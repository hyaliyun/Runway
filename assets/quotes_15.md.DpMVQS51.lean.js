Your task is to generate answer \\"yes\\" when the tweet has that particular sentiment, otherwise generate answer \\"no\\". Review: There are just so many things wrong with this movie.To begin with, the first twenty minutes of the film could have been compressed into just five or maybe ten. The overall movie is (mercifully) short already, but this could have been made up for by giving a little more attention to the Mean Lion (how did the miss a reference to \\"The Wiz\\" on that one?) and working his subplot a little more closely into the main plot. In short, the script had the seed of a good idea, but needed quite a bit of reworking.Second, it could have done without the crude humor. The original also had some that it could have done without, but at least there it was almost an afterthought -- here, flatulence and urination abound.Third, the show is a little too self-aware. The original series had that well enough, as did the first movie, but here it's just way, way too much. The Brendan Fraser in-jokes were just a bit over the top (and why no mention of the \\"new Ursula\\"?). Other gags with the Narrator, especially a couple of interactions near the end, also exceed good sense.Fourth, a bit more attention could have been given to the CGI work. In the first it was hard to tell that Shemp wasn't a real elephant (except by behavior, of course), but here the CGI stands out like a sore thumb. Ideally special effects should merely tell the story whether they're good or bad, and they at least do succeed on that count, so it's a relatively small problem, but it's still there.All that said, Christopher Showerman's performance as George is decent enough. It lacks Brendan Fraser's charm, but Christopher only really fails in that specific comparison -- he even managed to give George a bit of personal depth, which should have been a major foul in a Jay Ward-inspired movie but wasn't here. Julie Benz as the new Ursula surprised me as being even better than Leslie Mann in the original.Most other performances were pretty standard, not standing out in my mind as either good or bad.

With Iphigenia, Mikhali Cacoyannis is perhaps the first film director to have successfully brought the feel of ancient Greek theatre to the screen. His own screenplay, an adaptation of Euripides' tragedy, was far from easy, compared to that of the other two films of the trilogy he directed. The story has been very carefully deconstructed from Euripides' version and placed in a logical, strictly chronological framework, better conforming to the modern methods of cinematic story-telling. Cacoyannis also added some characters to his film that do not appear in Euripides' tragedy: Odysseus, Calchas, and the army. This was done in order to make some of Euripides' points regarding war, the Church, and Government clearer. Finally, Cacoyannis' Iphigenia ending is somewhat ambiguous when compared to Euripides'. The film was shot on location at Aulis. The director of photography, Giorgos Arvanitis, shows us a rugged but beautiful Greece, where since the Homeric days time seems to have stood still. He takes advantage of the bodies, the arid land, the ruins, the intense light and the darkness. The harshness of the landscape is particularly fitting to the souls of the characters. The camera uses the whole gamut of available shots, from the very long, reinforcing the vastness and desolation of the landscape, as well as the human scale involved, to the extreme close-ups, dissecting and probing deep into the soul of the tormented characters. In particular, the film's opening, with a bold, accelerating tracking shot along a line of beached boats, followed by an aerial view of the many thousands of soldiers lying listlessly on the beach, is a very effective means of communicating Agamemnon's awesome political and military responsibility. No word but \\"sublime\\" can describe the stunning performances of Costa Kazakos (Agamemnon), Irene Papas (Clytemnestra), and Tatiana Papamoschou (Iphigenia). Kazakos and Papas embody the sublimity of the classical Greece tragedy. Kazakos' character is extremely down-to-earth, and his powerful look into the camera, more than his words, reveals the unbelievable torment tearing his soul. Irene Papas is the modern quintessence of classic Greek plays. In Iphigenia, she is terrible in her anguish, and even more so for what we know will be her vengeance. Tatiana Papamoskou, in her first role on the screen, is outstanding in her portray of the innocent Iphigenia, which contrasts with Kazakos' austere depiction of her father, Agamemnon. Cacoyannis is faithful to Euripides in his representation of the other characters: Odysseus is a sly, scheming politician, Achilles, a vain, narcissistic warrior, Menalaus is self centered, obsessed with his honor, eager to be avenged, and to have his wife and property restored. The costumes and sets are realistic: no Hollywood there. Agamemnon's quarters resembles a barn, he dresses, as do the others, in utilitarian, hand-woven, simple garb. Clytemnestra's royal caravan is made up of rough-hewn wooden carts. The music is by the prolific contemporary music composer Mikis Theodorakis. Theodorakis' score intensifies the dramatic and cinematographic unfolding, reflects on the psychological aspect of the tragedy, and accentuates its dimensions and actuality. This film and the story it narrates offer considerable insight into the lost world of ancient Greek thought that was the crucible for so much of our modern civilization. It teaches us much about ourselves as individuals and as social and political creatures. Euripides questions the value of war and patriotism when measured against the simple virtues of family and love, and reflects on woman's vulnerable position in a world of manly violence. In his adaptation of Euripides' tragedy, Cacoyannis revisits all of these themes in a modern, clear, and dramatic fashion. The relationships governing the political machinations are clearly demonstrated: war corrupts and destroys the human soul to such an extent that neither the individual nor the group can function normally any longer. With the possible exception of Menelaus, whose honor has been tarnished by his own wife's elopement with her lover, everyone else has his own private motivation for going to war with Troy, which has nothing to do with Helen: the thirst for power (Agamemnon), greed (the army, Odysseus), or glory (Achilles). And so in a real sense, Helen became the WMD of the Trojan War. The war, stripped of all Homeric glamor and religious sanctioning, was just an imperialist venture, spurred primarily by the desire for material gain, all else being a convenient pretext. Another conflict raised in the film is that between the Church and the State. Calchas, who represents the Church, feeling the challenge to his priestly authority and wishing to destroy Agamemnon for the insult to the Goddess he serves, tells him to sacrifice his daughter. In consenting to the sacrifice, the King comes closer to his moral undoing, but in refusing, loses his power over the masses (his army), who are brainwashed by religion. Of course, for Agamemnon, it's a game. The King must go along with the charade whether he honestly believes in the Gods or not, until he realizes, too late, that he has ensnared himself into committing a despicable filicide. Is it a sacrifice or a murder, and how can we tell the difference between the two? By focusing on the violent and primitive horror of a human sacrifice--and, worst of all, the sacrifice of one's own child--Euripides/Cacoyannis creates a drama that is at once deeply political and agonizingly personal. It touches on a most complex and delicate ethical problem facing any society: the dire conflict between the needs of the individual versus those of the society. In the case of Iphigenia, however, as in the Biblical tale of Abraham and Isaac, the father is asked to kill his own child, by his own hand. What sort of God would insist on such payment? Can it be just or moral, even if divinely inspired? Finally, does the daughter's sacrificial death differ from the deaths of all the sons and daughters who are being sent to war?

A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

The full score had been lost soon after Purcell's death in 1695, and had only recently been found. Twenty-eight Morley students copied out the complete vocal and orchestral parts. There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time. A concert performance of the work was given at The Old Vic, preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams. The Times praised Holst and his forces for \\"a most interesting and artistic performance of this very important work\\".After this success, Holst was disappointed the following year by the lukewarm reception of his choral work The Cloud Messenger. He again went travelling, accepting an invitation from H. Balfour Gardiner to join him and the brothers Clifford and Arnold Bax in Spain. During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to astrology, an interest that later inspired his suite The Planets. Holst cast his friends' horoscopes for the rest of his life and referred to astrology as his \\"pet vice\\".In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School opened a new music wing, and Holst composed St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and his family moved to a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925.  Guess a valid title for it!

Write an article based on this summary: – Baltimore police officer William Porter will have to testify against five fellow officers in connection to the death of Freddie Gray, Maryland's court of appeals ruled Tuesday, in what the Baltimore Sun calls a \\"big victory for the state.\\" Gray was 25 when his spine was severed while he was in the back of a police van in April. According to USA Today, the jury in Porter's manslaughter trial was deadlocked in December, and trials for the other five officers involved were halted while the appeals court decided if Porter would have to testify against them. Now those trials are free to resume. The appeals court didn't explain its ruling, which reverses a lower court's ruling, stating it would release an opinion some time in the future, the AP reports. Porter had requested he not be forced to testify against his fellow officers. A defense lawyer says making him do so while his own case remains unresolved could violate his right to not self-incriminate. Porter's retrial is not scheduled until after the other five trials. The ruling could be especially bad news for Officer Caesar Goodson, who was driving the van at the time of Gray's death and faces a second-degree murder charge. During his initial trial, Porter testified that Gray wasn't wearing a seatbelt in the van, and that it was Goodson's responsibility to make sure he was. He also testified that Gray requested to go to the hospital, but Goodson declined, instead picking up another prisoner and driving to the station. Porter was in the van for most of the ride, which prosecutors claim officers made intentionally rough for the unrestrained Gray. Article:","output":"Once upon a time, in a city called Baltimore, there was a man named Freddie Gray. Freddie was 25 years old. One day in April, while Freddie was in the back of a police van, he got very hurt. His spine was damaged and it was very serious. There were six police officers responsible for taking care of Freddie while he was in the van. One of them was William Porter. All the officers got in trouble because they didn't take good care of Freddie. The people in charge tried to figure out what happened to Freddie, so they went to court. The court is a place where people go to when they have a disagreement or when something is wrong. In December, they had a trial for officer William Porter. A trial is when a group of people called a jury listens and decides if someone did something wrong. But the jury couldn't decide what to do with officer William Porter, so they tried again. Meanwhile, the other five officers also had to go to court because of what happened to Freddie Gray. But to help them decide what happened, they wanted officer William Porter to tell the story as well. William Porter didn't want to do it because he was also being investigated. Recently, a group of people called the \\"court of appeals\\" decided that officer William Porter must tell the story in the other five officers' trials. This will allow the jury to have a better understanding of what went on and make a decision. One of the other officers, named Caesar Goodson, might be really worried now. Officer Goodson was driving the van when Freddie Gray got hurt. Officer Porter told the story that Freddie Gray asked to go to the hospital, but Officer Goodson denied the request. This could mean that he did something wrong. So, now everyone is waiting for the trials of the five officers, where they'll learn more about what happened to Freddie Gray from officer William Porter as well."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A Denver, Colorado dispatcher has been fired after failing to relay key information to officers responding to a call from a woman who was killed 12 minutes into a 911 call. Police say the dispatcher didn't tell officers that the woman's husband was getting a gun from a safe. Kristine Kirk, a mother of three, was allegedly shot dead by her husband Richard while she was on the phone to 911 in April. Scroll down for video. Mother of three: Kristine Kirk was shot dead while she was on the phone to a 911 dispatcher who police say did not update them when Kirk's situation escalated. Public safety department spokeswoman Daelene Mix said Monday the dispatcher was fired Friday. The person was not identified. Police have said Kirk pleaded in the April 14 call for authorities to hurry and send officers because her husband had asked her to get a gun and shoot him. Kirk said Richard Kirk was hallucinating, after having marijuana-infused candy and possibly pain pills. When police finally arrived, officers discovered Kristine Kirk on a floor inside the home with a bullet wound to the head. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Avoidable: The dispatcher has now been fired from his or her position after police failed to initiate an emergency response to Kristine Kirk's phone call because they were unaware her husband had a gun. Drugs: Kristine Kirk told the dispatcher that her husband had eaten marijuana candy and was hallucinating. Family tragedy: The couple's three children are believed to have been home at the time their mother was shot. According to the probable cause statement, he admitted to police that he shot his wife at their home. Jackson would not say whether a gun or drugs were recovered from the home. The couple's children may have witnessed the crime. Police were seen escorting a little boy to a patrol car outside the home. In a May press conference, police said that while the dispatcher was documenting what Kris Kirk was telling her and entering the information into a computer, he or she was not providing verbal updates to officers but forwarding notes to officers' laptops. The dispatcher didn't provide police with a verbal update for 13 minutes. According to NBC 9 News, the community has criticized the 12 to 13 minutes response time it took officers to arrive at the Kirks' home. Charged: Richard Kirk has been charged with his wife's murder. However, the Denver Department of Public Safety found no wrongdoing on the part of responding officers. In a reports, the department wrote, 'the response of the patrol officers was found to be reasonable and appropriate, given the limited information that was aired by dispatch.' If the information had been relayed from the dispatcher to police verbally, an emergency response would have been prompted, but at the time, officers believed they were responding to a routine domestic call. Forty-seven year-old Richard Kirk has been charged with first-degree murder. He has not yet entered a plea. He had no prior criminal record.

The order in which the material is presented is perhaps the greatest strength of this text.

One weakness was that there was little in the way of applications.

Mickey is a New York City blue-collared taxi driver, unhappy over an act of infidelity committed by Heather (Cameron Diaz), his ex-fiancÃ©e. Francis is a white-collared Wall Street stock investor, who unknown to his wife, Renee (Jennifer Aniston), is having an affair.

Their mother is never seen on screen, while they have better time interacting with their father, Frank (John Mahoney), who always gives Mickey and Francis advice to live out their lives any way they can and to always go for what drives them to succeed. While driving his cab one day, Mickey picks up Hope (Maxine Bahns), an NYU art student with whom he becomes infatuated and impulsively marries after a few days. This causes consternation for his brother, largely because he was not asked to be best man at the wedding. Mickey moves in with Hope, but later becomes disillusioned with aspects of their lifestyle, including frequent power cuts in their ramshackle apartment.

The paragraph seems to express concerns about introducing a new bill late in the parliamentary process, given the timelines involved in passing previous legislation and the necessary stages for a bill to be enacted. However, there is no explicit mention of Bill C-42 having been passed. First, the paragraph calls attention to the introduction of an unspecified bill, presumably coming late within the current parliamentary session. The argument being presented is that it is disrespectful or unproductive to introduce this bill at this stage. Subsequently, the writer refers to \\"the timetable in terms of the previous tobacco legislation, Bill C-71,\\" indicating that the considerations surrounding the introduction of this new legislation may have something to do with time taken in passing Bill C-71. However, the paragraph does not state if Bill C-71 has been passed or is still under consideration. Then, the paragraph addresses \\"the time it takes for this parliament to pass Bill C-42.\\" From this statement, we can infer that Bill C-42 is not yet passed, as the writer specifically talks about the time it will take to pass it. It is reasonable to assume that if the bill had already been passed, the author would have referred to the time it took rather than the future-oriented \\"the time it takes.\\" In conclusion, based on the information provided in the paragraph, we cannot confirm that Bill C-42 has already been passed. The paragraph raises concerns about the introduction of an unspecified bill late in the parliamentary process, but it does not provide enough details to confirm the current status of Bill C-42."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

From the moment I entered Trattoria del Parco, I was embraced by a warm and welcoming ambiance, accentuated by the melodious tunes of Italian classics playing softly in the background. The restaurant boasts an exquisite rustic decor, showcasing the beauty of traditional Italian design while providing a cozy and enchanting atmosphere. The attentive staff greeted my party with genuine cordiality, escorting us to our table in a well-lit corner beside an impressive view of their enchanting garden. The menu, elegantly bound in leather, presented an array of mouth-watering choices that piqued my interest and spurred my taste buds into anticipation. My server, Federico, was the epitome of professionalism and grace. His extensive knowledge and passion for Italian cuisine shone through as he skillfully presented the day's specials and offered thoughtful pairings of wine from their vast collection. After considerable deliberation, I opted for Antipasto misto, a delightful selection of marinated vegetables, cured meats, and cheeses, followed by Risotto ai Funghi Porcini, a creamy porcini mushroom risotto. While waiting for our appetizers, I couldn't help but notice the other diners around me were equally entranced by their meals, a further testament to the allure of Trattoria del Parco. As the Antipasto misto arrived at our table, my senses were greeted by an artful arrangement of vibrant colors, rich aromas, and enticing textures on the plate. Each component of the antipasto showcased the chef's finesse, and the harmonious blend of flavors was nothing short of magical. The moment I took the first forkful of my Risotto ai Funghi Porcini, I was transported straight to the Italian countryside. The tender risotto, expertly cooked to heavenly perfection, mingled gracefully with the earthy flavors of the porcini mushrooms and the nutty undertones of the Parmigiano-Reggiano. It was a true symphony of sensations that simply enveloped my palate in a loving embrace. And of course, the entire meal was enhanced by the mellow, velvety notes of the recommended Chianti Classico - an exemplary pairing, indeed! After relishing every last mouthful of my main entrée, I decided to indulge in their Tiramisu for dessert. The traditional Italian staple, light yet exquisitely rich, concluded my meal on a euphoric note. The mingling of caffeinated hints and the velvety mascarpone, all atop layers of soft, sumptuous ladyfingers, served as the perfect culminating act for an unforgettable dining journey. Needless to say, my experience at Trattoria del Parco far exceeded my expectations. The immaculate service, the captivating ambiance, and, above all, the culinary prowess of the talented chefs behind the scenes make this restaurant a true gem and a must-visit location for anyone seeking an authentic Italian gastronomic adventure.

Today we are going to learn a super simple and fun thing to do - removing shoe laces! You might be wondering why we would ever want to remove the laces from our shoes, right? Well, sometimes our shoe laces get old and dirty, or we just want to change the color of them to make our shoes look cool and stylish! Step 1: Find a Pair of Shoes with Laces First, go find your favorite pair of shoes that have laces. They can be your sports shoes or even your everyday shoes. Make sure you ask your mommy or daddy if it's okay to remove the laces from them. Step 2: Untie the Knots Before we can take the laces out, we need to untie the knots. Look at the top of your shoes where the laces make a bow. You can tug on the loose ends of the laces gently to make the loops smaller. Once the loops are gone, you are left with two strings. Step 3: Pull the Laces Through the Holes Now comes the fun part! Start at the top of the shoe near the knot, and slowly pull the laces away from the holes they are going through. They will look like little loops sticking out of the holes. You can use your fingers to help gently push the laces out. Continue doing this all the way down to the bottom of the shoe, where the laces first entered the shoe.  Step 4: Set the Laces Aside Once you've removed the laces from your shoes, set them aside so you don't lose them. If your laces are dirty, you can ask your parents to help you wash them. If you're replacing the laces with new ones, make sure you keep the old ones in case you ever want to use them again. That's it! You've successfully removed the laces from your shoes. Good job! Now you can learn how to put new laces in your shoes and show off your cool skills to your friends and family."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is while visiting Peter's apartment that Charley sees four coffins being taken into a car. On the way out from Peter's apartment, Charley sees four strange people walk past him, into an elevator. Charley instantly becomes smitten with one of the four, the alluring Regine (Julie Carmen). Charley drives Alex back to her dorm room and begins to make out with her, only to pull away and see Regine staring back at him. A ticked-off Alex storms off, not realizing that something is following her. Another girl leaves the dorm as Alex enters, and she is followed and killed by one of Regine's henchmen, Belle. Alex, meanwhile, is unaware that Louie, another of Regine's posse, is scaling up the wall outside her window, but he is startled and falls when Alex inadvertently slams her window shut on his hands. Bozworth ( Brian Thompson), the third heavy, makes fun of Louie before consuming some bugs.Meanwhile, later that night Charley dreams that Regine comes to visit him, only for her to turn into a vampire and bite him.

Joseph and Mary lived with their son Joseph, Jr. and his family in a small house while theirs was being built. Mary Priestley was primarily responsible for the design of the couple's new home and her family inheritance may have helped finance it, but she died before it was completed. By 1797, Joseph's laboratory was completed—the first part of the home to be finished. It was the first laboratory that \\"he had designed, built, and outfitted entirely himself\\" and was probably the first \\"scientifically-equipped laboratory\\" in the United States. Joseph continued his scientific and scholarly work in his new laboratory, identifying carbon monoxide (which he called \\"heavy inflammable air\\"). In 1798 Joseph Jr., his wife, and their children moved into the new house with Joseph Priestley. The house also held Priestley's library, which contained about 1600 volumes by his death in 1804 and was one of the largest in America at the time. The Priestley family held Unitarian church services in the drawing room and Joseph educated a group of young men until the local Northumberland Academy that he helped found was completed.The house proper was completed in 1798, with a Mr. Jones of Northumberland employed acting as master carpenter. Built in an 18th-century Georgian style, the \\"balance and symmetry\\" of the architecture signaled \\"subdued elegance\\".

Step 4: List potential negative effects of not getting enough sleep. Possible negative effects include impaired cognitive function, difficulty concentrating, mood swings, weakened immune system, and a higher risk of accidents.

Answer: In Terminologia Anatomica the large intestine includes the cecum, colon, rectum, and anal canal. Question: what is another name for the large intestine Answer:","output":"Another name for the large intestine is the \\"large bowel.\\" The large intestine, or large bowel, is a significant anatomical component of the digestive system. Its primary function is to absorb water and electrolytes from the remaining indigestible food matter, as well as to synthesize and absorb certain types of vitamins, primarily vitamin K and some of the B group vitamins. The large intestine also plays a critical role in the formation and elimination of feces from the body. The large intestine comprises various regions that altogether form a continuous structure which begins at the ileocecal valve (connecting the small intestine to the large intestine) and ends at the anus. As mentioned in the question, these regions include the cecum, colon, rectum, and anal canal. 1. Cecum: This is a pouch-like structure at the beginning of the large intestine. The cecum receives the undigested food material (chyme) from the small intestine via the ileocecal valve. The appendix, a small, worm-like structure that has a minor role in the immune system, is attached to the cecum. 2. Colon: This is the longest part of the large intestine and is divided into four segments:    a. Ascending colon: It extends upward from the cecum, positioned on the right side of the abdomen.    b. Transverse colon: This segment runs horizontally across the abdomen from the right side to the left side.    c. Descending colon: This part of the colon moves downward on the left side of the abdomen.    d. Sigmoid colon: The sigmoid colon is the final segment of the colon, which has an S-shaped structure and connects to the rectum. 3. Rectum: This is a muscular chamber that holds the feces before elimination. The rectum connects the sigmoid colon to the anal canal. 4. Anal canal: The anal canal is the final part of the large intestine, responsible for expelling the feces from the body. It is surrounded by the internal and external anal sphincters, which help maintain continence and control bowel movements. In summary, the large intestine, also known as the large bowel, encompasses the cecum, colon, rectum, and anal canal. These structures enable the absorption of water, electrolytes, and certain vitamins and play a critical role in the formation and elimination of feces."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who spread a false rumour that Reema was a whore Movie title: Zinda Movie plot: The film is about a rich, successful business man named Balajeet \\"Bala\\" Roy (Sanjay Dutt), who lives a blissful life with his beautiful wife, Nisha Roy (Celina Jaitley). Nisha is expecting their first child together. Bala is suddenly captured for an unknown reason and kept alive in a cell without knowing who his captives are and the reason behind it. While in captivity, he practices martial arts which he learns from watching T.V., with the intention of using it against the people who captured him. When he is released, 14 years later, he sets out for revenge. As the film moves on, he is helped by a taxi driver Jenny (Lara Dutta) to track his kidnapper. Bala tracks down the restaurant that had served his food, during his entire captivity and follows a delivery moped to his captors. Discovering he was held in a private prison where people can pay to have others incarcerated, Bala tortures the owner Wong Foo (Rajendranath Zutshi) for answers by plucking out his teeth with a clawhammer; he then finds out he was imprisoned for \\"talking too much\\", and fights his way out of the building. Injured Bala is helped out by a hooded man who takes him to a taxi. The hooded man turns out to be Rohit Chopra (John Abraham). Soon Wong Foo kidnaps Jenny and tortures her. He threatens Bala to remove his teeth with his clawhammer by himself, but is interrupted by Rohit. Bala grows intimate with Jenny and has sex with her. Bala is informed that her daughter is alive. During tracking, he encounters his kidnapper which is none other than Rohit. In his flashback, Rohit reveals his reason of kidnapping Bala that during their childhood, Bala's lustful eyes falls on Rohit's elder sister Reema Chopra. After she slaps Bala for gifting a panty, Bala spreads a false rumour that his sister is a whore. And he fools little Rohit by sticking a message on his back. She becomes a laughing stock for all school. She commits suicide by burning herself. This left Rohit broken and deciding to seek revenge. Back to the present it is also revealed that...

As for deciding whether it's worth investing in this film proposal, there are several factors to consider. Here are a few points you may want to think about: 1. Market research: Research the target audience for this film, and try to determine whether there is a demand for movies in this genre and with this storyline. Does this movie cater to the interests of a specific demographic or is it trying to appeal to a more general audience? 2. Budget and financing: Look at the estimated budget for the film proposal and compare it to similar films that have been made in the past. Is the budget reasonable, or is it excessive? Consider the potential return on investment based on comparable films and their box office performances. 3. Cast and crew: Evaluate the proposed cast and crew associated with this film. Are the actors well-known or trending in the industry, or would lesser-known talent suffice? Regarding the crew, has the director or cinematographer had success with similar projects? 4. Distribution and marketing strategy: Consider the distribution and marketing plans for the film. Is there a clear plan to market and monetize the film after production? Who are the potential distribution partners, and do they have a track record of success? 5. Competition: Analyze the competitive landscape for the film's genre and release time frame. Will this film have strong competition with similar movies released around the same time, or is there a comparatively open window which may give it an advantage? 6. Story and emotional impact: Lastly, evaluate your own gut feelings about the film's story and its potential emotional impact on audiences. Does the story resonate with you, and do you think it would evoke strong emotions in viewers? By considering these factors, you can make an informed decision about whether or not it's worth investing in this film proposal.

The best skillets for cooking a steak on the stove are cast iron skillets, which get very hot, distribute the heat evenly, and create an even crust on the meat. If you don't have a cast iron skillet, use the skillet or pan with the thickest bottom that you have. Olive oil has a low smoke point, and will smoke very quickly and taste somewhat bitter. You want an oil that will get hotter without smoking too much. Grapeseed, gram, or canola are all ideal. Some people like to add a little butter to the skillet as well, for an added nutty flavor. You can add it at the beginning, or wait until you flip the steak. Don't crowd the skillet with too many steaks, or the temperature will lower in the pan and the steaks will cook unevenly. Steaks don't take long to cook, so take your time and do them one at a time.  When the skillet it hot, lay in the seasoned steak, dropping it into the skillet away from you to avoid splatter. If the skillet isn't hot and the meat doesn't sizzle, take the meat out and wait. Putting a piece of steak into a cold pan will make a tough steak. Put the meat in the skillet and leave it alone for about five minutes. Let it caramelize on that side. You don't need to prod at it, check on it, or do anything. Just let the meat cook.  Don't push on the steak or press it into the skillet. There's no need to do this. Cook thinner steaks for no more than four minutes and thicker steaks for up to six, depending on how done you like your steak. Flip the steak to the other side when it's ready. If you have them, tongs are great for cooking a steak, because you don't have to pierce the meat. Forks are also fine, though some people prefer not to pierce the meat before slicing it. It's not a huge deal, either way, and some people swear by either method. If you like a steak on the rare side, it should be done with a few minutes on each side, and 10-15 minutes of resting while covered. But if your steaks are very thick, or you like them a little more done, the best way to cook them is by finishing them in the oven. Spoon extra butter over the steak and plate in the center of the oven at 275 degrees F. Finish it for 5-10 minutes, until the temperature shows where you want it on the thermometer, or it feels the firmness you're looking for.","output":"A well-seasoned cast iron skillet ensures even heat distribution for perfectly cooked steak, using high smoke point oils like grapeseed, gram, or canola, while avoiding overcrowding the pan and allowing the steak to caramelize before flipping, with thick steaks potentially finished in the oven."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To many property developers and local government officials, housing price in China is still low compared with many developed countries. However, the average housing price in the United States is only 8, 000 yuan per square metre, while in China, it is even higher than that in the United States. \\"This shows that there are some bubbles  in Chinese real estate  market,\\" the International Finance News reported. Although the average price of residential houses in the United States, after changed to RMB, is about 8, 000 yuan per square metre, the houses in the US are not sold in terms of building area, as most Chinese property developers do when they sell their houses. If the US property developers sell their houses according to the building area, then the housing price will be even lower than 8, 000 yuan per square metre. In most big Chinese cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, houses are sold at a price even higher than those in the US. The high housing price in large cities in China proves that Chinese real estate market does have some bubbles. Moreover, Chinese houses cannot be compared with houses in the US in terms of building quality, environment and supporting facilities.

Early reports mentioned finds of brooches, an iron sword and Danish coins, and the enduring Norse place names indicate a sustained Viking presence on Hirta, but the visible evidence has been lost. In the late 14th century John of Fordun referred to it as 'the isle of Irte (insula de Irte), which is agreed to be under the Circius and on the margins of the world'. The islands were historically part of the domain of the MacLeods of Harris, whose steward was responsible for the collection of rents in kind and other duties. The first detailed report of a visit to the islands dates from 1549, when Donald Munro suggested that:  \\"The inhabitants thereof ar simple poor people, scarce learnit in aney religion, but M’Cloyd of Herray, his stewart, or he quhom he deputs in sic office, sailes anes in the zear ther at midsummer, with some chaplaine to baptize bairnes ther.\\"Despite the chaplain's best efforts, the islanders' isolation and dependence on the bounty of the natural world meant their philosophy bore as much relationship to Druidism as it did to Christianity until the arrival of Rev.

Joe's  farm has a depleted soil, while Gary started agroforestry a few years back, and grows cover crops.  But I can use this background: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth:  What is an answer for this question: Which farmer increased infiltration to prevent erosion? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information, Gary, the farmer who started agroforestry and grows cover crops, has successfully increased infiltration to prevent erosion. Gary's adoption of agroforestry practices has led to numerous benefits, including an enhanced soil structure, reduced soil erosion, and improved water quality. The integration of trees and shrubs in his farming system has provided multiple ecological functions, such as enhancing nutrient cycling, retaining soil moisture, and providing habitat for beneficial insects and birds. As a result, Gary's farm is better equipped to handle extreme weather events and the negative impacts of climate change. Cover crops, such as grasses, legumes, and other species, have further contributed to the resilience and productivity of Gary's farm. By growing these crops in between the primary cash crops or during fallow periods, the soil gets covered, providing protection against erosion. Cover crops not only help in stabilizing the soil, but they also contribute to improving its fertility by adding organic matter, fixing atmospheric nitrogen, and assisting in nutrient cycling. In comparison, Joe's farm has depleted soil, which makes it more susceptible to erosion and nutrient loss. The lack of groundcover plants on Joe's farm means that the soil is not protected, leading to increased soil surface runoff and nutrient leaching. This not only negatively impacts the productivity of Joe's farm but also contributes to degraded water quality in nearby streams. To sum up, Gary's implementation of agroforestry practices and the use of cover crops has effectively increased infiltration and reduced soil erosion on his farm.

There are differences in the numbers of congregations, bishops, and mailing list subscribers mentioned. In the first sentence: - It reports a mailing list of 50,000: This suggests that there are 50,000 subscribers to the group's mailing list, implying a potentially larger community of supporters or interested parties. - Support from about 500 congregations: This means around 500 churches or religious communities actively support the group and may participate in its initiatives. - 50 bishops: This refers to a group of 50 religious leaders who endorse and possibly participate in the programs offered or advocated by this group. In the second sentence: - The support of about 215 churches: In contrast to the first example, this group has support from approximately 215 churches or religious communities. This number is less than half of the mentioned 500 congregations in the first sentence. - An estimated 25 bishops: The number of religious leaders supporting the group here is half that of the first sentence.

The race was run over 52 laps of the Silverstone Grand Prix circuit, and was won by British driver Jim Clark in a Lotus 25.

The context states that the 15th BRDC International Trophy race was run over 52 laps of the Silverstone Grand Prix circuit. If we break down the number 52 into two equal parts, we can say it consists of 26 laps and another 26 laps. That is, the total number of laps (52) is the summation of 26 laps and another 26 laps. It's important to note that this reduced form doesn't alter the fundamental fact provided in the context, which is that Jim Clark completed 52 laps in total to win the race at the Silverstone Circuit in a Lotus 25. By splitting the total number of laps into two parts, the hypothesis is emphasizing that the total was achieved in two halves, even though the race wasn't necessarily split this way and all the laps were likely completed consecutively. The context doesn't specifically say that the race was run in two halves or segments, but mathematically speaking, 52 laps do split evenly into two sets of 26 laps. In summary, the hypothesis that the race was composed of 26 + 26 laps is a mathematically accurate and valid interpretation of the context provided."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pick from: a. no b. yes The answer is:","output":"a. no The answer is \\"a. no\\" because these two questions are not the same; they are addressing different topics and seeking different types of information. The first question, \\"How can the chemical formula for potassium hydrogen phosphate be balanced?\\" is focusing on the balancing of a specific chemical formula for a compound known as potassium hydrogen phosphate. Potassium hydrogen phosphate, also known as dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, is a chemical compound with the formula K2HPO4. Balancing a chemical formula usually refers to adjusting the coefficients in the formula to ensure that the number of atoms of each element remains the same on both sides of a chemical equation. However, as K2HPO4 is a stand-alone chemical formula and not a chemical equation, there seems to be confusion in the question itself. The second question, \\"What is the chemical formula of air?\\" is asking for the composition of air in terms of its chemical components. Air is a mixture of various gases, primarily composed of nitrogen (N2) at around 78%, oxygen (O2) at about 21%, and small amounts of other gases such as argon (Ar), carbon dioxide (CO2), and traces of other elements. As air is not a single compound with a chemical formula, it is not directly comparable with the first question. While the first question deals with a specific compound and its formula, the second question pertains to the composition of a mixture of gases.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Gyorgy Sandor Ligeti (; Hungarian: Ligeti Gyorgy Sandor, pronounced ['ligeti 'jorj 'Sa:ndor]; 28 May 1923 - 12 June 2006) was a Hungarian-Austrian composer of contemporary classical music. He has been described as \\"one of the most important avant-garde composers in the latter half of the twentieth century\\" and \\"one of the most innovative and influential among progressive figures of his time\\". Born in Transylvania, Romania, he lived in Hungary before emigrating to Austria in 1956, and became an Austrian citizen in 1968. In 1973 he became professor of composition at the Hamburg Hochschule fur Musik und Theater until he retired in 1989. Ligeti was born in 1923 at Dicsoszentmarton (which was renamed Tarnaveni in 1941), in the Romanian region of Transylvania to Dr. Sandor Ligeti and Dr. Ilona Somogyi. His family was Hungarian Jewish. He was the grandnephew of the violinist Leopold Auer and cousin of Hungarian philosopher Agnes Heller.  Ligeti recalled that his first exposure to languages other than Hungarian came one day while listening to a conversation among the Romanian-speaking town police. Before that he had not known that other languages existed. He moved to Cluj with his family when he was six years old. He was not to return to the town of his birth until the 1990s. In 1940, Northern Transylvania was annexed by Hungary following the Second Vienna Award and Cluj became part of Hungary.  In 1941 Ligeti received his initial musical training at the conservatory in Cluj, and during the summers privately with Pal Kadosa in Budapest. In 1944, Ligeti's education was interrupted when he was sent to a forced labor brigade by the Horthy regime. His brother, age 16, was deported to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp and both of his parents were sent to Auschwitz. His mother was the only other survivor of his immediate family.  Following World War II, Ligeti returned to his studies in Budapest, Hungary, graduating in 1949 from the Franz Liszt Academy of Music. He studied under Pal Kadosa, Ferenc Farkas, Zoltan Kodaly and Sandor Veress. He went on to do ethnomusicological research into the Hungarian folk music of Transylvania. However, after a year he returned to Franz Liszt Academy in Budapest, this time as a teacher of harmony, counterpoint and musical analysis, a position he secured with the help of Kodaly and held between 1950 and 1956. As a young teacher, Ligeti took the unusual step of regularly attending the lectures of an older colleague, the conductor and musicologist Lajos Bardos, a conservative Christian whose circle represented for Ligeti a safe haven, and whose help and advice he later acknowledged in the prefaces to his own two harmony textbooks (1954 and 1956). However, communications between Hungary and the West by then had become difficult due to the restrictions of the communist government, and Ligeti and other artists were effectively cut off from recent developments outside the Eastern Bloc. What school he attended?","output":"Ligeti attended the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest, Hungary, where he graduated in 1949."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Although their review contains both positive and negative aspects, the overall outlook appears more inclined toward the positive side. The critic mentions \\"an admirable rigor\\" in regards to the main character, Jimmy's relentless anger. This suggests that the critic appreciates the intensity and dedication portrayed by the character in the movie, indicating that they find this aspect of the film commendable and well-executed. The level of authenticity and realism in this regard is seen as an achievement or an added value to the movie. Furthermore, the script's refusal of a happy ending also holds seemingly positive connotations in the critic's evaluation. This implies that the critic is appreciative of the unconventional, non-formulaic, and perhaps more realistic approach taken by the filmmakers. By challenging common narrative tropes and not succumbing to the predictable happy ending, the movie shows a level of maturity and complexity that the critic seems to respect. However, it's important to highlight that the review does make mention of \\"relentless anger\\" and the lack of a \\"happy ending.\\" These aspects could be perceived as negative by some viewers, as they might not align with their preferences or expectations when watching a movie. Nevertheless, every individual has a unique taste, and for this particular critic, these attributes contribute positively to the overall film experience. In conclusion, the critic's assessment of the movie appears to be more positive than negative. They appreciate the rigorous portrayal of anger and the script's refusal to follow a typical happy ending, which signifies a refreshing and compelling departure from traditional storytelling. While there are aspects that could be viewed as negative by some audiences, the critic's perspective, in this case, leans toward a positive evaluation."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

I'm here to talk to you about the importance of praise, admiration and \\"thank you\\"s, and making them specific and genuine. The way I got interested in this was, I noticed that when I was growing up, and until about a few years ago, I would want to say thank you to someone. I would want to praise them. I would want to take in their praise of me and then I'd just stop myself. I asked myself: why? I felt shy. I felt embarrassed. And then my question became: am I the only one who does this? So I decided to study that question. I'm fortunate enough to work in a rehab facility, so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction. Sometimes it comes down to something as simple as their core wound is how their father died without ever saying he's proud of them. But then, they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud, but he never told the son. It's because he didn't know that his son needed to hear it. I used to take my bike into the bike store and they'd do something called \\"truing \\" the wheels. The guy said: \\"You know, when you true the wheels, it's going to make the bike so much better.\\" I get the same bike back, and they'd have taken all the little warps out of those same wheels I've had for two and a half years, and my bike would feel like new. So, I'm going to challenge all of you. I want you to true your wheels: be honest about the praise that you need to hear. What do you need to hear? Go home to your wife and ask her: \\"What do you need?\\" Go home to your husband and ask him what he needs. Go home and ask those questions and then help the people around you. It's simple. But why should we care about this? We talk about world peace. How can we have world peace with different cultures, different languages? I think it starts in each of our households.

Which species would be more successful in reproduction, Species A or species B?  John is a biologist. Last summer, he was studying the evolution of two different salamander species, species A and species B. Species A salamander was Gold-striped salamander while species B salamander was fire salamander. He found it interesting that they took different approaches to adapt to different habitats.  Hint: Consider the antlers of the Irish elk, (often supposed to be far too large; in deer antler size has an allometric relationship to body size). Obviously, antlers serve positively for defence against predators, and to score victories in the annual rut. But they are costly in terms of resource. Their size during the last glacial period presumably depended on the relative gain and loss of reproductive capacity in the population of elks during that time. As another example, camouflage to avoid detection is destroyed when vivid coloration is displayed at mating time. Here the risk to life is counterbalanced by the necessity for reproduction.Stream-dwelling salamanders, such as Caucasian salamander or Gold-striped salamander have very slender, long bodies, perfectly adapted to life at the banks of fast small rivers and mountain brooks. Elongated body protects their larvae from being washed out by current. However, elongated body increases risk of desiccation and decreases dispersal ability of the salamanders; it also negatively affects their fecundity. As a result, fire salamander, less perfectly adapted to the mountain brook habitats, is in general more successful, have a higher fecundity and broader geographic range. A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, species B (fire salamander) would be more successful in reproduction compared to species A (Gold-striped salamander).

Answer the above question based on the context below:  After John Dortmunder is released from his latest stint in prison, he is approached by his brother-in-law, Andy Kelp, about another job. Dr. Amusa seeks a valuable gem in the Brooklyn Museum that is of great significance to his people in his country in Africa, stolen during colonial times and then re-stolen by various African nations. Dortmunder and Kelp are joined by driver Stan Murch and explosives expert Allan Greenberg, concocting an elaborate plan to steal the gem. Although the scheme (and each subsequent one) is carefully planned—and keeps increasing in cost—something always goes awry, and the quartet has to steal the diamond again and again. First off, the diamond is swallowed by Greenberg when he alone gets caught by the museum guards during the initial heist. Dortmunder, Kelp, and Murch, at the urging of Greenberg's rotund father Abe, a lawyer, help Greenberg escape from state prison, but they then find he does not have the diamond. After Greenberg tells his partners he hid the rock in the police station (after bodily evacuating it), the quartet break into the precinct jail by helicopter, but the rock is not where Greenberg hid it. Greenberg discloses that his father Abe was the only other person who knew where it was.

The original sentence provides specific details about the following elements: 1. A Chinese man is carrying a load. 2. He is wearing a traditional Chinese rice hat. 3. The load is balanced across his shoulder. 4. He is using a long stick to carry the load. It is important to note that the original sentence does not provide any information about the man's purpose, the contents of the load he's carrying, or whom he is carrying it for. Therefore, while it is possible that the Chinese man might be carrying fish for his family, we cannot verify this based on the given information. To better understand if the second statement is true or not, we would need additional information, such as a description of the load's contents and the man's intentions. For example, if the original sentence mentioned that the man was carrying a bucket of fish on each side of the stick or stated that he was gathering food for his family, we could accurately assess the truthfulness of the second statement. However, given the information provided, we can only conclude that the original sentence does not have enough details to confirm if the second statement is true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hint: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common.

Article: After studying the daily habits of 177 self-made millionaires over the course of five years, Thomas C. Corley found that they avoid one costly habit: procrastination  . \\"It prevents even the most talented individuals from realizing success in life,\\" he writes in his upcoming book, \\"Change Your Habits, Change Your Life.\\" This goes hand-in-hand with author Napoleon Hill's claim that the wealthiest people are also the most decisive people. Out of the 500 millionaires Hill studied in the early 20thcentury, \\"Every one of them had the habit of reaching decisions quickly,\\" Hill wrote in his 1937 classic, \\"Think and Grow Rich.\\" One of the major causes of procrastination is lack of passion, Corley emphasizes: \\"We simply like to do the things we like to do and we put off the things we do not like to do.\\" \\"According to Gallup, only 13% of employees are 'engaged' in their jobs, or emotionally invested in their work,\\" Corley writes. \\"Whether you realize it or not, procrastination is a big reason why you are struggling financially in life. It damages your credibility with employers and fellow colleagues at work. It also affects the quality of your work and this affects the business you or your employer receive from customers, clients, and business relationships.\\" The good news is that anyone can overcome procrastination -- and it's simpler than you may think. He also notes that \\"the voice of procrastination screams just as loud and clear in the minds of those who _ in life as it does in the minds of those who do not.\\" How do they silence it? They rely on \\"to-do\\" lists to get things done. They create firm deadlines, and they meet with \\"accountability partners\\" to ensure they're sticking to their goals and deadlines, Corley says. Nearly everyone is susceptible to procrastination -- but fighting against it can make all the difference. Question: According to the passage, millionaires  _  .

A:","output":"Based on the customer's review, it is clear that they are extremely dissatisfied with the product. There are several factors that contribute to this dissatisfaction, which I will elaborate on below. 1. Product failure: The customer has experienced two product failures in a span of five years. The first occurred after only three years of usage, which the customer had to pay for the repair since it was not under warranty. The second failure happened just two years after the repair, and this time, there were no parts available for repairing it. This indicates that the product did not meet the customer's expectations in terms of quality and reliability. 2. Repair cost: The customer had to spend 350 on repairing the TV after it failed the first time. This is a significant amount of money, particularly for a product that is expected to last for a longer period. This added cost undoubtedly contributes to the customer's dissatisfaction. 3. Lack of available parts: The fact that no parts were available for the second repair indicates that the support for the product is limited or has been discontinued. This can make the customer feel that they have been left with a useless product that cannot be fixed, further fueling their frustration. 4. Loss of trust in the brand: The overall experience with this Sony product has left the customer feeling that they cannot trust Sony as a brand. As a result, the customer is adamant about not purchasing any more products from Sony. Their use of capital letters and repetition of the statement \\"I WILL NOT PURCHASE ANOTHER SONY ANYTHING!\\" clearly conveys their strong negative emotions towards the brand. 5. Expression of anger: The customer explicitly asks if Sony is \\"pickin' up on the anger\\" in their review. This indicates that the customer wants the company to be aware of their dissatisfaction and take it into account. The anger is directed towards the brand rather than the product itself, which signifies a deeper disappointment in the company as a whole. In summary, the customer's review demonstrates that they are deeply dissatisfied with the product and the overall experience with the Sony brand. Factors such as product failures, repair costs, lack of available parts, loss of trust in the brand, and the expression of anger all contribute to their negative stance towards Sony."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: During mid-summer (July in the northern hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.There are local names for winds associated with sand and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust during the winter into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere for days at a time across the Persian Gulf states.  Now, I have a new situation: Jennifer is looking to move to a new city. She has always wanted to live in a coastal town, and she has narrowed her options down to two. She is looking to live in either Malarn or Trainlan. Malarn is known for its peppersteaks and its active nightlife. Malarn also regularly gets a large amount of dust in the air from a desert located across the ocean. Trainlan has a very famous art museum in its city, and being an art fanatic, that greatly appeals to Jennifer. She is planning to take a trip to both cities sometime in the near future to see them in person before making her decision.  Answer this question please: Which city is worse for Jennifer's health? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Malarn is likely worse for Jennifer's health due to the large amount of dust in the air from the nearby desert. The presence of dust from the desert can negatively impact air quality by increasing the count of airborne particulates, which could potentially lead to respiratory issues or other health problems. Additionally, dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs, which could imply broader ecological issues in the area that might also impact human health.

Upon closer inspection, she realizes that it contains extremely confidential information related to the case they are working on. Step 4: Develop character relationships and subplots As the story unfolds, Jennifer and Tom must work together to retrieve the fax and ensure that their case isn't compromised. Along the way, their relationship develops and a romantic subplot begins. Meanwhile, Mr. Anderson is growing increasingly suspicious of the pair's activities, putting their jobs and the case in jeopardy. Step 5: The climax and resolution Jennifer and Tom track down the person who received the fax, and just as they are about to retrieve it, Mr. Anderson confronts them, demanding an explanation for their actions. Jennifer admits the truth, explaining that they were trying to correct a mistake and save the case. Impressed with their dedication and integrity, Mr. Anderson lets them off the hook and they win the case. Jennifer and Tom also reveal their feelings for each other, setting the stage for a happy ending. So, the movie plot based on Jennifer asking about the fax involves Jennifer receiving a mysterious fax containing confidential information related to a high-profile case. With Tom's help, they must track down the person who accidentally received the fax and secure the information before it is mishandled. Along the way, Jennifer and Tom's relationship develops, culminating in a triumphant conclusion as they save the case and confess their love for one another."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The following article contains an answer for the question: What are the full names of the people Koch suspects is responsible for Blayden turning up dead? , can you please find it?   Johnny O'Clock is a junior partner in a posh casino with Guido Marchettis. Complicating their longtime working relationship is Guido's wife Nelle, who is still in love with former boyfriend Johnny. She gives Johnny an expensive custom pocket watch, the twin of a birthday present she gave her husband, except Johnny's has a romantic engraving on the back. Johnny gives the watch, along with a rejection note, to Harriet Hobson, a hat-check girl at the casino, to return to Nelle. Harriet, however, apparently commits suicide using gas. Her sister Nancy shows up to find out what happened. She becomes attracted to Johnny. They eventually learn from Police Inspector Koch that Harriet was killed by poison. Harriet was dating Chuck Blayden, a crooked cop who is trying to persuade Guido to let him take Johnny's place. When Blayden also turns up dead, Koch suspects that either Johnny or Marchettis is responsible. Though Johnny tries to resist, little by little, he falls for Nancy. When Koch shows both Johnny and Marchettis Johnny's watch and note, Johnny tells Nancy their relationship is through and takes her to the airport. As he is driving away, however, he narrowly survives a drive-by shooting, and Nancy realizes he was only trying to protect her. She refuses to leave him. Johnny decides to flee to South America with Nancy, but not before brazenly cashing in his share of the casino. Marchettis pulls out a gun when Johnny's back is turned. They shoot it out; Marchettis is killed and Johnny wounded. Afterward, Nelle offers to testify it was self-defense, but only if he will come back to her. He refuses, so she tells Koch it was cold-blooded murder. Johnny's first instinct is to run away, but Nancy convinces him to give himself up. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the article, Inspector Koch suspects that the individuals responsible for Blayden turning up dead are Johnny O'Clock and Guido Marchettis. Their full names are not mentioned explicitly in the article, as they are primarily referred to by their first names or nicknames. However, considering the context and relationships between the characters, we can infer that the two people Koch suspects of being responsible for Blayden's death are: 1. Johnny O'Clock: He is a junior partner in the casino with Guido Marchettis and has a complicated relationship with Guido's wife, Nelle. Johnny is also the former boyfriend of Nelle, which further complicates the situation. The article does not provide a last name for Johnny. 2. Guido Marchettis: He is the other partner in the casino and husband of Nelle. Guido's relationship with Johnny is strained due to the romantic past between Johnny and Nelle. Additionally, Chuck Blayden, the now-deceased police officer, was attempting to replace Johnny in his partnership with Guido, leading to a potential motive for either Johnny or Guido to kill Blayden. In conclusion, Inspector Koch suspects Johnny O'Clock and Guido Marchettis of being responsible for Chuck Blayden's death."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

OPTIONS: (a). yes; (b). it is not possible to tell; (c). no;","output":"(a). Yes. Based on the given premise, it can be concluded that the hypothesis \\"The older teams in the NFC will have to rebuild soon\\" is true. The premise discusses the teams in the NFC East, stating that they are getting older, and specifically mentions the Washington Redskins (now known as the Washington Football Team) as an example of an older team. As teams age, their players typically reach the latter stages of their careers, and their performance levels can decline due to factors such as injury, decreased physical abilities, or retirement. In order to stay competitive in the league, teams with an aging roster must undergo a rebuilding process. This process often entails acquiring younger players through the NFL draft, signing free agents, or trading with other teams. Furthermore, rebuilding a team also involves evaluating and potentially changing coaching staff and management, looking for a combination of personnel that can best bring out the potential in younger players and create an environment conducive to growth. Depending on the team's existing resources and level of talent, rebuilding can take anywhere from a few seasons to several years. In summary, based on the premise provided, the hypothesis that \\"The older teams in the NFC will have to rebuild soon\\" is a valid conclusion. As older teams experience potential declines in performance due to factors such as aging players or outdated coaching approaches, it becomes crucial for their sustained competitiveness to undergo a rebuilding process focused on the acquisition of younger talent and the establishment of a supportive environment for their development."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Elliot Hopper is a workaholic widower who is about to land the deal of a lifetime at work, which he hopes will win him a promotion and a company car. After he forgets his daughter Diane's birthday, he attempts to make it up to her by promising her she can have his car when he secures the deal at work on the coming Thursday. After being persuaded to give the car to his daughter early, Elliot must hail a taxi from work, which is driven by Satanist Curtis Burch, who drives erratically and is of control. Attempting to get the taxi stopped, Elliot announces that he is Satan and commands him to stop the taxi, and also attempts to give him his wallet. Shocked to see his \\"Evil Master\\", Burch drives off a bridge and into the river. Elliot emerges from the accident scene, only to learn that he is a ghost when a police officer fails to notice him and a speeding bus goes straight through him. When he gets home he discovers that his three children can see him, but only in a totally dark room, and they can't hear him at times. He struggles to tell them what happened when he is whisked away to London by paranormal researcher Sir Edith, who tells him he is a ghost who has yet to enter the afterlife because \\"they screwed up\\"; his soul will not cross over until Thursday. The pressures of work and family life lead to many comedic events, as Elliot attempts to renew his life insurance policy and complete his company's merger, so his family will be provided for once he crosses over.

He eventually decides that his family's happiness is more important and walks out on his furious boss, Mr. Collins, who later smugly fires him.

Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time.  - The IBM System/360 Model 30 was a low-end member of the IBM System/360 family. It was announced on April 7, 1964, shipped in 1965, and withdrawn on October 7, 1977.  - The ZX81 is a home computer produced by Sinclair Research and manufactured in Scotland by Timex Corporation. It was launched in the United Kingdom in March 1981 as the successor to Sinclair's ZX80 and was designed to be a low-cost introduction to home computing for the general public. It was hugely successful, and more than 1.5 million units were sold before it was discontinued. The ZX81 found commercial success in many other countries, notably the United States, where it was initially sold as the ZX-81. Timex manufactured and distributed it under licence and enjoyed a substantial but brief boom in sales. Timex later produced its own versions of the ZX81 for the US market  the Timex Sinclair 1000 and Timex Sinclair 1500. Unauthorised clones of the ZX81 were produced in several countries.  - Don Priestley (born 1940) is a video game programmer who wrote for the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum between 1982 and 1989.  - The ZX Spectrum is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd. It was manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, in the now closed Timex factory.  - The IBM System/360 (S/360) is a mainframe computer system family that was announced by IBM on April 7, 1964, and delivered between 1965 and 1978. It was the first family of computers designed to cover the complete range of applications, from small to large, both commercial and scientific. The design made a clear distinction between architecture and implementation, allowing IBM to release a suite of compatible designs at different prices. All but the incompatible model 44 and the most expensive systems used microcode to implement the instruction set, which featured 8-bit byte addressing and binary, decimal and (hexadecimal) floating-point calculations.  - A game programmer is a software engineer, programmer, or computer scientist who primarily develops codebases for video games or related software, such as game development tools.

Here are the step-by-step justifications for the translation from English to Romanian: 1. \\"Mr President\\" translates to \\"Domnule Președinte\\" - The formal address for a president in Romanian is \\"Domnule Președinte.\\" 2. \\"I agree\\" translates to \\"sunt de acord\\" - In Romanian, expressing agreement is communicated using \\"sunt de acord\\". 3. \\"with the colleagues\\" translates to \\"cu colegii\\" - In the context of the sentence, \\"the colleagues\\" refers to other people making statements, so \\"cu colegii\\" is the appropriate expression. 4. \\"who are commending\\" translates to \\"care laudă\\" - I used the verb \\"a lauda\\", which means \\"to commend\\". The correct form in this case is \\"care laudă\\", meaning \\"who are commending\\". 5. \\"excellent work\\" translates to \\"excelenta activitate\\" - The adjective \\"excellent\\" is translated to \\"excelent\\" and the noun \\"work\\" or \\"activity\\" is translated to \\"activitate\\".

Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.  Question: \\"Why did Parameswara take money to Beijing in 1411?\\" Answer: \\"To give to his family\\" Is this answer to the question correct? Select from the following. (i). no; (ii). yes;","output":"(i). no The answer is incorrect because Parameswara took money to Beijing in 1411 as an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. This was part of the agreement made when Admiral Cheng Ho and the Chinese fleet called in at Melaka in 1409.

If you will be using the spray to help an infant or a small child with nasal congestion, you should also have a soft, rubber-bulb syringe to remove nasal secretions gently and efficiently.   A saline (saltwater) nasal spray can be used as often as needed, and they can be used for adults, children, and infants. Saline spray can be made with sea salt or table salt. If you have an iodine allergy, or if you don’t know if you have an iodine allergy, use a non-iodized salt such as pickling salt or kosher salt. To start the solution, boil eight ounces of water. You can use tap or distilled water. After boiling, allow it to cool until it is only very warm. Add ¼ teaspoon of salt to the eight ounces of water. The ¼ teaspoon of salt will make a saline solution that matches the amount of salt in your body.  You may want to try a salt spray that has a greater concentration of salt than your body. To do this, add ½ teaspoon of salt instead. This may be useful if you have major congestion, have a lot of mucus, and are having trouble breathing or clearing your nose. Don’t use a concentrated salt solution for infants or small children younger than five years old. Once you add the warm salt, mix it well. Make sure to mix until salt is dissolved. Next, pour the mixture into the spray bottle.  If you find that it hurts your nose, add ½ teaspoon of baking soda. This will help make it less likely to sting a sore nose. To use the spray, put the top of the squirt bottle into your nose. Then, spray one or two squirts of the saline solution into each nostril as needed. For infants and small children, spray one or two squirts and wait two to three minutes. Then, slightly tilt the baby’s head back and use a soft, rubber-bulb syringe to gently remove nasal secretions. Place the leftover saline solution in a covered container and refrigerate. Always warm up the refrigerated solution before using it. After two days, throw out any unused solution. This natural treatment is used to flush mucus from your system using the same saline solution in a process called nasal irrigation.  Neti pots can be purchased at most drug stores or health food stores. Make a solution of 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt and one cup of water. Fill the neti pot with the solution. Stand over a sink, tip your head to one side, place the spot of the neti pot in one nostril. Pour the solution into your nostril and let it flow out the other nostril until the mucus in your nasal cavity is discharged. Fill the neti pot again and repeat with the other nostril.","output":"The article provides instructions on how to prepare and use a homemade saline nasal spray to help alleviate nasal congestion in adults, children, and infants, as well as explaining the use of neti pots for nasal irrigation as a natural treatment for flushing out mucus."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

In 1980, Zappa cut his ties with record distributor Phonogram after the label refused to release his song \\"I Don't Wanna Get Drafted\\". It was picked up by CBS Records and released on the Zappa label in the United States and Canada, and by the CBS label internationally.After spending much of 1980 on the road, Zappa released Tinsel Town Rebellion in 1981. It was the first release on his own Barking Pumpkin Records, and it contains songs taken from a 1979 tour, one studio track and material from the 1980 tours. The album is a mixture of complicated instrumentals and Zappa's use of sprechstimme (speaking song or voice)—a compositional technique utilized by such composers as Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg—showcasing some of the most accomplished bands Zappa ever had (mostly featuring drummer Vinnie Colaiuta). While some lyrics still raised controversy among critics, some of whom found them sexist, the political and sociological satire in songs like the title track and \\"The Blue Light\\" have been described as a \\"hilarious critique of the willingness of the American people to believe anything\\". The album is also notable for the presence of guitarist Steve Vai, who joined Zappa's touring band in late 1980.The same year the double album You Are What You Is was released. Most of it was recorded in Zappa's brand new Utility Muffin Research Kitchen (UMRK) studios, which were located at his house, thereby giving him complete freedom in his work.

Move the decimal point two places to the left to get the converted decimal. You can also use the %{displaystyle %} sign on a calculator. For example, you might want to calculate the sale price of a pair of shoes that is regularly 69.95. If the shoes are 25% off, you need to convert 25% to a decimal by thinking 25%=25.00%=.25{displaystyle 25%=25.00%=.25}. You can  multiply the decimal by hand, or use a calculator. This will tell you the discount, or what value is being taken off the original price. For example, to find the 25% discount on a pair of 69.95 shoes, you would calculate 69.95×.25=17.49{displaystyle 69.95times .25=17.49}. To subtract decimals, line up the decimal points and subtract as you would whole numbers. Be careful to drop the decimal point down into your answer. You can also use a calculator. The difference will be the sale price of the item. For example, if a pair of shoes that are originally 69.95 have a discount of 17.49, calculate the sale price by subtracting:69.95−17.49=52.46{displaystyle 69.95-17.49=52.46}.

At the peak of their power under King Kakushtavarma, the Kadambas of Banavasi ruled large parts of modern Karnataka state. The dynasty was founded by Mayurasharma in 345 CE which at later times showed the potential of developing into imperial proportions, an indication to which is provided by the titles and epithets assumed by its rulers. King Mayurasharma defeated the armies of Pallavas of Kanchi possibly with help of some native tribes. The Kadamba fame reached its peak during the rule of Kakusthavarma, a notable ruler with whom even the kings of Gupta Dynasty of northern India cultivated marital alliances. The Kadambas were contemporaries of the Western Ganga Dynasty and together they formed the earliest native kingdoms to rule the land with absolute autonomy. The dynasty later continued to rule as a feudatory of larger Kannada empires, the Chalukya and the Rashtrakuta empires, for over five hundred years during which time they branched into minor dynasties known as the Kadambas of Goa, Kadambas of Halasi and Kadambas of Hangal.

We need to find the value of \\"k\\". Let me explain it step by step: 1. We have this equation: -68*k = -97*k + 116 2. Our goal is to get \\"k\\" all by itself on one side of the equation. First, let’s add 97*k to both sides of the equation to remove -97*k:   -68*k + 97*k = -97*k + 116 + 97*k 3. The -97*k and +97*k on the right side of the equation cancel each other out, so now we have:   29*k = 116 (Because -68*k + 97*k equals 29*k) 4. Now, we need to get \\"k\\" all by itself. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 29:   29*k / 29 = 116 / 29 5. When we divide 29*k by 29, we are left with just \\"k\\":   k = 116 / 29 6. Finally, we do the division on the right side:   k = 4 So there you have it! The value of \\"k\\" in this math problem is 4.

The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

During a private argument about whether or not they should move, Elaine reveals she is pregnant. The next morning, blue lights descend from the sky, hypnotizing anyone who looks at them. The light affects them physically, causing them to become zombie-like. Any immobilized humans are collected by the light machines. Ray is taken, but Jarrod is saved when Terry tackles him, and he slowly returns to normal. He and Terry go to the apartment roof to investigate the lights. They see large alien spaceships descending through the clouds and vacuuming up thousands of screaming people. They are attacked by one of hundreds of flying alien drones and forced to retreat from the roof.

At a campaign rally in New Hampshire Monday, Trump promised his supporters that, if elected, he would use the executive powers to \\"suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats.\\" Although the suspected Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, was an American citizen, Trump suggested immigrants from the Middle East can come to the U.S. and radicalize people who are already here, or work to convince them online. \\"The media talks about homegrown terrorism,\\" Trump said. \\"But Islamic radicalism ... and the networks that nurture it are imports from overseas whether you like it or don't like it.\\" Refugees and immigrants from conflict ridden Middle Eastern countries like Syria, Iraq and Libya could \\"be a better, bigger more horrible version than the legendary Trojan horse ever was,\\" Trump said.

Then Maggie came up and started bugging me . I though it was because she wanted me to go to bed . Question What will you do after Maggie came up ? Answer:","output":"When Maggie came up, it became evident that there might be an issue that needs addressing or she might be trying to communicate something important. Therefore, it is important to be attentive and considerate in this situation. Here is a detailed plan for managing the situation after Maggie came up: 1. Listen attentively to Maggie: Give her your full attention and listen to what she has to say. This will help you understand the reason behind her approaching you. There might be something important that you need to attend to, or she might just be concerned about your well-being. 2. Assess the situation: After getting a clearer understanding of why Maggie came up, assess the situation to determine the best course of action. If it's something that requires immediate attention, you should handle it promptly. If it's concerning your well-being or a reminder to rest, consider her concern in light of the current circumstances in the office. 3. Address any urgent matters: If Maggie brought up something that needs immediate attention, such as a work task, do your best to resolve it as soon as possible. It may require you to pause or exit RCT3 temporarily, but it's best to prioritize urgent tasks over leisure activities. 4. Consider scheduling and time management: Reflect on how your time management and scheduling may have affected the current situation. If it's late and you have been playing RCT3 for an extended period without taking breaks, consider setting specific time limits for your leisure activities in the future. This will help ensure you maintain a work-life balance and prevent instances where you lose track of time. 5. Acknowledge Maggie's concern: Express your appreciation for Maggie's concern and acknowledge her feelings. If it was a simple reminder to take a break or go to bed, thank her for caring about your well-being. If it was regarding an urgent matter, make it clear that you value her input and will handle the situation promptly. 6. Take a break and adjust your activities: If playing RCT3 in full screen mode is causing you to lose track of time or is interfering with your work, consider taking intervals to pause the game, check on the time, and attend to other tasks or commitments. Alternatively, opt to play in windowed mode, which can allow you to multitask and stay aware of your surroundings better. 7. Communicate with your colleagues: Keep open communication with your colleagues to prevent situations where they feel the need to intervene.

Going where no pope has gone before In an interview with journalist Peter Seewald, Pope Benedict XVI said that condom use may be acceptable under \\"exceptional circumstances\\" such as use by a male prostitute in order to prevent the spread of HIV/ AIDS. Interpretation of the pope's pronouncement has varied. Many insist that the church's teaching, which bans birth control, has not changed, but others see the pope's statement as opening the door to a broader conversation about human sexuality in the modern world. What are the implications of Pope Benedict's statement on condoms in terms of AIDS policy, the church's teaching on sex and its view of women? At the risk of over-interpreting Pope Benedict's statements regarding the use of condoms as moral in certain circumstances, and I admit up front here that is a live risk, I still believe these recent statements by the pope signal a shift in Catholic thinking. The pope, it is reported, said \\"There may be a basis in the case of some individuals, as perhaps when a male prostitute uses a condom, where this can be a first step in the direction of a moralization, a first assumption of responsibility.\\" Furthermore, intentionality is important according to Benedict, \\"in this or that case, there can be nonetheless in the intention of reducing the risk of infection, a first step in a movement toward a different way, a more human way, of living sexuality.\\" There are frankly some things I feel are theologically promising. The key concept is that the use of a condom can be a moral act, given the intention to reduce the risk of infection from HIV/AIDS. Let's say first this is a good thing in itself for the pope to have signaled. Condom use should be, and in many religious traditions other than Catholicism is, promoted as a moral act, an \\"assumption of responsibility\\" in the age of HIV/AIDS. Yes, yes, I know the example was not one where procreation was the issue, but still, a signal in that condom use in certain contexts can be moral. A further question is whether this kind of thinking will be able to move the Catholic church forward in terms of regarding contraception in general as an \\"assumption of moral responsibility,\\" that being the most common basis religious traditions use to argue that contraception is a moral good. The Religious Coalition for Reproductive Rights summarizes these positions and their arguments, leading with Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said, \\"Planned parenthood is an obligation of those who are Christians. Our church thinks we should use scientific methods that assist in family planning.\\" They then go on to quote the Dalai Lama who has noted, \\"Family planning is crucial, especially in the developing world.\\" From Anglicans to Buddhists to Jews to Southern Baptists to Methodists and my own United Church of Christ, there is remarkable similarity in the statements to this one phrase used by Pope Benedict: \\"moral responsibility.\\" While the Catholic Church is not on that list, of course, many Catholics have in effect concluded that they are taking moral responsibility in using contraception. Indeed, \\"most U.S. Catholics agree contraception is an important tool most Americans have incorporated into their lives as responsible adults. In a study, 90 percent of American Catholic women supported access to contraception at community hospitals. In another survey cited in the same report, 60 percent of American Catholics agreed that it was even acceptable to offer birth control pills to teenagers.\\" Arguing against further progress in this direction, however, is the Catholic understanding of \\"natural theology.\\" This is the theology that underlies the papal encyclical Humanae Vitae written by Pope Paul VI and released in 1968. This document re-affirms the traditional teaching of the Catholic Church regarding contraception at a time when the contraceptive pill had become available. It also discusses abortion and other issues pertaining to human life. In sum, the theological basis is that there are certain laws of creation that God as creator has built into the world. Artificial forms of contraception when used in the sexual act impair that order and frustrate the divine design, a design that is naturally procreative. Contravening this order in an artificial way is not only considered wrong, but evil. \\"Calendar based\\" contraceptive methods that work with a woman's natural cycle do not contravene the natural order and thus have been permitted. So where can a way forward be found, if any? The two that suggest themselves from Pope Benedict's remarks are 'intentionality' and 'assuming responsibility.' The intention of women and men in regulating pregnancy would have to become a recognized social good and part of God's intention in giving the gift of procreation in the Catholic view. The other is the related concept of assuming responsibility. As we assume responsibility for our capacity to procreate, we become partners with God in taking care in how we procreate. This is not unlike Pope John Paul II's Laborem exercens of 1981. Work, according to John Paul II, is the primary way human beings participate as co-creators with God. Is it such a stretch to see procreation in the same light? When I read Pope Benedict's remarks, I began to wonder if it would be possible to connect this earlier papal thinking to the current, admittedly small, opening.

Theft is sometimes okay, if it serves the greater good, killing is okay in certain circumstances, even not honoring your violent, abusive parents is okay in certain(sane) circumstances. Morality is relative to time, place and culture. Belching loudly in my car on the long commute is fine. In front of my kids, naughty, but funny. In front of my saintly mother, unthinkable. Time, place, culture, context. Even the RCC itself has redefined or rationalized certain âabsolutesâ over the centuries. Morality is defined and adjudicated by the society in which a person resides. If that society bases its morality on a specific religious definition, then that is what will likely be dominant. But it is still relative to other places, other cultures, other periods of time. As David6 pointed out. Polygamy, incest, animal sacrifices and slaughtering enemies was quite common in OT times and places... Even when Jesus came along he released mankind from some of the old laws/absolutes.

Catholics disaffection is related to the church not publishing rigorous studies of the Catholic faith in relation to philosophical and scientific research in physics and astrophysicist. Most priests in the church are very intelligent and highly educated. In a press release from Geneva researchers claimed a breakthrough in solving one of the biggest riddles in physics, successfully trapping the first âanti-atomâ in a quest to understand what happened to all the antimatter that has vanish since the Big Bang. The study involves finding that indicate matter and antimatter were created in equal amount at the moment of the Big Bang. Since then antimatter seems to have disappeared from the universe while matter went on to become the building blocks of everything that exists and antimatter has all but disappeared except in the lab. The phenomenon of antimatter is that it immediately disappears upon creation of matter. When atoms made of antimatter contact atoms of matter, there is burst of energy upon contact and the antimatter disappears immediately upon their creations. Researchers have now captured anti-protons mixed in a vacuum to create anti-hydrogen atoms. In an overwhelming epiphany of insight to creation science has discovered antimatter that is the residual scientific evidence of the word of God. According to the Bible in the book of John, âIn the beginning was the Wordâ or in scientific terms the Big Bang when the physic of matter became the building block of everything that exists. âIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.â Posted by: klausdmk | November 23, 2010 12:50 PM Report Offensive Comment Will he now order his known pervert priests to use them?

Condoms are merely an effective method of reducing the spread of certain STD's. They are not perfect, no.

You guys talk a lot about the failure rate, but you rarely, if ever mention the success rate.

Information:  - An anti-establishment view or belief is one which stands in opposition to the conventional social, political, and economic principles of a society. The term was first used in the modern sense in 1958, by the British magazine \\"New Statesman\\" to refer to its political and social agenda.  - John Graham Mellor (21 August 1952  22 December 2002), known by his stage name Joe Strummer, was a British musician, singer, actor and songwriter who was the co-founder, lyricist, rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist of the Clash, a punk rock band that was formed in 1976 as part of the original wave of British punk. Their music also incorporated elements of reggae, ska, dub, funk, rap, and rockabilly. The Clash were one of the most prominent of the emerging bands in the UK punk rock scene, with their second album, \\"Give 'Em Enough Rope\\" (1978) reaching number 2 on the UK charts. Soon after, they began achieving success in the US, starting with \\"London Calling\\" (1979), and peaking with 1982's \\"Combat Rock\\", reaching number 7 on the US charts and being certified 2× platinum there. The Clash's politicised lyrics, musical experimentation, and rebellious attitude had a far-reaching influence on rock, and alternative rock in particular.  - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths.  - Garage rock (shortened as \\"garage\\"; sometimes '60s punk\\" or \\"garage punk\\") is a raw and energetic style of rock and roll that flourished in the mid-1960s, most notably in the United States and Canada. The term derives from the perception that groups were often made up of young amateurs who rehearsed in the family garage, although many were professional. The phrase \\"garage band\\" is often used to refer to musical acts in this genre.  - Paul Gustave Simonon (born 15 December 1955) is an English musician and artist best known as the bassist for the punk rock band The Clash. More recent work includes his involvement in the project \\"The Good, the Bad & the Queen\\" in 2007 with Damon Albarn, Simon Tong and Tony Allen and the Gorillaz album, \\"Plastic Beach\\" in 2010, which along with Albarn saw him reunite with Mick Jones.  - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.  - Rocksteady is a music genre that originated in Jamaica around 1966. A successor of ska and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as The Gaylads, The Maytals, The Heptones and The Paragons. The term \\"rocksteady\\" comes from a dance style that was mentioned in the Alton Ellis song \\"Rock Steady\\". Dances performed to rocksteady were less energetic than the earlier ska dances. The first international rocksteady hit was \\"Hold Me Tight\\" (1968) by the American soul singer Johnny Nash; it reached number one in Canada.  - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\")   - The King Blues are a punk rock band from London , England , credited for fusing ska and folk together with influences from punk rock and hardcore punk . Tariq Ali described the band 's sounds as ' rough , radical music that should unsettle the rulers of this country . A new generation of musicians are challenging war - monger politicians and their courtiers ' . Influences include Public Enemy , The Clash , The Specials , Black Flag and Minor Threat . Their third full - length album , Punk and Poetry , was released on 17 April 2011 . Lead singer Jonny \`\` Itch '' Fox describes the music as ' a mixture of reggae , hip hop , folk , doo wop , punk rock . ' They announced their breakup on 3 April 2012 . They announced their reformation on 25 November 2015 .  - DIY ethic refers to the ethic of self-sufficiency through completing tasks without the aid of a paid expert. Literally meaning \\"do it yourself,\\" the DIY ethic promotes the idea that anyone is capable of performing a variety of tasks rather than relying on paid specialists. The DIY ethic requires that the adherent seeks out the knowledge required to complete a given task. The term can refer to a variety of disciplines, including home improvement, first aid or creative works.  - Mainstream is current thought that is widespread. It includes all popular culture and media culture, typically disseminated by mass media. It is to be distinguished from subcultures and countercultures, and at the opposite extreme are cult followings and fringe theories.  - Rockabilly is one of the earliest styles of rock and roll music, dating back to the early 1950s in the United States, especially the South. As a genre it blends the sound of Western musical styles such as country with that of rhythm and blues, leading to what is considered \\"classic\\" rock and roll. Some have also described it as a blend of bluegrass with rock and roll. The term \\"rockabilly\\" itself is a portmanteau of \\"rock\\" (from \\"rock 'n' roll\\") and \\"hillbilly\\", the latter a reference to the country music (often called \\"hillbilly music\\" in the 1940s and 1950s) that contributed strongly to the style. Other important influences on rockabilly include western swing, boogie woogie, jump blues, and electric blues.  - The Specials, also known as The Special AKA, are an English 2 Tone and ska revival band formed in 1977 in Coventry. Their music combines a \\"danceable ska and rocksteady beat with punk's energy and attitude\\". Lyrically they present a \\"more focused and informed political and social stance\\" than most other ska groups.  - Proto-punk (or \\"protopunk\\") is the rock music played by garage bands<ref name=\\"Bangs (RS-2nd ed./Garage)\\"></ref> from the 1960s and early 1970s that presaged the punk rock movement. A retroactive label, the musicians involved were not originally associated with each other, coming from a variety of backgrounds and styles, but together they anticipated many of punk's musical and thematic attributes.  - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.  - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads.  - The Clash were an English punk rock band that formed in 1976 as part of the original wave of British punk. Along with punk, their music incorporated elements of reggae, dub, funk, ska and rockabilly. For most of their recording career the Clash consisted of Joe Strummer (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Mick Jones (lead guitar, lead vocals), Paul Simonon (bass guitar, vocals) and Nicky \\"Topper\\" Headon (drums, percussion). Headon left the group in 1982, and internal friction led to Jones's departure the following year. The group continued with new members, but finally disbanded in early 1986.    What is the relationship between 'the king blues' and 'alternative rock'? A:","output":"The King Blues are a punk rock band from London, England, which fuses ska and folk elements with influences from punk rock and hardcore punk.

It consists of various subgenres, including punk rock, that are distinct from mainstream rock music. The King Blues' combination of reggae, hip-hop, folk, doo-wop, and punk rock, along with their anti-establishment lyrics and DIY ethic, makes them a fitting example of an alternative rock band."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? DENVER, Colorado (CNN) -- It was classic Clinton. It was Sen. Hillary Clinton's big night but before her speech even began, former President Bill Clinton reached out in his box and firmly embraced a young African-American man. Clinton gripped the young man tightly; to millions watching on television, it was clear he could feel Mervyn Jones Jr.'s pain. As he sat down for his wife's headlining address, Bill Clinton's silent embrace of the 25-year-old son of recently deceased Ohio Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones resonated loudly. Rep. Tubbs Jones, of course, was a solid and loyal Clinton supporter, standing by the Clintons even when many other black leaders were shifting their support to Barack Obama. Tubbs Jones endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in April 2007 but with Sen. Barack Obama's success during the primaries, many African-American superdelegates came under pressure to back OPTIONS: - African instead. - American instead. - Barack Obama instead. - Bill Clinton instead. - CNN instead. - Clinton instead. - Clintons instead. - Colorado instead. - DENVER instead. - Hillary Clinton instead. - Mervyn Jones Jr. instead. - Ohio instead. - Stephanie Tubbs Jones instead. - Tubbs Jones instead.","output":"Tubbs Jones endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in April 2007 but with Sen. Barack Obama's success during the primaries, many African-American superdelegates came under pressure to back Barack Obama instead. This shift in support from the Clinton camp to Obama's highlighted the changing political landscape and dynamics within the Democratic party, specifically among African-American leaders and their constituents. Despite this growing pressure, Rep. Tubbs Jones remained steadfast in her support for Hillary Clinton, demonstrating her loyalty to the Clintons and their long-time friendship. Her sudden and untimely death left many of her followers and those she had inspired mourning the loss of a strong and dedicated leader. The powerful, symbolic embrace between former President Bill Clinton and Mervyn Jones Jr., right before Sen. Hillary Clinton's big speech, spoke volumes about the deep respect and connection that existed between the Clinton and Tubbs Jones families. It also served as a reminder of the complex factors and relationships at play during the 2008 Democratic primaries and the historical significance of having the first viable African-American presidential candidate. The race between Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama was fierce, and although it ultimately led to Obama's nomination as the Democratic candidate, the support from key figures such as Rep. Tubbs Jones for Hillary was essential in shaping the narrative of the primaries. The embrace, witnessed by millions, exemplified unity within the Democratic Party and reminded those watching that political allegiance could cut across racial lines. Moreover, the moment also highlighted the personal side to politics, reminding the public that behind the campaigns and professional personas, there are relationships built on trust, loyalty, and shared values that can endure even throughout tough political contests. In the end, Hillary Clinton's tight race with Barack Obama paved the way for her to become the Democratic nominee in the 2016 presidential election and solidified her historical role as the first female nominee from a major party."},{"instruction":"How many Latin Grammy Award nominations did the artist, who released \\"Latina\\" album, receive?

Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary.

Article: We use an average of 158 liters of water a day in Britain, for which we pay a bargain price of 28p a liter, but much of this is just cash down the drain, according to water companies. Most are campaigning to cut the amount we use. And the frontline weapon in their campaign is the water meter  . They want us all to have one and one company is seeking powers to make this compulsory. The Government is anxious for us to use less water, too. Elliot Morley, the Environment Minister, says he is impressed by the savings when a meter is installed. In most homes, consumption drops by 20 percent. He also thinks consumers get a good deal from meters. He said, \\"Most people would find that they would either be exactly the same or better off with water meters and it is a fairer way of paying for water.\\" At present, only 25% of households have meters and most of those are in East Anglia. They are installed by water companies, and households then have about PS43 added to each bill to cover the cost of installing and reading the meter. Barrie Clarke, a spokesman for Water UK, said, \\"We want everyone to be more water wise--to think about the amount of water they use. But with our climate change and different weather patterns, over time it will make economic and environmental sense to think how we use water. This may mean meters.\\" Mr. Clarke believes the easiest way to save water is to use less in the garden. In one hour, a sprinkler uses the same amount of water as the average family of four uses in a day--about 632 liters. He said that gardeners should water in the evening so that it dose not _ in the heat of the day and that every household should have a water butt to collect rainwater for use in the garden.

The ugly truth about Benghazi and Team Obama Until Friday, there were two possible explanations for why the White House failed to immediately call the Benghazi attack an act of terrorism. One was incompetence, the other was worse. Now there is only one, and it is the worse one. Based on the persuasive testimony of ex-CIA boss David Petraeus, it is clear the Obama administration made a deliberate decision to mislead Congress and the American people. The repeated claim that the attack was spontaneous and grew out of a demonstration against an anti-Islam video — a claim made by the president and secretary of State as they stood next to the bodies of four dead Americans — was a monstrous lie. It was vile and done for the basest of reasons. Because we now know the truth of what happened — CIA reports were edited to remove the names of al Qaeda groups involved in the attack, Petraeus said under oath — we also know the motive. It was political self-preservation, meaning the president and his team put politics first. The timing helps tell the tale. Just days removed from his Charlotte convention, where he danced on the grave of Osama bin Laden and boasted that al Qaeda was decimated, Obama couldn’t bear to admit that affiliated groups were thriving in North Africa. And he certainly couldn’t admit they had carried out a murderous attack on our consulate on the 11th anniversary of the most awful day in American history. To do so would be to acknowledge the failure of his decision to ignore hard-line Islamists and that his team had erred egregiously in rejecting pleas for more security from Libya Ambassador Chris Stevens. So the president lied, including in a speech to the United Nations, where he cited the video as the reason for the attack. He sent out reams of flunkies to do the same, including his snide press secretary, Jay Carney. Most notably, UN Ambassador Susan Rice went on five Sunday television shows to spin the nonsense about the hijacking of a demonstration — a demonstration that never existed. Rice made a fool of herself, and now, she, too is damaged goods. Oddly, Petraeus, brought down by the reckless affair with his biographer, nonetheless looks like the only honest man in the drama. A briefing he gave soon after the attack is now more suspect because it adhered to the party line, despite his belief that it was always a terrorist attack. But Friday in his testimony behind closed doors, Petraeus told the truth as he knew it, even though the administration announced the day before that it was investigating his conduct at the CIA. If that was meant to pressure him to protect the president, it failed spectacularly. Whatever his personal failings, Petraeus reinforced his reputation for professional integrity. The next move is up to Congress. While Democrats are predictably and shamefully trying to deny the significance of Petraeus’ revelation, Republicans say they are determined to get the full truth, wherever the hunt takes them. Especially as the president begins a new term, and huge economic and tax difference must be resolved, the country would be better served if the administration co-operates. But their behavior up to now does not make that seem likely. Having built their web of lies, it would be hard to suddenly come clean. The first tests will come with the next round of hearings. Any attempt by the White House to block the appearance of any official who played a role in shaping the false narrative should be seen as proof that the stonewalling continues. In that case, the full power of the constitution must be brought to bear. Nobody is above the law, even the president.

Please answer the following question: This article: Kill 'Em All features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. \\"Metal Militia\\", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity.... contains an answer for the question: What is the title of the song whose central rift is in NWOBHM fashion?, what is it ?

Given the question \\"How could you describe Sasha?\\", is \\"a slacker and lazy\\" a valid answer? Pick your answer from: [+] Yes. [+] No. Answer:","output":"No. Given the information provided in the question, it would not be valid to describe Sasha as \\"a slacker and lazy.\\" According to the details, Sasha \\"firmly exerted the necessary pressure on the local government to get things done.\\" This statement suggests that he was proactive, assertive, and committed to achieving a particular goal. Slacker and lazy are terms used to characterize someone who is idle, unproductive, and lacks motivation or discipline. Clearly, Sasha's actions are quite the opposite. The statement in question tells us that Sasha made an effort to influence the local government so that certain tasks would be completed. To do this, Sasha likely needed to employ a variety of skills, such as effective communication, negotiation, persistence, networking, and a clear understanding of government policies and procedures. These qualities seem to imply that Sasha is involved, resourceful, and determined. In addition to the qualities mentioned above, the fact that Sasha succeeded in exerting the necessary pressure further supports the notion that they are not a slacker or lazy. Successfully lobbying government officials or advocating for particular causes usually requires significant time, effort, and dedication. In this case, Sasha's proactive approach seems to reflect a strong work ethic and commitment to making an impact. In conclusion, it is not valid to describe Sasha as \\"a slacker and lazy.\\" Instead, their actions indicate that they are motivated, persistent, and capable in their pursuits. Given their success in putting pressure on the local government and getting things done, it is more accurate to describe Sasha as someone who takes action and demonstrates initiative in achieving their goals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force. Depending on the militarization of the culture, the relative size of the armed forces and the society supporting them, the style of government, and the popular support for the military objectives, such war effort can range from a small industry to complete command of society.  - The Deutsche Luftstreitkräfte (German Air Force)known before October 1916 as the Fliegertruppen des deutschen Kaiserreiches (\\"Imperial German Flying Corps\\") or simply Die Fliegertruppewas the World War I (191418) air arm of the German Army, of which it remained an integral part. In English-language sources it is usually referred to as the Imperial German Air Service, although that is not a literal translation of either name. German naval aviators serving with the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" remained an integral part of the Imperial German Navy \\"(Kaiserliche Marine)\\". Both military branches, the army and navy, operated conventional aircraft, observation balloons and Zeppelins.  - The Messerschmitt Me 262, nicknamed Schwalbe (German: \\"Swallow\\") in fighter versions, or Sturmvogel (German: \\"Storm Bird\\") in fighter-bomber versions, was the world's first operational jet-powered fighter aircraft. Design work started before World War II began, but problems with engines, metallurgy and top-level interference kept the aircraft from operational status with the Luftwaffe until mid-1944. The Me 262 was faster and more heavily armed than any Allied fighter, including the British jet-powered Gloster Meteor. One of the most advanced aviation designs in operational use during World War II, the Me 262's roles included light bomber, reconnaissance and experimental night fighter versions.  - A light bomber is a relatively small and fast type of military bomber aircraft that was primarily employed before the 1950s. Such aircraft would typically not carry more than one ton of ordnance. The dedicated light bomber disappeared as fighters, due to advancements in powerplants and aircraft design, were eventually able to deliver equal or greater bomb loads while also carrying out other missions and roles.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Walter Schuck ( 30 July 1920 -- 27 March 2015 ) was a German World War II fighter ace who served in the Luftwaffe from 1937 until the end of World War II. He claimed 206 enemy aircraft shot down in over 500 combat missions , eight of which while flying the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter . For these achievements , Schuck received the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves ( German : Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub ) . The Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grade Oak Leaves was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership . Born in the Saargebiet ( Territory of the Saar Basin ) , Schuck volunteered for service in the Luftwaffe of the Third Reich in 1936 and was accepted in 1937 . After a period of training at various pilot and fighter pilot schools , he was posted to Jagdgeschwader 5 ( JG 5 -- 5th Fighter Wing ) , operating on the most northern section of the Eastern Front , the Arctic Front , in April 1942 . In April 1944 he was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross for 84 aerial victories . Following his 171st aerial victory he was injured in combat and received the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves during his convalescence . In early 1945 Schuck transferred to Jagdgeschwader 7 ( JG 7 -- 7th Fighter Wing ) which operated the then revolutionary jet fighter Me 262 . Claiming a further eight aerial victories , he was forced to bail out when his aircraft was shot down by a P - 51 Mustang on 10 April 1945 . Schuck sustained minor injuries preventing him from flying further combat missions .  - The Iron Cross (abbreviated EK) was a military decoration in the Kingdom of Prussia, and later in the German Empire (18711918) and Nazi Germany (19331945). It was established by King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia in March 1813 backdated to the birthday of his late wife Queen Louise on 10 March 1813 during the Napoleonic Wars (EK 1813). Louise was the first person to receive this decoration (posthumous). The recommissioned Iron Cross was also awarded during the Franco-Prussian War (EK 1870), World War I (EK 1914), and World War II (EK 1939, re-introduced with a swastika added in the center). The Iron Cross was normally a military decoration only, though there were instances of it being awarded to civilians for performing military functions. Two examples of this were civilian test pilots Hanna Reitsch who was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class and 1st Class and Melitta Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg, who was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class, for their actions as pilots during World War II.  - The Franco-Prussian War or Franco-German War, often referred to in France as the War of 1870 (19 July 1871), was a conflict between the Second French Empire of Napoleon III and the German states of the North German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia. The conflict was caused by Prussian ambitions to extend German unification and French fears of the shift in the European balance of power that would result if the Prussians succeeded. Some historians argue that the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck deliberately provoked a French attack in order to draw the southern German statesBaden, Württemberg, Bavaria and Hesse-Darmstadtinto an alliance with the North German Confederation dominated by Prussia, while others contend that Bismarck did not plan anything and merely exploited the circumstances as they unfolded.  - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history.  - Aviation is the practical aspect or art of aeronautics, being the design, development, production, operation and use of aircraft, especially heavier than air aircraft. The word \\"aviation\\" was coined by French writer and former naval officer Gabriel La Landelle in 1863, from the verb \\"avier\\" (synonymous flying), itself derived from the Latin word \\"avis\\" (\\"bird\\") and the suffix \\"-ation\\".  - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability.  - A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions.  - The swastika (also known outside the Indian subcontinent as the Hakenkreuz, gammadion cross, cross cramponnée, croix gammée, fylfot, or tetraskelion) (as a character  or ) is an ancient religious symbol originating from the Indian subcontinent, that generally takes the form of an equilateral cross with four legs each bent at 90 degrees. It is considered to be a sacred and auspicious symbol in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism and dates back at least 11,000 years. It continues to be commonly used as a religious symbol in religions native to the Indian subcontinent, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.  - Melitta Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg, born Melitta Schiller (9 January 1903  8 April 1945), was a German Aviator who served as a test pilot in the Luftwaffe before and during World War II.  - The Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) were a series of major conflicts pitting the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I, against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions, primarily led and financed by the United Kingdom. The wars resulted from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars, which had raged on for years before concluding with the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. The resumption of hostilities the following year paved the way for more than a decade of constant warfare often categorized into five conflicts: the War of the Third Coalition (1805), the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806-7), the War of the Fifth Coalition (1809), the War of the Sixth Coalition (1813), and the War of the Seventh Coalition (1815). The Napoleonic Wars had profound consequences for global and European history, leading to the spread of nationalism and liberalism, the rise of the British Empire as the world's premier power, the independence movements in Latin America and the collapse of the Spanish Empire, the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the establishment of radically new methods in warfare.   - The Luftwaffe was the aerial warfare branch of the combined German Wehrmacht military forces during World War II. Germany's military air arms during the First World War, the \\"Luftstreitkräfte\\" of the Army and the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" of the Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force.  - A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known.  - Hanna Reitsch (29 March 1912  24 August 1979) was Germany's most famous female aviator and test pilot, starting in the early 1930s. During the Nazi era she served as an international representative for the regime. In the 1960s she was sponsored by the West German foreign office as a technical adviser in Ghana and elsewhere.  - German is a West Germanic language that is mainly spoken in Central Europe. It is the most widely spoken and (co-) official language in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, South Tyrol (Italy), the German-speaking Community of Belgium, and Liechtenstein; it is also an official, but not majority language of Luxembourg. Major languages which are most similar to German include other members of the West Germanic language branch, such as Afrikaans, Dutch, and English. It is the second most widely spoken Germanic language, after English.  - Total war is warfare that includes any and all civilian-associated resources and infrastructure as legitimate military targets, mobilizes all of the resources of society to fight the war, and gives priority to warfare over non-combatant needs. The American-English Dictionary defines total war as \\"war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the territory or combatants involved, or the objectives pursued, especially one in which the laws of war are disregarded.\\"  - The Wehrmacht (lit. \\"defence force\\") was the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1946. It consisted of the \\"Heer\\" (army), the \\"Kriegsmarine\\" (navy) and the \\"Luftwaffe\\" (air force). The designation \\"Wehrmacht\\" for Nazi Germany's military replaced the previously used term, \\"Reichswehr\\" (191935), and was the manifestation of Nazi Germany's efforts to rearm the nation to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted.  - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe.  - A fighter aircraft is a military aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat against other aircraft, as opposed to bombers and attack aircraft, whose main mission is to attack ground targets. The hallmarks of a fighter are its speed, maneuverability, and small size relative to other combat aircraft.

Movie title: From Paris with Love Context: A personal aide to the U.S. ambassador in France, James Reese (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) has an enviable life in Paris and a beautiful French girlfriend, but his real passion is his side job as a low-level operative for the CIA. Reese wants to become a higher level agent with more responsibilities. As the result of a shortage of agents in France, he is assigned as a partner to secret agent Charlie Wax (John Travolta). Reese's first test is to have Wax released from airport detention by the French Customs when Wax does not want to surrender the cans of his favorite energy drink. Despite the apparent triviality of an energy drink that Wax could probably purchase in Paris, Wax continues to verbally abuse French Customs until Reese places a Diplomatic Mail sticker on Wax's luggage containing the energy drink, which makes them immune from customs and quarantine requirements. Once in the car, Wax apologizes for his behavior while opening the tins and revealing the concealed pieces of his personal SIG Sauer P226 X-Five Lightweight, which he refers to as \\"Mrs. Jones\\". Wax explains that he has been sent to Paris to investigate a drug ring at least indirectly responsible for the death of a woman who happens to be the niece of the Secretary of Defense. During the investigation, Wax reveals that there was no overdoseâtheir goal is to trace the money back to a circle of Pakistani terrorists. Evidence leads them to the terrorists, resulting in an armed confrontation in which most of the terrorists are killed. Wax and Reese learn that the terrorists plan to infiltrate the U.S. embassy with explosives hidden beneath their burkas. As they collect evidence, they find photographs of Agent Reese pinned to a wall. Ultimately, Reese learns that the terrorists are targeting a summit meeting. Wax discovers that Reese's fiancÃ©e Caroline (Kasia Smutniak) is a \\"sleeper\\" agent who was assigned to infiltrate them.

Question: \\"What concession did Notre Dame make in order to keep their football affiliation?\\"  Context: \\"Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers. The leprechaun was featured on the cover of Time in November 1964 and gained national exposure.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"In order to maintain their football independence while transitioning their other sports affiliations from the Big East to the ACC (Atlantic Coast Conference) in July 2013, the University of Notre Dame committed to playing five games per season against ACC opponents.

Here is an article: John Oliver is a sensible man. He often has wise things to say about the news, or, if the headlines are to be believed, “completely destroys [Name of News Topic] in a way that must be seen to be believed” and “ravages the city of misconception with the raw power of his rampant intellect.” And he’s definitely right about New Year’s. Let me admit that I used to love New Year’s. But I can’t help feeling that New Year’s Eve is generally a bit of a letdown. If I recall correctly, “Family Feud” once polled its excruciatingly non-scientific audience about how enjoyable they found New Year’s Eve on a scale from one to 10, and the most popular answer was four. Four is about right. The trouble with New Year’s Eve is that, unlike the other holidays, it is a Holiday for Adults. Definitely. It is past everyone else’s bedtime. Like most adult things — driving cars, eating ice cream for breakfast and cereal for dinner, grouting tile — it seems like the sort of thing that should be fun but isn’t. As a kid, when I saw the “New Year’s Eve” assortments of hats and noisemakers in the pages of the Oriental Trading Company catalog, I was convinced that here we had a real, bang-up holiday, when you could stay up late and cut loose and pelt each other with confetti and drink champagne from a plastic flute. That, I told myself, was the life. I also felt that there was a certain romance in cleaning your toilet, with the help of those cheery animated bubble characters (who, the commercial suggested, would do most of the work for you). Now I know better. It is a party to celebrate what time it is, for Pete’s sake. If you go to a bar, everything costs 60 and by the time you have fought through the crowd to get a second drink, the evening is over. Also, as you stumble to the street in your jaunty glasses that used to make sense when there were two zeros in the middle of the year and now don’t, there is Surge Pricing on Uber. If you stay in, you are stuck there. The fact that you cannot leave under any circumstances before midnight suddenly causes you to loathe all of your friends. They were great and fine and dandy until you found that you were stuck with them until Ryan Seacrest said you could go. If you don’t go out at all — well, this is why they coined the term FOMO. When you get down to it, nothing about a “holiday for adults” sounds particularly fun. Adulthood, generally, is not tremendous fun, which is why alcohol is so necessary. Drinking can be almost as much fun as fun. And New Year’s Eve is no exception to this rule. We so badly want it to be fun that we drink until it is. The day after New Year’s Eve is when searches for hangover cures hit their highest point of the year. The other problem with this holiday is that we still can’t shake the notion, somehow, that New Year’s Eve should be fun. Maybe if we went to a hipper party, instead of just watching Ryan Seacrest tell America the time, as Oliver so eloquently put it. Maybe if we went and stood in Times Square. Maybe if I went to a different house party. Maybe if I went to a different Hip Happening Club. Maybe if I just stayed in and watched Netflix. Surely there’s a way that a good time could be managed. Hope. That’s the problem. That’s what makes it so bad. Alexandra Petri writes the ComPost blog, offering a lighter take on the news and opinions of the day.

Harold is given a low-paying job at the firm's bookeeper.Jumping forward 22 years to 1945, Harold (still working in his boring job as bookkeeper) is promptly let go by Waggleberry with nothing but a tiny pension of around 1,000.

There is more opportunities for work in larger cities than in small towns because the","output":"population is denser, diverse industries are established and thriving, and they are often the hubs for innovation and cultural exchanges. These factors create a more dynamic and sustainable environment for job seekers, professionals, and entrepreneurs alike. In larger cities, the concentration of people and businesses is significantly higher. This increased population density generates a greater demand for both essential and non-essential services. Consequently, companies in various industries such as retail, healthcare, education, finance, and entertainment, among others, tend to establish a presence in these urban areas to tap into the vast market of potential customers. This robust economy helps create more job openings to cater to the growing needs of the city. Another reason why there are more opportunities for work in larger cities is the presence of diverse industries and sectors. Small towns may have a limited number of industries or rely heavily on a single industry, making the job market quite narrow and restrictive. In contrast, larger cities offer a wide range of job opportunities across multiple sectors, from entry-level positions to higher-level executive roles. Having an assortment of industries in the city invites people with varying skill sets and expertise to find their niche, thus facilitating a more inclusive job market. The bustling environment of urban centers frequently attracts multinational corporations and new startups, providing an increased number of opportunities for professionals seeking upward mobility and career growth. Given the surrounding competition, companies are motivated to invest in employee training and professional development, leading to further skill enhancement and increased chances of promotions and lateral moves. Large cities are also epicenters for technological advancements, research, and innovation. Global businesses often have their headquarters in major cities, drawing in talented individuals from all over the world. This influx of talent results in a melting pot of different ideas and perspectives that promote creativity, foster innovation, and drive economic growth. The presence of top universities and research institutions in bigger cities lays the foundation for collaborative efforts between academia and the private sector. These partnerships result in cutting-edge research, advancements in technology, and the establishment of innovative companies, further fueling the city's thriving job market. Cultural exchanges are also an integral part of large cities, where global events, international conferences, art exhibitions, and entertainment programs take place. These events attract tourists and professionals from diverse backgrounds, presenting numerous opportunities for businesses to flourish and job vacancies to arise in the hospitality, arts, and events management sectors, among others. In conclusion, larger cities offer more opportunities for work because of factors such as higher population density, the presence of diverse industries, and being hubs for innovation and cultural exchanges. The dynamic and fast-paced environment of urban centers fosters economic growth and sustainability, providing a wider array of job opportunities for people with different skills and aspirations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Available choices:  1). negative.  2). positive.","output":"In order to analyze and predict the sentiment of the tweet in question, we must first break down its elements and assess the context. The tweet reads: \\"@pappe_it_is yeah yeah... sure sure.. I'm coming.\\"  Let's break down the tweet: - The tweet is addressed to another user, \\"@pappe_it_is\\", indicating a conversational nature. - The repetition of \\"yeah yeah\\" and \\"sure sure\\" can imply varying sentiments and tones depending on the context. In some cases, this could be enthusiastic; in others, it might be sarcastic, indicating that the tweeter is not entirely on board with what's being discussed. - The closing statement, \\"I'm coming\\", suggests that the tweeter will be attending or joining an event, a plan, or a gathering. Considering the tweet's elements, it would be reasonable to predict the sentiment as follows: 1). Negative: If the repetition of \\"yeah yeah\\" and \\"sure sure\\" is interpreted as sarcasm, it implies that the tweeter might be unenthusiastic about the said event or plan. In this case, the sentiment behind the tweet can be construed as negative. This interpretation suggests reluctance in joining or attending the event, and the tweeter might only be complying due to external pressures or expectations. 2). Positive: Conversely, if the repetition of \\"yeah yeah\\" and \\"sure sure\\" is interpreted as genuine enthusiasm, the tweet's sentiment can be seen as positive. In this scenario, the user is excited about or looking forward to the event and is on board with the plan.  Given the ambiguity surrounding the interpretation of the tweet, it is challenging to definitively predict the sentiment as either negative or positive. The tone and intention behind the tweet are unclear without additional context or knowledge of the tweeter's personality and the broader conversation. Therefore, a definitive answer cannot be provided, but the possibilities for both negative and positive sentiments can be inferred based on the textual analysis outlined above."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Former President Bill Clinton later spoke at a concert in the city. Hurricane Katrina killed nearly 2,000 people and displaced one million. It was the most expensive natural disaster in US history and caused destruction along the Gulf coast. In New Orleans, the failure of the levee system left about 80% of the city under water. Mayor Landrieu led a sombre tribute to the 83 unidentified victims whose bodies lie in mausoleums at the city's Hurricane Katrina Memorial. \\"Though they are unnamed, they are not unclaimed because we claim them,\\" he said. \\"We saved each other,\\" the mayor added. \\"New Orleans will be unbowed and unbroken.\\" Residents and community activists also gathered at the levee in the Lower Ninth Ward, where storm waters broke through and flooded the district. At the scene: BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC correspondent Today the sun shone brightly in New Orleans. A decade ago Hurricane Katrina brought havoc to these same skies. The city's Lower Ninth Ward was hit the hardest - at a wreath laying ceremony for victims there, some found the memories too hard to bear. As a solitary trumpet played in honour of the dead, one woman wailed uncontrollably. Everyone felt her pain. But New Orleans is famous for its party spirit - and the day was also about moving forward. Large parts of the city have been rebuilt. But as marching bands paraded past abandoned homes untouched since the storm sucked the humanity from them, many told me much more needs to be done. Katrina stole lives and homes, but not the city's heartbeat. As the world looks on a decade later, people in New Orleans, and across the country's Gulf Coast, want to ensure they're never forgotten. The Hurricane Station - the radio Katrina could not silence After speeches, a parade took place through the neighbourhood, with some participants in colourful Mardi Gras dress. \\"It is kind of bittersweet. We want to celebrate because we are still here, but a lot of people are not,\\" said Lower Ninth Ward resident Natasha Green, 36. \\"It is important to remember what we went through here.\\" Throughout the day, thousands took part in traditional musical parades through the city's streets. Former President Clinton later spoke at a free concert at the city's Smoothie King Center. He said the sheer magnitude of what had been accomplished in rebuilding the city should not be underestimated, but that more work needed to be done so that the lines that divided communities - such as race and wealth - could be erased. A ceremony was also held at the Superdome arena that housed thousands of displaced people after the storm. President Barack Obama visited the Lower Ninth Ward on Thursday, praising \\"the extraordinary resilience of this city and its people\\". But although the city has largely recovered from the disaster, some - particularly from the African-American community - feel left behind. Dwight McKenna, publisher of African-American newspaper the New Orleans Tribune, told the BBC that rebuilt public housing projects were now too expensive for many poor black people to move back to. \\"The population of New Orleans... is 100,000 less black people than prior to Katrina. Black people have been left out of the recovery altogether,\\" he said. On Friday, another former President, George W Bush, visited New Orleans. His administration was criticised at the time over its slow response and the issue remains a source of deep resentment in the city. In a speech, he said he would never forget the images of \\"misery and ruin\\". Neighbouring Mississippi was also marking the anniversary and on Saturday morning church bells rang out across coastal Hancock County. In Biloxi, a memorial to Katrina's victims was held at a newly built Minor League Baseball park which will later host a concert.

Analyzing the first question: \\"How does a fiction book differ from a non-fiction book?\\" This question focuses on the differences between fiction and non-fiction books. To address this, I will first explain what fiction and non-fiction are in general and afterward, provide the key points that differentiate the two categories. Fiction: - Fiction books are literary works that are based on the author's imagination. - They often have invented characters and plots, can be set in imaginary worlds, and may have supernatural elements. - Examples include novels, short stories, and poetry. Non-fiction: - Non-fiction books are based on facts and real-life events. - They provide information or tell true stories. - Examples include biographies, autobiographies, history books, scientific texts, and self-help books. Key differences: - Fiction is imaginative and creative, while non-fiction is fact-based and informative. - Fiction has invented characters and plotlines, while non-fiction is about real people and events. 2. Analyzing the second question: \\"What's the difference between non-fiction and fiction?\\" The second question basically asks the same thing as the first one: the differences between fiction and non-fiction.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"Before we dive into comparing the given solutions, let me first outline a detailed procedure for cleaning old metal fixtures: 1. Identify the type of metal: Determine the type of metal being dealt with, as the cleaning method can vary depending on whether it is brass, bronze, chrome, copper, iron, or another metal. In some cases, a magnet can be helpful: Brass, aluminum, copper, and bronze are non-magnetic, while iron and steel are magnetic. 2. Gather cleaning materials: Ensure you have necessary cleaning materials based on the type of metal. These may include mild dish soap, old toothbrush, soft cloth, vinegar, baking soda, lemon juice, salt, and specialized metal cleaners or polishes. 3. Put on protective gear: To protect your skin from any potential irritants, wear gloves, and use goggles if working with any chemical cleaning agents. 4. Dry clean the surface: Use a dry cloth or soft brush to remove loose dirt and dust from the fixture. 5. Prepare a mild soapy solution or a homemade cleaning solution: Fill a container with warm water and add a few drops of mild dish soap or prepare a homemade cleaning solution based on the type of metal. For example, brass may require a mixture of equal parts vinegar and flour, while chrome fixtures can be cleaned using soapy water or a vinegar solution. 6. Test the cleaning solution in an inconspicuous area: To avoid any damage, try the cleaning solution on a small, hidden area of the metal fixture to ensure the solution does not harm the material. 7. Apply the cleaning solution: Using a soft cloth, old toothbrush, or sponge, gently scrub the fixture with the appropriate cleaning solution in circular motions. For deep crevices and intricate designs, use the toothbrush to reach all areas. 8. Rinse the fixture: Use a cloth dampened with clean water to remove any cleaning solution residue. 9. Dry the fixture: Quickly and thoroughly dry the fixture using a clean, soft cloth. This step is crucial to prevent water spots or accelerated tarnishing. 10. Polish the fixture: Depending on the type of metal, use a specialized metal polish or a homemade polish, such as a mixture of lemon juice and baking soda for copper. Apply the polish with a soft cloth and buff away any excess using a clean, soft cloth.

Pascal Saint-Amans, who runs the OECD's Centre for Tax Policy, said that new standards would require companies to pay more tax in the countries where they sold goods or created revenues. He also said companies should not use tax havens to shelter their profits. Mr Saint-Amans' intervention comes after years of complicated negotiations and endless summits on reforming the toxic issue of where large multi-national companies pay their taxes. He revealed that there should be international agreement on new tax laws ready for the G20 summit of global leaders in November. The implementation phase should then mean the rules are in place \\"well before\\" 2020. And, according to Mr Saint-Amans, that should mean technology companies such as Facebook, Apple and Google paying more tax to the UK Treasury. They will also be required to pay more tax in a number of other countries and publish, country-by-country, how much they pay. The UK has already agreed new rules on the taxation of multi-nationals - called the \\"diverted profits tax\\". The government predicts that companies such as Google - operating in the UK but paying tax in other jurisdictions - will already be obliged to pay hundreds of millions of pounds more tax in Britain. Mr Saint-Amans agrees, and says that the UK rules will have to be \\"co-ordinated\\" with the OECD agreements. In his interview, Mr Saint-Amans is clear on what he thinks about technology giants which move profits around the world to gain preferable tax rates. \\"Most of these companies have been extremely aggressive, pushing the boundaries of what is legal,\\" he said. \\"They have tried schemes that cannot resist further examination by tax administrations. \\"My advice would be instead of focusing on tax planning, please do the wonderful job you are doing on innovation and be much more conservative on tax planning. \\"They have been extremely aggressive and that may have sounded unfair to the audience - that you have giants making billions in profits and not paying taxes where they operate.\\" The technology companies that have been targeted by tax campaigners say that they follow all the rules laid down by governments. What is obvious is that the modern world of global digital companies has left national tax systems struggling. Although much of the revenue for these firms may be created in a country such as the UK, the intellectual property (the profitable bit) is actually based elsewhere, often the US, and the \\"sales\\" undertaken in a more favourable tax location such as Ireland, the Netherlands or Luxembourg. That leaves the national \\"marketplace\\" without much tax to collect. \\"The marketplaces should have something,\\" Mr Saint- Amans said. \\"They have been left with hardly anything. I think it is changing through the project we are conducting. \\"[We will be asking multi-nationals] where is your turnover, where are your profits, where are your employees, where do you pay your taxes? This information will be collected by all the countries - that is a game changer.\\" The technology companies say that it is for governments to decide how they tax businesses, not them, and that they have not broken tax rules. That is an opinion Mr Saint-Amans has some sympathy with. I ask him whether the problem has actually been created by the policymakers rather than the companies themselves. \\"You are 100% right,\\" he replied. \\"The blame should be put on governments which have over the past 20 years let the rules shift away from what should have been achieved. \\"We didn't update the rules. We unfortunately needed a crisis to have this wake-up call to say we need to change because it is outdated. \\"Now, governments have decided to move. It shows that when you have political support you can achieve technical changes.\\" The rules were originally put in place in the 1920s to stop \\"double taxation\\" of companies operating in different countries and encourage businesses to invest internationally. \\"We have moved from a world where we were so good at eliminating double taxation with tax treaties and transfer pricing rules that we have facilitated double non-taxation. \\"You have rules, they are bilateral, but businesses are global. And of course they can play on the differences between the sovereignties, or the gaps. And where are the gaps? In tax havens. \\"So what we need to do is fix the rules and develop better co-operation. And if we do that we put an end to double non-taxation. \\"[But] we need to be balanced. Double taxation is bad [and] multiple taxation is worse because that will harm cross-border investment. And that is what we need, for growth and for employment.\\" The OECD says that tax competition to encourage investment is fine. Smaller countries such as Ireland and larger countries such as the UK, with low corporation tax rates, have used it to their advantage. \\"The problem we face today is not the low rate in Ireland, or the low rate in the UK,\\" Mr Saint-Amans said. \\"It is the fact that you have 2trn of accumulated profit of US companies located where? In Bermuda or the Cayman Islands - there is no activity there.\\" And that has to stop? \\"Absolutely.\\" What is a summary of this text?","output":"Pascal Saint-Amans, the head of the OECD's Centre for Tax Policy, stated that technology giants like Facebook, Apple, and Google should pay more tax in countries where they generate revenue.

Some have called it the most influential show in the history of television. American Idol has been extremely successful in the country since 2002. The show was number one for six years! The most popular episode had nearly 38 million _ . But why is the show so popular? The idea of the show is this: everyday people get a chance to show their singing talents to the world and become an \\"American Idol\\", a famous pop star. Anyone in the country(between the ages of 15 and 28) can have a try--a chance of becoming world famous. In fact, everyday people are the ones who are allowed on the show. If you are a professional singer--you cannot be an American Idol. The winners are regular people from small towns--people who sang in churches or bars but had bigger dreams. The winners of the contest don't get a prize of money. Instead, they get to record an album. Famous stars such as Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood gained fame  from winning the show. So, it seems the contest really works. It is the idea that anyone can be a super star that draws people to this program. All those hours of practicing in front of the mirror could lead to fame and fortune .Even you could be the next \\"American Idol\\". ,. Question: What does the story mainly tell us about? - How US kids spend their spare time. - Why the American Idol show is so popular. - What America's most successful show is. - How the American Idol show creates pop stars. Answer:","output":"The story mainly tells us about why the American Idol show is so popular. It elaborates on how the show gives the typical citizens, aged between 15 and 28, an opportunity to showcase their singing abilities and the potential to become famous pop stars. The winners get a chance to record their own album instead of a money prize, thereby offering them a platform to embark on a successful music career. A testament to this is the fact that famous stars such as Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood emerged from the show. The show's popularity stems from the idea that anyone can become a superstar."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Harold Adams Innis (; November 5, 1894 - November 8, 1952) was a Canadian professor of political economy at the University of Toronto and the author of seminal works on media, communication theory, and Canadian economic history. Despite his dense and difficult prose, Innis was one of Canada's most original thinkers. He helped develop the staples thesis, which holds that Canada's culture, political history, and economy have been decisively influenced by the exploitation and export of a series of \\"staples\\" such as fur, fishing, lumber, wheat, mined metals, and coal. Harold Innis wrote his PhD thesis on the history of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The completion of Canada's first transcontinental railway in 1885 had been a defining moment in Canadian history. Innis's thesis, eventually published as a book in 1923, can be seen as an early attempt to document the railway's significance from an economic historian's point of view. It uses voluminous statistics to underpin its arguments. Innis maintains that the difficult and expensive construction project was sustained by fears of American annexation of the Canadian West.  Innis argues that \\"the history of the Canadian Pacific Railroad is primarily the history of the spread of Western civilization over the northern half of the North American continent\\". As Robert Babe notes, the railway brought industrialization, transporting coal and building supplies to manufacturing sites. It was also a kind of communications medium that contributed to the spread of European civilization. Babe writes that, for Innis, the CPR's equipment \\"comprised a massive, energy-consuming, fast-moving, powerful, capital-intensive 'sign' dropped into the very midst of indigenous peoples, whose entire way of life was disrupted, and eventually shattered as a result.  Communications scholar Arthur Kroker argues that Innis's study of the Canadian Pacific Railway was only the first in which he attempted to demonstrate that \\"technology is not something external to Canadian being; but on the contrary, is the necessary condition and lasting consequence of Canadian existence\\". It also reflected Innis's lifelong interest in the exercise of economic and political power. His CPR history ends, for example, with a recounting of Western grievances against economic policies, such as high freight rates and the steep import tariffs designed to protect fledgling Canadian manufacturers. Westerners complained that this National Policy funnelled money from Prairie farmers into the pockets of the Eastern business establishment. \\"Western Canada\\", Innis wrote, \\"has paid for the development of Canadian nationality, and it would appear that it must continue to pay. The acquisitiveness of Eastern Canada shows little sign of abatement.\\" Entity:","output":"This text is about Harold Adams Innis, a Canadian professor and author known for his works on media, communication theory, and Canadian economic history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.  - Slanted and Enchanted is the debut studio album by American indie rock band Pavement, released in April 1992 on Matador Records.  - Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain is the second studio album by American indie rock band Pavement.

It was developed first by Commodore International and introduced with the launch of the first Amiga, the Amiga 1000, in 1985. Early versions of AmigaOS required the Motorola 68000 series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors. Later versions were developed by Haage & Partner (AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9) and then Hyperion Entertainment (AmigaOS 4.0-4.1). A PowerPC microprocessor is required for the most recent release, AmigaOS 4.  - A type-in program, type-in game or just type-in, is a computer program listing of source code printed in a computer magazine or book, meant to be typed in on the computer's keyboard by the reader in order to run the program.  - A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system.  - In computing, source code is any collection of computer instructions, possibly with comments, written using a human-readable programming language, usually as ordinary text. The source code of a program is specially designed to facilitate the work of computer programmers, who specify the actions to be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code. The source code is often transformed by an assembler or compiler into binary machine code understood by the computer. The machine code might then be stored for execution at a later time. Alternatively, source code may be interpreted and thus immediately executed.  - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.  - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - Guinness World Records, known from its inception in 1955 until 1998 as The Guinness Book of Records and in previous U.S. editions as The Guinness Book of World Records, is a reference book published annually, listing world records and national records, both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time. As of the 2017 edition, it is now in its 63rd year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages. The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in \\"Guinness World Records\\" becoming the primary international authority on the cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records; the organisation employs official record adjudicators authorised to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records.  - Ahoy ! was a magazine published between January 1984 and January 1989 that focused on all Commodore International color computers , but especially the Commodore 64 and Amiga . It was noted for the quality and learnability of its type - in program listings .  - The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by Commodore in the 1980s and 1990s. Based on the Motorola 68000 family of microprocessors, the machine has a custom chipset with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from earlier 8-bit home computers, including Commodore's own C64.  - The Motorola 68000 (\\"'sixty-eight-thousand'\\"; also called the m68k or Motorola 68k, \\"\\"sixty-eight-kay\\"\\") is a 32-bit CISC microprocessor with a 16-bit external data bus, designed and marketed by Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector (later Freescale Semiconductor, now NXP). Introduced in 1979 with HMOS technology as the first member of the successful 32-bit m68k family of microprocessors, it is generally software forward compatible with the rest of the line despite being limited to a 16-bit wide external bus. After 37 years in production, the 68000 architecture is still in use.  - Commodore International (or Commodore International Limited) was a North American home computer and electronics manufacturer. Commodore International (CI), along with its subsidiary Commodore Business Machines (CBM), participated in the development of the homepersonal computer industry in the 1970s and 1980s. The company developed and marketed one of the world's best-selling desktop computers, the Commodore 64 (1982) and released its Amiga computer line in July 1985.  - The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64 in Sweden, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Vitamins Found to Curb Exercise Benefits The body has its own defense system for combating oxidative damage, but it does not always do enough. So antioxidants, which mop up the reactive oxygen compounds, may seem like a logical solution. The researchers, led by Dr. Michael Ristow, a nutritionist at the University of Jena in Germany, tested this proposition by having young men exercise, giving half of them moderate doses of vitamins C and E and measuring sensitivity to insulin as well as indicators of the body’s natural defenses to oxidative damage. The Jena team found that in the group taking the vitamins there was no improvement in insulin sensitivity and almost no activation of the body’s natural defense mechanism against oxidative damage. The reason, they suggest, is that the reactive oxygen compounds, inevitable byproducts of exercise, are a natural trigger for both of these responses. The vitamins, by efficiently destroying the reactive oxygen, short-circuit the body’s natural response to exercise. “If you exercise to promote health, you shouldn’t take large amounts of antioxidants,” Dr. Ristow said. A second message of the study, he said, “is that antioxidants in general cause certain effects that inhibit otherwise positive effects of exercise, dieting and other interventions.” The findings appear in this week’s issue of The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The effect of vitamins on exercise and glucose metabolism “is really quite significant,” said Dr. C. Ronald Kahn of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, a co-author of the report. “If people are trying to exercise, this is blocking the effects of insulin on the metabolic response.” The advice does not apply to fruits and vegetables, Dr. Ristow said; even though they are high in antioxidants, the many other substances they contain presumably outweigh any negative effect. Dr. Kahn said it might be that reactive oxygen is beneficial in small doses, because it touches off the body’s natural defense system, but harmful in higher doses. Andrew Shao of the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade association of dietary supplement makers, said the new study was well designed but was just one bit of evidence in a complex issue. Most available evidence points to the opposite conclusion, that antioxidants benefit health by reducing oxidative stress, he said. “I wouldn’t change recommendations for anyone based on one study,” he said. “This is one small piece of the puzzle.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: Vitamins Found to Curb Exercise Benefits. Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe","output":"This is about an experiment where some scientists wanted to see if taking vitamins C and E would help people who exercise. They found out that the vitamins didn't help, and they might even stop some of the good things that happen when you exercise.  It's important to remember that this study is just one piece of information and more research is needed. But it does make us think about whether or not we should take big amounts of antioxidant vitamins when we exercise. The good news is that eating fruits and vegetables with antioxidants is still a great idea because they have many other healthy things in them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Warm weather occurs happens, how will it affect The air gets warm.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you proposed states that warm weather occurs instead of the air getting cold. This would indeed have a direct effect on the snow formation process you described. Let's analyze the impact of warm air on each step of the process: 1. Water evaporates from the ground up to the sky: Warm air can actually increase the rate of evaporation as it can hold more water vapor than cold air. So, in this case, the process of evaporation might be accelerated with warm weather. 2. Water droplets are in clouds: The presence of warm air would not necessarily hinder the formation of clouds, as it relies on the balance of upward and downward air movement (convection). However, the type and altitude of clouds may change due to the warmer temperature. 3. The air gets cold: In the perturbation hypothesis, \\"the air gets warm\\" instead of cold. This directly contrasts the original process, which affects the rest of the sequence. 4. Water droplets turn into ice crystals: Since the air is warm in the perturbation hypothesis, water droplets are less likely to turn into ice crystals. They would remain in a liquid state as the air temperature would not be low enough to cause the phase change from liquid to solid. 5. Ice crystals in clouds stick together and become snowflakes: With the absence of ice crystals due to the warm air, there would be no formation of snowflakes. This stage of the process would not occur when warm weather is present. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of warm weather occurring would have a significant direct effect on the snow formation process. It would prevent the formation of ice crystals and snowflakes, leading to different precipitation types such as rain or drizzle rather than snow."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Thus, it's important to know how much your thumb covers at arm's length. The actual width of your thumb doesn't matter, but the angle it covers does.    a. Find an object of known width - such as a ruler or a building with a known width.    b. Stand at a known distance from the object (try standing 10 meters away).    c. Extend your arm fully and place your thumb vertically, in such a way that the side of your thumb is covering the object.    d. If your thumb completely covers the object, it covers 1-degree angle. If it covers more or less, try adjusting the distance until it matches 1-degree. Remember the adjusted known distance as your calibration point. 2. Identify the object you want to measure the distance to: Once you've established your calibration point, locate the object you're trying to estimate the distance to. For example, it could be a car, house, bus stop, or tree. 3. Align your thumb: Extend your arm fully and place your thumb vertically, aligning it so that the side of your thumb is covering the object you've identified. 4. Close one eye: Close your non-dominant eye, while keeping your dominant eye open. This will help you focus on the object behind your thumb and avoid confusion. 5. Estimate the angle: Remembering your calibration point, estimate the angle in degrees that your thumb covers. For example, if your thumb at a 10 meter distance covers 1-degree, and the object you're measuring extends exactly twice the width of your thumb, the angle covered is about 2 degrees. 6. Apply the distance formula: To roughly estimate the distance, multiply the object's actual width by the known distance from your calibration point, and then divide by your thumb's width in the same unit. Let's say you're estimating the distance to a car and you know that the car is 1.8 meters wide. If your thumb covers 1-degree at 10 meters, the formula would look like this:    Distance = (Object Width x Known Distance) / Thumb Width    Distance = (1.8 meters x 10 meters) / 0.18 meters = 100 meters 7. Consider potential sources of error: Due to parallax, using your thumb and eyes to estimate distance is a rough approximation and may not provide completely accurate results, but it's a useful skill for gaining a general idea of an object's distance. Factors such as object familiarity, environmental conditions, and subjective biases may also affect your measurements. 8. Practice and refine: As with any skill, practice will improve your ability to estimate distances using your thumb and eyes. You could practice on various distances and objects, but make sure you maintain your calibration point. By following these steps, you can quickly gain a rough idea of the distance between you and an object using only your thumb and eyes. It may not be as precise as using a measuring tape or a rangefinder, but it's a useful skill for general distance estimations in everyday situations or outdoor activities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Information:  - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.  - Strømmens Værksted A/S was an industrial company based in Skedsmo, Norway, specializing in the production of rolling stock. Founded in 1873, it remains as a part of Bombardier Transportation. The plant is located just off Hovedbanen west of Strømmen Station.  - The term rolling stock originally referred to any vehicles that move on a railway. It has since expanded to include the wheeled vehicles used by businesses on roadways. It usually includes both powered and unpowered vehicles, for example locomotives, railroad cars, coaches, and wagons.  - A tram (also known as tramcar; and in North America known as streetcar, trolley or trolley car) is a rail vehicle which runs on tracks along public urban streets, and also sometimes on a segregated right of way. The lines or networks operated by tramcars are called tramways. Tramways powered by electricity, the most common type historically, were once called electric street railways (mainly in the USA). However, trams were widely used in urban areas before the universal adoption of electrification; other methods of powering trams are listed below under \\"History\\".  - Skedsmo is a municipality in Akershus county, Norway. It is part of the traditional region of Romerike. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Lillestrøm. About one third of the municipal population lives in Lillestrøm. Other important towns are Skedsmokorset, Skjetten and Strømmen. A smaller settlement adjoining Lillestrøm is Kjeller.  - Strømmen Station is a railway station on the Trunk Line in Skedsmo, Norway. It is served by the Oslo Commuter Rail line 400 operated by Norwegian State Railways running from Lillestrøm via Oslo S to Asker. The station was opened in 1854 along with the rest of the Trunk Line.  - Trondheim Bilruter or TBR was a municipally owned bus company in Trondheim, Norway between 1951 and 1974. It was merged with the tram operators Trondheim Sporvei and A/S Graakalbanen in 1974 to form Trondheim Trafikkselskap. It is now part of Team Trafikk, a subsidiary of Nettbuss.  - Bombardier Transportation is the rail equipment division of the Canadian firm Bombardier Inc. Bombardier Transportation is one of the world's largest companies in the rail vehicle and equipment manufacturing and servicing industry. The division is headquartered in Berlin, Germany, and has regional offices and major development facilities in Canada (Montreal and Toronto) and the United States (Plattsburgh, New York). Bombardier Transportation has many minor production and development facilities worldwide.  - Nettbuss AS is the largest bus company in Norway, owned by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). It was established on 10 February 2000 as the continuation of the bus operations from former NSB Biltrafikk. In addition to bus services in major parts of Norway, it also operates buses in Sweden through subsidiaries.  - Trondheim Sporvei was a municipally owned tram operator in Trondheim, Norway that existed between 1936 and 1974. The company operated the municipal parts of the Trondheim Tramway until it was merged with A/S Graakalbanen and Trondheim Bilruter to create Trondheim Trafikkselskap. That company has become part of Nettbuss, the largest Norwegian bus company in Norway which is owned by Norwegian State Railways (\\"Norges Statsbaner AS\\").  - The Trondheim Tramway in Trondheim, Norway, is the world's most northerly tramway system, following the closure and dismantling of the Arkhangelsk tramways in Russia. It consists of one 8.8-km-long line, the Gråkallen Line, running from St. Olav's Gate in the city centre through Byåsen to Lian Station in Bymarka.  - TS Class 6 was a series of 28 trams and 15 trailers built by Strømmens Værksted for Trondheim Sporvei . They were delivered in two slightly different batches ; ten in 1948 -- 49 and six in 1955 . On 10 October 1956 , almost all operative trams used by the company were lost to the flames . Subsequently , Trondheim Sporvei ordered the Class 6 from Strømmen . Five engines were salvaged from the fire , and were reused in trams 1 through 5 . The remaining deliveries were numbered 10 -- 32 . The trams delivered with new motors , had four NEBB motors with a power output of 43 kW ( 58 hp ) . The Class 6 remained in service until 1984 , when the Class 8 was delivered . Until then , the Class 7 served as the only tram on the Trondheim Tramway . Four trams and one trailer have been preserved by the Trondheim Tramway Museum .  - Trondheim Trafikkselskap or TT was the city public transport company for Trondheim, Norway between 1974 and 2001. It operated both the city buses, and the Trondheim Tramway until 1988. The company was owned by the city council.  - Electrification is the process of powering by electricity and is usually associated with changing over from another power source. The broad meaning of the term, such as in the history of technology and economic history, usually applies to a region or national economy. Broadly speaking, electrification was the build out of the electrical generating and distribution systems which occurred in Britain, the United States, and other countries from the mid-1880s until around 1950 and is in progress in rural areas in some developing countries. This included the change over from line shaft and belt drive using steam engines and water power to electric motors.  - Norges Statsbaner AS, trading as NSB AS and known in English as the Norwegian State Railways, is a government-owned railway company which operates most passenger train services in Norway. Owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, it is also engaged in real estate through Rom Eiendom, bus transport through Nettbuss, cargo trains through CargoNet and Swedish train transport through Tågkompaniet. NSB transported 52 million train passengers and 104 million bus passengers in 2009. The current company was established on 1 December 1996, when the former Norwegian State Railways (18831996) was split into the new NSB, the infrastructure company the Norwegian National Rail Administration and the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate. In 2002 the freight operations were split to the subsidiary CargoNet, and the maintenance department became Mantena.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - Trondheim, historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Sør-Trøndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 187,353 (January 1, 2016), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area.

The roots of this slogan can be traced back to the mid-18th century when the British government started imposing a series of taxes on the American colonies to pay for their wars and to maintain their empire. Among the various taxes were the Sugar Act of 1764, Stamp Act of 1765, and Townshend Acts of 1767. The colonists saw these taxes as a violation of their rights since they had no elected representatives in the British Parliament who could voice their concerns and protect their interests. The phrase \\"No taxation without representation\\" gained popularity during the protests against the Stamp Act. This act required colonists to pay a tax on virtually every printed paper, including newspapers, legal documents, and even playing cards. The colonists vehemently opposed the act, arguing that the tax was a direct attempt by the British government to control their affairs without giving them any say in the matter. Colonial leaders like James Otis, Samuel Adams, and Patrick Henry used the slogan to rally support for their cause and to emphasize the importance of self-governance. In response to the colonists' demands for representation, Benjamin Franklin famously said, \\"It is suppos'd an undoubted Right of Englishmen not to be taxed but by their own consent, given thro' their representatives.\\" \\"No taxation without representation\\" soon became a unifying battle cry for the colonists in their struggle for independence. Protests, boycotts, and eventual armed conflict with the British authorities led to the formation of the Continental Congress, which declared the colonies' independence from Great Britain in 1776. Ultimately, the American War of Independence was fueled by this desire for self-governance and the principle of \\"No taxation without representation.\\" It paved the way for the creation of the United States of America, a new nation based on democratic ideals and the fundamental belief that citizens have the right to influence the decisions affecting their lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He might need our help, or perhaps he has important information for us.\\" The siblings nodded, and together they devised a plan to split into two small search parties. Peter and Susan would head east toward the Great River, while Edmund and Lucy ventured west into the dense forests surrounding the plains. They promised to regroup by nightfall at their original meeting spot. Before they set off, Peter pulled out a small, worn map of Narnia that he had safely tucked in his pocket. \\"We'll cover more ground this way,\\" he explained, tracing his finger along the terrain, marking their route. \\"We must stay diligent and keep a sharp eye out for any clues or signs that Aslan might have left behind.\\" As each group headed in their respective directions, with apprehensive hearts and the weight of uncertainty heavy on their shoulders, their quest to find their beloved Aslan began. Peter and Susan braved the rugged terrain along the eastern bank of the Great River, combing through the tall grasses and calling out Aslan's name. Their voices would frequently ring loud and clear across the valleys and hills, but the only response was a sorrowful silence that haunted the air. As the hours wore on, their search continued to prove fruitless, yet their determination remained as strong as ever. On the western front, Edmund and Lucy trekked through the shadowed forests with the eerie, lingering fog obscuring their path. The gnarled branches above formed a thick canopy, casting a cool darkness over their search. It was disheartening when the whispers of their cries for Aslan were absorbed by the encroaching cedars and pines. Time was ticking away, but they refused to give up on the hope that they would eventually find him. Night arrived, and the echoing call of nightingales accompanied the weary, hoarse voices of the siblings as they prepared to regroup. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy all stood by their word and returned to the agreed meeting spot at the day's end, their faces etched with exhaustion and despair. \\"We had no luck,\\" Peter admitted, his voice heavy with defeat. \\"Did you find any traces of him in the forest?\\" Edmund shook his head solemnly. \\"Not a single sign. What do we do now?\\" Lucy's resolve remained steadfast, her eyes glimmering in the fading light. \\"We continue searching. Aslan wouldn't abandon us, and we won't abandon him.\\" In that moment, the siblings embraced one another, their spirits mutually strengthened by a fierce determination to find their lost friend. As they huddled together, they resolved to continue their search into the following day, knowing that their unwavering loyalty and courage would see them through this dark chapter in the history of Narnia. Their voices may have been hoarse, and the sound of Caspian's horn seemed to dissipate into the night, but their determination did not falter. Their love for Aslan and their duty to protect Narnia drove them onwards, and with the rise of the sun the following day, the siblings began their search anew, driven by the hope that they would soon be reunited with their beloved Aslan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course.

Fun ignites passion, and people will work harder for you if they're having fun on the job, Jennings said. The activity should bring out the team members' passions. She recalls a yoga challenge on a cruise ship, where employees had to respond to questions about their company through yoga poses. 7. Try unusual activities. Jennings suggested activities that are \\"wacky and special,\\" since those get employees talking and laughing. She designed an exercise where a CEO and a janitor teamed together to build a race car out of fruits and vegetables. \\"You have a reason to connect with the person in the future, since you did it during the exercise,\\" she said. (Read more: 5 ways to prep your business for a sale in 2014) 8. Give thanks. Halley Bock, CEO and president of Fierce, said office workers don't spend enough time appreciating one another. A particularly effective exercise requires each individual to sit at the front of the room in a chair for two minutes and listen to compliments from fellow team members, saying nothing but thank you in response. Instead of hollow expressions, like, \\"You're fun,\\" they need to be specific, like, \\"I appreciate the way you greet me every morning. You really start my day off well.\\" The person gets to hear how they're unique, and it provides an opportunity for fellow team members to give positive feedback and ensure that it's heard. \\"[This] can energize and tighten the fabric of a team, resulting in higher engagement,\\" Bock said. And the more employees are energized and engaged, the more likely they are to be productive. 9. Build trust. The most effective activities are those where people have to work interdependently and rely on each other in order to achieve the outcome, said Beth Bechky, a professor of management and organizations at the New York University Stern School of Business. One of her favorite exercises is to have teams build tents together blindfolded. It's a good task, she said, because they realize it's only possible to do this as a team, and they have to rely on each other in intimate ways. (Read more: How a solo business can make a million) 10. Take risks. Ron Roberts, president of Action Centered Training, often uses whitewater rafting or paintball, since they \\"push employees so far outside of their comfort zone that they have to adapt.\\" In one game, 25 to 50 executives at a company played against 10 highly trained expert paintball judges. The judges soundly beat the executives in the first two rounds, resulting in a disgruntled president whose pride was wounded. Ultimately, though, he and the other executives agreed to listen to suggestions on how to improve and ultimately won the third round. \\"Ego is a false sense of self that makes us think we can do everything. And it can destroy organizations,\\" so the humbling exercise was helpful to this company, Roberts said. 11. Set a charitable goal. Charitable team building is on the rise, whether it's helping to build bikes for low-income children or sending supplies to troops overseas. \\"It shows you can compete and think of others at the same time,\\" which is a critical skill set for leaders, Roberts said. Goldstein recalled one of his company's exercises, during which employees worked together to make teddy bears for children with Down's syndrome. To their surprise, the children arrived to accept the teddy bears. \\"If you make everyone in the room cry, you've done a good job,\\" Goldstein said. —By Julie Halpert, Special to CNBC.com What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses 11 ways to build an all-star team by fostering a positive work environment, promoting teamwork, and encouraging personal growth.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The Spice Girls are an English pop girl group formed in 1994. The group originally consisted of Melanie Brown (\\"Scary Spice\\"), Melanie Chisholm (\\"Sporty Spice\\"), Emma Bunton (\\"Baby Spice\\"), Geri Halliwell (\\"Ginger Spice\\"), and Victoria Beckham, nee Adams (\\"Posh Spice\\"). They were signed to Virgin Records and released their debut single \\"Wannabe\\" in 1996, which hit number one in 37 countries and established them as a global phenomenon. Their debut album Spice sold more than 31 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in history. While on tour in the United-States, the group continued to record new material and released a new song, \\"Goodbye\\", before Christmas in 1998. The song was seen as a tribute to Geri Halliwell, and when it topped the UK Singles Chart it became their third consecutive Christmas number-one - equalling the record previously set by the Beatles. Later in 1998, Bunton and Chisholm appeared at the 1998 MTV Europe Music Awards without their other band members, and the group won two awards: \\"Best Pop Act\\" and \\"Best Group\\" for a second time. In late 1998, Brown and Adams announced they were both pregnant; Brown was married to dancer Jimmy Gulzer and became known as Mel G for a brief period. She gave birth to daughter Phoenix Chi in February 1999. One month later, Adams gave birth to son Brooklyn, whose father was then Manchester United footballer David Beckham. Later that year, she married Beckham in a highly publicised wedding in Ireland.  The Spice Girls returned to the studio in August 1999, after an eight-month recording break to start work on their third and last studio album. The album's sound was initially more pop-influenced, similar to their first two albums, and included production from Eliot Kennedy. The album's sound took a mature direction when American producers like Rodney Jerkins, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis came on to collaborate with the group. In December 1999 they performed live for a UK-only tour, Christmas in Spiceworld, in London and Manchester, also showcasing new songs from the third album. During 1999, the group recorded the character Amneris' song \\"My Strongest Suit\\" in Elton John and Tim Rice's Aida, a concept album which would later go on to fuel the musical version of Verdi's Aida. The band performed again at the 2000 Brit Awards, where they received a Lifetime Achievement Award. Despite being at the event, Halliwell did not join her former bandmates on stage. In November 2000, the group released Forever. Sporting a new edgier R&B sound, the album received a lukewarm response from critics.  In the US, the album peaked at number thirty-nine on the Billboard 200 albums chart. In the UK, the album was released the same week as Westlife's Coast to Coast album and the chart battle was widely reported by the media, where Westlife won the battle reaching number one in the UK, leaving the Spice Girls at number two. The lead single from Forever, the double A-side \\"Holler\\"/\\"Let Love Lead the Way\\", became the group's ninth number one single in the UK. However the song failed to break onto the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart stateside, instead peaking at number seven on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles. \\"Holler\\" did peak at number thirty-one on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 2000. The only major performance of the lead single came at the MTV Europe Music Awards on 16 November 2000. In total, Forever achieved only a fraction of the success of its two best-selling predecessors, selling five million copies. In December 2000, the group unofficially announced that they were beginning an indefinite hiatus and would be concentrating on their solo careers in regards to their foreseeable future, although they pointed out that the group was not splitting.

Article: In the beginning stages of writing a book, you will want to organize your plot. It is okay to leave some room for movement when you begin writing, but writing your story without some road map rarely works out. The best place to start is with choosing a structure that works for you. Writing theory teaches that there are several classic structures, which most works fall into, but most are not mutually exclusive and can be combined. The two major structures are:  Act structure: The act structure, commonly associated with plays and film, can easily be applied to novels as well. This theory of structure states that stories do well when broken up into clearly identifiable sections. The normal number of sections is three though two and four are common. In the classic three-act structure, the first act introduces the main and secondary characters, the setting, the problem to be conquered, and often some background information (this act usually comprises roughly 25% of the story). The second act moves through and develops the conflict in the story, usually containing a plot point where the main character faces a major setback. This is the meat and potatoes of the story and usually comprises roughly 50% of the content. The third act is the conclusion, where the hero faces the villain and the story reaches its climax, followed by a rewarding or, at least, less exciting ending scene or series of scenes. Each of these acts can often be boiled down into three subsections, each with its own arch or mini-story. Monomyth or the Hero’s Journey: This theory of story structure was famously put forward by Joseph Campbell. It states that almost every story with a hero can be boiled down into one main series of archetypes. This begins with a hero who is called to adventure though s/he initially refuses the burden. The hero is given some aid before crossing from the world, s/he has always known into the adventure (where the hero feels lost and alone at first). The hero then undergoes a series of trials, during which they will often encounter helpers, at the end of which the hero goes through some significant personal change. The hero then confronts the main antagonist of the story and returns home, enriched with wisdom and treasure. You may want to think about what type of conflict you wish to have in your story. This can help you develop a plot, as well as lead you to other similar stories to gain inspiration. There are many theories about the types of conflict in stories, but the main sources are:  Man against nature: This is a story where your main character faces off against some natural phenomena. An example would be stories where the main character becomes lost in the wilderness or the antagonist is an animal. An example of this kind of story would be the film 127 Hours. Man against the supernatural: This is a story where your main character faces off against creatures like ghosts and demons, God himself, or other beings not of this world. The Shining is a good example of this type of conflict. Man against man: This is the most basic story conflict, where your main character faces off against another person. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is a classic example. Man against society: In this type, your main character faces off against the rules of a society or societal norms. An example would be the novel Fahrenheit 451. Man against self: This is a story where your main character faces off against his own inner demons or his own internal conflict. An example of this would be The Picture of Dorian Gray. Whether it is intentional or not, your story will end having a theme. This is what the story is about. Through writing about this theme, you will end making some statement about what you think on the topic. Think about the themes in your book or that could be in your book and what you want to say about them. This can help you develop a plot, through creating situations which present your ideas. Frank Herbert’s Dune (for example) is not about a guy trying to avenge his family. It’s about the perils of imperialism and Herbert makes it clear that he believes Western powers have become hopelessly entangled in a situation where they do not belong which they cannot hope to control. Plot points are turning points in your story, important events which change the course your character must take. You will need to plan what these will be and try to space them evenly. There is a plot point, which serves to convince your character that they must go on their adventure. This is a point at which all of your character’s plans for dealing with their problem go right out the window and then some climax which incites the final battle. Once you know where you are going and how you are going to get there, write down the whole thing. This will be your roadmap and is vital to a smooth writing process. Write down the basics of each scene, what purpose the scene serves, what characters are in the scene, where they are, what they are thinking and feeling, etc. Every minuscule detail of the sequence of events should also be written down for each scene. This is the best way to prevent crippling writer’s block, as you can still cover the basics of a scene, even if you may not feel that it is perfect.

(ii) Mary had inferior spiritual habits.","output":"(i) Maria had inferior spiritual habits. Maria had always been aware of her less-than-perfect spiritual habits. Often overwhelmed by the busy, modern world, she found it difficult to cultivate mindfulness and tranquility. Long hours at work, chaotic social life and the distractions of technology all took a toll on her mental well-being. Seeing Maria's struggles, Mary, an old-school, wise woman with years of spiritual practice under her belt, felt compelled to help her friend. Mary had spent years learning and practicing various forms of spirituality, including meditation, yoga, and prayer. She'd seen a profound transformation in herself – she'd grown more compassionate, patient and understanding over time. She wanted the same for Maria. Thus, Mary gently proposed the idea of mentoring Maria in her spiritual pursuits. Maria gratefully accepted, eager to cultivate a richer spiritual life. And so, Mary began to guide Maria through a well-crafted regimen of prayer and meditation. In the initial weeks, Mary introduced Maria to different types of meditation, including mindfulness, loving-kindness and transcendental meditation. She taught Maria the art of focusing on her breath and letting go of her thoughts as they arose, allowing her mind to unwind, easing her into a deep state of relaxation. Maria soon started noticing subtle changes – her patience was growing, and she felt a newfound peace within herself. Feeling encouraged by these moments of success, Maria and Mary moved on to exploring the power of prayer. Together, they would pray for guidance, strength, and clarity on their spiritual journey. Mary shared stories and teachings from various spiritual traditions and explained the significance of each prayer they performed. The background they get from these stories enriched Maria's understanding and appreciation of the prayers, helping her forge a more profound, personal connection with the Divine. As the weeks went by, Maria diligently practiced the techniques and lessons she learned from Mary. She began to implement these practices outside their sessions as well, learning to draw upon the tranquility she experienced during meditation when facing the challenges and stresses of her daily life. As a result, Maria's spiritual habits continued to grow and strengthen. Despite the occasional slip-ups and obstacles, Maria's dedication to her spiritual practice was unwavering. Over time, her once-inferior spiritual habits gave way to a growing understanding and appreciation of mindfulness, prayer, and self-reflection. Maria soon developed a robust and mature spiritual life. She and Mary continued to meet and share their progress with each other, bound together by their shared journey of self-discovery, growth and enlightenment. As the years went by, Maria gradually evolved into a wise, compassionate and loving individual, radiating a sense of peace that was visible to all who met her. Friends, family and strangers alike found themselves inspired by Maria's transformation, and many began to seek her guidance just as she once sought Mary's. Maria never forgot the kindness, patience, and wisdom Mary had shared with her, and she endeavored to pay it forward by helping others find their own path to spiritual fulfillment. Thanks to Mary's influence, Maria had turned her once-inferior spiritual habits into a powerful force for good in the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Who took the production of Sullivan's Patience to the Vienna Festival in 1975? , can you please find it?   The company, retaining the title \\"Sadler's Wells Opera\\", opened at the Coliseum on 21 August 1968, with a new production of Mozart's Don Giovanni, directed by Sir John Gielgud. Though this production was not well received, the company rapidly established itself with a succession of highly praised productions of other works. Arlen died in January 1972, and was succeeded as managing director by Lord Harewood.The success of the 1968 Mastersingers was followed in the 1970s by the company's first Ring cycle, conducted by Goodall, with a new translation by Andrew Porter and designs by Ralph Koltai.  The cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios. In Harewood's view, among the highlights of the first ten years at the Coliseum were the Ring, Prokofiev's War and Peace, and Richard Strauss's Salome and Der Rosenkavalier. The company's musical director from 1970 to 1977 was Charles Mackerras. Harewood praised his exceptional versatility, with a range \\"from The House of the Dead to Patience.\\" Among the operas he conducted for the company were Handel's Julius Caesar starring Janet Baker and Valerie Masterson; five Janáček operas; The Marriage of Figaro with pioneering use of 18th century performing style; Massenet's Werther; Donizetti's Mary Stuart with Baker; and Sullivan's Patience. The company took the production of the last to the Vienna Festival in 1975, along with Britten's Gloriana. Sir Charles Groves succeeded Mackerras as musical director from 1978 to 1979, but Groves was unwell and unhappy during his brief tenure. Starting in 1979, Mark Elder succeeded Groves in the post, and described Groves \\"immensely encouraging and supportive\\".A long-standing concern of Arlen and then Harewood was the need to change the company's name to reflect the fact that it was no longer based at Sadler's Wells theatre. Byam Shaw commented \\"The one major setback the Sadler's Wells Opera Company suffered from its transplant was that unheeding taxi drivers kept on taking their patrons up to Rosebery Avenue\\".Harewood...

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The perturbation in question - no immediate water available - would directly impact a step of the process. Watering is a crucial part of the process of planting seeds as outlined above.  To give a more detailed explanation, the process you’ve outlined is a basic but absolute method for planting most types of seeds. Each step plays a critical role in ensuring the seed germinates and grows into a healthy plant. 1. Get some seeds: It all starts with the selection of seeds, which determines what kind of plant you'll end up with. The seed holds the life of the plant within it. 2. Pick a spot: This is also important as different plants have different light, soil, and space needs. 3. Dig a hole in the dirt: This is where you'll place your seed. The depth of the hole typically depends on the size of the seed. 4. Put the seed in the hole: By placing the seed within the dirt, you're providing it with a favorable environment for germination. 5. Pour some water on the seed and hole: This is critical for initiating the germination process as water provides the necessary moisture that seeds need to germinate. Seeds absorb water, which triggers the biochemical processes within them that ultimately spur growth. 6. Cover up the hole: This helps to retain the moisture and protect the seed from possible threats like wind, birds, or insects. 7. Press down on it: This ensures the seed makes proper contact with soil and prevent its displacement because of wind, rain, or insects. 8. Spray some plant food on it: Plant food or fertilizer provides the necessary nutrients that seeds need to grow and thrive. If the step of pouring water on the seed is missed or delayed due to unavailability of water, it directly impacts the process of germination. In the absence of water, the seed will not receive the required moisture to activate germination. Even if water is eventually provided, the seed could be compromised if it remains dry for too long. If a larger amount of water is received by the plants after a period of no water, it can lead to waterlogged soil or water stress. Excessive watering after a dry spell may cause more harm than good. Roots need both water and oxygen to thrive. Overwatered soil becomes so saturated that oxygen cannot reach the roots, causing them to suffocate and rot. So, watering plants isn't just about hydrating them, it’s also about maintaining an adequate soil environment for root health. Sudden changes in water availability or quantity can lead to an imbalance in soil conditions, directly affecting plant health.  In conclusion, the supposed perturbation is directly impacting a step of the process. The availability and frequency of water application have a critical role in the successful growth of a plant. If the water isn't available, it will compromise the complete process of planting and growing vegetation directly. Hence, balanced irrigation is fundamental in vegetable farming, among other practices."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Why ur not adding the call feature to Asia?

What is the name of the person that owned the Hookend studio?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In Waters' absence, Gilmour had been recruiting musicians for a new project. Months previously, keyboardist Jon Carin had jammed with Gilmour at his Hookend studio, where he composed the chord progression that became \\"Learning to Fly\\", and so was invited onto the team. Gilmour invited Bob Ezrin (co-producer of 1979's The Wall) to help consolidate their material; Ezrin had turned down Waters' offer of a role on the development of his new solo album, Radio K.A.O.S., saying it was \\"far easier for Dave and I to do our version of a Floyd record\\". Ezrin arrived in England in mid-1986 for what Gilmour later described as \\"mucking about with a lot of demos\\".At this stage, there was no commitment to a new Pink Floyd release, and Gilmour maintained that the material might become his third solo album. CBS representative Stephen Ralbovsky hoped for a new Pink Floyd album, but in a meeting in November 1986, told Gilmour and Ezrin that the music \\"doesn't sound a fucking thing like Pink Floyd\\". Gilmour later said that the new project was difficult without Waters. He experimented with songwriters such as Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, but eventually settled on Anthony Moore, who was credited as co-writer of \\"Learning to Fly\\" and \\"On the Turning Away\\". Whereas many prior Pink Floyd albums are concept albums, Gilmour settled for the more conventional approach of a collection of songs without a thematic link. By the end of that year, he had decided to make the material into a Pink Floyd project. Answer:","output":"The above context does not explicitly provide the name of the person who owned Hookend studio. It only mentions that Gilmour had jammed with Jon Carin at his Hookend studio.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Qatar promises to reform labour laws after outcry over 'World Cup slaves' Qatar has promised to scrap key elements of its controversial labour laws, in the wake of an international outcry over conditions for migrant workers before the 2022 World Cup, which followed a Guardian investigation into workplace abuse in the Gulf state. Officials said they would replace the country's \\"kafala\\" sponsorship system, which tethers workers to a single employer, who can therefore treat his workforce with impunity, pending the approval of a draft law. But human rights groups, which had hoped this would be a watershed moment, feared the lack of detailed proposals represented \\"a missed opportunity to tackle the key issues\\". Amnesty International said it suspected it amounted to a \\"change of name rather than a reform to the system\\". One significant change is to make it less difficult – though not necessarily easy – for foreigners to leave the country and change jobs. However, altering the rules on \\"exit visas\\", which restrict a worker's ability to leave Qatar, and other reforms will have to be ratified by the shura (advisory) council, and businesspeople in Qatar are expected to oppose them vigorously. \\"We are going to abolish the kafala system and it will move to the legislative institutions,\\" said Colonel Abdullah Saqr al-Mohannadi, human rights director of the Qatari interior ministry. \\"It will be replaced by a contractual relationship between employer and employee. We hope that the exit visa will be abolished completely.\\" Under the new rules, a Qatari employer would have to show \\"compelling\\" proof of any objection to a worker leaving the country. Disputes would be resolved within three days. Other possible changes include mandatory employee welfare contracts, sanctions against employers who fail to meet their obligations, and closer bilateral regulatory links with the workers' countries of origin. Experts say tighter implementation across the board will be the key. The reforms are based on recommendations by the London law firm DLA Piper, which was commissioned to review the legislative and enforcement framework of Qatari labour laws after the Guardian's investigative reports last autumn. The firm has had a 10-strong team working on the 140-page report for six months. \\"This shows willing on the part of the highest levels of government, after a huge amount of international pressure, to reform the kafala system,\\" said a western diplomat. \\"There will be significant domestic pressure to water down these proposals. Still, things can happen quite quickly if they have the emir's full backing.\\" Sepp Blatter, president of Fifa, which awarded Qatar the 2022 World Cup, claimed it was a \\"significant step in the right direction for sustainable change in the workers' welfare standards in Qatar\\". But Amnesty's James Lynch said: \\"Promises to fully review sponsorship and exit permits in the long term don't help workers on the ground. The government has been announcing a law on domestic workers' rights since 2008 but we still haven't seen it.\\" Nicholas McGeehan of Human Rights Watch said: \\"The notion that the kafala system can be abolished by no longer referring to a 'sponsor' but an employer/employee relationship is utterly preposterous.\\" Rima Kalush, at Migrant-Rights.Org, said the reforms unveiled amounted to \\"an announcement of an announcement\\". \\"My worry is that Qatar will follow Bahrain's footsteps in renaming the sponsorship system without actually abolishing the majority of the exploitative laws and practices that encompass the system.\\" Qatar has an expatriate community of 1.39 million people, which forms more than 85% of the country's total population of 2.1 million – the highest ratio of migrants to citizens in the world. The largest foreign community is about 500,000 Indians, with large contingents from Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and the Philippines. Qatar, with vast reserves of gas, is officially the world's richest country according to GDP per capita. Doha's many glittering new buildings and massive construction projects are concrete testimony to its immense wealth and ambition.But its construction boom has come at the expense of the safety and wellbeing of many thousands of migrant workers. Investigations by the Guardian, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have revealed cases of workers toiling for little pay in unsafe and insanitary conditions. Some have been prevented from leaving the country and others have had their wages withheld. Some end in a kafkaesque nightmare, on the run from the brutality of their official \\"sponsor\\", unable to work and so to subsist, unable to leave. Hundreds die. The International Trade Union Confederation has warned that 4,000 workers could die before a ball is kicked in 2022 if nothing is done to protect their rights. The DLA Piper report carried confirmation from the Qataris that hundreds of migrants die in the emirate on construction projects each year. The government said 964 workers from Nepal, India and Bangladesh had died while living and working in the Gulf state in 2012 and 2013. A minority of the deaths happened on building sites; in 2012, 246 were recorded as \\"sudden cardiac death\\" – the biggest killer among the largest groups of migrant workers in Qatar, according to statistics provided by the state's Supreme Council of Health. Another 72 were killed in road traffic accidents, and 35 died in falls or by being struck by a \\"thrown, projected or falling object\\". In 2012, 28 workers killed themselves by \\"hanging, strangulation and suffocation and intentional self-harm, by sharp object\\", the classification states. Doha still insists no workers have died on World Cup construction projects. Officials like to describe the 2022 Fifa soccer tournament as a \\"catalyst for change\\". But DLA Piper warned that increased transparency and communication were crucial. Changes to the labour laws will be closely scrutinised. The exit visa requirement has already been abolished in the nearby UAE, another huge employer of foreign workers. But an ongoing review is not expected to include agreement to collective bargaining rights. The fanfare surrounding Wednesday's announcement suggested the Qataris were keen to improve an image that has been tarnished by revelations about migrant labour deaths and conditions.The changes – officially described as \\"far-reaching labour market reforms\\" – were announced at a joint ministry of interior and ministry of labour press conference in one of many Doha's luxury hotels, where journalists were welcomed with a groaning buffet before proceedings began. But the speakers were officials rather than ministers – suggesting a lack of confidence in the future of the reform programme.Still, foreigners involved in the migrant labour issue point to improved levels of cooperation. \\"There's been a change of attitude by the Qataris,\\" said one European legal expert. \\"They have openly engaged with people. They have allowed themselves to be criticised in their own press. They have some good civil servants but like everyone else they also have some time servers. The scale of the issue is huge.\\" Shadow international development secretary Jim Murphy, who recently travelled to Qatar, said: \\"Today's announcement is a small step on a very long journey – and it is absolutely vital that the reforms promised today are implemented quickly and fully. But Fifa must insist that more is done. Football fans will be sickened if the industrial scale exploitation of workers is allowed to continue\\" Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the ITUC, was more peremptory. \\"Modern slavery will still exist in Qatar despite the announcement of cosmetic reforms to the labour law today. The changes are designed to make it easier for employers to find migrant workers, but the announcement fails to address the multiple violations of international labour standards found by the International Labour Organisation in March. The announcement was made by civil servants and the military, without a government minister present. It gives no guarantee for workers in Qatar.\\" Further announcements about new legislation and reforms were promised \\"in the coming months\\". Summary:","output":"Qatar has announced plans to scrap key elements of its controversial labor laws, following an international outcry over the treatment of migrant workers in the lead up to the 2022 World Cup. Officials plan to replace the \\"kafala\\" sponsorship system, which ties workers to a single employer.

Fact 2: Just like sweating, the evaporation of the water cools the body.  Given the two facts above, why do animals sweat? A:","output":"Animals sweat primarily to regulate their body temperature and maintain homeostasis. Given the two facts above, we can understand the process of sweating in animals and its importance: Fact 1: Sweating leads to a decrease in bodily water. - Sweating is a natural process wherein the body releases fluid (sweat) through specialized sweat glands that are present in the skin. This fluid, which mainly consists of water, minerals, and salts, is released onto the skin's surface and subsequently evaporates. Fact 2: Evaporation of the water cools the body. - The evaporation of sweat from the skin surface results in a cooling effect. This is because, during the evaporation process, the sweat absorbs heat from the body, which helps in lowering body temperature. This principle is based on the fact that evaporation is an endothermic process, meaning it requires heat energy for the transition of water from the liquid to the gas phase. In summary, animals sweat to maintain their body temperature within safe limits, ensuring the proper functioning of their biological processes and preventing overheating. The process of sweating thus allows animals' bodies to expel heat through the evaporation of bodily water, which cools down their body temperature effectively. This is crucial for maintaining a stable internal environment and overall survival."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sure, you don't necessarily know the people in your audience or that new friend in your group, but they're nodding along with you and looking knowingly at you all the same. This means that they are connecting with you. So reward them with your acknowledgment! Use facial expressions consciously. Strive to reflect passion and generate listener empathy by using soft, gentle, aware facial expressions. Avoid negative facial expressions, such as frowns or raised eyebrows. What is or isn't negative depends on the context, particularly the cultural context, so be guided by your situation. Be quick to identify unexpected behavior that suggests a cross-culture collision, such as a clenched fist, a slouched posture, or even silence. If you don't know the culture intimately, ask questions about the communication challenges you might face before you start to speak with (or to) people in an unfamiliar cultural context. Eye contact builds rapport, helps to convince people that you're trustworthy, and displays interest. During a conversation or presentation, it is important to look into the other person's eyes if possible and maintain contact for a reasonable amount of time. Take care not to overdo it.– Use just as much eye contact as feels natural, about 2-4 seconds at a time.  Remember to take in all of your audience. If you're addressing a boardroom, look every member of the board in the eye. Neglecting any single person can easily be taken as a sign of offense and could lose you business, admission, success, or whatever it is you endeavor to achieve. If you're addressing an audience, pause and make eye contact with a member of audience for up to two seconds before breaking away and resuming your talk. This helps individual members of the audience feel personally valued. Be aware that eye contact is culturally ordained. In some cultures it is considered to be unsettling, or inappropriate. Ask about this in particular or do the research in advance. There is power in pausing. Simon Reynolds says that pausing causes an audience to lean in and listen. It helps you to emphasize your points and allow the listener time to digest what has been said. It also helps to make your communication come across as more compelling and it makes your speech easier to absorb and become comfortable with.  Take a few deep breaths to steady yourself before you begin communicating. Get into the habit of solid, regular breathing during a conversation, This will help you to keep a steady, calm voice and will also keep you more relaxed. Use pauses to take a breather from what you are saying. Use hand gestures carefully. Be conscious of what your hands are saying as you speak. Some hand gestures can be very effective in highlighting your points (open gestures), while others can be distracting or even offensive to some listeners, and tend to shut down the conversation or listening (closed gestures). It also helps to watch other speaker's hand gestures with an eye for how they come across to you. Emulate those you see that are effective and engaging. Notice that the most effective gestures are natural, slow, and emphatic. Be alert to your wandering eyes, your hands picking at fluff, your constant sniffling, shuffling, rocking, and the like. These small gestures add up and are all guaranteed to dampen the effectiveness of your message. Have someone record your talk, then take the time to view your speech delivery in fast forward. Any repetitive gesture or unconscious habit will stand out like a sore thumb and will be somewhat comical. Once you have targeted such a behavior, it will be easier to modify your unintended body language and monitor its reappearance. Summary:","output":"To effectively connect with your audience or engage in a conversation, it is essential to pay attention to various aspects of non-verbal communication. Use facial expressions consciously, reflecting passion and empathy while avoiding negative expressions. Be aware of cultural differences that may affect the interpretation of body language. Maintain eye contact to build rapport, display interest, and show trust, but also keep it natural and culturally appropriate. Use the power of pausing to emphasize points and allow listeners time to process information. Practice steady and regular breathing to maintain a calm voice and demeanor.

The Czech language, also known as čeština, is a West Slavic language primarily spoken in the Czech Republic, where it is the official language. It is also spoken to some extent by Czech minorities in other countries, such as Slovakia and Austria. The Czech language shares numerous similarities with its neighboring languages, such as Slovak, Polish, and Sorbian. It utilizes the Latin alphabet with several additional characters, including diacritics like the caron (ˇ) and acute accent (´). Czech is part of the wider Slavic language family, which also includes East Slavic languages like Russian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian, and South Slavic languages like Bulgarian, Croatian, Macedonian, Serbian, and Slovenian. Historically, the Czech language developed and branched off from Proto-Slavic, the ancestral language for all Slavic-speaking people. It emerged as a separate language in the 10th century, following the establishment of the Great Moravian Empire. Over the years, Czech has gone through various development phases, including Old Czech (10th - 15th centuries), Middle Czech (15th - 17th centuries), and Modern Czech (since the 17th century). In recent years, as the Czech Republic has become an increasingly popular tourist destination, the importance of learning Czech has grown significantly. Numerous language programs and online resources are now available for those interested in learning Czech, whether for travel, business, or personal interest.

Question 2: Do you feel upvote and follow feature could get biased at times on Quora? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1: Why isn't variable wing geometry used in 5th generation fighters? Variable wing geometry, also known as swing-wing or variable-sweep wing design, is a feature in some aircraft that allows the pilot to adjust the wing's sweep angle during flight. This allows for improved versatility, as the aircraft can perform optimally at various speeds and altitudes. Despite the potential advantages, variable wing geometry is not used in 5th generation fighters for several reasons: 1. Complexity and weight: Variable wing geometry adds significant complexity to the aircraft design and increases its overall weight. The added weight and complexity come with increased maintenance and production costs. 5th generation fighters, such as the F-35 Lightning II and F-22 Raptor, aim to achieve high performance and stealth capabilities while reducing manufacturing and maintenance expenses. 2. Stealth and radar signature: 5th generation fighters are designed for stealth, meaning they need to reduce their radar signature to remain undetected by enemy forces. Variable wing geometry introduces gaps, seams, and moving parts that can negatively impact an aircraft's radar signature. Maintaining a fixed wing geometry allows for a simpler and more aerodynamic design, which helps reduce the radar signature. 3. Advancements in aerodynamics and materials: Developments in aerodynamics and materials technology have allowed for improved fixed-wing designs that can perform well across a range of speeds and altitudes. Newer materials like composites, and advanced aerodynamic designs have enabled aircraft to perform efficiently without the need for variable wing geometry. Consequently, the benefits of variable wing geometry are not as pronounced as they once were. 4. Reliance on other technologies: 5th generation fighters rely heavily on advanced avionics, sensors, and communication systems to provide situational awareness and increase mission effectiveness. These advanced technologies compensate for any potential disadvantages of not having variable wing geometry, making it less critical for overall performance. Question 2: Do you feel the upvote and follow feature could get biased at times on Quora? Quora is an online platform that allows users to ask questions and receive answers from other users. The upvote and follow features are meant to encourage users to share knowledge and engage with high-quality content. While the intentions are positive, there are instances where biases can emerge: 1. Popularity bias: Users with a more significant following or better-established reputations on the platform may receive more upvotes regardless of the content quality. This is due to their popularity, which can prompt others to upvote their answers without critically considering the content. 2. Confirmation bias: Upvotes can be influenced by users' existing beliefs and opinions. When users encounter answers that align with their views, they are more likely to upvote and engage with the content, even if it may not be objectively accurate or well-supported. 3. Groupthink: Users may upvote answers because many others have done the same, following the crowd's behavior and assuming that the content must be right or valuable. 4. Cognitive biases: Several cognitive biases, such as anchoring and the halo effect, can impact users' decision-making processes when upvoting or following others on Quora. These biases can lead to skewed upvote patterns and reinforce certain content over others, not necessarily based on its quality or accuracy. In conclusion, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is about the reasons for not using variable wing geometry in 5th generation fighters, focusing on technical and design aspects. Question 2 is about potential biases that may arise on Quora due to its upvote and follow features. Both questions explore different topics and have distinct concerns."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

He repeatedly calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since \\"The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.\\" For those yearning for a lost sense of order in an older, more tranquil world, he offers his \\"Caliphate\\" as an imagined alternative to today's uncertainty. For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world.  Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction.  Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to reset his relationship with Africa on Monday, as he hosted Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries. Asked whether those comments came up during his private meeting with Trump, Buhari declined to comment.  \\"I'm very careful with what the press says about other than myself. I'm not sure about, you know, the validity or whether that allegation was true or not. So, the best thing for me is to keep quiet,\\" Buhari said. Question: After President Buhari's meeting with Trump, how does he really feel about President Trump? === The answer to the above question is","output":"speculative, as I cannot read President Buhari's thoughts or feelings. However, one can make some educated assumptions based on the outcomes of the meeting and the public statements made by both leaders. During the meeting with President Trump, many important issues were addressed, including combating terrorism, expanding trade, and strengthening military cooperation. Both leaders seemed to focus on their shared interests and common goals, downplaying the previous tensions or disagreements between them. President Buhari expressed gratitude for President Trump's approval of a 600 million military sales deal that had previously been suspended by the Obama administration due to human rights abuse allegations. This gesture can be seen as an indication that the U.S. is willing to strengthen its ties with Nigeria and support the country in its fight against the Boko Haram extremist group. This likely left President Buhari with a positive impression of President Trump's willingness to collaborate. The issue of President Trump's alleged derogatory comments about African countries was not publicly addressed by either leader during the meeting, although it was mentioned during a joint press conference. President Buhari chose not to comment on the issue, stating that he was uncertain about the validity of the allegations and preferred to remain silent. This may suggest that President Buhari is cautious about his relationship with Trump and is keen to avoid public confrontations over controversial matters. Overall, it is likely that after the meeting with President Trump, President Buhari felt reassured by the U.S. commitment to support Nigeria in its fight against terrorism and to strengthen bilateral relations. However, given President Buhari's reticence to comment on Trump's reported comments about African countries, it also suggests that he may maintain a cautiously optimistic approach when dealing with President Trump and the U.S. government, especially concerning sensitive topics."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a hypothesis: Postal administrations have constraints on their budgets and staffing. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"It is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis might be true as well. However, more information would be useful to establish a solid connection between the premise and the hypothesis. Below, I provide a detailed explanation of the relationship between the two, based on the premise and the hypothesis provided. Premise: Postal administrations, however, are often under constraints that limit their ability to respond to such pressure. The premise provided implies that there are certain constraints faced by postal administrations that affect their ability to respond adequately to external pressures and circumstances. These constraints could be of various types, such as financial, operational, workforce, or even regulatory constraints. The premise does not specify the exact constraints that are being referred to, but it establishes that these constraints are significant enough to impact postal administrations' functioning. Hypothesis: Postal administrations have constraints on their budgets and staffing. The hypothesis provided gives an example of the constraints that postal administrations might be facing. It states that postal administrations have limitations on their budgets and staffing. These constraints could directly affect the services provided by the postal administrations, resulting in a lack of funds allocated to essential operational activities and understaffed administrations that struggle to cope with the corresponding workload.  Based on the premise and the hypothesis, it can be inferred that the hypothesis could be a plausible explanation for the constraints mentioned in the premise. Limited budgets could lead to postal administrations being unable to invest in modern technology, infrastructure, or workforce development that would support their efforts to respond to external pressures. Similarly, understaffed postal administrations might struggle to process and deliver mail, handle customer inquiries, and manage workload efficiently. Both budgetary and staffing constraints could hinder the ability of postal administrations to respond to the pressure they face from market expectations, increasing competition, and technological advancements. However, it is important to note that proving a definitive link between the premise and the hypothesis would require more information and data. For instance, information about the specific constraints faced by postal administrations to understand the cause-and-effect would be insightful, as well as data on how budget and staffing limitations affect postal administrations' performance. In conclusion, while the hypothesis appears to be a logical and plausible explanation for the constraints mentioned in the premise, more information is needed to definitively prove the connection between the two. The hypothesis can be considered as one potential explanation among others, and further research might reveal additional constraints that could be impacting postal administrations' ability to respond to external pressures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Francis Piol Bol Bok (born February 1979), a Dinka tribesman and native of South Sudan, was a slave for ten years but is now an abolitionist and author living in the United States. On May 15, 1986, he was captured and enslaved at the age of seven during an Arab militia raid on the village of Nyamlel in South Sudan during the Second Sudanese Civil War. Bok lived in bondage for ten years before escaping imprisonment in Kurdufan, Sudan, followed by a journey to the United States by way of Cairo, Egypt. Bok was aided by people of diverse cultures and faiths in his journey to freedom. Seven-year-old Bok was captured by Giemma, a member of the slave hunting militia, who forced him to join a caravan of slaves, stolen produce, livestock and wares that the militia had captured in their raid of the Dinka settlement. When the members of the militia split up to return to their homes, Bok was taken by Giemma. Upon arriving at Giemma's residence, Francis was beaten by his captor's children with sticks and was called abeed. The word literally means \\"slave\\" and the stereotype is that of an inferior, demeaned, Negroid race. Francis was given quarters in a hovel near the pens of Giemma's livestock.  Bok began a ten-year period of slavery at the hands of Giemma and his son Hamid. He was forced to tend the family's herds of livestock. He had to take them to pastures in the area and to local watering holes, where he saw other Dinka boys who were also forced to tend herds of livestock. He began to suspect that his life was going to change forever and that his father was not going to be able to save him. His attempts to speak to the other Dinka boys were futile, as they were speaking Arabic, which he could not understand; they also seemed afraid to speak to him.  According to Bok, as he grew older, Giemma and Hamid began to place more trust in his abilities as a herdsman. Care of the cattle, horses and camels was passed to Bok and he was able to spend more time alone with the animals. Previously he had been under the careful supervision of Hamid and sometimes Giemma. In addition to having him serve as his slave, Giemma forced Francis to convert to Islam and to take the Arabic name of Abdul Rahman, meaning \\"servant of the compassionate one.\\" In his autobiography, Francis states that although he was forced to convert to Islam, that he never stopped praying to God for strength to get him through his ordeal.  Bok tried twice to flee from slavery at the age of 14. The first instance happened early one morning after he had been sent out with the cattle. Bok blindly ran down a road for several miles before he was captured by one of Giemma's fellow militia members. Giemma's peer returned Francis to the Giemma's compound, where he was beaten with a bullwhip. Bok attempted to escape once again just two days later, when he fled in the opposite direction of his previous escape. He once again fled for several miles, this time keeping to the forest. He stopped for water at a local stream crossing, where he was spotted by Giemma who happened to be there as well. Giemma forced Francis back to his home, this time promising to kill him. Francis was beaten again, but Giemma chose not to kill him, as Francis had become too valuable to the family as a slave.","output":"The given text is about Francis Piol Bol Bok. Justifications: 1. His full name, Francis Piol Bol Bok, is presented in the very first sentence of the text. 2. Most of the descriptive details within the text pertain to his life, history, and experiences. 3.

Insulin administration using a syringe and needle is still one of the most common methods people use to take their insulin.  Start by making sure you have everything you need, including your insulin syringe and needle, alcohol pads, the insulin, and a sharps container nearby. Remove the insulin vial from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before it is time for your dose to allow the insulin to reach room temperature.  Check the dating on your insulin vial before you proceed. Do not use expired insulin or insulin that has been opened for more than 28 days. Dry them completely with a clean towel.  Be sure your injection site is clean and dry. Clean the area with soap and water if needed before you begin.  Avoid wiping the area with alcohol. If you do wipe the area with alcohol, give the area time to air dry before you administer the dose. Many people use more than one type of insulin. Look carefully at the label to be sure you have the correct product for the scheduled dose.  If the insulin vial is in a container or has a cover, remove it and carefully wipe the bottle with an alcohol wipe. Let the bottle air dry, and do not blow on it.  Inspect the liquid inside. Check for any visible clumps or particles floating inside the vial. Be sure the vial is not cracked or damaged.  Insulins that are clear should not be shaken or rolled. As long as they remain clear they can be given without mixing.  Some types of insulin are naturally cloudy. Cloudy insulins should be gently rolled between your hands to mix them properly. Do not shake the insulin. Know the dose you need to administer. Remove the cap from the needle, taking care not to touch the needle with your fingers or to any surface in order to keep it sterile.  Pull back the plunger of the syringe to the same mark as the amount of insulin you intend to remove from the vial.  Push the needle through the top of the vial, and push the plunger to inject the amount of air you just put in the syringe.  Keeping the needle in the vial and the syringe as straight as possible, turn the bottle upside down.  Hold the vial and syringe in one hand, and gently pull back on the plunger to withdraw the exact amount of insulin needed with the other.  Check the liquid in the syringe for air bubbles. With the needle still inside the vial and still holding it upside down, gently tap the syringe to move air bubbles to the top part of the syringe. Push the air back into the vial, and withdraw more insulin if needed to be sure you have the correct amount in the syringe.  Carefully pull the needle from the bottle, and place the syringe on a clean surface without allowing the needle to touch anything. Many people use different types of insulin to cover their blood sugar needs for a longer period of time.  If you use more than one type of insulin for each injection, the insulins must be drawn up into the syringe in a specific order and according to your doctor’s instructions.  If your doctor has instructed you to use more than one type of insulin at a single injection, draw the insulins up exactly as your doctor directed. Be sure you know the the amount of each insulin you need, which product to put in the syringe first, and the total amount of insulin that should be in the syringe when you are finished drawing up both insulins.  The shorter acting insulin product, which is clear, is drawn into the syringe first, followed by the longer acting product, which is cloudy. You should always go from clear to cloudy when mixing the insulin. Avoid scars and moles by one inch, and do not give insulin within two inches of your navel. Avoid bruised areas or areas that are swollen or tender. The insulin is to be administered into the fat layer just under the surface of the skin. This is called a subcutaneous injection. Creating skin folds by gently pinching the skin helps to prevent injecting into muscle tissue.  Insert the needle at either a 45 degree or 90 degree angle. The angle of the needle insertion depends on the injection site, the thickness of the skin, and the length of the needle. In some cases where the skin or fatty tissue is thicker, you may be able to insert the needle at a 90 degree angle.  Your doctor or diabetic healthcare provider will guide you in understanding the areas on your body that should be pinched and the angle of insertion for each injection site. Push the needle all the way into the skin and slowly push the plunger of the syringe to deliver your dose. Be sure the plunger is completely depressed.  Leave the needle in place for five seconds after injecting, then pull the needle out of the skin at the same angle it went in.  Release the skin fold. In some cases, diabetic healthcare providers recommend releasing the skin fold just after needle entry. Talk to your doctor about your insulin injections specific to your body.  Sometimes insulin leaks from the injection site. If this is the case with you, then gently press the site for several seconds. If this problem continues, talk to your doctor. Keep the sharps container in a safe place away from children and pets.  Both needles and syringes are only to be used once.  Each time a needle punctures the top of the vial and the skin, the needle becomes dulled. Dulled needles cause more pain, plus they carry a much greater risk of infection.","output":"This article explains how to properly administer insulin using a syringe and needle, including preparing the insulin, keeping the injection site clean, mixing different types of insulin if needed, and injecting the insulin at the correct angle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Arrange the gifts based on size and fragility The bridesmaid decided it would be best to first arrange the gifts based on their size and fragility. She carefully separated them into three groups: small and fragile, medium-sized, and large and sturdy. This would help her avoid any damage to the gifts during transportation. Step 3: Start with the large and sturdy gifts She began by placing the large and sturdy gifts in the back of the car, arranging them in a way that maximizes space and provides support for the more fragile gifts. Each gift was positioned so that it would not slide around when the car was in motion. Step 4: Add medium-sized gifts Next, she focused on the medium-sized gifts. She placed these in the car, fitting them into any gaps between the large and sturdy gifts. The bridesmaid tried to distribute the weight of these gifts evenly in the car to ensure a smooth ride. Step 5: Pack the small and fragile gifts carefully Lastly, the bridesmaid took the small and fragile gifts and wrapped them in bubble wrap or soft fabric, if not already wrapped, to provide extra protection. She then carefully placed them on top of the sturdier gifts in the car, ensuring they were secure and had minimal chance of being damaged during the journey. Step 6: Double-check the table Once she had finished packing the car, the bridesmaid went back to the table to double-check that every gift has been removed. Discovering that the table was now empty, she felt confident that her task of moving the gifts was complete.

Step 3: Invest in a Cutting Board To protect your work area and ensure precise cuts, invest in a high-quality cutting board specifically designed for leatherworking. A cutting board made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or self-healing materials is recommended. This will prevent cutting marks from showing on your working surface, making it easier to maintain and prolonging the life of your tools. Step 4: Acquire a Mallet A mallet is an indispensable tool, used for striking punches, chisels, and other cutting tools. Leather mallets are often made from polyethylene, rubber or rawhide, materials designed to prevent damage to your tools. Make sure to choose a mallet with a comfortable grip and appropriate weight for your needs. Step 5: Focus on the Most Important Tools As a beginner, it's essential to focus on the most important tools and techniques to build a strong foundation. The swivel knife, edge beveler, hole punch, and stitching chisels are key tools for basic leatherworking tasks such as cutting, shaping, and stitching. As you gain experience, explore more advanced tools to enhance your skills and creativity. Step 6: Ensure Your Tools are the Right Size It's crucial to use tools that are the right size for you. Beginners should prioritize comfort and ergonomics to avoid strain and injury. Test various tools in-store or consider recommendations from experienced leatherworkers to determine the appropriate sizes for your hand and projects. Step 7: Understand the Language of Leather Designs Familiarize yourself with the terminology used in leather design, such as embossing, carving, and stamping. This will facilitate communication with fellow leatherworkers and enable you to follow tutorials and patterns more efficiently. Additionally, keep yourself updated on the various types of leather and their recommended uses to further expand your knowledge. Conclusion: Leatherworking is a rewarding hobby that offers countless opportunities for self-expression and creativity. By focusing on essential tools and techniques, understanding the language of leather designs, and ensuring your tools are the correct size, you're well on your way to a successful leatherworking journey. Most importantly, always remember to embrace the versatile nature of the craft and explore your unique style."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Last summer he visited the tropical forest in Brazil. He labeled that part of his study as forest A. To understand the differences between forests he then visited the temperate forest in Germany. He labeled that part of his study as forest B. He found significant differences in these two types of forests.  But I can use this background: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color.  What is an answer for this question: Which forest would get more insolation, forest A or forest B?","output":"To answer this question, let us go over the provided information step-by-step and then approach the question logically.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Gavin Christopher Newsom was born in San Francisco, California, to Tessa Thomas (nee Menzies) and William Alfred Newsom III, a retired state appeals court justice and attorney for Getty Oil. He is a fourth-generation San Franciscan. His father is of mostly Irish descent; one of Newsom's maternal great-grandfathers, Scotsman Thomas Addis, was a pioneer scientist in the field of nephrology and a professor of medicine at Stanford University. Newsom is the second cousin, twice removed, of musician Joanna Newsom. On May 14, 1991, Newsom and his investors created the company PlumpJack Associates L.P. In 1992, the group started the PlumpJack Winery with the financial help of his family friend Gordon Getty. PlumpJack was the name of an opera written by Getty, who invested in 10 of Newsom's 11 businesses. Getty told the San Francisco Chronicle that he treated Newsom like a son and invested in his first business venture because of that relationship. According to Getty, later business investments were because of \\"the success of the first.\\"  One of Newsom's early interactions with government occurred when Newsom resisted the San Francisco Health Department requirement to install a sink at his PlumpJack wine store. The Health Department argued that wine was a food. The department required the store to install a 27,000 sink in the carpeted wine shop on the grounds that the shop needed the sink for a mop. When Newsom was later appointed supervisor, he told the San Francisco Examiner: \\"That's the kind of bureaucratic malaise I'm going to be working through.\\"  The business grew to an enterprise with more than 700 employees. The PlumpJack Cafe Partners L.P. opened the PlumpJack Cafe, also on Fillmore Street, in 1993. Between 1993 and 2000, Newsom and his investors opened several other businesses that included the PlumpJack Squaw Valley Inn with a PlumpJack Cafe (1994), the Napa Valley winery (1995), the Balboa Cafe Bar and Grill (1995), the PlumpJack Development Fund L.P. (1996), the MatrixFillmore Bar (1998), PlumpJack Wines shop Noe Valley branch (1999), PlumpJackSport retail clothing (2000), and a second Balboa Cafe at Squaw Valley (2000). Newsom's investments included five restaurants and two retail clothing stores. Newsom's annual income was greater than 429,000 from 1996 to 2001. In 2002, his business holdings were valued at more than 6.9 million. Newsom gave a monthly 50 gift certificate to PlumpJack employees whose business ideas failed, because in his view, \\"There can be no success without failure.\\"  Newsom sold his share of his San Francisco businesses when he became mayor in 2004. He maintained his ownership in the PlumpJack companies outside San Francisco that included the PlumpJack Winery in Oakville, California, new PlumpJack-owned Cade Winery in Angwin, California, and the PlumpJack Squaw Valley Inn. He is currently the president in absentia of Airelle Wines Inc., which is connected to the PlumpJack Winery in Napa County. Newsom earned between 141,000 and 251,000 in 2007 from his business interests. In February 2006, he paid 2,350,000 for his residence in the Russian Hill neighborhood, which he put on the market in April 2009, for 2,995,000. Where did he work after that?","output":"After Gavin Newsom sold his share of his San Francisco businesses when he became mayor in 2004, he maintained his ownership in the PlumpJack companies outside San Francisco.

The violent arena of domestic abuse litigation has grown a bit more volatile here, now that a judge has decided to hold two women in contempt of court for returning to men who had been ordered to stay away from them. \\"You can't have it both ways,\\" said Judge Megan Lake Thornton of Fayette County District Court in recently fining two women 100 and 200 respectively for obtaining protective orders forbidding their partners from contacting them, then relenting and contacting the men. Ruling that the order was mutually binding, Judge Thornton also cited the men for contempt. \\"It drives me nuts when people just decide to do whatever they want,\\" said Judge Thornton, who is experienced in the state's thick domestic abuse docket, which produces close to 30,000 emergency protective orders a year. Kentucky officials say there is a virtual epidemic of abusive relationships in the state. Judge Thornton's ruling has alarmed advocates for battered women, who plan to appeal it. The advocates say the finding goes beyond existing law and is unrealistic because some renewed contacts often prove unavoidable in domestic abuse cases, which involve economic and family dependency and other complications of daily living. The state office on domestic violence has pointedly agreed, warning that the ruling could cause abused women to hesitate in bringing their plight before the courts for fear of being chastised for their trouble. \\"The reality is it's easy to say they should never have contact,\\" said Sherry Currens, executive director of the Kentucky Domestic Violence Association, an advocacy and legal protection group. \\"But we're talking about people in long-term relationships. They may have children in common. It's pretty hard to say, \`Never speak again.' People have financial difficulties. They may love the partner. It's not an easy thing.\\" But Judge Thornton declared in court, \\"When these orders are entered, you don't just do whatever you damn well please and ignore them.\\" The ruling stunned Cindra Walker, the lawyer for the two women, who is with Central Kentucky Legal Services, which represents many of the thousands of indigent women caught in abusive relationships. \\"For over five years, I've been in court practically every day on these abuse cases,\\" Ms. Walker said, \\"and I've never before had a victim threatened with contempt.\\"  Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Fayette County District Court\\" correctly answer the question \\"Which county and state does Judge Megan Lake Thornton work for?\\"?

Summarize this article: Construction on the fence, planned to be about 110km (70 miles) long and 2.5m (8ft) high, is set to start in 2018. It is expected to cost about â‚¬71m (Â£52m; 80m), according to reports. The plans come amid heightened tensions between Russia and the West over the Ukraine conflict. Europe is also struggling with an influx of migrants. \\"The aim of the construction is to cover the land border with 100%, around-the-clock technical surveillance to create ideal conditions for border guarding and to ensure the security of Estonia and the Schengen area,\\" interior ministry spokesman Toomas Viks told AFP news agency. He said information gathered could be used to investigate illegal border crossing, smuggling and human trafficking. The fence would only cover just over a third of Estonia's 294km (183 miles) border with Russia as much of it is covered by water, Estonia's Postimees newspaper reports. The former Soviet nation is among the EU member states to have borders on the external boundaries of the Schengen zone, which enables passport-free travel. Another such country, Hungary, has already started building a controversial 175km-long fence along its border with Serbia to try to keep migrants out. Officials say thousands of people cross into the country every day as they head north into Europe and Germany in particular. However the focus of the migrants crisis in recent months has been in the Western Balkans, rather than Estonia. Migrants have also continued to make the perilous crossing to Europe via the Mediterranean from Libya. Meanwhile Konstantin Kosachev, deputy head of the Russian parliament's foreign affairs committee, has condemned the plan for the fence, according to local media. He said Estonia did not face the same migrants challenge as other EU countries and that the aim instead was ideological - to depict Russia as a threat to Europe. Earlier this month Russia jailed Estonian security official Eston Kohver to 15 years in prison for spying in a case that provoked a diplomatic row. Kohver was detained at the Russian border last September, with Estonia and the EU insisting he was on Estonian soil and Russia saying he was on Russian territory.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: While there are some general signs used to identify gender dysphoria, it's not cut-and-dry, and everyone experiences it differently. Some people identify their true gender in early childhood, whereas others don't recognize it until puberty or adulthood. Some people experience severe and distressing dysphoria, while others experience it minimally or not at all. There's no one \\"right\\" way for someone to experience dysphoria, so gender dysphoria can be difficult to identify, and it may take time to figure it out.  Gender dysphoria can exist in anyone who's not cisgender, including nonbinary people.  If you're trying to determine whether you're experiencing gender dysphoria, you may find it beneficial to look at forums and social media sites for transgender and nonbinary people, read various people's experiences to see if you relate to them, and read articles such as How to Know if You Are Transgender. . It's not unusual for children to experiment with gender, such as by wanting to be called by another name during play. However, if a child consistently asserts that they are a gender other than the one they were assigned, or resists behavior or presentation associated with the gender they don't identify with, they may have gender dysphoria. Signs of gender dysphoria or gender variance in a child include:  A repeated desire to be the other sex or an assertion that they are the other sex A belief that their assigned sex will change on its own (e.g. thinking they'll grow a penis or that their penis will come off when they get older) Wanting to change their name to a name typically associated with another gender, or a gender-neutral name A preference for presenting as another gender (e.g. a child assigned male at birth who prefers long hair and wearing dresses, or a child assigned female at birth who prefers short hair and wearing gender-neutral clothing) Resistance or distress when made to present as a gender they don't identify with (such as a \\"girl\\" throwing a tantrum over having to wear a dress or a \\"boy\\" crying after having to get a haircut) Assuming the role of another gender in fantasy games or make-believe An intense desire to participate in the games and activities typical of another gender (such as an assigned-male child playing with Barbie and an assigned-female child playing contact sports) A preference for playmates of another gender Gender dysphoria often becomes more apparent during puberty, since hormonal changes and physical changes are occurring, and a preteen or teen who previously didn't question their gender identity may suddenly feel confused or distressed about the changes. Signs of gender dysphoria in adolescence include:  Feelings of panic or severe discomfort concerning puberty and bodily changes (e.g. refusing to acknowledge or admit changes are occurring, refusing to look at their body, or becoming distressed or uncomfortable with body development, menstruation, or ejaculation) Discomfort or distress with certain forms of gender presentation, such as disliking long hair or certain types of clothing Increased bullying at school due to differences in acting out one’s perceived gender or lack of self-confidence Isolation from peers due to lack of connection or fear of bullying Depression and/or anxiety as a result of confusion over gender identity or not fitting in with peers Be aware that some adolescents may try to repress their true gender due to outside pressure, such as from family and peers, even if they previously expressed their true gender as a child. Often, gender dysphoria remains hidden or unrecognized until adulthood due to the learned gender behaviors that are taught to both children and adolescents by their family and peers. Some signs of gender dysphoria in adults include:  A difference between the sex at birth and the gender the individual expresses or experiences Consistently identifying with a gender other than the one matching the sex they were assigned (for an official diagnosis of gender dysphoria, this must have been ongoing for at least six months) Constant daydreaming or \\"what if...\\" thoughts about being another gender Wanting to be treated as another gender, or disliking being treated as the gender others perceive them as (e.g. being uncomfortable when addressed as \\"sir\\" or \\"ma'am\\") Wanting to remove, alter, or hide their sex characteristics (however, this is not present in all transgender or nonbinary people) The individual may feel that they act in ways typical of another gender. If gender dysphoria has been deeply repressed or buried, it may have resulted in mental health problems. Take note of any history of anxiety or depression, self-injurious behavior, or substance abuse, and whether these problems lessen or even disappear when they present as their true gender; these can be subtle indicators of dysphoria. Gender dysphoria can be difficult to identify, and some people don't experience it; however, many transgender or nonbinary people experience gender euphoria, which is described as positive feelings when their true gender is affirmed and validated. Even if the person doesn't feel their assigned sex is wrong, they may feel that presenting as a different gender is right, instead. Some signs of gender euphoria are:  Feeling happy or excited when addressed as their true gender Feeling relieved after identifying their gender Joy or excitement when presenting in a way that aligns with their gender (e.g. wearing a bra or cutting their hair short) A feeling of peace with their body when transitioning socially or medically Summary:","output":"The article discusses the complex and varied nature of gender dysphoria, its signs and manifestations in people of different age groups, and how it may be experienced differently by individuals, making it challenging to identify; it also highlights the concept of gender euphoria as a positive affirmation of one's true gender."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.  Two earth-like planets orbited the same star. The inhabitants of Earth I released greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

Here's the problem we need to solve: 1706*q + 40075 + 2575 = 0 First, let's add the two numbers that don't have the letter 'q': 40075 + 2575 = 42650 Now our problem looks like this: 1706*q + 42650 = 0 We want to solve for 'q', so we'll get all the other numbers to the other side of the equal sign. To do this, we'll subtract 42650 from both sides: 1706*q = -42650 Now, we need to get 'q' alone. Since 1706 is being multiplied by 'q', we'll divide both sides by 1706: q = -42650 / 1706 After doing the division, we get: q = -25 So the solution to the problem is q = -25.

Movie plot title: S1m0ne Movie plot: When Nicola Anders (Winona Ryder), the star of out-of-favor director Viktor Taransky's (Al Pacino) new film, refuses to finish it, Taransky is forced to find a replacement. Contractual requirements totally prevent using her image in the film, so he must re-shoot. Instead, Viktor experiments with a new computer program he inherits from late acquaintance Hank Aleno (Elias Koteas) which allows creation of a computer-generated woman which he can easily animate to play the film's central character. Viktor names his virtual actor \\"Simone\\", a name derived from the computer program's title, Simulation One. Seamlessly incorporated into the film, Simone (Rachel Roberts) gives a fantastic performance, exactly controlled by Viktor. The film is immediately a huge success. The studio, and soon the world, ask \\"who is Simone?\\" Viktor initially claims that Simone is a recluse and requests her privacy be respected, but that only intensifies media demands for her to appear. Viktor intends to reveal the secret of her non-existence after the second picture. To satisfy demand, he executes a number of progressively ambitious stunts relying on misdirection and cinematic special effects technology. Eventually it escalates to simulated remote location video live interviews. In one instance, two determined tabloid reporters discover Viktor used out-of-date stock photography as a background during an interview instead of being on that site as claimed and blackmail him into getting Simone to make a live appearance. He arranges her to perform a song at a stadium event appearing in a cloud of smoke and then using flawless holographic technology. The perception of being in person is reinforced with realtime visualization on the stadium's monitors. Simone becomes even more famous, simultaneously becoming a double winner for the Academy Award for Best Actress, tying with herself in the process. Once the pressure of serving his creation reaches a breaking point for Viktor, he decides to ruin Simone's career as an act of vengeance. Simone's... The answer to this question is:","output":"In the movie S1m0ne, Viktor Taransky (Al Pacino) wants to \\"kill\\" Simone, his computer-generated actress, not in a literal sense because she is not a physical entity, but he wants to ruin her career and erase her existence in the public perception. There are a few reasons why Viktor is driven to this point. Firstly, Simone's success and fame become overwhelming for Viktor. He initially created Simone out of desperation, to replace the unpredictable, real actress Nicola Anders (Winona Ryder). He wanted to have an actress that he could fully control, who would flawlessly execute his vision. However, the fame and success Simone attains far exceed his expectations, and the world becomes obsessed with her. Viktor feels pressured to maintain the facade of Simone's real existence and to progressively upscale his efforts to make her appear real. Secondly, Viktor's decision to 'kill' Simone is also motivated by his desire to reveal the truth behind her existence. Viktor originally plans to reveal Simone's non-existence after the second picture, which indicates his intention to end the simulation at some point. The desperation and deceit required to maintain Simone's existence become too much for Viktor. Thirdly, Viktor's plan to ruin Simone is also a form of vengeance. He feels a sense of injustice because the world cherishes and idolizes Simone, who is his creation, while he himself is overlooked and unappreciated. This sense of injustice, alongside the mental and emotional stress that comes with maintaining the Simone deception, ultimately leads to his decision to destroy Simone's career and thereby 'kill' her.  Therefore, the 'killing' here is more metaphorical and refers to the end of Simone's projected existence in the public eye, than an actual physical act of murder."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They are now back to full health and their owner has been prosecuted.","output":"Title: Overweight and Neglected Horses Rescued by Animal Welfare Staff in Somerset Introduction: In a heartwarming story from Somerset, England, a group of neglected and overweight horses were recently rescued by animal welfare staff from a local farm. The horses were found with matted fur and painfully overgrown hooves, with some curling into the shape of 'slippers.' Thanks to the tireless efforts of the rescue team, these horses are now back to full health and their previous owner has been prosecuted. Step 1: Inform readers about the details of the footage showing the neglected horses Footage taken before the rescue painted a dire picture of the horses' living conditions. On-site, the rescue team discovered horses suffering from the harsh realities of neglect. The animals were visibly overweight and unkempt, as evident by their matted fur. But it was the state of their hooves, curling up into painful, slipper-like shapes, that truly highlighted the severity of the situation. Step 2: Share information about the rescue operation led by animal welfare staff Upon receiving word of the mistreatment happening at the farm in Somerset, animal welfare staff quickly mobilized to rescue the suffering horses. This much-needed intervention not only saved the lives of these animals but also demonstrated the importance of reporting any instances of neglect or abuse that one might encounter.   Step 3: Describe the process of nursing the horses back to full health Once safely in the care of their rescuers, the horses underwent thorough examinations by veterinarians. They received proper treatment, including hoof trimming and grooming, to alleviate their distress and ensure their well-being. Over time, and with the support of compassionate humans, the horses gradually regained full health. Step 4: Inform readers about the prosecution of the horses' previous owner Animal cruelty is a grave offense, and the law enforces strict punishments for those who engage in such actions. In this case, the previous owner of the horses in Somerset faced prosecution for their neglectful behavior. This serves as a stern reminder that animal abuse is taken seriously, and that violators will be identified and held accountable for their actions. Conclusion: The rescue of these neglected horses in Somerset is a testament to the resilience of animals and their ability to thrive with proper care. It is a powerful example of how communities must work collectively to report instances of abuse or neglect and ensure that all animals receive the love, care, and dignity they deserve. Through the tireless efforts of animal welfare staff, and the support of concerned citizens, these courageous horses are now able to live happy and healthy lives, free from pain and suffering."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"Wonder Woman and Killer Bean Forever are both 2009 films that belong to distinct genres, yet they share some common elements. I will provide a detailed breakdown of each film's genre, as well as their similarities and differences. Wonder Woman, directed by Lauren Montgomery, is an animated superhero film based on the DC Comics character of the same name. This movie falls under the broader genres of action, adventure, and fantasy. The story predominantly revolves around Princess Diana of Themyscira, an Amazonian warrior princess, who goes on to embrace her destiny as Wonder Woman, a symbol of truth, justice, and compassion. Killer Bean Forever, created by Jeff Lew, is a computer-animated action-comedy film. This movie features a unique protagonist - a coffee bean named Jack Bean, who is an elite assassin code-named \\"Killer Bean.\\" The story follows Killer Bean as he pursues a rival criminal organization and uncovers a larger, more sinister plot. The film primarily incorporates elements of action, comedy, thriller, and crime drama. While Wonder Woman and Killer Bean Forever both released in 2009 and include action and adventure elements, they diverge in terms of tonality, target audience, and emphasis on certain genre aspects. Wonder Woman is more focused on the superhero genre and conveys themes of power, heroism, and responsibility. The movie highlights the character's challenges, her growth as a heroic figure, and her eventual triumph over adversity, making it more of an action-adventure and fantasy film with some emotional depth. The target audience for Wonder Woman is mainly fans of superhero fiction, DC Comics enthusiasts, and those who enjoy animated action-adventure films. On the other hand, Killer Bean Forever is a blend of action, comedy, crime, and thriller genres, emphasizing its eccentric and somewhat absurd premise of a highly skilled, anthropomorphic coffee bean assassin. Its comedic elements range from situational humor to tongue-in-cheek references and parodies. Given the combination of genres and slightly more mature themes, the target audience for Killer Bean Forever might consist of individuals who appreciate animated films with unconventional humor, quirky characters, and an engaging plot that transcends usual animated movie tropes. In summary, Wonder Woman and Killer Bean Forever are 2009 films that can be categorized within the action, adventure, and animated genres but diverge with regards to their core themes, target audiences, and the extent to which they emphasize specific genre elements. Wonder Woman is primarily a superhero-action film that also deals with the protagonist's growth and moral dilemmas, while Killer Bean Forever is an action-comedy crime thriller showcasing a bizarre and humorous concept packaged in an entertaining storyline."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Problem: A dog takes 3 leaps for every 5 leaps of a hare. One leap of the dog equals 3 leaps of the hare. Find the ratio of the speed of the dog to that of the hare. First, let's break down the information: - Dog takes 3 leaps for every 5 leaps of the hare. - One leap of the dog is equal to 3 leaps of the hare. To find the ratio of the speed of the dog to the hare, we can follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total leaps of the dog and the hare. 2. Convert the dog's leaps to hare's leaps. 3. Find the ratio between the leaps. Step 1: Total leaps: Dog's leaps: 3 (1 leap = 3 hare's leaps) Hare's leaps: 5 Step 2: Convert dog's leaps to hare's leaps: 3 dog's leaps * 3 hare's leaps (per dog's leap) = 9 hare's leaps Step 3: Find the ratio: Dog's leaps (in hare's leaps) / Hare's leaps = 9 / 5 So, the ratio of the speed of the dog to that of the hare is 9:5.

Canine stroke typically occurs when blood vessels in the brain rupture (hemorrhagic stroke) or become blocked (ischemic stroke). The symptoms of canine stroke may appear quite suddenly, and may also be different from the typical signs of stroke in humans. Your dog may have had a stroke if it:  Walks in circles for no apparent reason. Holds its head tilted to one side. Turns the wrong way when called. Has difficulty balancing, standing, or walking. Experiences extreme lethargy. Has sudden problems with bladder and bowel control. Shows signs of loss of vision. Suddenly collapses. You may also notice your dog’s eyes moving rapidly from side to side as if following a moving object (nystagmus). Stroke is only one possible cause of nystagmus, but it is always a good idea to get this symptom evaluated by a vet. You can help your vet diagnose canine stroke and identify potential underlying causes more quickly by letting them know if your dog has any common risk factors for stroke. Stroke may be more likely to occur in elderly dogs and dogs with a history of:  Head injury or trauma. Heart disease. Diabetes. Kidney disease. Endocrine disorders, such as thyroid disease or Cushing’s disease. Brain tumors. Exposure to some types of poison. Certain parasites or tick-borne diseases, such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. If you suspect your dog has a stroke, take them to the vet immediately. Tell your vet about your dog’s symptoms and health history. In addition to examining your dog and observing their behavior, your vet may use imaging tests as an MRI, CT scan, or standard X-rays in order to confirm or rule out a stroke.  Your vet may perform other tests, such as a spinal tap, in an effort to check for other conditions and diseases with similar symptoms. The vet will be looking for bleeding, clots, inflammation, or masses in the brain. Treat any symptoms of stroke as a medical emergency. Early medical intervention may help ensure the best possible outcome for your dog. Summary:","output":"Canine stroke consists of hemorrhagic or ischemic strokes with various symptoms, and potential risk factors include age, health conditions, and exposure to certain diseases or toxins; prompt veterinary attention is essential for diagnosis and treatment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: An EM has greater resolving power than a light microscope and can reveal the structure of smaller objects because electrons have wavelengths about 100,000 times shorter than visible light photons . Question: what types of microscopes do not require a vacuum A:","output":"There are several types of microscopes that do not require a vacuum. These microscopes are designed to work with visible light or other non-electron-based illumination sources. Some of the most common microscopes that do not require a vacuum include: 1. Optical (Light) Microscopes: These microscopes are the most common and versatile instruments used for microscopy. They use visible light and a series of lenses to magnify samples. There are several categories of light microscopes, including:    a. Compound Microscope: A traditional microscope with multiple lenses for magnification, typically consisting of an objective lens and an eyepiece lens. These microscopes generally have a magnification range from 40x to 1000x.    b. Stereo Microscope (Dissecting Microscope): A type of microscope that provides a 3D view and lower magnification (typically up to 100x), designed for observing larger specimens such as insects or small dissections.    c. Confocal Microscope: A specialized type of light microscope that employs laser light and specific optics to provide high-resolution optical sectioning of the sample.    d. Darkfield Microscope: A type of light microscope that uses an opaque disk to block direct light, creating higher contrast in the sample. This microscope is useful for observing unstained or transparent samples. 2. Phase Contrast Microscope: This type of microscope is designed to observe specimens that have small differences in refractive index, such as unstained biological cells. By utilizing a ring-shaped diaphragm and a phase plate, it can produce an image with contrast based on these differences in refractive index. 3. Fluorescence Microscope: A fluorescence microscope takes advantage of the phenomenon of fluorescence, where certain compounds absorb light at specific wavelengths and emit it at a longer wavelength. This microscope uses excitation and emission filters to selectively observe specific wavelengths, allowing the visualization of fluorescent-labeled samples. 4. Polarizing Microscope: Polarizing microscopes use polarized light to analyze the optical characteristics of materials, such as minerals and crystals. These microscopes can reveal important information about the structural properties of a sample by exploiting the interaction between polarized light and the material. 5. Atomic Force Microscope (AFM): AFM is a scanning probe technique that uses a sharp tip attached to a flexible cantilever to investigate the surface properties of a sample. By measuring the interaction between the tip and the surface, AFM can provide detailed information about the topography, friction, and other properties of the sample at the nanoscale level. While it is quite different from light microscopes, it does not require a vacuum. Overall, each type of microscope mentioned above has its specific applications and advantages depending on the sample and the required level of detail. However, none of these microscopes necessitate a vacuum, as they rely on visible light or alternative methods for sample observation and analysis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who had weakened technical mastery?  During the 1950s, Szigeti began to develop arthritis in his hands and his playing deteriorated. Despite his weakened technical mastery, his intellect and musical expression were still strong, and he continued to draw large audiences to his concerts. In Naples, Italy, in November 1956, just after the Soviets crushed the Hungarian uprising, as soon as he walked onto the stage the audience burst into wild applause and shouts of Viva l’Ungheria! (Italian for \\"Long live Hungary!\\"), delaying the concert for nearly fifteen minutes.In 1960 Szigeti officially retired from performing, and returned to Switzerland with his wife. There he devoted himself primarily to teaching, although he still traveled regularly to judge international violin competitions. Top-class students from all over Europe and the United States came to study under him. One of these students was Arnold Steinhardt, who spent the summer of 1962 with Szigeti. He came to the conclusion that \\"Joseph Szigeti was a template for the musician I would like to become: inquisitive, innovative, sensitive, feeling, informed\\".Toward the end of his life, Szigeti suffered from frail health. He was put on strict diets and had several stays in hospital, but his friends asserted that this did nothing to dampen his characteristic cheerfulness. He died in Lucerne, Switzerland on February 19, 1973, at the age of 80. The New York Times ran a front-page obituary that ended with this 1966 quote from violinist Yehudi Menuhin: We must be humbly grateful that the breed of cultured and chivalrous violin virtuosos, aristocrats as human beings and as musicians, has survived into our hostile age in the person of Joseph Szigeti.

The Cabinet is the executive committee of Her Majesty's Privy Council, a body which has legislative, judicial and executive functions, and whose large membership includes members of the Opposition. Its decisions are generally implemented either under the existing powers of individual government departments, or by Orders in Council. Can we conclude that can a cabinet minister be from another party?","output":"Yes, a cabinet minister can be from another party, but it is important to understand the context and factors that can influence such an appointment. A cabinet is a group of senior government officials, usually composed of the heads of the executive departments and other key officials, who act collectively to advise and make decisions on matters of national importance. Its members are appointed by the Prime Minister or President and serve at their discretion. In parliamentary systems, such as the United Kingdom, the Cabinet is typically composed of members who belong to the majority party or a coalition of parties that have formed the government. However, under certain circumstances, a cabinet minister may be appointed from an opposing party. This practice, often referred to as a \\"national unity government\\" or a \\"government of national unity,\\" is intended to ensure representation from diverse political backgrounds and facilitate cooperation on critical issues, particularly during times of crisis or extreme political polarization. There are several factors that may lead to the appointment of a cabinet minister from another party: 1. Coalition government: In cases where no single party has a majority in the parliament, two or more parties may agree to form a coalition government. This agreement often involves sharing cabinet positions and responsibilities among the participating parties, which may include ministers from other parties. 2. Inclusive governance: In order to ensure that diverse perspectives are represented and to promote national unity, a government may choose to include representatives from opposition parties in the cabinet. This can be particularly important in countries that face significant societal divisions or have a history of political tension. 3. Expertise and competence: A Prime Minister or President may choose to appoint a cabinet minister from another party based on their expertise or competence in a specific area. This can also be seen as a way to demonstrate bipartisanship and foster a more collaborative political environment. 4. Crisis circumstances: During times of crisis, such as wartime or significant national emergencies, a government may seek to bring opposition party members into the cabinet as a sign of national unity and to better address the pressing issues. Regardless of the reason for appointing a cabinet minister from another party, it is important to note that the practice is relatively rare and typically happens under specific conditions. The ability of such ministers to effectively contribute to the decision-making process can depend on the level of trust, cooperation, and communication between the ruling party and the opposition party to which the minister belongs. Nevertheless, appointing a cabinet minister from another party can be an effective way to create a more inclusive and cooperative governance model, particularly in extraordinary circumstances."},{"instruction":"Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: Worms are crawling out of the earth in the middle of rain, why are they?

News article: When the runaway ghost train rolled into the heart of town and detonated like a bomb, levelling the entire historic central district of pretty Lac-Mégantic, Que., survivors say that life or death depended on where you happened to be standing.      A day after the conflagration which destroyed at least 30 buildings, including a packed bar, apartments and all the town’s archives, fire still raged. With one confirmed dead, hope was diminishing for dozens of people who remained missing. Medical officials reported almost no injuries. Those who failed to escape probably did not survive to seek treatment.      The town of Lac Megantic where a train carrying crude oil derailed early morning in Lac-Mégantic, Quebec, July 6, 2013. THE GLOBE AND MAIL gallery In pictures: The aftermath of the explosive Quebec train derailment In this OPP handout photo from CTV, a train car is seen in a river after a bridge collapse caused a Canadian Pacific train to derail. Ontario Provincial Police via CTV Interactive Interactive: Recent CP train derailments      Many of those missing were indoors, such as the patrons of the Musi-Café bar who filled the building when 73 driverless train cars rolled in out of control at 1:15 a.m. ET Saturday morning.      Those who were outside when the train failed to negotiate a bend had a chance. Some survivors were out for a smoke. Some were going home after a enjoying a few drinks at a packed bar near the epicentre of the explosion. Others out for a stroll ended up running just a metre or two ahead of a river of fire – tons of burning crude oil flowing down city streets and into the lake.      So far, the Surêté du Québec is confirming only one death and refusing to validate reports that anywhere between 50 and 80 people are missing. An officer speaking on condition of anonymity Saturday afternoon told a Globe and Mail reporter he had 50 names on his list. Agence France-Presse put the number at 80.      In the final police briefing for Saturday, Lieutenant Guy Lapointe would say only: “There is one confirmed death. But we expect others.”      Those who were on the scene when the immense fireball turned buildings into piles of ash have no doubt the death toll will be big.      \\" Everybody who didn’t make it back is dead,\\" predicted Frédérique Mailloux, a 38-year-old stay-at-home mom, who said six of her friends are missing. “I have cried every tear in my body.”      Nearly two square kilometres of the downtown were razed, according to Fire Chief Denis Lauzon. “The scene is like one you see after a big forest fire. There are only parts of the buildings left, trees have been completely burnt, there is no grass left, the cars are charred. This is total destruction.”      Earlier, provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told a news conference: “Our investigators are trying to track down family members, so we can’t give the identity of this (dead) person, but at this time we can confirm one person has died.”      Mr. Brunet said authorities have been told “many” people have been reported missing.      “We’re told some people are missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,” Mr. Brunet said.      “We’re checking all that, so I can’t tell you at the moment whether there are any victims or people who are injured.”      Relatives in the tourist town of 6,000 full-time residents were already starting to grieve. At a community centre, Jacques Bolduc and Solange Gaudreault emerged after providing a DNA sample to potentially identify their son, Guy Bolduc, a 23-year-old singer who was performing at the bar.      “Our boy wanted so much to live,” Mr. Bolduc told Radio-Canada. “The police told us there is no hope. The train exploded 30 feet from the (Musi-Café) bar.”      Bernard Théberge, 44, a cook who lives on the outskirts of Lac-Mégantic, was out with his friends at the Musi-Café, one of the most popular hangouts in town and the last known whereabouts of many of the missing. The Musi-Café is a few metres from where the tracks cross Frontenac Street, Lac-Mégantic’s main street.      Mr. Théberge was on the outside patio in front of the café smoking a cigarette when the derailment happened. He heard the train coming and knew right away that something was wrong.      “It was going way too fast,” said Mr. Théberge. \\"I saw a wall of fire go up. People got up on the outside patio. I grabbed my bike, which was just on the railing of the terrasse. I started pedaling and then I stopped and turned around. I saw that there were all those people inside and I knew right away that it would be impossible for them to get out.      Mr. Théberge said he tried to go around front to help people escape “but there was just fire everywhere.”      \\"I just pedaled away, but I know a lot of people didn’t make it out. There were maybe 60 people inside. “This is a first. Smoking saved my life,” he said with a voice raspy from the heat and smoke. His right arm was bandaged for the second-degree burns.      At a tent at the corner of Frontenac and Lemieux streets in the afternoon, paramedics sat idly in the torrid heat with no one to help. Residents gathered to await news of survivors, which never came.      Report Typo/Error ||||| One person has been declared dead after a train derailment in the tight-knit community of Lac-M├ęgantic, Que., sparked explosions and a major blaze.      The train, which was carrying crude oil, rolled away overnight after it was parked by an engineer. It derailed in the heart of the small town in Quebec's Eastern Townships, forcing close to 2,000 people from their homes.      Share your thoughts and wishes with the community of Lac-M├ęgantic. Tweet #LacMegantic      Witnesses reported between five and six explosions overnight in the town of about 6,000 people. The derailment happened at about 1 a.m. ET, about 250 kilometres east of Montreal. About 1,000 people were evacuated from their homes overnight, and several hundred more also left their homes on Saturday afternoon because of air quality concerns.      'ItÔÇÖs like the town has been cut by a knife.'ÔÇöGr├ęgory Gomez del Prado, Quebec provincial police      Quebec provincial police confirmed one death on Saturday afternoon, and Sgt. Gr├ęgory Gomez del Prado told CBC it's possible up to 100 people could be missing, although he said it is difficult to pin down an exact number.      ÔÇťItÔÇÖs like the town has been cut by a knife,ÔÇŁ he said, referring to the fire that tore through the community's downtown.      Quebec premier Pauline Marois offered her support to the community and Prime Minister Stephen Harper will be visiting the area Sunday to assess the damage and meet with officials.      Harper sent his thoughts out to the community on Saturday afternoon. He said the government was monitoring the situation and was standing ready to provide extra support.      ÔÇťOur thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train derailment,\\" he said in a statement. ÔÇťWe hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly,\\" he said.      Death toll expected to rise      Police said in a news conference late Saturday that they expected the death toll to rise.      \\"I don't want to get into numbers, what I will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will be found deceased, unfortunately,\\" said Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial police.      \\"We also expect that down the line the number of people who are reported missing with regards to people that who have actually lost their lives will much higher in the sense that there will be more people reported missing that people actually found dead.\\"      Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted for because police are having a difficult time getting a number.      \\"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some people are reported two, three times missing by different members of the family,\\" he said.      'Total mayhem'      Zeph Kee, who lives about 30 minutes outside of Lac-M├ęgantic, said he saw a huge fireball coming from the city's downtown early Saturday morning.      The area surrounding the explosion site was a popular place on the evenings, and witnesses said the bars and restaurants were bustling with people when the first explosion hit.      Kee said one of the bars, which was packed with people enjoying their drinks on the patio, is now gone along with dozens of other buildings and homes that were flattened by the blast.      Watch the explosion      \\"It was total mayhem ÔÇŽ people not finding their kids,\\" Kee said.      Isabelle Aller, who was visiting the area, says she has been calling her friends ever since the explosion, and they haven't answered their phones.      \\"The more time that passes, the more we are worried,\\" she said.      Aller says after the first explosion, some people went to the scene to see what was going on.      Several explosions followed afterwards.      Train inexplicably rolls away      The derailed train belongs to Montreal Maine & Atlantic Railway, which owns more than 800 kilometres of track serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and New Brunswick, according to the company's website.      Chairman Edward Burkhardt said an engineer parked the train west of Lac-M├ęgantic before he went to a local hotel for the night.      While other details remain unclear, the train rolled away later that night and derailed in the centre of the town.      \\"He had parked the train, so far as we can determine, properly,\\" Burkhardt said, adding that the brakes were properly applied.      The company will have to wait for clearance from authorities before they can look for more answers.      Burkhardt said that while it's not clear how much oil has been spilled, his company is committed to cleaning up.      \\"We're pledging a complete cleanup and remediation of the area,\\" he said.      Mayor holds back tears      The teary-eyed mayor of Lac-M├ęgantic, Colette Roy-Laroche, said emergency services are doing everything possible to deal with the crisis.      \\"We have deployed all resources to ensure that we can support our citizens,\\" she said.      'It's terrible. We've never seen anything like it.'ÔÇöClaude B├ędard, Lac-M├ęgantic resident      A spokesperson for Quebec's Environment Ministry says 73 rail cars filled with crude oil were involved. At least four of the cars exploded, sending a huge cloud of thick, black smoke into the air.      The fire, which can be seen for several kilometres, spread to a number of homes. Authorities say some 30 buildings were affected.      \\"It's dreadful,\\" said Lac-M├ęgantic resident Claude B├ędard. \\"It's terrible. We've never seen anything like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is gone.\\"      Firefighters called in from U.S.      More than 150 firefighters, some from as far away as Sherbrooke, Que., and the United States, worked from the early Saturday morning to bring the flames under control. While the fire continued to burn in the afternoon, authorities said it had been contained.      A large but as-yet undetermined amount of fuel is also reported to have spilled into the Chaudi├Ęre River. Some residents say the water has turned an orange colour. Mayor Roy-Laroche assured the public that the town's drinking-water supply is safe, and she encouraged residents to limit their water consumption as much as possible.      Experts from Environment Quebec were also on the scene to keep an eye on the town's air quality.      The cause of the derailment is under investigation.

Translate to English English:","output":"The number of individuals found to be HIV-positive in Montenegro is only 52.  HIV, also known as Human Immunodeficiency Virus, is a virus that targets and alters the immune system, increasing the risk and impact of other infections and diseases. Without treatment, the virus could progress to an advanced disease stage called AIDS, or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome. It's worth noting that the term \\"only\\" is somewhat relative, as even a single case of HIV is significant because of the serious nature of the disease. Even though 52 might seem like a small number compared to the total population, it's still 52 lives profoundly affected. It's also critical because HIV can be spread from person to person, so one undiagnosed or untreated person could potentially transmit the virus to others. Moreover, the actual number of people living with HIV might be higher than reported due to several reasons including stigma associated with the disease leading to under-reporting, lack of access to testing, or individuals being unaware of their status. That's why it's important to continue to promote HIV awareness and prevention measures and ensure everyone has access to HIV testing and treatment. Despite advancements in HIV research, there's no cure yet, making prevention and timely treatment essential. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can help people with HIV live long, healthy lives, and greatly reduces the risk of transmission. In the context of Montenegro, a country in the Balkans, these figures might indicate the effectiveness of the country's HIV prevention efforts, the accessibility to adequate health care services, or possibly lower rate of testing and reporting. However, it's critical to maintain and improve these efforts to ensure that the HIV epidemic is kept under control and the health and wellbeing of the population is prioritized."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing U.S. companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage. That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage. \\"Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies,\\" said Noel D. Matchett, a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc., Silver Spring, Md. It \\"may well be\\" that theft of business data is \\"as serious a strategic threat to national security\\" as it is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms, said Michelle Van Cleave, the White House's assistant director for National Security Affairs. The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association, a joint industry-government trade group. Any secret can be pirated, the experts said, if it is transmitted over the air. Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder. They need only position themselves near a company's satellite dish and wait. \\"You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time,\\" Mr. Matchett said, adding : \\"It's a pretty good bet they won't get caught.\\" The only way to catch an electronic thief, he said, is to set him up with erroneous information.  Do you have any questions?","output":"Sure, let's break this down like we're talking about a big game of hide and seek! Imagine if you had a really special toy that you wanted to keep all to yourself because it's super unique and special. But then you have friends or even some people who aren't your friends, who want to find your toy and take it to share with their friends. This is not good, right? You would lose your toy and what makes it special.  This is basically what's happening to some big companies in America. They have special things (which are called data, like secret codes or plans) that other people from different countries or even their own employees try to steal. It's like they're playing a wrong game of hide and seek! These people stealing these special things is causing a lot of problems. It's like if lots of kids kept taking your special toys - pretty soon, you wouldn't have the best toy box anymore.  To prevent this, some smart people came together for a big talk, like a school meeting, to discuss how to stop these sneaky actions.  But sometimes, these secret plans can be shared through the air, like magic, except it's not magic, it's technology. If someone is really sneaky, and spends a bit of money, they can get some special tools that can catch these secrets, just like how you can catch a ball!  The sneaky person just has to wait near a big dish that sends messages (kind of like a big post office), and then they can steal the secrets. Imagine knowing that many other kids are trying to steal your toys, what a pickle! This makes it very hard to catch the thief, just like in a game of hide and seek. According to a man named Mr. Matchett, one way could be to trick the thief by giving them wrong information.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"In order to evaluate which solution is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning, I need to know the specific solutions you want me to compare. However, since you mentioned the scenario of \\"peeling out\\" of a driveway, I will provide some general tips and considerations based on naive physics reasoning. \\"Peeling out\\" of a driveway usually implies a rapid acceleration and spinning of the tires while exiting the driveway. While this might sound like an entertaining or impressive thing to do, it is not advisable from a perspective of safety or practicality. It can cause damage to the tires, vehicle components, and the driveway itself, as well as posing a risk to pedestrians and other drivers.  With that warning in mind, here are two possible solutions based on naive physics reasoning:  Solution 1 - Front-Wheel Drive:  1. Get into the vehicle, unlock the steering wheel, and start the engine. 2. Depress the brake pedal to ensure that the vehicle remains stationary while engaging the transmission. 3. Set the transmission to \\"Drive\\" or the \\"1\\" gear if using a manual transmission. 4. While maintaining braking pressure, rev the engine by stepping on the gas pedal. Bring the engine's RPM (revolutions per minute) up to a level where you are confident that the tires will begin to spin as soon as you release the brakes. 5. Quickly release the brake pedal and let the front wheels spin and create a peel-out effect. 6. As the vehicle gains momentum, smoothly transition to a controlled acceleration to navigate safely out of the driveway. Solution 2 - Rear-Wheel Drive: 1. Enter the vehicle, unlock the steering wheel, and start the engine. 2. Apply the brake pedal to make sure the vehicle doesn't move while engaging the transmission. 3. Set the transmission to \\"Drive\\" or the \\"1\\" gear if using a manual transmission. 4. While pressing the brake pedal, rev the engine by stepping on the gas pedal. Ramp up the engine's RPM to a level where you believe the tires will start spinning once you release the brakes. 5. Quickly let go of the brake pedal, causing the rear wheels to spin and create the peel-out effect. 6. As the vehicle picks up speed, ease into a controlled acceleration to exit the driveway safely. While these two solutions might work in terms of naive physics reasoning, I must emphasize that peeling out of a driveway is not encouraged as it can lead to unintended consequences and dangerous situations. A more responsible approach would be to exit the driveway at a slow and controlled speed, prioritizing safety over entertainment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The movie will provide an uplifting message of hope, courage, and perseverance in the face of adversity. Plot: Obree, a young and introverted high school student from a dysfunctional family, is passionate about bicycles. His father is an unemployed alcoholic who neglects his family, while his mother is constantly trying to make ends meet. Obree's magnetic pull towards bicycles offers him a much-needed outlet and escape from his challenging life. Despite the financial difficulty, his mother saves up enough money to gift him his first bicycle. However, Obree's excitement is short-lived when he faces bullying from a group of elitist and well-off cyclists from his school. The bullies, led by the notorious Tom, constantly tease, mock, and physically abuse him for his old and rusty bicycle. Unbeknownst to the bullies, Obree discovers an innate talent for cycling. He spends countless hours practicing after school, pushing his limits and improving his skills in secret. One day, Obree stumbles upon a flyer for the upcoming National Junior Cycling Championship and decides to participate. As the competition day draws closer, Obree's mother reveals she must move to another city for work, forcing him to make a choice between a fresh start away from the bullies, or pursuing his dreams in the cycling competition. Determined to prove the bullies wrong, Obree chooses to stay with his grandparents and face the challenges head-on. To prepare for the championship, he turns to Mr. Reynolds, the old and wise bike repairman who becomes his mentor and coach. With his guidance, Obree develops unorthodox cycling techniques that give him an incredible edge against his opponents. The day of the championship arrives, setting the stage for the climactic showdown between Obree, Tom, and the rest of the national junior cyclists. Obree, with his self-built bicycle, struggles through the initial stages of the race. However, as the race progresses, he begins to outperform his competitors using his unconventional cycling methods. In the final stretch of the race, Obree and Tom are neck-and-neck. Just when it seems like Tom is about to win, he resorts to attempting to knock Obree off his bicycle. In a surprising twist of fate, Tom crashes, while Obree skilfully maneuvers out of harm's way and crosses the finish line, winning the championship in a nail-biting finish. The movie concludes with the once-bullied and underestimated Obree receiving resounding applause and admiration from spectators, including his emotionally overwhelmed mother. Tom and the bullies begrudgingly respect Obree's abilities, and the newfound fame and recognition pave the way for a brighter future for Obree."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They belong to the class Cephalopoda, which also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone. Despite their name, cuttlefish are not fish but molluscs.  - Spirula spirula is a species of deep-water squid-like cephalopod mollusk. It is the only extant member of the genus Spirula, the family Spirulidae, and the order Spirulida. Because of the shape of its internal shell, it is commonly known as the ram's horn squid or the little post horn squid. Because the live animal has a light-emitting organ, it is also sometimes known as the tail-light squid.  - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.  - Baltoceratidae is an extinct family of orthoconic cephalopods belonging to the subclass Nautiloidea endemic to what would be Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America during the Ordovician living from about 480460 mya, existing for approximately .  - A cephalopod (pronounced or ) is any member of the molluscan class Cephalopoda (Greek plural , \\"kephalópoda\\"; \\"head-feet\\"). These exclusively marine animals are characterized by bilateral body symmetry, a prominent head, and a set of arms or tentacles (muscular hydrostats) modified from the primitive molluscan foot. Fishermen sometimes call them inkfish, referring to their common ability to squirt ink. The study of cephalopods is a branch of malacology known as teuthology.  - The Ordovician is a geologic period and system, the second of six periods of the Paleozoic Era. The Ordovician spans 41.2 million years from the end of the Cambrian Period million years ago (Mya) to the start of the Silurian Period Mya. The Ordovician, named after the Celtic tribe of the Ordovices, was defined by Charles Lapworth in 1879 to resolve a dispute between followers of Adam Sedgwick and Roderick Murchison, who were placing the same rock beds in northern Wales into the Cambrian and Silurian periods, respectively. Lapworth, recognized that the fossil fauna in the disputed strata were different from those of either the Cambrian or the Silurian periods, and placed them in a period of their own. It received international sanction in 1960, when it was adopted as an official period of the Paleozoic Era by the International Geological Congress.  - The nautilus (from the Latin form of the original Ancient Greek \\"\\", 'sailor') is a pelagic marine mollusc of the cephalopod family Nautilidae, the sole extant family of the superfamily Nautilaceae and of its smaller but near equal suborder, Nautilina.  - The siphuncle is a strand of tissue passing longitudinally through the shell of a cephalopod mollusk. Only cephalopods with chambered shells have siphuncles, such as the extinct ammonites and belemnites, and the living nautiluses, cuttlefish, and \\"Spirula\\". In the case of the cuttlefish, the siphuncle is indistinct and connects all the small chambers of that animal's highly modified shell; in the other cephalopods it is thread-like and passes through small openings in the walls dividing the chambers.  - Baltoceras is a member of the Ellesmerocerida , included in the family , Baltoceratidae . The shell of Baltoceras is slender with a subcircular cross section , straight transverse sutures , and a large siphuncle in contact with the venter . Septal necks are short but not vestigial ; connecting rings are thick ; endosiphonal organic deposits are unknown . Baltoceras ranges in age from Whiterock to Chazy ( Middle Ordovician ) . The few species known are from the upper Pogonip Limestone of Nevada , the Day Point Limestone of New York , and the \`\` Orthoceras limestone '' of the Baltic region of Europe . Baltoceras differs from Rioceras in the same family in that Baltoceras has deeper camerae , longer septal necks and thinner connecting rings . Also Rioceras is earlier , mostly late Canadian in age . It should not be confused with the orthocerid , Balticoceras .  - The Cambrian Period (or ) was the first geological period of the Paleozoic Era, of the Phanerozoic Eon. The Cambrian lasted 55.6 million years from the end of the preceding Ediacaran Period 541 million years ago (mya) to the beginning of the Ordovician Period mya. Its subdivisions, and its base, are somewhat in flux. The period was established (as Cambrian series) by Adam Sedgwick, who named it after Cambria, the Latinised form of \\"Cymru\\", the Welsh name for Wales, where Britain's Cambrian rocks are best exposed. The Cambrian is unique in its unusually high proportion of lagerstätte sedimentary deposits, sites of exceptional preservation where \\"soft\\" parts of organisms are preserved as well as their more resistant shells. As a result, our understanding of the Cambrian biology surpasses that of some later periods.  - The Ellesmerocerida is an order of primitive cephalopods belonging to the subclass Nautiloidea with a widespread distribution that lived during the Late Cambrian and Ordovician.    What is the relationship between 'baltoceras' and 'genus'? A:","output":"Baltoceras is a specific member within the taxonomic classification known as genus. In taxonomy, the genus is a rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms, which is a grouping of related species. In the context of Baltoceras, it belongs to the family Baltoceratidae, which is a group of extinct orthoconic cephalopods. This relationship between Baltoceras and genus signifies that Baltoceras is a representative species within a particular genus, which itself is part of a broader family (Baltoceratidae), subclass (Nautiloidea), and class (Cephalopoda) within the phylum Mollusca. The term \\"genus\\" is used in biology to define a group of species that are closely related through shared characteristics, such as morphology, physiology, and genetics. Thus, Baltoceras is a specific example of a species within a genus, highlighting its unique traits and qualities that set it apart from other species within the same genus or other genera within the family Baltoceratidae."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Eucharist (also called Holy Communion or the Lord's Supper, among other names) is a Christian rite that is considered a sacrament in most churches and an ordinance in others. According to the New Testament, the rite was instituted by Jesus Christ during his Last Supper; giving his disciples bread and wine during the Passover meal, Jesus commanded his followers to \\"do this in memory of me\\" while referring to the bread as \\"my body\\" and the wine as \\"my blood\\". Through the Eucharistic celebration Christians remember Christ's sacrifice of himself on the cross.  The elements of the Eucharist, bread (leavened or unleavened) and wine are consecrated on an altar (or table) and consumed thereafter. Communicants (that is, those who consume the elements) may speak of \\"receiving the Eucharist\\", as well as \\"celebrating the Eucharist\\". Christians generally recognize a special presence of Christ in this rite, though they differ about exactly how, where, and when Christ is present. While all agree that there is no perceptible change in the elements, Catholics believe that they actually become the body and blood of Christ (transubstantiation). Lutherans believe the true body and blood of Christ are really present \\"in, with, and under\\" the forms of the bread and wine (sacramental union). Reformed Christians believe in a real spiritual presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Others, such as the Plymouth Brethren, take the act to be only a symbolic reenactment of the Last Supper. 1.

The text illustrates this by saying, \\"Jesus commanded his followers to 'do this in memory of me' while referring to... the wine as 'my blood'.\\" 3. The bread symbolized Jesus' body in this sacrament. This is explained in the text by referencing Jesus' statement, \\"... while referring to the bread as 'my body'\\". 4.

The specific kind of bread is not clarified beyond the fact that it can be leavened or unleavened. 6. Before it can be eaten, the bread and wine (the elements of the Eucharist) must be consecrated on an altar or table.

This text is missing some spaces, please add them: AlthoughWalliswasaParliamentarianhecertainlyspokeoutagainsttheexecutionofCharlesIand,in1648,hadsignedadocumentopposingtheexecution.","output":"Although Wallis was a Parliamentarian, he certainly spoke out against the execution of Charles I, and, in 1648, he had signed a document opposing the execution. John Wallis, a prominent English mathematician and one of the founding members of the Royal Society, was a Parliamentarian during the English Civil War, which took place between 1642 and 1651. This war happened between the supporters of the Parliament led by Oliver Cromwell (known as the Parliamentarians or Roundheads) and the supporters of King Charles I (known as the Royalists or Cavaliers). Despite being on the side of the Parliamentarians, Wallis had reservations about some of their actions, particularly when it came to the execution of King Charles I. The execution of the King was a controversial decision, and it was a crucial turning point in the conflict between the two factions. In 1648, John Wallis decided to voice his opposition to the King's execution by signing a document that protested against carrying out such an extreme measure. This act was a testament to his belief in a more moderate approach, rather than resorting to taking the King's life. The execution of Charles I eventually took place on January 30, 1649, signaling an end to the monarchy in England and leading to the establishment of the Commonwealth, under the leadership of Oliver Cromwell. This period, also known as the Interregnum, was marked by political and social unrest, eventually resulting in the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 when Charles II took the throne. Wallis's stance on the execution of Charles I is a perfect example of how individuals could maintain their political loyalties while still having concerns about specific actions or policies pursued by their side during times of conflict. Wallis remained committed to his Parliamentarian allegiances but recognized the steep and frankly contentious consequences that the execution of the King would entail. In conclusion, John Wallis, although a Parliamentarian, expressed his disagreement with the execution of King Charles I by signing a document in 1648 opposing this decision. His actions demonstrate that political loyalty does not always mean blind allegiance to every decision, and it's possible to maintain one's beliefs while questioning and challenging specific steps taken by one's chosen side."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Earths magnetic field helps protect Earth and its organisms. It protects us from harmful particles given off by the sun. Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest. This is also where relatively few organisms live. Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earths magnetic north pole. Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations. Recent research suggests that warblers and other migrating birds have structures in their eyes. These structures let them see Earths magnetic field as a visual pattern.

After all, who would choose a plastic toy over a lovely puppy? But Rault argues that the robotic kind has a lot going for it: \\"You don't have to feed it, you don't have to walk it, it won't make a mess in your house, and you can go on a holiday without feeling guilty.\\" The technology also benefits those who are allergic to pets, short on space, or fearful of real animals. It's not clear whether robot pets can replace real ones. But studies do suggest that we can bond with these smart machines. People give their cars names and kids give their toy animals life stories. It's the same with robots. When Sony stopped its repair service for its robot dog Aibo in March 2014, owners in Japan held funerals. As an animal welfare researcher, Rault is concerned about how robotic pets could affect our attitudes towards live animals. \\"If we become used to a robotic companion that doesn't need food, water or exercises, perhaps it will change how humans care about other living beings,\\" he said. So are dogs and cats a thing of the past, as Rault predicts? For those who grew up with living and breathing pets, the mechanical kind might not do.

In the rest of the world, China's supreme sage, Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu), is better known by the romanized name \\"Confucius.\\" He was born in 551 b.c. in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China. So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers. After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \\"Warring States\\" period (475–221 b.c.).  After reading the above, is \\"Ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state relationships, or dire consequences would be paid\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What kind of relationships did Confucius say must be hierarchical and dictorial, and if they are not what would happen?\\"?","output":"Yes, you got it right!

The decision comes in the wake of escalating player costs and the need to attract and retain top talent in the league. The move is seen as a turning point for the sport, promising increased investment in players and greater competition among teams. This article will delve into the motives behind the proposed salary cap raise, its impact on clubs and players, and the benefits that may follow. Reasons Behind the Salary Cap Increase The key reason behind the decision to increase the salary cap is the desire for Super League clubs to stay competitive in the face of growing international markets for rugby talent. Clubs hope to hold onto their star players who may be lured by lucrative contracts offered abroad. Additionally, the salary cap raise is expected to enable teams to attract some of the best global players, ultimately intensifying league competition and improving the overall quality of domestic rugby.  Another motive stems from the pressure to keep up with rival leagues, particularly the National Rugby League (NRL) in Australia and Top 14 in France. Both leagues boast a higher salary cap, providing an incentive for players to explore their options outside of the Super League. By raising the cap, the hope is that players will remain in the Super League, barring some talented individuals from leaving. Implications for Clubs and Players The implications of raising the salary cap to £2.1m could be both positive and negative for Super League clubs and players.  On the positive side, clubs will have the opportunity to deepen their rosters and sign higher-caliber players. Not only will this lead to a more competitive league, but it will undoubtedly create more excitement for rugby fans. Additionally, clubs will also have a better chance of retaining their own home-grown talents and maintaining squad continuity. The new salary cap structure will also benefit the players, who are likely to see improved contracts and better financial rewards. As a result, the prospect of players jumping ship to other leagues will be significantly reduced, and the player welfare in the sport will be improved. On the other hand, clubs may face increased financial pressure to keep up with the new salary cap level. Smaller clubs in particular, without ample financial backing, will need to find ways to generate extra income in order to stay competitive. If they fail to do so, the gap between the top teams and the rest of the league may widen. Potential Long-Term Benefits The proposed raise in the salary cap could lead to long-term benefits for the Super League. With enhanced playing squads, the quality of competition within the league is expected to increase, attracting more fans and generating greater interest in the sport. Increased viewership and fan engagement could translate into higher revenues through sponsorships, merchandise sales, and ticket sales. Furthermore, the Super League could improve its international standing with a higher salary cap, expanding the league's exposure and potentially attracting global talents from across the rugby landscape. Finally, a more competitive league with higher-quality players will be key to the national team's success in international competitions, as the talent pool in the country will grow stronger. Conclusion The unanimous decision by Super League clubs to raise the salary cap to £2.1m by 2020 is a bold move aimed at enhancing league competition and retaining top talent. While there may be financial pressures for some clubs, the long-term benefits of improved competition, increased fan engagement, and a stronger national team suggest that this new structure may be fundamental to the growth and prosperity of the sport in the years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The amnesia victim remembered their home before they remembered their workplace because the","output":"emotional connections associated with their home were stronger and more deeply ingrained in their subconscious mind. This phenomenon can be explained by analyzing the psychology behind memory formation, particularly in terms of emotional memories. Step 1: Analyzing memory formation Memory formation involves a complex interplay of various cognitive processes, which include encoding, storage, and retrieval. Emotional events and information tend to be encoded more deeply and vividly into our brains, increasing the likelihood of recalling them later. This is mainly due to the influence of the amygdala, a key region in the brain's limbic system, which plays a crucial role in emotional processing. Step 2: Understanding the role of emotional memories Emotional memories are typically more salient than neutral memories, and this increased salience makes them easier to recall. Studies have shown that emotionally charged events are stored in a more rich and robust manner than non-emotional ones, contributing to their longevity and easy access during retrieval. Step 3: The significance of home and family memories For most individuals, their home represents a sanctuary, a safe haven filled with cherished memories, love, and comfort. These emotional bonds manifest as strong personal memories associated with their home, making them more accessible and easier to retrieve compared to memories related to a workplace, which might be more neutral or even stressful in nature. Step 4: Comparing emotional quality of home and workplace memories While both home and workplace memories can hold emotional significance, the overall emotional quality of home memories is generally more positive and intense. As a result, the amnesia victim remembered their home first because the emotional memories associated with it were more deeply ingrained and easily retrievable. Step 5: Concluding the explanation In conclusion, the amnesia victim remembered their home before their workplace due to the power of emotional memories and the strong emotional connections that their mind associated with home. These emotional connections help to encode memories more deeply and encode them more vividly, allowing for easier retrieval of these memories when compared to more neutral or less emotionally charged memories, such as those that may be associated with a workplace."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: “Hey, Natalie! Nice sweatshirt!” I was passing through the hallways of school last year, being messenger boy for the teachers, when this girl walked up to me. I had no clue who she was, but I thought she was a year younger than me. That’s why I thought it was weird that she said my name. But the “nice sweatshirt” bit was what really got me. I wasn’t even wearing my sweatshirt. So. There was a substitute teacher in my literacy class, so my class was split. half of us did actual work, and the other half watched a documentary. Ben, Evan, Isabelle and myself were put together in the class watching the super boring documentary. We got bored, so, when Ben left the classroom for a bit and left his jacket behind, I don’t remember why, but, I put on his sweatshirt and traded it for mine. This turned into everyone swapping sweatshirts for the next hour until school was out. At one point I was called to the office to deliver a message to a different classroom. I walked out of the office with the information, and turned around at the sound of my name. “Hey, Natalie! Nice sweatshirt!” I smiled and thanked her like the nice human being I want people to think I am. Once she started down the stairs I looked down at my sweatshirt. Black and orange? Nike? But my sweatshirt’s gray and purple! Then I remembered our little game of “try not to get caught swapping sweatshirts and giggling”. I wasn’t wearing my sweatshirt. Someone else had it. I was wearing Evan’s. It’s also kind of sad because that was one of the only compliments I’ve gotten from a stranger all year.

In Canada, the traditional ceremony for granting assent in parliament was regularly used until the 21st century, long after it had been discontinued in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms. One result, conceived as part of a string of royal duties intended to demonstrate Canada's status as an independent kingdom, was that King George VI personally assented to nine bills of the Canadian parliament during the 1939 royal tour of Canada—85 years after his great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, had last granted royal assent personally in the United Kingdom. Under the Royal Assent Act 2002, however, the alternative practice of granting assent in writing, with each house being notified separately ( the Speaker of the Senate or a representative reads to the senators the letters from the governor general regarding the written declaration of Royal Assent), was brought into force. As the act also provides, royal assent is to be signified—by the governor general, or, more often, by a deputy, usually a Justice of the Supreme Court, at least twice each calendar year: for the first appropriation measure and for at least one other act, usually the first non-appropriation measure passed.

One day, he accepts an assignment from a wealthy businessman, Yam, to remove Yam's deceased father's grave and rebury it, with the hopes that doing so will bring more prosperity to the Yam family. Unfortunately, upon opening the coffin, Kau notices the body is still intact, even though it's been years since he died. Realizing that it is a vampire, Kau orders it to be moved to his house for further study and to be subject to spells that will prevent it from awakening. Kau deduces that Yam's father had died angry, and his last breath became stuck in his body for years, causing it to keep him \\"alive\\" and reducing it to a mindless state. Once in the house, Choi and Sang cover the coffin with enchanted ink to keep the vampire from escaping.

Sean John Combs was born on November 4, 1969 in Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood in New York City, and was raised in Mount Vernon, New York. His mother, Janice (Smalls), was a model and teacher's assistant, and his father, Melvin Earl Combs, served in the U.S. Air Force and was an associate of convicted New York drug dealer Frank Lucas. At age 33, Melvin was shot to death while sitting in his car on Central Park West, when Combs was 2 years old. Combs graduated from the Roman Catholic Mount Saint Michael Academy in 1987. In 1998, Combs started a clothing line, Sean John. It was nominated for the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) award for Menswear Designer of the Year in 2000, and won in 2004. California billionaire Ronald Burkle invested 100 million into the company in 2003.  Also in 2003, the National Labor Committee revealed that factories producing the clothing in Honduras were violating Honduran labor laws. Among the accusations were that workers were subjected to body searches and involuntary pregnancy tests. Bathrooms were locked and access tightly controlled. Employees were forced to work overtime and were paid sweatshop wages. Charles Kernaghan of the National Labor Committee told The New York Times that \\"Sean Puff Daddy obviously has a lot of clout, he can literally do a lot overnight to help these workers.\\"  Combs responded with an extensive investigation, telling reporters \\"I'm as pro-worker as they get\\". On February 14, 2004, Kernaghan announced that improvements had been implemented at the factory, including adding air conditioning and water purification systems, firing the most abusive supervisors, and allowing the formation of a labor union.

Make a new paper away from your resume and cover letter. You don't want to mix them up! 2. Write a big heading on the top of the paper. It's like the title of a storybook. You can write \\"My References\\" or \\"Who Can Tell You I'm Awesome!\\", or any other fun title that makes you happy. 3. Now, it's time to write the names of your references. Under your fun title, write the first reference's name, how you know them (like your teacher or mom's friend), their phone number, and their email address.  4. Keep doing step 3 for all your references. Remember, it's important to choose people who can say nice things about you. And that's it!

Option C: Identifying traffic or safety hazards at intersections may be useful for ensuring general safety, but it doesn't directly address preventing child molestation. Option D: Using dolls or toys to make role-playing situations less intimidating is highly relevant to the context as it provides a practical suggestion for teaching safety basics and mimicking potential predator situations. Part #3: Pick the best ending for the context and justify the choice. Usage: In this case, the best ending for the context is Option D.

Less than two years old at the time, Charles treated Anne with 'great care', the Queen wrote to her friend Mrs Tanner. She also wrote that 'it will be fun when they are able to play together'. Family life: The Queen at her coronation (far left) Prince Charles (centre left) and Princess Anne (centre right) with their father The Duke of Edinburgh (far right) '","output":"The young prince, who had been an only child up until that point, was clearly enamored by the arrival of his baby sister, the Queen's letter reveals. Destined to become close siblings, their bond would only grow stronger in the years to come. In that letter to Mrs. Tanner, an intimate glimpse into the royal household was shared. The Queen described the enchanting dynamics among the young royals, with Charles demonstrating a natural and gentle protectiveness over his newborn sister. Even in their infancy, the pair displayed qualities of friendship and affection for one another that would define their sibling relationship in the future. As the Prince and Princess grew older, their shared experiences increased, and the two found solace in each other's companionship. They endured the pressures of royal life, navigated the world stage, and found their sense of duty and identity in the face of public scrutiny and growing demands with remarkable resilience. Besides their royal duties, both Charles and Anne developed their unique passions and interests. Prince Charles pursued his love for the environment, architecture, and the arts, culminating in his creation of The Prince's Trust, a charitable organization that has had a profound impact on the lives of many young people. Meanwhile, Princess Anne gravitated towards her love of horses, becoming an accomplished equestrian and proudly representing Britain in the Olympics. These personal endeavors only strengthened their bond as they found pride and admiration in each other's achievements. Through the years, Charles and Anne have also supported their mother, the Queen, as she navigated her long and impactful reign. They have stood by her side, fulfilling their duties and upholding the values of the monarchy for the British public as well as the world. Today, the early admiration and affection captured in that letter have manifested into a deep-rooted friendship and genuine support for one another. This was especially evident during difficult times, such as the tragic death of their former sister-in-law, Princess Diana, and the tumultuous period that followed. In conclusion, this rare letter written by the Queen gives us a precious insight into the early beginnings of the remarkable bond between Prince Charles and Princess Anne. Their lifelong friendship has been a testament to the enduring love that has united the royal family and remains a vital source of strength for both siblings as they continue to navigate the challenges of a life of service and public duty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the most logical next event? How to change cat food  Pick cat food based on life stage.  The nutritional needs of your cat will change as they grow and age, so you should change their food when they are making a life transition. If your kitten is becoming a cat or your adult cat is becoming a senior, you should choose a food that is appropriate for their new stage of life.","output":"The most logical next event after selecting the appropriate cat food based on the life stage is to properly introduce the new food to your cat and monitor their response to it. This involves gradually mixing the new food with the old food over a period of time to prevent potential digestive upsets and food rejection. Here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how to do it: 1. Research and select the appropriate cat food: Before making the switch, take the time to research various cat food brands and options that cater to your cat's specific life stage and dietary requirements. Consult with your veterinarian to discuss your cat's nutritional needs and any health concerns that may require special consideration. 2. Gradual transition: Introducing new food to your cat should be a gradual process to minimize the risk of stomach issues and to increase the likelihood of your cat accepting the new food. Begin by mixing a small amount of the new food with the old food in the ratio of roughly 25% new food to 75% old food. Use this mixture for two to three days, closely observing your cat's reaction and ensuring they are eating it well. 3. Increase the ratio: After the initial period, gradually increase the ratio of the new food to old food by mixing approximately 50% new food and 50% old food. Continue this process for another two to three days, taking note of any changes in your cat's appetite, digestion, or overall health. 4. Continue to adjust the ratio: As your cat gets used to the change, further adjust the ratio of new food to old food to about 75% new food and 25% old food. Maintain this mixture for another two to three days, closely observing your cat's response. 5. Complete the switch: If your cat has tolerated the transition well and is readily eating the new food, it's time to fully replace the old food with the new food. As a precaution, closely monitor your cat's behavior, appetite, and digestion for a few more days to ensure they are adjusting well to their new diet. 6. Create a consistent feeding routine: Cats thrive on consistency. Once your cat has adapted to their new food, establish a regular feeding schedule at consistent times of the day. Maintaining a routine will help your cat feel more secure and avoid stress-related digestive issues. 7. Monitor your cat's condition and weight: After the transition to the new food, it's essential to keep an eye on your cat's overall health and wellbeing. Regularly weigh your cat and ensure they are in a healthy weight range for their age and breed. If you notice any signs of weight loss or gain, lethargy, or other health concerns, consult your veterinarian for recommendations. Remember that changing cat food is not a one-size-fits-all process. Each cat is unique, and their response to a new food may differ. Be patient, attentive, and flexible during the transition period, and consult your veterinarian if you have concerns or questions about your cat's specific nutritional needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The seasonal outing of ITV's popular period drama will be screened at 20:30 GMT - the same time as BBC One's flagship soap. Doctor Who will be screened at 19:30 GMT, going head to head with an hour-long Coronation Street on ITV. Downton's third Christmas special sees the action shift to 1923 and has US actor Paul Giamatti joining the cast. The two-hour episode centres on the Crawleys' wayward family member Rose being presented at Buckingham Palace, a grand occasion that sees Cora's mother Martha - played by Shirley MacLaine - return to the drama. It will also see Giamatti makes his Downton debut as Martha's brother Harold, who was in trouble with the law at the end of the last series. The show's producers are keeping tight-lipped about the fate of Lady Edith and her pregnancy, saying only that she is \\"wrestling with a moral dilemma\\". Last year's Christmas Day special climaxed in the unexpected death of Downton heir Matthew Crawley, leaving behind his wife, Lady Mary, and their newborn son. Its first hour overlapped with EastEnders in 2012. Final audience figures gave EastEnders the edge, scoring 11.2 million viewers over Downton's 10.2 million. This year the second hour of Downton Abbey's seasonal special will be up against BBC One sitcom Mrs Brown's Boys. The Christmas Day episode of Doctor Who will see Matt Smith battle deadly enemies, including the Daleks and the Cybermen, before regenerating into Peter Capaldi. In BBC One's schedule, the sci-fi drama finds itself sandwiched between Call the Midwife and EastEnders. Albert Square will see the arrival of a new landlord for the Queen Vic pub, Mick Carter, played by Danny Dyer. The ongoing murder storyline involving Janine Butcher is also expected to figure highly in EastEnders' hour-long special. On the cobbles of Coronation Street, producers have revealed that Leanne and Nick Tilsley's relationship will take a turn for a worse. Yet the tragic storyline involving long-serving character Hayley Cropper is not expected to end until early next year.","output":"\\"Downton Abbey Christmas Special: New Cast and Intrigues\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Not all states recognize guardianship letters. Instead, they require that even temporary custody issues be handled through the courts. Hypothesis: There are some letters some states do not allow.","output":"Yes, we can draw the following hypothesis based on the given context: Hypothesis: There are certain types of letters, such as guardianship letters, that some states do not allow. This hypothesis is supported by the context, which says \\"Not all states recognize guardianship letters.\\" This statement indicates that in some states, guardianship letters are not considered an acceptable means for transferring the temporary custody of a child. Furthermore, the context emphasizes the fact that legal guardianship and custody matters are bound by state laws, which vary across the United States. In states where guardianship letters are not recognized, the process for transferring temporary custody usually requires official intervention through the court system. The context makes it clear that \\"they require that even temporary custody issues be handled through the courts.\\" This means that people living in such states cannot rely solely on a written guardianship letter to transfer temporary custody of a child. In summary, the hypothesis that there are some letters some states don't allow, specifically guardianship letters, is supported by the given context.

The triumphant story of an underdog racehorse and the men who believed in him is beautifully portrayed through Laura Hillenbrand's compelling narrative. Her historical research is impeccable, providing readers with a rich tapestry of life during the Great Depression.

Furthermore, Hillenbrand's portrayal of the relationships between the characters adds an emotional depth to this true account, making it not only informative but also highly engaging. Review 3: A Page-Turner That Appeals to All One of the most striking features of \\"Seabiscuit\\" is its ability to captivate readers regardless of their interest in horse racing.

Conversely, the setbacks faced by the protagonist break the heart, but add to the richness of the narrative and make the eventual triumph all the more gratifying.

It successfully brings the excitement, intensity, and emotion of Seabiscuit's journey to the big screen. However, those who have read the book will find a deeper appreciation for the story's various elements, including Hillenbrand's rich historical context and incredibly detailed descriptions of events. In conclusion, \\"Seabiscuit\\" is a captivating, well-researched, and emotionally charged book that has a universal appeal.

The reason being that the perturbation directly interferes with the efficiency or effectiveness of a particular stage, ultimately affecting the amount of sediment being transported. For example, a decrease in wind speed could be a direct perturbation, as it would directly affect the ability of the wind to pick up and transport the sediment. Similarly, an increase in vegetation cover in the area might also be considered a direct perturbation, as it could hinder the wind's ability to move and transport sediment effectively. However, in some cases, the perturbation could be categorized as indirect, such as when it affects the conditions of the environment or the sediment source, thereby altering the overall transport process. For example, a reduction in soil erosion at the sediment source might lead to a decrease in the amount of sediment available for transportation by the wind.

The more they learn about pet food, the better able they will be to make an informed decision that will keep their pet healthier and safer.\\" Here are several tips that consumers may want to keep in mind when it comes to choosing a pet food that will help reduce the risks. Get to know the company. Most people may know a company name simply because they spend millions on advertising. But that doesn't mean they know much about the company or their morals. Research companies to find one that offers high standards, quality products, and great customer service. Ask questions. Don't be afraid to get in touch with a pet food company and ask them where something was made, where ingredients  came from, or any other questions.

Review: Samuel Fuller brings his customary playful and stylish direction to this seedy, pulpy story and manages to create one of the undiscovered gems of 1950s cinema. Richard Widmark plays a petty thief tough guy (a role he perfected over the course of many movies), who snatches a young lady's (Jean Peters) wallet on a New York subway and with it a piece of much-wanted microfilm. This is 1953, so of course the microfilm is property of Commie spies who will stop at nothing to get it back. When the girl shows up at Widmark's waterfront shack, sent by an abusive boyfriend to reclaim the film, Widmark senses the opportunity to shake her and her \\"comrades\\" down for big money. The plot thickens, people start dying, and Widmark and Peters fall in love. Fuller handles the love story clumsily, but more from a sense of indifference than bad writing or direction. It's as if he included a love story under duress, and so made it intentionally unbelievable, as love stories so frequently were and still are in Hollywood films. Peters gives a remarkable performance as a tough New Yawk cookie, part gangster moll and part damsel in distress. When violence occurs against her, we genuinely care about her well being, and it's typical of Fuller's renegade, ahead-of-his-time style that a happy ending is not necessarily a foregone conclusion. But the ultimate success of \\"Pickup on South Street\\" rests squarely on the world-weary shoulders of Thelma Ritter, who plays Moe, a feisty lady who makes money any way she can, whether that be selling neckties or acting as a police informant. Ritter gives the performance of her career; in a breathtaking monologue, she conveys without ever directly addressing it the entire sad trajectory of her character's life, and the hopelessness she feels waking up every morning to a world of struggle, crime and hardship. It's as if every character Ritter ever played converges for one brief instant to give vent to all of the emotions they weren't given a chance to vent in those other movies. The scene is the highlight of Fuller's film, and a highlight of 50s cinema, period.

We have record rainfall during 24 hours in Lahore, breaking previous one day record by more than 60%. Our drainage system is pathetic. Other systems such as telephone, electricity, cable etc. are no better. Poor planning has further been aggravated by extremely mismanaged maintenance and operational bugs. This morning, when I was out for our fajr (morning prayers) in masjid, a neighbor told me that the pole laden with electricity meters was under fire. After that he buzzed off for complaint office. When I returned after prayers, I saw fire reaching cable part after meter; one meter had caught fire and other meters (including ours) was in danger of catching fire. It was still dark. I waited for someone to come out. No one appeared. I came inside and told my wife about and went again out to see if I could find someone to go about extinguishing fire. IT WAS DAM RISKY AS DIGGING WAS DONE BY TELEPHONE COMPANY AND RAINS HAD MADE A MESS ON OUR STREET. No one was seen. My wife came out; brought hose pipe. I managed to use it as water gun and there was some post-extinguishing sparking; fire was put out. I want to add here that hose pipe should only be used when someone knows how to send bursts of water so that electric current cannot build a circuit.

The narrator finished his prayers and on his way back home, noticed that the fire had spread to the cable part of the meter. One meter was already aflame and other meters —including his own— were at risk of catching fire.  4. Seeing that the situation was risky due to recent rainfall and digging work done by the telephone company, he felt the need to take action. However, he couldn't find anyone around to help.  5. He informed his wife about the situation. She brought out a hose pipe. 6. Using the hose pipe as a water gun, the narrator managed to extinguish the fire. He ensured to use it in a way so that the electric current couldn't build a circuit, which required sending bursts of water. 7. Later in the day, the narrator was surprised to learn that other people had been aware of the fire but had not taken any action to help. He plans to discuss this issue with his neighbors. 8.

Pelecanos is more interested in working families struggling to get by, the racial tensions in its ethnic neighborhoods and the low-lifes on the edges. His crime-writing peers call Pelecanos the \\"undisputed poet\\" of Washington's gritty side. The best-selling and award-winning author is out this week with his 17th and latest novel, \\"The Cut.\\" It's the first in a new series featuring Iraq war veteran and private investigator Spero Lucas. When he's not working for a Washington defense attorney, Lucas recovers stolen property for a 40% cut. Now, a high-profile crime boss hires Lucas to find out who's been stealing from him, and it could turn out to be Lucas' biggest payday or an untimely end. While Pelecanos made his bones in the noir tradition, there's a definite \\"Western\\" feel to \\"The Cut.\\" The new novel takes place in a morally gray and often violent world. It's peppered with pitch-perfect dialogue and captures the sights, sounds and taste of Washington in rich detail. In short, Pelecanos reads like the real deal. Pelecanos knows a thing or two about capturing the authenticity of urban America with an ethnically and socially diverse cast.

To grasp the reasoning behind this, let's analyze both the premise and the hypothesis more thoroughly. 1. The premise: \\"The other one, I don't remember.\\" This statement suggests that the speaker has forgotten, or at least cannot distinctly recall, information regarding \\"the other one.\\" It may imply that there are at least two options being evaluated, but it doesn't provide any concrete information about either option. Additionally, the phrase \\"I don't remember\\" implies uncertainty, which further complicates drawing any conclusions. 2. The hypothesis: \\"It is this one, I recall.\\" The hypothesis attempts to establish a claim of certainty regarding \\"this one,\\" implying that the speaker has a clear recollection or understanding of it. However, without any additional context or information, it is impossible to determine a direct relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Now, considering both the premise and the hypothesis, it can be argued that the statement \\"It is this one, I recall.\\" might be true, as the speaker could be contrasting \\"this one\\" with \\"the other one\\" they don't remember. However, without any further context or information, this connection cannot be assured. It is also possible that the speaker has remembered something unrelated to the initial premise, making the certainty behind the hypothesis unrelated to the original topic. In conclusion, due to the lack of context and the uncertainty implied by the premise, it is not possible to definitively determine the truth of the hypothesis \\"It is this one, I recall.\\" As a result, the most accurate selection among the given options is [ii] it is not possible to tell."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: Pick out a few ears that are at the ideal stage of ripeness for eating fresh and remove the husks and all traces of remaining silk. While you're shucking, heat a large pot of water until it just begins to boil, then add the corn. At the 3 minute mark, remove the ears from the pot carefully and set them aside on a layer of paper towels to cool. Leave the blanching water to continue boiling. You'll be using it later to pack the corn for canning. Allow the corn to rest until it's cool enough to handle. Then, stand each ear vertically on its end and run a knife down the side to loosen the whole kernels from the cob. Use a large bowl to collect the kernels as they fall, or scrape them into the bowl from your cutting board.  Be careful not to let the blade of the knife scrape against the cob. This can release a starchy liquid from the kernels, which may impact the flavor of the canned corn or it's ability to be safely preserved.  An electric knife can come in handy for making quick, clean cuts. If one of these tools isn't available, you can use either a smooth or serrated blade, provided it's sharp enough to avoid mangling the kernels. Spoon the kernels into the mouth of each jar, leaving 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space at the top. Give the jar a shake to help the corn settle. Avoid packing or compressing the kernels, as this may damage them.  It will take about 2.25 pounds (1,020 g) of whole corn, or about 4 average-sized ears, to fill 1 US-pint (470 ml)-sized canning jar. Double that amount for quart-sized jars.  Heat your canning jars under a stream of hot water before adding the corn. This will prevent them from cracking or shattering when you add the boiling canning liquid. The exact temperature isn't that important as long as the jars are still warm to the touch when the corn goes in. Though it's not a strict requirement, a little bit of salt can help preserve canned goods more effectively and for longer periods. For pint jars, a ½ teaspoon pinch will do. For larger quart-sized jars, you can use up to 1 full teaspoon. Use granulated iodized salt or kosher salt only. Pour the hot liquid steadily into each jar until it reaches the top layer of kernels. Avoid overfilling the jars—once again, you'll want to leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of headspace. Let the jars sit open for 3-5 minutes to cool slightly and allow trapped air bubbles to escape.  It may help to use a funnel or ladle to safely get the boiling liquid from the pot to the jars. Overfilling may cause the jars to burst when they're subjected to intense pressure. Place the jars in your canner and lock the lid, leaving the heat vent open. Adjust the canner to the appropriate pressure setting specified by the model and start it up. Once the steam stops escaping, close the vent. Pint jars should process for 55 minutes, while quart jars will need about 85. Afterwards, you can cool them off and put them into storage. When preserved by canning, sweet corn will stay good for a year or longer.  The exact pressure level you use will depend on the quantity of corn you're canning, as well as your location. As a general rule, however, you'll want to keep it somewhere between 11–13 pounds (5.0–5.9 kg).  Alternatively, you can do your canning the old fashioned way by submerging the sealed jars in boiling water until you hear the lids pop. Summary:","output":"This article talks about how to can sweet corn. First, pick ripe corn and remove the husks and silk. Boil the corn for 3 minutes, then let it cool. Cut the corn off the cob and fill jars with the kernels. Heat the jars with hot water, and add a little salt. Pour hot liquid over the corn in the jars and let them cool. Finally, put the jars in a canner and process them. Canned corn can stay good for a year or more."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer the following question: The sighting of a killer whale (or orca) can be rare, but they do love to hunt and play in the waters between Vancouver and Seattle, so one of the activities we absolutely wanted to do (in addition to the harbour seaplane flight) was to go whale watching. Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. Honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the NHS. Forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from Vancouver. Not having much success closer to the British Columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the Canadian/American border. Incredibly, the resident killer whales of the San Juan Islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. Stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human. Much of what is known about the orca whale’s highly-organized social life has been learned from the resident pods in the San Juan Islands of Washington. Where are the killer whales most studied?

Write an article based on this \\"Discuss prescription topical drugs with your doctor. Inquire about prescription oral drugs if your acne is severe. Look into chemical peels to help even out your skin. Ask about laser and light treatments to minimize scars.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Exploring Advanced Acne Treatments: Discussing Options with Your Doctor Introduction: Acne is a common skin condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Although many people tackle acne with over-the-counter treatments or lifestyle changes, it may not be enough for some, especially those who experience severe or persistent acne. In such cases, discussing advanced treatment options with a trusted medical professional becomes crucial. This article will guide you through various advanced acne treatments, such as prescription topical and oral drugs, chemical peels, and laser and light treatments. Step 1: Discussing Prescription Topical Drugs If your current over-the-counter treatments have proven ineffective, it is vital to consult a dermatologist and discuss prescription topical drugs. Topical medications can be more potent and are typically applied on the skin in the form of creams, gels, or lotions. They help unclog pores, reduce inflammation, and target acne-causing bacteria. Examples of these medications include tretinoin, adapalene, and antibiotics such as clindamycin or erythromycin. A dermatologist can provide the necessary guidance to choose the appropriate medication, dosage, and application that best suit your skin type and condition. Step 2: Inquiring About Prescription Oral Drugs In cases of severe acne, it is essential to consider prescription oral drugs, which powerfully combat acne from within the body. Some oral medications work by regulating hormone levels, decreasing oil production, or eliminating bacteria. Examples of prescription oral drugs include antibiotics, birth control pills (for women), and isotretinoin. It is important to discuss potential side-effects, possible drug interactions, and any contraindications with your doctor before considering this treatment option. Step 3: Considering Chemical Peels Chemical peels can help to address acne and uneven skin tone by applying a chemical solution to the skin's surface, which then peels off to reveal a smoother layer beneath. This treatment can improve the texture and overall appearance of acne-prone skin. Some chemical peels are available over the counter, while others require a medical professional to administer them. Discussing the intensity, frequency, and potential side effects with a dermatologist will ensure the safe and effective use of chemical peels. Step 4: Exploring Laser and Light Treatments Laser and light therapies are advanced non-invasive treatment options used to minimize acne scars and improve skin texture. These treatments work by targeting acne-causing bacteria and stimulating collagen production to reduce scarring. A variety of devices are employed for this purpose, including intense pulsed light (IPL), fractional laser devices, and blue-light therapy. Consulting with a dermatologist will help to determine which treatment method is most appropriate for your specific skin concerns. Conclusion: Advanced acne treatments can greatly improve skin health and appearance, but they should be approached with caution and expertise. It is essential to consult a dermatologist to guide you through the process and ensure that the chosen treatments are suited to your unique needs. By discussing prescription topical and oral drugs, chemical peels, and laser and light treatments with your doctor, you can explore the most effective options in your quest for clearer, healthier skin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

It may not affect all users, and it could be resolved by a future update, or there may even be a workaround for the issue. 3. The reviewer is hopeful that the problem can be fixed soon, which indicates a certain level of trust in the app developers. If the developers receive enough feedback regarding the issue, they will likely prioritize fixing it, ensuring that the app returns to its previous functionality. Based on these points, I would recommend the app to a friend, but with the caveat that they should monitor reviews and updates to see if the mapping issue is resolved. It might also be beneficial for them to test the app themselves to verify if they experience the same problem or not. Until the issue is resolved, the recommendation remains in the \\"Maybe\\" category but could easily shift to \\"Yes\\" or \\"Definitely\\" once the app returns to its previously satisfactory performance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Question: He was running from the assailant, what is his purpose for running?  Choices:  - accidents - moving fast - injuries - shortness of breath - exercise  The rationale to choose \\"moving fast\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"The purpose of him running from the assailant is to create distance and ensure his own safety. Out of the given choices, \\"moving fast\\" is the most appropriate answer, as it directly relates to the need for him to cover more ground quickly in order to avoid potential danger. The rationale behind choosing \\"moving fast\\" over the other options can be explained as follows: - \\"Accidents\\": This choice focuses on unintended events or mishaps, which is not the main concern when someone is running from an assailant. The primary objective is to evade the attacker to protect oneself, not to avoid accidents. - \\"Injuries\\": While running away from an assailant may result in injuries, the purpose of running in this situation is not to get injured but to escape from harm. So, this choice does not accurately represent the person's goal in this situation. - \\"Shortness of breath\\": This choice refers to a physical sensation or symptom experienced during or after strenuous activity, such as running. It does not represent the primary goal or purpose of running away from an assailant, which is to ensure personal safety. - \\"Exercise\\": This choice implies that the person is running for the sake of physical fitness. In the context of the situation, exercise is not the main motivation for running away from an attacker. The person's primary concern is to escape potential harm, not to improve their physical fitness.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: In addition to clove oil, you can also use clove in its whole herbal form. Take one to three whole pieces of clove and place them on the tooth right next to the painful one in your mouth. Wait a few minutes for the clove pieces to soften, then gently bite down on them, releasing the clove oils. Leave them in the area for 20 minutes.  Afterwards, rinse your mouth out with a warm salt water solution. The cloves can taste really strong and cause tingling in your mouth. This is normal. The taste should disappear in your mouth about 10 minutes. You can buy whole cloves at most grocery stores. In addition to its whole form, you can also use ground clove as well. Measure out ⅛ teaspoon of ground cloves into a bowl. Mix in ¼ teaspoon of olive oil and stir together until mixed. Take a cotton swab and dip it into the mixture, then apply the clove infused oil to the painful tooth and the surrounding gum.  Leave it on the tooth for 20 minutes. After this, rinse your mouth out with warm salt water. You can also just add a pinch of the ground clove directly in your mouth on the area of your painful tooth. Your saliva will mix with the clove and help your tooth. You can buy ground cloves in the baking section of most grocery stores. Clove infused water can also help your tooth pain.

However, getting more pocket money naturally leads to having more financial freedom, and with this freedom comes more responsibility. Are you sure you're capable of handling that responsibility? Lily: Yes, I think so. I've done well with saving and not overspending with the amount I currently get. Also, I promise I won't spend the additional money on unnecessary items.

To provide a detailed and long response, we can assume a situation where the reviewer had an unpleasant dining experience. Title: Disappointing Experience at [Restaurant Name] I recently visited [Restaurant Name] with high expectations, as I had heard many great things about their cuisine and service. Sadly, I was thoroughly disappointed by my experience and feel compelled to share my thoughts in this detailed review. Firstly, upon entering the establishment, I noticed that the overall ambiance and cleanliness were lacking. The lighting was either too dim or too harsh in various areas, creating an unwelcoming atmosphere. Additionally, the tables and chairs were not properly maintained, as several of them wobbled and appeared somewhat worn out. The menu had an extensive range of dishes, which seemed promising at first glance. However, when our server arrived to take our order, he appeared to be inattentive and disinterested. Despite my efforts to ask for recommendations or clarification on specific dishes, the server provided minimal assistance and seemed more concerned with finishing our order as quickly as possible, rather than ensuring we would enjoy our meal. As for the food itself, the quality and presentation left much to be desired. Our appetizers arrived lukewarm, and the flavors were bland and uninteresting. One of the dishes, the fried calamari, was overly greasy and lacked the crisp texture I had anticipated. The main courses followed suit in their mediocrity. My steak was overcooked and smothered in a heavy sauce that failed to enhance the dish. My partner's pasta was under-seasoned and the sauce lacked depth. To make matters worse, the time between courses was excessive, with our table left waiting for more than 30 minutes between our appetizers and main courses. Additionally, our server rarely checked on us during this time, and we had to flag down another member of the wait staff to request more bread and water. Lastly, the overall value for the price of our meal was underwhelming. The portion sizes were smaller than expected, and given the quality of the dishes, I found it difficult to justify the expense. Moreover, there were no efforts on the part of the staff or management to address or rectify the shortcomings we experienced during our meal. In conclusion, I cannot recommend [Restaurant Name] based on my experience. The combination of poor service, underwhelming food quality, lackluster ambiance, and steep pricing left me feeling regretful of my decision to dine there. I sincerely hope that they take the necessary steps to improve in these areas in order to provide a better experience for future guests."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On 20 July at about 3:00 am, after a fierce bombardment, Hungarian infantry including all three groups crossed the Tisza River and attacked Romanian positions. On 20 July, in the northern arena, the Hungarians army Rakamaz and some nearby villages. Troops of the Romanian 16th and 2nd Vânători divisions took back the villages shortly and regained Rakamaz the next day. The Hungarians renewed their efforts and, supported by artillery fire, retook Rakamaz and two nearby villages but could not break out of the Rakamaz bridgehead. Hungarian forces attempted to outflank the Romanian positions by crossing the Tisza River at Tiszafüred  with troops of the 80th International Brigade. There they were halted by troops of the Romanian 16th Division. On 24 July the Romanian 20th Infantry Division, brought in as reinforcements, cleared the bridgehead at Tiszafüred.

Unfortunately, the attainment of such an all-consuming goal has not produced the peace and happiness that was expected. There was a dark side to success. Fairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits. The majority of these studies agree on one thing – there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career. The studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals – it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed. The danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources. Professional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level. Psychology Today tells us that “Burnout is one of those road hazards in life that high-achievers really should be keeping a close eye out for, but sadly – often because of their “I can do everything” personalities, they rarely see it coming.” According to the above context, answer the following question. Why will stress be detrimental to a person? Answer:","output":"Stress will be detrimental to a person when it is relentless, not properly managed, and becomes accepted as the norm. This chronic stress can lead to professional burnout, which debilitates the individual, preventing them from functioning effectively on both personal and professional levels. The depletion of resources and lack of recovery time further exacerbate the negative effects of uncontrolled stress on mental health and overall well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nine-year-old Hogarth Hughes follows a trail of the forest's destruction and frees the robot, who is stuck in the power cables of an electrical substation. After being rescued by and befriended by Hogarth, the Giant follows him back to his house, where he lives with his widowed mother Annie. Upon their return, the Giant attempts to eat the rails off the ties of the nearby railroad tracks. Alarmed by the sound of an oncoming train, Hogarth tells the giant to repair the tracks. The Giant attempts this, but takes too long, causing the train to collide with his head. Hogarth hides the damaged robot in their barn where he discovers the robot is self repairing.Later that night, Hogarth returns to the barn with a stack of comic books to read to the Giant. The Giant is impressed with Superman, but distressed when he discovers a comic about an evil robot; Hogarth tells the Giant that he can be \\"who you choose to be\\". Investigating the destroyed substation, U.S. government agent Kent Mansley discovers evidence of the Giant and decides to continue his inquiries in nearby Rockwell.

He is paranoid about an alien invasion and alerts the U.S. Army to the possible presence of the Giant. Worried that they will get caught, Hogarth evades Mansley and takes the Giant to beatnik artist Dean McCoppin, who passes off the robot as one of his works of scrap-metal art when Mansley and Lieutenant General Guy Rogard investigate. Once Mansley and Rogard are gone, Hogarth plays with the Giant using a toy gun, but inadvertently causes the Giant to activate a defence mechanism.

Firstly, he was seen managing A.F.C. Blackpool, a football club based in Blackpool, Lancashire, which competes in the North West Counties Football League. His managerial role involved strategic decision-making, performance improvement, ensuring the coordination among the players, and overall team building to maintain the superior performance of the club. His expertise and leadership profoundly impacted the strategies, game style, and player development program on A.F.C. Blackpool. On the other side, Stuart Parker held a different but equally significant role with Blackpool F.C., another professional football club, also based in Blackpool, Lancashire. Blackpool F.C. is known to participate in the English Football League (EFL). Here, Parker was not managing the role but was a club footballer. His primary role involved playing in various positions depending upon the demands of the game and undertaking responsibilities of a professional footballer. His job was to follow the gameplay carved out by the manager, execute the strategies during the matches, and bring success and glory to the team. Thus, Stuart Parker's association with both A.F.C.

His sporting journey has witnessed his involvement in the game through not just playing but also being an influential decision-maker, enhancing the quality of football in both the clubs and enriching them with his skills and experiences.

I never loved anything more in this world than these three right here. I raised them from birth to almost 11 weeks. While my mom wanted money, selling the others to anyone.(there was 11 in the litter) I cared for their safety and happiness and quality of life. They were my everything when I had nothing. I gave them away to a animal charity organization for free. My mom bitched at me for not getting money for them. At this time I was in severe depression, severe poverty, no chance of a job due to location, and wearing dirty clothes for months in her basement. I love animals to death, I love animals more than I love humans(but I'm no PETA activist). I loved these puppies, what I did was out of complete love and care for them and was seriously the hardest thing I have ever done in my entire life. It gets me very emotional thinking about this, I wish I was in a better position to give them a happy life. The black puppy, Lilo was my upmost favorite. She had the whine of a angel. She used it to always get my attention to give her more love. She always wanted to sleep with me every night and be with me every second of the day.

Give them to a teacher, a colleague, or a teenager perhaps, and you can show you have at least thought about them, without second-guessing their tastes. But last year thousands of consumers were left out of pocket, when HMV, Blockbuster, Comet and Jessops all went out of business after the Christmas period. Most vouchers were eventually honoured but only after a period of uncertainty. In the case of Jessops, now under new management, some people were offered replacement gifts, but customers with vouchers worth, in total, more than half a million pounds never saw their money back. The fact is, if you buy a gift card, there is no guarantee it will be honoured if the shop goes out of business. So can they be trusted? Not at the moment, argues Deborah Harvey, from Newport in south Wales. She and Louise McDaid run  Safeguard All Savings, a website dedicated to protecting consumers' money. She believes passionately that gift cards and vouchers should be guaranteed if a retailer goes out of business. \\"If I give you £10, I expect to be able to spend £10; not to be told, 'Well actually, your voucher has expired, you can't use it. And by the way, we've just gone bust, so you definitely can't spend it,'\\" she says. She believes the best option would be for voucher money to be ring-fenced. In other words retailers would have to keep that money in a separate account for a specified period. Another issue is that voucher-holders are well down the list of creditors, should a retailer go out of business. They are currently on the fifth tier, alongside suppliers and the taxman. Only shareholders are less likely to get their money back. The body which represents the gift card business would like to see card holders moved up the priority list. For the moment, any administrator looking at the books of a retailer is obliged to pay the banks which have lent money to the business, the costs of the administration, and staff salaries, long before they look at gift card holders. \\"If a retailer goes in to administration, the decision to continue to accept gift cards and vouchers is down to the individual administrator,\\" says Andrew Johnson, the director general of the UK Gift Card and Voucher Association. A recent study by a body representing insolvency specialists looked at other possible solutions. These included the idea of making retailers who offer gift cards buy a protection bond, a form of insurance which would pay out if a retailer went bust. They also considered the idea of extending the Consumer Credit Act. Currently anyone who buys vouchers worth more than £100 on a credit card is protected, in theory by both the credit card company and the retailer. Where a retailer has gone bust, that responsibility in practice rests with the credit card provider. The Act could, in theory, be extended to include smaller purchases. However, retailers could be severely affected by such liabilities. Many of them trade on notoriously thin margins as it is. Indeed some argue that shops might be even more likely to go bust, should they have to honour gift cards. \\"All of these options are quite difficult to administer, and they are also quite costly,\\" says Andrew Tate of the Association of Business Recovery Professionals. \\"Taking cash flow out of a business in the current economic climate is difficult,\\" he says. So what should consumers do if they are considering buying gift cards or vouchers this Christmas? First of all, they should watch their local high street carefully. Blockbuster, the video chain, has already announced its intention to call in the administrators, for the second time. \\"I'm really concerned that there's going to be something again this Christmas,\\" says Deborah Harvey from Newport. \\"And it's going to be too late for anyone to do anything about it,\\" she warns. The UK Gift Card and Voucher Association advises customers to think very carefully about where they buy vouchers from. It says as long as you trust the retailer, you should trust their vouchers. But the reverse must be equally true. If you wish to buy more than £100 of vouchers, make sure you buy them on a credit card. But otherwise there are still no guarantees that your money will be safe.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The chapter ordered that 13 canons, including the succentor and the archdeacon, should immediately \\"erect, construct, build, and duly repair their manses, and the enclosures of their gardens within the college of Moray\\". The manse of the precentor, erroneously called the Bishop's House, is partially ruined and is dated 1557. (Fig. 2) Vestiges of the Dean's Manse and the Archdeacon's Manse (Fig. 3) are now part of private buildings.The hospital of Maison Dieu (the Alms House), dedicated to St Mary and situated near the cathedral precinct but outside the chanonry, was established by Bishop Andreas before 1237 for the aid of the poor. It suffered fire damage in 1390 and again in 1445. The cathedral clerks received it as a secular benefice but in later years it may, in common with other hospitals, have become dilapidated through a lack of patronage. Bishop James Hepburn granted it to the Blackfriars of Elgin on 17 November 1520, perhaps in an effort to preserve its existence. The property was taken into the ownership of the Crown after the Reformation and in 1595 was granted to the burgh by James VI for educational purposes and for helping the poor. In 1624, an almshouse was constructed to replace the original building, but in 1750 a storm substantially damaged its relatively intact ruins. The remnants of the original building were finally demolished during a 19th-century redevelopment of the area.There were two friaries in the burgh. The Dominican Black Friars friary was founded in the western part of the burgh around 1233. The Franciscan (Friars Minor Conventual) Grey Friars friary was later founded in the eastern part of the burgh sometime before 1281. It is thought that this latter Grey Friars foundation did not long survive, but was followed between 1479 and 1513 by the foundation of a friary near Elgin Cathedral by the Franciscan (Observants) Grey Friars.

They provide support, love, companionship, and endless adventure. Yet, not all friendships are created equal. If you've ever found yourself in a toxic friendship, it might be time to recognize the signs and learn how to cut ties to protect your well-being. In this article, we will discuss how to spot toxicity, the importance of being honest with yourself, and the necessary steps to take in order to end a harmful friendship. 1. Recognize the signs of a toxic friendship: To navigate the complexities of a toxic friendship, it is crucial to recognize the signs that identify it. Here are some common red flags: a) Jealousy and competition: A toxic friend might always try to one-up you, show envy when you succeed, and undermine your accomplishments. b) Frequent criticism: Constructive criticism is essential for growth, but if a friend puts you down consistently and discourages your ideas, they might be toxic. c) Negativity: While everyone has their bad days, a toxic friend will always find a reason to complain, and their negativity can be draining. d) Unreliability: Trust is a fundamental aspect of any friendship. A toxic friend may make promises they never keep and may frequently cancel plans without any notice or explanation. e) Emotional draining: Does being around this person leave you feeling drained and emotionally exhausted? A toxic friend may sap your energy and happiness with their drama and constant need for emotional support. 2. Be honest about your reasons for needing to end things: It's essential to be honest with yourself for your own emotional wellbeing. Reflect on your reasons for needing to end the friendship. This will help you to have a clear perspective on the situation and enable you to communicate your thoughts more effectively. Additionally, acknowledging the impact the toxic friendship has on your life validates your decision to move on and can pave the way for healthier relationships. 3. Cut off ties with that individual: Once you have recognized the signs of a toxic friendship and have been honest with yourself about the reasons for needing to end it, it's time to take action. Cutting ties can be challenging, but it is a necessary step to protect your well-being. Here are some suggestions on how to detach from a toxic friend: a) Communicate your feelings: Be open and honest about your decision to end the friendship. Explain your reasons for wanting to distance yourself in a calm and respectful manner. b) Set boundaries: Establish clear boundaries to limit contact with the toxic individual. This may include unfollowing them on social media or blocking their phone number. c) Seek support: Reach out to friends, family, or a therapist to talk about your feelings and help you navigate the process of ending a toxic friendship. d) Focus on positivity: Surround yourself with positive and uplifting people who encourage and support you. Invest time in cultivating healthy friendships and engaging in activities that bring joy to your life. e) Acceptance: Understand that it's normal to grieve the loss of a friendship, even a toxic one. Allow yourself to feel sadness, anger, or disappointment, and trust that these emotions will pass in time as you heal and move forward. Conclusion: Toxic friendships can have a significant impact on your mental and emotional wellbeing. Recognizing the signs, being honest with yourself, and taking action to end the relationship are crucial steps in prioritizing your health and happiness. By having the courage to disconnect from negativity and surround yourself with supportive, positive people, you will nurture a social circle that contributes to your personal growth and fulfillment."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who collaborated with Ono on Some Time?  Lennon and Ono moved to New York in August 1971 and immediately embraced US radical left politics. The couple released their \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\\" single in December. During the new year, the Nixon administration took what it called a \\"strategic counter-measure\\" against Lennon's anti-war and anti-Nixon propaganda. The administration embarked on what would be a four-year attempt to deport him. Lennon was embroiled in a continuing legal battle with the immigration authorities, and he was denied permanent residency in the US; the issue would not be resolved until 1976.Some Time in New York City was recorded as a collaboration with Ono and was released in 1972 with backing from the New York band Elephant's Memory. A double LP, it contained songs about women's rights, race relations, Britain's role in Northern Ireland and Lennon's difficulties in obtaining a green card. The album was a commercial failure and was maligned by critics, who found its political sloganeering heavy-handed and relentless. The NME's review took the form of an open letter in which Tony Tyler derided Lennon as a \\"pathetic, ageing revolutionary\\". In the US, \\"Woman Is the Nigger of the World\\" was released as a single from the album and was televised on 11 May, on The Dick Cavett Show. Many radio stations refused to broadcast the song because of the word \\"nigger\\". Lennon and Ono gave two benefit concerts with Elephant's Memory and guests in New York in aid of patients at the Willowbrook State School mental facility. Staged at Madison Square Garden on 30 August 1972, they were his last full-length concert appearances. After George McGovern lost the 1972 presidential election to Richard Nixon, Lennon and Ono attended a post-election wake held in the New York home of activist Jerry Rubin. Lennon was depressed and got intoxicated; he left Ono embarrassed after he had sex with a female guest. Her song \\"Death of Samantha\\" was inspired by the incident.

The Court is expected to rule on several key cases in this term, most notably the Hobby Lobby contraception case that asks whether owners of companies with strongly held religious views can seek an exemption from the birth control provisions of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A majority of Americans oppose letting employers, based on their religious views, exclude certain contraceptives from workers’ insurance coverage, says a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll ahead of a U.S. Supreme Court decision expected on Monday.      In one of the most closely watched cases of the year, the nine-member court will weigh whether for-profit corporations may raise religious objections to a mandate in President Barack Obama's signature 2010 healthcare law that their insurance cover contraceptives.      It brings to the forefront thorny questions of religious freedom and reproductive rights, along with enduring politicking over the law known as Obamacare, itself broadly upheld by the Supreme Court in 2012.      The poll asked whether employers should be able to choose what forms of contraceptives their health plans provide based on their religious beliefs. Of those responding, 53 percent disagreed and 35 percent agreed. Of those surveyed, 12 percent said they did not know.      The justices will sit at 10 a.m. ET on Monday for the final day of their nine-month annual term.      In the case, two family-owned companies, Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties, challenged the insurance requirement for certain employee birth control devices and methods as a violation of a 1993 religious-freedom law. The Oklahoma based arts-and-crafts retailer Hobby Lobby is controlled by evangelical Christians, and the Pennsylvania-based cabinet-manufacturer Conestoga Wood Specialties is owned by Mennonites. The healthcare law already exempts churches and religious-run entities from the contraceptive mandate.      The companies, and others involved in related lawsuits, do not oppose every type of birth control. Some object only to emergency contraceptive methods, such as the \\"morning-after\\" pill, which they view as akin to abortion.      The Obama administration contends for-profit corporations, even closely held ones, do not exercise religious rights as individuals do and are not covered by the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act.      JUDICIAL SPLIT      During oral arguments in March, the justices seemed split along ideological lines, with the five conservative justices suggesting they might be ready to rule that certain for-profit entities have the same religious rights to object to federal requirements as individuals do.      In a 2010 case known as Citizens United, the five-justice conservative bloc enhanced corporate free speech rights when it struck down campaign finance regulation.      The Reuters/Ipsos poll of 10,693 people was conducted April 28-June 20, 2014. It found that 40 percent strongly disagreed and 13 percent somewhat disagreed with the idea that employers should be able to choose what forms of contraceptives their health plans provide based on their religious beliefs. It found that 20 percent strongly agreed and 15 percent somewhat agreed with the idea. The poll has a credibility interval of plus or minus 1.1 percentage point.      The administration contends that if the court rules for the companies, the decision could lead to lawsuits by corporations against other federal requirements, including minimum-wage and Social Security tax laws. A company might also object, some liberal justices suggested during oral arguments, to providing coverage for vaccinations.      The only other pending case is over whether public employees can be forced to pay union dues. The case, Harris v. Quinn, tests whether Illinois may force in-home healthcare workers to pay union fees. It could have repercussions for public employee unions nationwide because, at its broadest, the question is whether mandatory union dues violate free speech rights. Under earlier cases, public-sector unions are allowed to collect money from workers who do not want union representation, if the money is not spent on political activities.      The contraception cases are Burwell v. Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties v. Burwell, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 13-354 and No. 13-356. The other case is Harris v. Quinn U.S. Supreme Court, No. 11-681.      (Reporting by Joan Biskupic; Editing by Howard Goller and Ken Wills) ||||| Shortly after 10 a.m. Monday, the Supreme Court will issue its much-anticipated decision on the religious freedom challenge businesses have brought against the Obamacare contraception mandate.      Hobby Lobby, along with Conestoga Wood Specialties, are closely-held companies whose owners claim their religious rights would be infringed if the firms have to comply with parts of the Affordable Care Act. In particular, they complain about covering certain forms of birth control for employees and their families.      Text Size -      +      reset      A win for the White House would help officials ensure that employer coverage is consistent, but employers would still be able to opt out of coverage altogether by paying a fine.      A win for Hobby Lobby would mean other businesses with a small number of owners could opt out of aspects of Obamacare coverage, possibly leaving employees on their own to pay for particular drugs or procedures.      (Earlier on POLITICO: Hobby Lobby aims for Obamacare win, Christian nation)      The justices could also endorse Hobby Lobby’s claim to religious freedom rights, but leave it to lower court to sort out whether individual forms of birth control and other drugs or treatments are so essential to the operation of the health reform law that they can be required despite an employer’s religious objection.      But until the decision is handed down, the comments — and quips — from the oral arguments are still our best guide to where justices are likely to come out. On March 24, court-watchers examined every question, comment, twitch and grimace in a quest to divine where the justices are headed. Of course, it’s a truism that justices’ remarks at arguments don’t always reflect where they will ultimately come down in a case.      In that spirit, here’s POLITICO’s take on where the nine justices appeared to stand:      (Based on a story that appeared March 25, 2014.)      Chief Justice John Roberts: For the companies, but just ones like these      Courtwatchers analyzing which justice has written what so far expect that Roberts will be the author of the court’s majority opinion in Hobby Lobby. He joined with the court’s liberals to provide the key vote to save Obamacare’s individual mandate a year ago. The George W. Bush appointee could back the administration again, further angering conservatives, but it seems more likely that he’ll come down this time on the side of the health care law’s critics.      (Earlier on POLITICO: Takeaways from the Hobby Lobby arguments)      During oral arguments, Roberts gave the administration little to be happy about but did indicate he favors limiting protection to “closely held” companies controlled by families or no more than a few individuals — where the business can really be seen as an extension of the owners.      “Whether it applies in the other situations is a question that we’ll have to await another case when a large publicly traded corporation comes in and says: ‘We have religious principles.’ The sort of situation that I don’t think is going to happen,” he said.      Roberts also reminded everyone that the court wasn’t considering a definitive constitutional ruling, but just one applying a law Congress passed in 1993, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. “If Congress feels as strongly about this as you suggest,” he told Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, “they can always pass an exemption, an exception to RFRA, which they have done on other occasions. And they haven’t done it here.”      Justice Anthony Kennedy: On the fence, but leaning toward the companies      Kennedy is often the man to watch in hotly contested Supreme Court cases, and his questions in March tracked with both sides’ arguments, obscuring his overall view.      He seemed troubled by the idea of allowing employers’ religious choices to override those of their workers. “You can have hypotheticals about the employer makes them, wants to make them wear burkas and so forth. That’s not in this case. The employee may not agree with these religious beliefs of the employer. Does the religious beliefs just trump? Is that the way it works?”      However, the Reagan appointee quickly turned on the government. First, there were several biting questions about exemptions the administration granted to various entities, undercutting arguments that protecting for-profit companies’ religious beliefs would unravel Obamacare.      Then, Kennedy walked Verrilli into a buzzsaw, claiming that the administration’s position was that companies could lawfully be required to provide not only contraception, but also surgical abortion if a law required it.      ”Under your view, a [for-]profit corporation … could be forced in principle to pay for abortions,” he said. “Your reasoning would permit that.”      As is often the case, Kennedy’s vote appears up in the air, but his use of the powerful abortion example, coupled with his references to already-granted exemptions, suggests he’ll rule that the law requires the Obama administration to accommodate the family-owned firms’ religious concerns.      Justice Stephen Breyer: Too cagey to call      Breyer won the award for Most Mysterious. He asked no questions whatsoever of the lawyer for the companies, Paul Clement, during Clement’s first 40 minutes at the lectern or his five-minute rebuttal.      When Breyer opened his mouth about an hour into the session, one of the first things that came out was a kind of disclaimer.      ”My question reflects no point of view at all on my behalf,” the Clinton appointee insisted before suggesting there was a “less restrictive way” to provide contraception coverage by having the government pay for it when employers with religious objections didn’t want to. “This is not coming from any point of view,” Breyer claimed again, implausibly, while also demanding a “precise” answer from Verrilli.      Breyer did fret a bit about the implications of allowing taxpayers to withhold taxes to be spent on things they disagree with, but he also seemed to doubt that Jewish or Muslim butchers who organize companies would not have some religious rights. “I don’t think it matters whether they call themselves a corporation or whether they call themselves individuals,” he said, before claiming again that his question was just a question.      Despite his defensiveness, Breyer sounded like a less than sure vote for the administration, though his history suggests he’d be reluctant to allow exemptions that could upend a complex law like Obamacare. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"This article talks about a Supreme Court decision and how it might affect a law called Obamacare.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Whose ally is Nigel?  Andy is an aspiring journalist fresh out of Northwestern University. Despite her ridicule for the shallowness of the fashion industry, she lands a job as junior personal assistant to Miranda Priestly, the editor-in-chief of Runway magazine. Andy plans to put up with Miranda's excessive demands and humiliating treatment for one year in the hopes of getting a job as a reporter or writer somewhere else. At first, Andy fumbles with her job and fits in poorly with her gossipy, fashion-conscious co-workers, especially Miranda's senior assistant, Emily Charlton. However, she does find an ally in art director Nigel, and gradually learns her responsibilities and begins to dress more stylishly to show her effort and commitment to the position. She also meets an attractive young writer, Christian Thompson, who offers to help her with her career. As she spends increasing amounts of time at Miranda's beck and call, problems arise in her relationships with her college friends and her live-in boyfriend, Nate, a chef working his way up the career ladder. Miranda is impressed by Andy and allows her to be the one to bring the treasured \\"Book\\", a mock-up of the upcoming edition, to her home, along with her dry cleaning. She is given instructions by Emily about where to leave the items and is told not to speak with anyone in the house. Andy arrives at Miranda's home only to discover that the instructions she received are vague. As she tries to figure out what to do, Andy begins to panic. Miranda's twins, Caroline and Cassidy, falsely tell her she can leave the book at the top of the stairs just as Emily has done on many occasions. At the top of the stairs, Andy interrupts Miranda and her husband having an argument. Mortified, Andy leaves the book and runs out of the house.","output":"In the given paragraph, Nigel is Andy's ally.

Title: Yummy bread--a nice change from white or wheat Review: This is the third Hodgson Mill break machine mix we have tried and so far it is our favorite. While I think their white and wheat are fine, they are nothing special. Now I am not sure about the cheese portion of this particular flavor, but you can certainly taste the herb half of the flavor, especially rosemary. It nicely complements Italian meals, or any other meal for that matter. Mix makes a 1 1/2 pound loaf but also includes instructions for adapting for a 1 pound loaf and cooks on the white bread cycle of your breadmaker. Mixes are easy to make, you only add hot water and butter.My only concern about these mixes is that the yeast does not have its own expiration date on it and I am suspect that it will be good until the expiration date on the bread mix. The ones I just received (rec'd Oct 2012) have a use by date of Feb 25, 2014. A:","output":"Based on the review, it seems the customer is mostly satisfied with the product. They mentioned that the Hodgson Mill bread machine mix is their favorite among the ones they have tried, and that it complements Italian meals nicely.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who was not much influenced by new developments in music? is inside the article: The two sides to Poulenc's musical nature caused misunderstanding during his life and have continued to do so. The composer Ned Rorem observed, \\"He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual\\"; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested in the works of younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, \\"Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. I remember him playing me the records of Boulez's Le marteau sans maître with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today.\\" Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, \\"There are always people who will take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after Sacre [du Printemps]. It was not progress.\\" Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc's work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: \\"You are truly good, and that is what I find again and again in your music\\".In his last years Poulenc observed, \\"if people are still interested in my music in 50 years' time it will be for my Stabat Mater rather than the Mouvements perpétuels.\\" In a centenary tribute in The Times Gerald Larner commented that Poulenc's prediction was wrong, and that in 1999 the composer was widely celebrated for both sides of his musical character: \\"both the fervent Catholic and the naughty boy, for both the Gloria and Les Biches, both Les Dialogues des Carmélites and Les Mamelles de Tirésias.\\" At around the same time the writer Jessica Duchen described Poulenc as \\"a fizzing, bubbling mass of Gallic energy who can move you to both laughter and tears within seconds. His language speaks clearly, directly and humanely to every generation.\\", can you guess it ?
