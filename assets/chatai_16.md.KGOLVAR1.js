The 20-year-old German, identified in a local newspaper only as Tobias, was part of a group of six who called themselves the “Bavarian Dumbasses.” They modeled their stunts on those performed by the Jackass crew and posted video of them on YouTube. In the lethal stunt, Tobias was taped to a playground merry-go-round while his friends tied a rope from one end to a car, then stepped on the gas to make the carousel spin as fast as possible. The tape ripped, and Tobias hurtled from the merry-go-round and plunged head-first into the ground, reports ABC News. “I heard this terrible scream and shouts for help,” said a woman who lives nearby. “When I arrived my husband was already there and he was trying to revive the victim but it was useless.

Kraft is the owner of NFL franchise the New England Patriots. The 71-year-old has considered purchasing EPL team Liverpool. Kraft said the absence of a salary cap in English football put him off investing.","output":"Title: Robert Kraft's Preference: 100 Million to Charity Over Soccer Investment  American businessman Robert Kraft, known for his unique business approaches and philanthropic contributions, recently made a surprising statement that rocked both the worlds of philanthropy and sports. The owner of the National Football League (NFL) franchise the New England Patriots made it clear that he would prefer donating 100 million to charity than investing it in a soccer team, revealing a significant insight into his investment philosophies and offering an interesting perspective into the economic landscape of global sports. As an individual who wears many hats, Kraft has garnered fame from his diverse ventures, with a significant chunk of his recognition attributed to his ownership of the New England Patriots. But beyond his business endeavors and sports affiliations, Kraft, at 71-years-old, has reflected a lifelong commitment to philanthropy, which contextualizes his recent surprising revelation. It is essential to note that amidst the array of possibilities available for high-profile investments, Kraft, at one point, reportedly considered purchasing the world-renowned English Premier League (EPL) team, Liverpool. English football is undoubtedly a lucrative space to invest, many billionaires across the globe already being active investors. Liverpool as a team, boasting a rich history, global popularity, and packed trophy cabinet has particularly attracted many prospective stakeholders, including Kraft himself. However, Kraft highlighted his reservations about investing in the EPL, significantly due to the absence of a salary cap in English football which is otherwise seen in most American sports. The salary cap in the NFL, prevalent during Kraft's ownership, sets a limit on the amount a team can spend on player salaries, which arguably establishes an economic equilibrium and promotes competition by avoiding disproportionate player payrolls. However, no such restriction exists in the Premier League, making player salaries a substantial part of the investment, thereby deterring Kraft. This difference in the business models that govern both American football and British soccer, where the lack of a salary cap in the latter could potentially prompt economic imbalance and impede competitive parity, became central to Kraft's decision. Yet, Kraft's stand, choosing charity over soccer, goes beyond just transactional choices. This disposition aligns with his long-standing commitment to philanthropy. The billionaire has a history of contributing to various causes and initiatives, having donated millions over the years to education, healthcare, and numerous charitable organizations. Today, the prospect of Robert Kraft donating a whopping 100 million to charity rather than making a high-profile investment divulges his values, sagacious investment philosophies and most importantly, reflects his commitment to deliver meaning and make a tangible difference. His enthusiasm for the well-being of community and society is evidently prioritized over the possible substantial returns from the global soccer industry. In all, Kraft's preference to give 100 million to charity over investing it in soccer is more than just an investment decision; it symbolizes his dedication to philanthropy over perceived profit-making. His rationale sheds light on the need for more responsible and impactful actions from those in similar positions. Thus, Robert Kraft sets a precedent that transcends the realm of sports, marking an inspiring example for billionaires and potential investors around the globe."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which friend learned less about surface areas of root systems?  Two friends studied permaculture together. Bill studied about mycorrhiza, while Red studied about hugel kultur.  Hint: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. Answer:","output":"Answer: Red learned less about surface areas of root systems. Step 1: Identify the subjects of study for both friends. Bill studied mycorrhiza, while Red studied hugel kultur. Step 2: Analyze relevant information in the paragraph. In the case of mycorrhiza, it is mentioned that the mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant's root system. Step 3: Compare the subjects. No information about surface areas of root systems is provided for the study of hugel kultur by Red. Step 4: Conclude based on the comparison. Since only Bill's subject, mycorrhiza, had information related to surface areas of root systems, Red learned less about this topic in his study of hugel kultur."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Companies would be given automatic access rights, but only for drilling at a depth of more than 1,000ft (300m). Fergus Ewing told BBC Scotland any decision should be taken at Holyrood, rather than Westminster. Fracking is the controversial process of drilling down into the earth before a high-pressure water mixture is used to recover gas and oil from shale rock. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, would only occur at far greater depths of 5,000 ft (1.5km) or more. Industry sources say the UK government proposals would bring oil and gas companies into line with the water, gas and electricity sectors. In return, communities would receive a one-off payment of Â£20,000 for each horizontal well of more than 200m in length. But Mr Ewing told BBC Scotland News: \\"We have to have a proper debate about this. \\"Simply proceeding by threatening to remove people's rights without any consultation with the people of Scotland is quite simply wrong. \\"We are taking a cautious approach yes, we are taking an evidence based approach. We are looking at matters further and if we decide that it may provide opportunities for Scotland, then perhaps it should be done in a controlled considered way, in appropriate parts of Scotland.\\" A 12-week consultation on the proposals was announced in May by the then Business and Energy Minister, Michael Fallon. He said: \\"Britain needs more home-grown energy. Shale development will bring jobs and business opportunities. \\"We are keen for shale and geothermal exploration to go ahead, while protecting residents through the robust regulation that is in place. \\"These proposals allow shale and geothermal development while offering a fair deal for communities in return for underground access at depths so deep they will have no negative impact on landowners.\\" In a statement, the trade body United Kingdom Onshore Oil and Gas said: \\"The industry supports UK government proposals to give automatic access rights to underground land below 300 metres, bringing it in line with other industries such as water, gas, electricity and sewerage. \\"This underground activity will not be noticeable at the surface and will not impact on the enjoyment landowners have of their property.\\" The Scottish Greens said they had been calling for the proposals to be blocked since earlier this year. The party's co-convener Patrick Harvie MSP said: \\"These comments from Fergus Ewing are a good step. Holyrood should reject the UK Infrastructure Bill when it gets the chance to do so by way of legislative consent motions. \\"Meantime Scottish ministers should continue to consider the use of existing regulations to ban unconventional gas completely. We are risking our economy, not just our environment, if we encourage yet more fossil fuel extraction.\\" The Scottish government's opposition to the proposals has been welcomed by anti-fracking campaigners. Dr Richard Dixon of Friends of the Earth Scotland said: \\"The United Kingdom government has been completely gung-ho for fracking the whole country and this puts a spoke in the works because it won't be able to make this change in Scotland. \\"It's also a very clear message for the industry that Scotland is a place where it will be much harder to do business.\\" What is a summary of this text?","output":"The UK government is currently consulting on plans to make it easier for companies to drill under residential areas, proposing automatic access rights for drilling at depths of more than 1,000ft (300m).

According to Lion, an examination by Keeley physicians confirmed the damaging effects of Bix's long-term reliance on alcohol: \\"Bix admitted to having used liquor 'in excess' for the past nine years, his daily dose over the last three years amounting to three pints of 'whiskey' and twenty cigarettes.....A Hepatic dullness was obvious, 'knee jerk could not be obtained' – which confirmed the spread of the polyneuritis, and Bix was 'swaying in Romberg position' – standing up with his eyes closed\\".While he was away, Whiteman famously kept his chair open in Beiderbecke's honor, in the hope that he would occupy it again. However, when he returned to New York at the end of January 1930, Beiderbecke did not rejoin Whiteman and performed only sparingly. On his last recording session, in New York, on September 15, 1930, Beiderbecke played on the original recording of Hoagy Carmichael's new song, \\"Georgia on My Mind\\", with Carmichael doing the vocal, Eddie Lang on guitar, Joe Venuti on violin, Jimmy Dorsey on clarinet and alto...

Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy. Come to find out the child had his picture made with that very Santa a few days prior. Very ironic. When was the curtain that exposed Santa's body opened?  A. not enough information  B. While the boy and his mother were passing by.  C. Before Santa's suit was cut into shreds.  D. Before the mother insisted she knew how to parent. The answer to this question is:","output":"B. While the boy and his mother were passing by. In the story, the mother insisted on bringing her young son into the Emergency Room, despite the AI's warnings about potential exposure to distressing scenes. As they passed by the room where the recently deceased mall Santa was, a tech opened the curtain, revealing the disheveled remains of Santa's costume and lifeless body. The young boy saw the scene and became extremely upset. This incident took place after the mother insisted she knew how to parent, which led to the AI allowing her to bring her son into the ER. Ultimately, the situation demonstrated the importance of adhering to the hospital's visitation policy, as the AI had initially cautioned."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: According to decades-long research, women who took low to moderate  daily doses of aspirin had a reduced death rate, especially from heart disease. The research, based on data from a major trial that has tracked almost 80,000 women since 1976, found that women who reported using aspirin on a regular basis had a 25 percent lower risk of death from any cause than women who didn't take the drug.   The risk of death from cardiovascular  disease was 38 percent lower for aspirin users, and there was also a 12 percent reduction in cancer deaths that took effect after a decade of aspirin use, the researchers found in their report based on the Nurses' Health Study. However, an accompanying editorial in the journal cautioned that the results were open to debate and far from definitive.       The dissenting   editorial was based on results of an earlier trial by the Women's Health Study, which followed almost 40,000 women for 11 years and found no reduction in overall deaths. Therefore, the new findings \\"cannot overcome the accumulated evidence that aspirin is not particularly effective for the primary prevention of death from cardiovascular disease in women.\\"       \\"This is a complicated issue,\\" said Dr. Andrew T. Chan, leading author of the new report. \\"We understand that aspirin has potential health benefits, but who would aspirin therapy  be appropriate for?\\" There are \\"areas of disagreement that need further study\\" before that question can be answered, Chan said. But there is information from the two large studies and other trials that can help guide women and their physicians, he said.

The documentary portrays a behind-the-scenes look at the poor state of Argentina's civil aviation , and puts the blame on the Argentine Air Force . The Air Force has been in control of air traffic operations since the military takeover of General Juan Carlos Ongan a in 1966 . The producer/director , Enrique Pi eyro , claims Argentina and Nigeria are the only countries whose air force controls and regulates the airline industry . Pi eyro , a former Argentine airline pilot , makes his case in the documentary using diagrams , 3D animations , interviews , hidden cameras in the control tower , and a few props . For example , at one point he spills out a bag of plastic airplanes and equates it to the number of planes the air force has lost due to negligence . The film is heavily based on the Austral L neas A reas Flight 2553 plane crash . Enrique Pi eyro takes his camera , secretly , into the control tower of the Ministro Pistarini International Airport also-known-as Ezeiza , the international airport at Buenos Aires .  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Which director uses a bag of plastic airplanes to demonstrate the poor state of the Argentinian civil aviation industry?\\" is \\"Enrique Pi Eyro\\"?","output":"Yes, according to the given information, the director who uses a bag of plastic airplanes to demonstrate the poor state of the Argentinian civil aviation industry is Enrique Piñeyro.  In his documentary, Piñeyro investigates the issues within Argentina's civil aviation system and highlights how the Argentine Air Force's control over air traffic operations has largely contributed to its dismal state. Drawing parallels to military control in Nigeria, he argues that the involvement of the Argentine Air Force in the industry has led to negligence and inefficiencies. To emphasize his point, he uses a variety of methods, including diagrams, 3D animations, interviews, and hidden camera footage, along with the striking visual of spilled plastic airplanes as an analogy for the number of planes lost due to negligence. Furthermore, the documentary specifically focuses on the Austral Líneas Aéreas Flight 2553 plane crash, which adds a personal and human dimension to the case Piñeyro is presenting. Through his secret recordings inside the control tower of Ministro Pistarini International Airport, or Ezeiza, which serves Buenos Aires, the director provides an inside perspective on the conditions and operational challenges faced within Argentina's aviation industry. Altogether, these elements work together to create a compelling and informative documentary that effectively brings the often-neglected issues within the Argentinian civil aviation sector to the forefront."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Old English or Anglo-Saxon is the earliest historical form of the English language, spoken in England and southern and eastern Scotland in the early Middle Ages. It was brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers probably in the mid 5th century, and the first Old English literary works date from the mid-7th century. After the Norman Conquest of 1066, English was replaced, for a time, as the language of the upper classes by Anglo-Norman, a relative of French, and Old English developed into the next historical form of English, known as Middle English.  - Robert I ( 11 July 1274 -- 7 June 1329 ) , popularly known as Robert the Bruce ( Medieval Gaelic : Roibert a Briuis ; modern Scottish Gaelic : Raibeart Bruis ; Norman French : Robert de Brus or Robert de Bruys , Early Scots : Robert Brus ) , was King of Scots from 1306 until his death in 1329 . Robert was one of the most famous warriors of his generation , and eventually led Scotland during the first of the Wars of Scottish Independence against England . He fought successfully during his reign to regain Scotland 's place as an independent nation and is today remembered in Scotland as a national hero . Descended from the Anglo - Norman and Gaelic nobilities , his paternal fourth - great grandfather was David I. Robert 's grandfather , Robert de Brus , 5th Lord of Annandale , was one of the claimants to the Scottish throne during the \`\` Great Cause '' . As Earl of Carrick , Robert the Bruce supported his family 's claim to the throne and took part in William Wallace 's revolt against Edward I of England . In 1298 , Bruce became a Guardian of Scotland alongside his great rival for the Scottish throne , John Comyn , and William Lamberton , Bishop of St. Andrews . Bruce resigned as guardian in 1300 due in part to his quarrels with Comyn but chiefly because the restoration of King John seemed imminent . In 1302 , he submitted to Edward I and returned to \`\` the king 's peace '' . When his father died in 1304 , Bruce inherited his family 's claim to the throne . In February 1306 , following an argument during a meeting at Greyfriars monastery , Dumfries , Bruce killed Comyn . He was excommunicated by the Pope but absolved by Robert Wishart , Bishop of Glasgow . Bruce moved quickly to seize the throne and was crowned king of Scots on 25 March 1306 , at Scone . Edward I 's forces defeated Robert in battle , and Bruce was forced to flee into hiding in the Hebrides and Ireland before returning in 1307 to defeat an English army at Loudoun Hill and wage a highly successful guerrilla war against the English .

The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - Early Scots was the emerging literary language of the Northern Middle English speaking parts of Scotland in the period before 1450. The northern forms of Middle English descended from Northumbrian Old English. During this period, speakers referred to the language as \\"English\\" (\\"Inglis\\", \\"Ynglis\\", and variants).  - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around .  - The Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Innse Gall\\"; Old Norse: \\"Suðreyjar\\") comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland. There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides. These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - The Northern Isles  is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland. The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801. The islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century.  - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea.

To do this, subtract 46 from both sides of the equation: -16 - 46 = -31 * q -62 = -31 * q Step 5: Solve for q by dividing both sides of the equation by -31.

Please answer the following question: This article: After a textual montage summarizing Edgar Allan Poe's life, the film begins in late September 1849 with Poe awakening from a hallucination where he is buried alive.  He prepares to take a trip to New York City via a ferry steamboat from Richmond, Virginia, to Baltimore, and from there, another ferry to New York City itself.  He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster with a stranger taking the same steamboat, who suggests that he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine The Stylus.  Though Poe had intended only to pass through Baltimore, he agrees to meet the investors who, one by one, turn down his request for funding.  Poe is depicted as having some type of memory loss, which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended.  One night, he chooses to dine in a local tavern rather than at the hotel.  There, he meets an old friend from his days at West Point.  In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, saying proudly he has already raised 1,000.  Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his prospectus for the magazine.  His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the 1,000 he had collected. An injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a cooping ring.  The author, along with several others, are forced to multiple polling locations around Baltimore to place multiple votes for the candidate for mayor.  A couple of victims of the scam die amidst the brutality of their captors. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who has a hallucination that they are buried alive?, what is it ?

Because of this, it can be a good idea to consume bitter herbs with meals. Bitter herbs can stimulate digestion and change stomach acid levels, possibly lowering the chances of a future acne outbreak.  Most extracts will have the appropriate dosage listed on the bottle. Some examples of bitter herbs include dandelion leaf and root, yarrow, wormwood, and gentian. Always consume bitter herbs with meals. Try adding dark, bitter greens to your meals or salads. For example, adding arugula can be a simple way to consume more bitters. Eating some dandelion leaves with your meal can be a simple way to add bitters to your meal. Many acne treatments may help reduce the effects of an outbreak, but can be harmful or rough on your skin. Using rhassoul clay may help to reduce the chances of future outbreaks without causing additional damage. Try applying some rhassoul clay to affected areas to help slow down oil production and possibly even prevent further outbreaks.  Mix 1 teaspoon (about 3.5 g) of rhassoul clay with warm water to create a paste. This can be worn as a face mask. You can try mixing other herbs into the clay for a greater effect. Green tea leaves can be a good addition if your face is oily. Adding chamomile can help with redness. Try to use rhassoul clay daily. Remove it if your skin starts to feel dry or tight. Your diet has a wide range of effects on your health and wellbeing. Diet can also have an effect on how likely you are to have an acne outbreak. Making some simple changes to your diet can be a natural way for you to lower the severity and frequency of acne outbreaks. Keep some of the following ideas in mind when reviewing your diet:  Try to steer clear of processed foods. Eat more whole foods instead, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Lower your intake of dairy products. Foods that are high in carbohydrates may trigger acne outbreaks. These include things like bread and pasta. .  Stress may also cause acne outbreaks, so it is important to keep your stress under control. Whenever possible, try to reduce the amount of stress in your daily life to help lessen the severity of any acne problem.  You might try meditation or exercise to lower stress.

Given the question: Information:  - Amoraim (Aramaic: plural  , singular Amora  ; \\"those who say\\" or \\"those who speak over the people\\", or \\"spokesmen\\") refers to the Jewish scholars of the period from about 200 to 500 CE, who \\"said\\" or \\"told over\\" the teachings of the Oral Torah. They were concentrated in Babylonia and the Land of Israel. Their legal discussions and debates were eventually codified in the Gemara. The \\"Amoraim\\" followed the \\"Tannaim\\" in the sequence of ancient Jewish scholars. The \\"Tannaim\\" were direct transmitters of uncodified oral tradition; the \\"Amoraim\\" expounded upon and clarified the oral law after its initial codification.  - Jose the Galilean ( Hebrew :   , Yose HaGelili ) , d. 15 Av , was a Jewish sage who lived in the 1st and 2nd centuries of the common era . He was one of the Tannaim , the rabbis whose work was compiled in the Mishna . Jose was a contemporary and colleague of Rabbis Akiva , Tarfon , and Eleazar ben Azariah . Neither the name of his father nor the circumstances of his youth are known , though his name ( \`\` HaGelili '' ) indicates that he was a native of Galilee . He suffered from the prejudice commonly held against the Galileans by the Judeans ; on one occasion a woman who wanted to make a point with him began by calling him a \`\` stupid Galilean '' . When he entered the academy at Yavne , he was entirely unknown . It is also noted that he was extremely modest and addressed Tarfon as \`\` my master '' . He was , nevertheless , a thorough scholar even then , and his arguments nonplused both Tarfon and Akiva . His first appearance at Yavne thus obtained for him general recognition , and the two rabbis considered him not as a pupil , but as a colleague . Akiva was obliged to endure more than one sharp criticism from Jose , who once said to him : \`\` Though thou expound the whole day I shall not listen to thee '' . Tarfon expressed his high esteem of Jose by interpreting Daniel viii. 4 - 7 as though it contained an allusion to him : \`\` I saw the ram , that is , Akiva , and saw that no beast might stand before him ; and I beheld the he - goat , that is , Jose the Galilean , come , and cast him down to the ground . '' As a matter of fact , Jose was the only one who opposed Akiva successfully , and the latter frequently abandoned his own interpretation in favor of his opponent 's . Jose frequently showed a tendency to revert to the older Halakha , explaining the text according to its literal meaning Generally , though , his halakic exegesis differed little from that of Akiva , and both often employed the same rules of interpretation He taught that poultry may be cooked in milk and eaten , as was done in his own native...  - Av (\\"Av\\" \\"\\" \\"Abba\\"; from Akkadian \\"abu\\"; \\"father\\") is the eleventh month of the civil year and the fifth month of the ecclesiastical year on the Hebrew calendar. The name is Babylonian in origin and appeared in the Talmud around the 3rd century. This is the only month which is not named in the Bible. It is a summer month of 30 days. Av usually occurs in JulyAugust on the Gregorian calendar.  - Tannaim (, singular , \\"Tanna\\" \\"repeaters\\", \\"teachers\\") were the Rabbinic sages whose views are recorded in the Mishnah, from approximately 10-220 CE. The period of the \\"Tannaim\\", also referred to as the Mishnaic period, lasted about 210 years. It came after the period of the \\"Zugot\\" (\\"pairs\\"), and was immediately followed by the period of the \\"Amoraim\\" (\\"interpreters\\").  - Rabban Gamaliel II (also spelled Gamliel) was the first person to lead the Sanhedrin as Nasi after the fall of the second temple, which occurred in 70 CE. Gamliel was appointed nasi approximately 10 years later. Gamaliel II was the son of Shimon ben Gamaliel, one of Jerusalem's foremost men in the war against the Romans, and grandson of Gamaliel I. To distinguish him from the latter he is also called Gamliel of Yavne.  - The Sanhedrin (Hebrew: \\"sanhedrîn\\", Greek: , \\"synedrion\\", \\"sitting together,\\" hence \\"assembly\\" or \\"council\\") was an assembly of twenty-three to seventy-one men appointed in every city in the Land of Israel. In the Hebrew Bible, Moses and the Israelites were commanded by God to establish courts of judges who were given full authority over the people of Israel, who were commanded by God to obey every word the judges instructed and every law they established. Judges in ancient Israel were the religious leaders and Teachers of the nation of Israel. The Mishnah arrives at the number twenty-three based on an exegetical derivation: it must be possible for a \\"community\\" to vote for both conviction and exoneration. The minimum size of a \\"community\\" is 10 men (10 vs 10). One more is required to achieve a majority (11 vs 10), but a simple majority cannot convict, and so an additional judge is required (12 vs 10). Finally, a court should not have an even number of judges to prevent deadlocks; thus 23 (12 vs 10 and 1). This court dealt with only religious matters.  - The Gregorian calendar is internationally the most widely used civil calendar. It is named after Pope Gregory XIII, who introduced it in October 1582.  - Halakha (; also transliterated as halacha, halakhah, halachah or halocho) is the collective body of Jewish religious laws derived from the Written and Oral Torah. It includes the 613 \\"mitzvot\\" (\\"commandments\\"), subsequent Talmudic and rabbinic law and the customs and traditions compiled in the \\"Shulchan Aruch\\" (literally \\"Prepared Table\\", but more commonly known as the \\"Code of Jewish Law\\").  - Ezra ('; fl. 480440 BCE), also called Ezra the Scribe  and Ezra the Priest in the Book of Ezra, was a Jewish scribe and a priest. According to the Hebrew Bible he was a descendant of Seraiah (Ezra 7:1) the last high priest to serve in the first temple (kings 2 25:18), and a close relative of Joshua the first High Priest of the second temple (chronicles 1 5:40-41. see also Ezra 3:2). He returned from the Babylonian exile and reintroduced the Torah in Jerusalem (Ezra 710 and Neh 8). According to 1 Esdras, a Greek translation of the Book of Ezra still in use in Eastern Orthodoxy, he was also a high priest. Rabbinic tradition holds that he was only a common priest.   - The Shulchan Aruch (, literally: \\"Set Table\\") also known by various Jewish communities but not all as \\"the Code of Jewish Law.\\" There are various legal codes in Judaism but the Shulchan Aruch is the most widely consulted. It was authored in Safed (today in Israel) by Yosef Karo in 1563 and published in Venice two years later. Together with its commentaries, it is the most widely accepted compilation of Jewish law ever written.  - Eleazar ben Azariah, was a 1st-century CE Jewish tanna, i.e. Mishnaic sage. He was of the second generation and a junior contemporary of Gamaliel II, Eliezer b. Hyrcanus, and Joshua b. Hananiah, and senior of Akiva. He was a kohen and traced his pedigree for ten generations back to Ezra, and was very wealthy. These circumstances, added to his erudition, gained for him great popularity. When Gamaliel II, in consequence of his provoking demeanor, was temporarily deposed from the patriarchate, Eleazar, though still very young, was elevated to that office by the deliberate choice of his colleagues. He did not, however, occupy it for any length of time, for the Sanhedrin reinstated Gamaliel. He was retained as vice-president (\\"ab bet din\\"), nevertheless, and it was arranged that Gamaliel should lecture three (some say two) Sabbaths, and Eleazar every fourth (or third) Sabbath.  - Zugot \\"Pairs\\" (\\"tqufath hazzughoth\\") refers to the hundred-year period during the time of the Second Temple (515 BCE  70 CE), in which the spiritual leadership of the Jews was in the hands of five successive generations of \\"zugoth\\" (\\"pairs\\") of religious teachers.    What is the relationship between 'jose the galilean' and '200'? The answer is:","output":"Jose the Galilean was a Jewish sage and one of the Tannaim who lived in the 1st and 2nd centuries CE. The Tannaim were rabbis whose work was compiled in the Mishnah, and their period lasted from approximately 10-220 CE. On the other hand, the number '200' is related to the beginning of the period of the Amoraim, which refers to the Jewish scholars of the period from about 200 to 500 CE. The Amoraim succeeded the Tannaim in the sequence of ancient Jewish scholars and expounded upon and clarified the oral law after its initial codification in the Mishnah. Therefore, the relationship between Jose the Galilean and the number '200' is that Jose the Galilean was a Tanna who lived before the period of the Amoraim, which began around 200 CE."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It's really easy, and all you need is sand, a net and a group of people, of any age or fitness level, who want to have fun. Beach volleyball can be played with as few as two people in each team, making a total of four people. However, if you are less skilled and experienced in the game, it will be easier to play with a larger team. The more players you have, the less ground each person will be responsible for covering and the more time they will have to recover between shots. If you only have a few players, each of you will get a lot of running for the ball after each volley  . If you are looking for a relaxing, fun, low-key experience, choose larger teams. Beach volleyball is similar to regular volleyball in its rules. However, even experienced volleyball players do not realize how much more difficult it is to run and jump on sand. Since it is harder to move quickly on sand than a hard surface, play will be much slower than regular volleyball on a court. When an athlete trains for beach volleyball, he will focus on building lower body strength as well as upper body strength. Strengthening his legs is extremely important. This improves the player's ability to move quickly and accurately on sand despite the resistance. The ability to jump high and land without injury is necessary for beach volleyball players. Whether you are in it for the competition, or just to have a great time with your friends, beach volleyball can be extremely exciting and fun. You may start out with friends and may soon fall in love with the sport. Question: When playing beach volleyball, in which of the following situation will you feel most relaxed? Options: A: Playing in a 2-person team. B: Playing in a 4-person team. C: Playing in a 6-person team. D: Playing in an 11-person team.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the below context:  Van Eyck gives Mary three roles: Mother of Christ, the personification of the \\"Ecclesia Triumphans\\" and Queen of Heaven, the latter apparent from her jewel-studded crown. The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a \\"throne room\\", which envelopes her as if a \\"carrying case\\". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as \\"the Madonna in a church\\", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary \\"as the Church\\". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and Arnolfini Portrait. These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his Annunciation of 1434–36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building. Perhaps reflecting the view of a \\"relatively immature painter\\", a copy of the Annunciation by Joos van Cleve shows Mary at a more realistic proportion scale to her surroundings.Mary is presented as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling...

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Leafy green vegetables have high levels of vitamins, minerals and other nutrients. Importantly for liver function, they can lower the level of fat deposits in the liver. Leafy greens include spinach, collard, beet, turnip and mustard greens, kale, the cruciferous vegetables (cauliflower, cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts), Swiss chard, dandelion greens, and all lettuces. Beets alone won't lower your liver enzymes, but they're high in \\"flavonoids\\" that act as antioxidants that support liver function. Avocados can also be helpful, as they have a lot of vitamin E, which is an effective natural antioxidant. Avocados and walnuts have precursors for the body’s primary antioxidant — glutathione.  Walnuts are also a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which can reduce liver inflammation. Other nuts, including walnuts, Brazil nuts, pecans, and almonds also contain B vitamins and minerals in significant amounts. Foods that are high in fiber prevent your body from absorbing cholesterol. By reducing the amount of cholesterol your liver has to process, you increase liver health and lower enzyme levels. Fiber also increases the liver's bile secretion, improving fat digestion and preventing liver disease down the line. Foods high in fiber include:  Oat, wheat, corn, rice bran Beans (lima, adzuki, black, red, kidney, white,navy and pinto beans), lentils (red, brown and yellow) and peas Berries (raspberry, blueberry, strawberry, blackberry, loganberry, gooseberry, boysenberry, salmonberry) Whole grains ( wheat, oats, corn, rye, teff, buckwheat, brown rice) Leafy green vegetables (Greens of turnips, mustard, collard, beets and Swiss chard, kale, and spinach) Nuts (almonds, pistachios, cashews, walnuts) and seeds (sesame, pumpkin, flax, sunflower) Fruit (especially those with edible rinds such as pears, apples, prunes, plums, peaches, apricots) Vitamin C helps in tissue repair and wound healing. Eating citrus fruits or drinking their juices will help the liver heal, bringing enzyme levels back to healthy levels. Citrus fruits are also known to reduce the risk of liver cancer. Find ways to work oranges, grapefruits, lemons, and limes into your diet. When buying juices, look for products fortified with extra vitamin C. The family of vegetables called \\"cruciferous vegetables\\" are known to balance the production of detoxifying liver enzymes. These \\"phase two detoxification enzymes\\" neutralize cancer-causing carcinogens in the body. These vegetables also have plenty of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber:  Broccoli Brussels sprouts Cauliflower Radishes Horseradish Rutabaga and turnips Wasabi Watercress Protein is usually the key to repairing damage in the body, so you might think you should increase protein to treat a strained liver. But because the liver is the organ processing the protein, you may overwhelm it with too much protein. This causes even more strain, further elevating your enzyme levels. Speak to your doctor and/or nutritionist about how much protein you should be consuming. They will be able to provide you with a plan specific to your body's needs. Drinking enough water will help your liver flush out waste products, reducing its work burden. Drink eight to ten 8 oz. glasses of water every day. Take special care to drink water at the following times:  When you first wake up. Before and during meals. Before and after physical activity. Right before you go to bed. Healthy foods can support the liver, but unhealthy foods can damage the liver. Too much fat, salt, sugar, or oil can overburden the liver. If you already have high enzyme levels, you need to give your liver a break for a while. Avoid the following foods to balance your enzyme levels:  Fatty foods like lamb, beef, chicken skin, foods made with shortening or lard, and vegetable oils.  Salty foods like most processed and prepared foods, snacks like pretzels and chips, and canned foods. Sugary foods like cakes, pies, or cookies. Fried foods. Raw or undercooked shellfish (these may contain liver-damaging toxins). Alcohol (though it’s not a food) should be avoided as much as possible, especially if you already have liver disease.","output":"This article highlights the importance of consuming leafy green vegetables, beets, avocados, walnuts, fiber-rich foods, citrus fruits, cruciferous vegetables, and adequate water for liver health, while cautioning against excessive protein intake and unhealthy foods to maintain balanced liver enzyme levels and support overall liver function."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ensimmäinen niistä on pitkällä aikavälillä kestävien, ympäristöystävällisten energialähteiden käytön lisääminen, etenkin sellaisten, joita saadaan biomaailmasta, esimerkiksi puupolttoaineita, pellettejä, brikettejä ja biokaasua, jotta tällä tavoin saataisiin esiin kestäviä energialähteitä. Translate to English English:","output":"The first of these is increasing the use of long-term sustainable, environmentally friendly energy sources, especially those obtained from the biomass world, such as wood fuels, pellets, briquettes, and biogas, in order to bring forth sustainable energy sources in this way. In recent years, the need for sustainable and environmentally friendly energy sources has grown significantly due to the increasing concerns about climate change, resource depletion, and negative environmental impacts caused by the use of conventional fossil fuels. Biomass-derived energy sources, including wood fuels, pellets, briquettes, and biogas, offer several advantages over traditional energy sources. Firstly, biomass energy sources are considered to be carbon neutral. When these organic materials are burnt, they release carbon dioxide that is absorbed by plants during their growth. It creates a closed loop of carbon emissions, meaning no additional net greenhouse gas emissions are added to the environment. This is crucial in the fight against global warming and climate change. Secondly, biomass energy sources are renewable and sustainable in the long run. Unlike fossil fuels, which are finite resources, biomass materials can be regenerated over time through natural processes, such as photosynthesis. This ensures a continuous supply of energy without depleting the Earth's resources. Thirdly, using biomass energy sources fosters rural development and local economies. The production and harvesting of biomass materials can provide employment opportunities in rural areas, contributing to their economic growth. Additionally, using locally sourced biomass can help reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels, thereby improving energy security. However, it is essential to note that the use of biomass energy sources must be sustainable and well-managed. Overharvesting of biomass materials, like wood, can lead to deforestation and loss of biodiversity, while excessive use of agricultural residues can diminish soil fertility. Therefore, proper management and guidelines must be in place for the use of biomass-derived energy sources to ensure their environmental sustainability. To increase the use of these sustainable energy sources, various initiatives can be undertaken, such as: 1. Government policies and incentives: Governments can implement policies, subsidies, and financial incentives to encourage the use of biomass energy sources by both consumers and industries. This can include support for research and development, grants for biomass infrastructure, and tax breaks for those using biomass-derived energy. 2. Raising awareness: Educating the public about the benefits of biomass energy sources and their potential in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as well as providing information on available incentives and support, can help increase the adoption of these energy sources. 3. Technological advancements: Investing in research and development to improve the efficiency, reliability, and affordability of biomass-derived energy technologies can contribute to their increased use. 4. Developing infrastructure: Designing and constructing energy infrastructure, such as biomass collection, storage, and distribution systems as well as biomass energy conversion facilities, can help make biomass-derived energy more accessible and practical for users. In conclusion, increasing the use of biomass-derived energy sources, such as wood fuels, pellets, briquettes, and biogas, is a vital step in promoting environmental sustainability and combating climate change. Through a combination of government policy, public awareness, technology advancements, and infrastructure development, these energy sources can become more widely adopted, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and contributing to a cleaner, healthier planet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The group of fans who towed it more than 2,000 miles around France in the summer say it is now beyond repair. After a Christmas party in the vehicle over the festive period, they plan to get rid of it in the new year. They offered it to a museum, but it was rejected, so they are now considering entering it into a demolition derby. The 20-year-old Green And White Army (GAWA) caravan has its own Facebook page and attracted international media attention at the Euros as it travelled around France. It went from Cherbourg in the north-west to the southern coastal city of Nice, before heading north again to Paris, via Lyon. To save money, the fans tried to avoid toll roads so ended up driving almost 3,000 miles. One of the supporters, Lee Brooks, said: \\"We offered it to the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, but they didn't want it. They said it wasn't old enough for a museum. \\"It's a pity because this caravan certainly has a bit of history to it.\\" The vehicle needed running repairs during the journey through France, especially after negotiating the twisting roads of the Alps. On a number of occasions, the supporters considered abandoning it and using hotels. However, the caravan became a magnet for attention wherever they went so they stuck with it. One of the fans involved, Noel Cowan, said: \\"We had Austrians, Germans and Poles in the caravan with us at various times. We had a BBQ with them all. \\"It was unreal - memories that we'll never forget.\\" The fans' plan had been to keep the caravan for the next two years in case Northern Ireland qualify for the World Cup in Russia, but they have now reluctantly accepted that will not be possible. \\"It wouldn't even make it to the ferry at Larne, never mind Moscow,\\" said Mr Cowan.","output":"A group of fans, who gained fame by towing a 20-year-old caravan around France during the Euros, have decided to retire the vehicle after it was deemed beyond repair and rejected by a museum."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

His passion for the project takes him to the top of the World Trade Center, where he admires the stunning view of the city that he hopes to reshape. As Cameron gazes out at the horizon, he reflects on the pressure to succeed, haunted by his troubled past and fear of failure. Cameron's life takes an unexpected turn when he stumbles upon a secret organization involved in a high-stakes conspiracy. They realize that Cameron has discovered their covert plan and become a threat to their ultimate goal. The organization, led by a sinister and powerful antagonist with a corrupt vision for the future of the city, will stop at nothing to silence Cameron. Faced with danger from every angle, Cameron teams up with Amanda, an investigative journalist who shares a personal connection to the conspiracy. Working together, they begin to unravel the secrets and corruption that compromise their city's integrity. As their investigation deepens, Cameron and Amanda realize that they're not just fighting for the truth, but for their survival. Their bond grows stronger through shared experiences evading danger and outwitting their adversaries. In a thrilling race against time, Cameron and Amanda uncover the organization's master plan to destroy the World Trade Center and disrupt the city's sense of unity and strength.

This data might be available through financial reports, budget statements, or public organizations like the Department of Medicaid Services or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Step 2: Calculate spending difference Once I have the spending data for both years, I'll subtract the previous year's spending from the current year's spending. This will give me the difference in Medicaid spending between the two years. Step 3: Calculate percentage change I'll divide the spending difference by the previous year's spending, then multiply by 100 to find the percentage change in Medicaid spending. Step 4: Compare and conclude Finally, I'll compare the calculated percentage change to the claim of a fifty percent increase. If the calculated percentage change is indeed fifty percent or greater, then it would follow that \\"Medicaid spending is up fifty percent year over year.\\" Otherwise, the claim would not be accurate. Justification: The given statement only tells us that Medicaid is administered by the Department of Medicaid Services. It does not provide any information about the increase or decrease in Medicaid spending.

Those called Judy and Joshua are the happiest, while Lynn or Ben is likely to be the unhappiest, according to research. Psychologist Dr David Holmes found that this might due to the association that others made with the name. Hearing the name Judy may make them think of actress Judi Dench or TV presenter Judy Finnigan, people who are seen as good natured and happy. On the other hand, people think Paulines are unhappy because of the character Pauline Fowler from the TV programme East Enders. The research claims that this association influences the person with the name and so their personality becomes shaped to fit it. Dr David Holmes said, \\"This also has some relation with the original meaning of the name. For example, the original meaning of Judy is 'praised'.\\"      Certain names also work well in certain aspects of life. In the workplace Richard and Judy are happiest, while those called Ruth and Carly are happiest in relationships. At the other end of the scale the unhappiest workers are Stuart and Liz, with the unhappiest in relationships being Frank and Harriet.         Dr Holmes said, \\"The relation we have with certain names, particularly important namesakes , also shapes how we see ourselves and so may have an effect on our confidence. Names are like product brands in having a powerful effect on attitudes and should therefore be chosen with care.\\"       \\"Other names are connected with being brave, outgoing or serious.

In general, he observes that supernatural beings tend to behave much like people, with the construction of gods and spirits resembling humans being a common trait in various religious beliefs. Boyer's analysis of Greek mythology, for example, highlights its similarity to a modern soap opera with characters exhibiting human-like behavior. However, Boyer's primary focus is on the underlying cognitive processes that result in the conception of supernatural beings, rather than merely stating that there are lots of them. Bertrand du Castel and Timothy Jurgensen further support Boyer's explanatory model by demonstrating that it shares similarities with physics' epistemology, which posits not directly observable entities as intermediaries. Additionally, anthropologist Stewart Guthrie contends that people project human features onto non-human aspects of the world in an attempt to make them more familiar and relatable. Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis, also suggested that God concepts arise as projections of one's father figure.  In summary, Pascal Boyer argues that there is a wide array of supernatural concepts found around the world, with the central idea that these concepts are generally constructed with human-like characteristics. This observation is reinforced by other scholars, such as Bertrand du Castel, Timothy Jurgensen, Stewart Guthrie, and Sigmund Freud, who provide additional perspectives and insights into the phenomenon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Everybody wears them, from the farmer to the lawyer and from models to housewives. But why have jeans become so popular?You'll get many answers. For some people they look cool, for others jeans are just comfortable. Jeans were first stronger trousers made for farm workers in the states of the American west. In the eastern part of the US jeans were hardly worn at all. They were connected with farm people and the workers. So the rich wouldn't like to wear them. It was James Dean and Marlon Brando that made them popular in movies and everyone started to wear them. They were a symbol of the _ of young people during the 1950s and 1960s. So these new trousers were not allowed in American schools and sometimes in theatres and cinemas. As time went on,jeans became more acceptable. American people in Europe and Japan often wore them when they were not on duty to show that they were Americans. The trousers showed the world a happier way of life, something that people needed, especially after what they had gone through in World War II. Jeans had other advantages as well. They didn't need to be washed as often as other trousers and women didn't need to iron them. This became more important as more and more women started working and had less time for housework. Today jeans are an important part of our lives. They are always washed a few times before they are sold to give them a faded look.

Hans Muller (Kirk Douglas), a German Jew, was once a well-known juggler before he was committed to a concentration camp; Muller survived, but his wife and children did not. After the war, Muller and many other displaced people found themselves in a temporary camp in Israel; his experiences have left him upset and confused, and several of the guards notice that he's behaving oddly. Muller flees the camp after one day, but while running away, he's stopped by Kogan (Richard Benedict), an Israeli policeman. When Kogan asks to see Muller's papers, he immediately flashes back to an unsetting memory in which a Nazi officer asked the same question; Muller panics, attacks the cop, and flees for Mount Carmel. In the morning, Muller encounters a group of children who believe the story he tells them: that he's a tourist from the United States. One of them, Yehoshua (Joseph Walsh), is making his way to a kibbutz in Syria, and Muller, who hopes to get to some friends in Egypt, joins him. Muller entertains the young man by teaching him to juggle, and they become close friends. When Yehoshua is injured by a land mine, Muller rushes him to a hospital, where he meets Ya'el (Milly Vitale), a woman who lost her husband to Arabs. A romance soon blossoms between Muller and Ya'el, and he confesses to her that he's on the run from the police; meanwhile, Israeli Detective Karni (Paul Stewart) is combing the nation, searching for the juggler -- not to arrest him, but to convince him that he's not wanted for murder, and that others want to help him.

Steel (John Henry Irons), also known as the Man of Steel, is a fictional character, a superhero in the DC Universe. Introduced in 1993 as one of several replacements for the then-deceased Superman, Steel continued to be an independent superhero after his inspiration's resurrection. He received his own ongoing series which saw him move from Metropolis to Washington, D.C. and join the Justice League of America in Grant Morrison's JLA. He later mentored his niece Natasha who became a superheroine herself. In 1997, a feature film was produced based on this version of the character. The film Steel stars professional basketball player Shaquille O'Neal in the title role and Judd Nelson as a new villain named Nathaniel Burke. The film was originally designed to be a spin-off of the new Superman film that used the \\"Death of Superman\\" storyline that first introduced the character in the comics. The project languished in development hell for so long the spinoff moved forward without the film it was to be attached to. The movie (released on August 15) was considered a flop both critically and financially. Steel was produced for an estimated 16,000,000 but grossed 1,686,429 at the box office.  A very young John Henry Irons appears in the animated film Justice League: The New Frontier reading a comic book nearby the gravestone of the \\"DC: The New Frontier\\" version of John Wilson, also known as John Henry, who is reportedly killed in the film.  John Henry Irons appears in Justice League: Throne of Atlantis, voiced by Khary Payton. He is seen wielding a hammer and is seen defending a colleague from an Atlantean before he is saved by Superman.  An alternate universe version of John Henry Irons appears in Justice League: Gods and Monsters, voiced again by Khary Payton. He is depicted as a scientist who is a member of LexCorp's \\"Project Fair Play.\\" John was discussing with the other scientists involved (consisting of Will Magnus, Michael Holt, Karen Beecher, Pat Dugan, Kimiyo Hoshi, Emil Hamilton, Thomas Morrow, and Stephen Shin) before they are all killed by the Metal Men with the exception of Will Magnus (who secretly orchestrated the attack).","output":"This text is about the fictional character Steel (John Henry Irons), also known as the Man of Steel, who is a superhero in the DC Universe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When the figure turns around the film introduces the audience to Lilja, who has recently been brutally beaten. The film then reveals her past. Lilja lives with her mother in a run down apartment block in an unnamed former republic of the Soviet Union (principal filming took place in Paldiski, Estonia). Lilja's mother tells her they are emigrating to the United States with the mother's new boyfriend, but instead she abandons Lilya in the care of her aunt. The selfish Aunt moves herself into the larger, nicer flat that Lilja and her mother had lived in, while forcing Lilya to move into a smaller, squalid apartment. A subsequent succession of humiliations and miseries are heaped upon Lilja. Her best friend encourages her to join her in prostituting herself for cash, but Lilja does not join her. When money is discovered in the friend's possession, she lies and implicates Lilya, whose reputation is subsequently ruined in the community and at school. She finally decides to become a prostitute to support herself. She forms a close, protective relationship with her friend Volodya, himself the victim of abuse.

You may recall that I’d been helping out a local charity with their website? Well that is all completed now but I’ve had some other family stuff going on and with looking after my baby daughter spare time for blogging is pretty scarce at the moment. I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

Answer the following question: Answer the question below:   If Milo is listening to the radio in his room and the room gets hotter, what happens to the speed of the sound waves generated by the radio increase or decrease?    Assuming that:  For a given medium, sound waves travel more slowly at lower temperatures. Answer:","output":"To answer this question, we first need to understand the relationship between temperature and the speed of sound waves in a given medium. The medium in this scenario is air, as sound waves travel through the air to reach Milo's ears from the radio.  When the temperature of a medium, like air, increases, the kinetic energy of its particles also increases. This results in a higher average speed of the particles and their interactions. In the case of sound waves, this increased kinetic energy translates into an increased speed of sound propagation due to the particles' increased ability to transmit the vibrational energy of the sound waves through the medium. Now, let's go back to the scenario. Milo is listening to the radio in his room, and as the room gets hotter, the temperature of the air in the room increases. According to the principles outlined above, this increase in temperature should lead to an increase in the speed of sound waves traveling through the air in the room. As a result, the speed of the sound waves generated by the radio will increase in the presence of higher temperatures. This is because the air particles in the room have a higher kinetic energy at the elevated temperature, making them more efficient at transmitting the vibrational energy of the sound waves from the radio to Milo's ears. To summarize, when the temperature in Milo's room increases, the speed of the sound waves generated by the radio also increases, due to the increased kinetic energy of the air particles and their enhanced ability to transmit the sound wave's vibrational energy through the medium. This relationship between temperature and the speed of sound holds true for other mediums as well, with variations depending on the medium's specific properties."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This question seems to be asking about the process of earning or winning money through YouTube-related activities. The phrasing is a bit unclear, but it looks like the person wants to know how to earn money on YouTube. Question 2: How can we make money from YouTube? This question clearly asks about ways to generate income from YouTube-related activities. Now, to answer your question: Are these two questions asking the same thing? Both questions appear to be asking about the process of earning money from YouTube. Although the phrasing is slightly different, the overall goal of each question seems to be the same, which is to understand how to make money through YouTube. Therefore, it can be concluded that these two questions are essentially asking the same thing."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: In what year did the titular counselor abandon his civil servant career?, using the article: Tchaikovsky was born in 1840 in Votkinsk, a small town in present-day Udmurtia, formerly the Imperial Russian province of Vyatka. A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, 800 miles (1,300 km) from his family home in Alapayevsk. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant. Tchaikovsky remained there for the rest of his three-year civil service career.In 1861, Tchaikovsky..., what would be the answer ?

OPT: I. yes II. no","output":"II. no While it is true that biodiversity is generally richest in the tropics, a more detailed and long answer would better address the different locations and factors that contribute to high biodiversity. Here's an example of an elaborated response: Biodiversity, the variety of life found in a particular ecosystem or region, is most abundant in the tropics because of several factors, including temperature, rainfall, and ecological history. Tropical regions, particularly tropical rainforests, are considered the most biologically diverse on Earth, housing millions of species of plants, animals, and microorganisms. Tropical rainforests, such as those in the Amazon Basin (South America), the Congo Basin (Central Africa), and Southeast Asia (including Indonesia and New Guinea), support an astounding array of life forms due to their unique conditions. Similarly, coral reefs, commonly found in tropical regions, represent one of the most diverse marine ecosystems. The “Coral Triangle” in Southeast Asia, for instance, has the highest concentration of marine biodiversity globally. High temperatures and consistent sunlight in tropical regions contribute to the high productivity of these ecosystems. This, in turn, supports a large number of species that depend on the abundant resources available. Furthermore, the high rainfall in tropical areas creates a humid environment that fosters lush growth of vegetation, which supports a complex food web and enables various species to coexist. Another significant factor contributing to high biodiversity in the tropics is their long-term ecological stability. Over millions of years, the tropical climate has remained relatively constant, allowing species to persist and adapt without facing the same selection pressures as those in temperate regions. This gives species the chance to specialize in occupying particular ecological niches, contributing to the high diversity seen today. However, it is essential to recognize that while the tropics host the majority of Earth's biodiversity, other regions play vital roles in preserving unique ecosystems and endemic species. For example, Madagascar, which is not located in the tropical rainforest regions mentioned above, is still home to a significant number of endemic species. In conclusion, biodiversity is the most abundant in tropical regions due to favorable climatic conditions, ecological stability, and a long evolutionary history that has allowed species to diversify and specialize. Tropical rainforests and coral reefs represent some of the planet's hotspots for biodiversity, but other regions, such as Madagascar, should not be overlooked for their contribution to the rich tapestry of life on Earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But just a short walk from Manhattan's skyscrapers, George Brown sits on the side-walk, cooking a lunch of rice and bits of fish over a can of cooking fuel. Brown is homeless -- one of the 2.3 million people in the US who end up on the street. During the day, Brown collects aluminium cans and sells them for five cents a piece.At night, he sleeps on the street. \\"I have been on the street about eight or nine years, something like that,\\" said the 62-year-old former construction worker. Brown admits he's had problems with alcohol and has smoked cocaine.But he said he still wants a more stable housing arrangement.He could afford it just with the money he earns by collecting cans and small pieces of metal, if only truly low-income housing were available. However, he sees no hope of finding affordable housing in New York. With the strong economy and unemployment down, beautiful housing is being built to meet demand. A US report shows rents in New York city rose more than 27 percent between 1984 and 1999, from US 549 to US 700 a month. One of the side effects of the strong economy is that rents have been going up. The majority of people who experience homelessness really just need some affordable housing help. But few housing companies have been built for the poor.Many small apartments in the city now rent for US 1,500 a month or more. Brown, the homeless New Yorker, said he has a daughter who lives in the city but he rarely sees her.She is angry about his drinking and won't allow it in her house.

Ned Ravine, who is both a police officer and lawyer (who often defends the people he arrests), believes that he knows everything about women, and says that he will throw away his badge if anyone ever proves him wrong. While on a stakeout, he encounters a seductive woman named Lola Cain; the next day, Lola shows up at his law office, saying that she needs him to look over some papers she has come across. Meanwhile, Max Shady, who was just released from prison after seven years, starts stalking Ned, planning to kill him for failing to successfully defend Max in court. Ned's wife Lana and her car mechanic Frank, with whom she is having an affair, start plotting to kill Ned in order to collect on his accident insurance, which has a triple indemnity rider; if Ned is shot, falls from a northbound train, and drowns in a freshwater stream, Lana will collect nine million dollars. Lola gets Ned to come to her house to examine the \\"papers\\", which are actually a laundry receipt and an expired lottery ticket, and the two of them end up having sex in various wild ways. The next morning, Ned says that they can never do that again because he loves his wife; this drives Lola to start stalking Ned. A few days later, Ned takes the train to go to a legal symposium; Lana and Frank are also on the train, and so is Max. When the train passes over a lake, Lana shoots Max 36 times with a revolver, mistaking him for Ned, and he backflips through the door to his death; Ned thinks that Lana had acted to save his life.

Information:  - The Theory of Moral Sentiments is a 1759 book by Adam Smith. It provided the ethical, philosophical, psychological, and methodological underpinnings to Smith's later works, including \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" (1776), \\"Essays on Philosophical Subjects\\" (1795), and \\"Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms\\" (1763) (first published in 1896).  - Bernard Mandeville, or Bernard de Mandeville (15 November 1670  21 January 1733), was an Anglo-Dutch philosopher, political economist and satirist. Born in Rotterdam, Netherlands, he lived most of his life in England and used English for most of his published works. He became famous for \\"The Fable of the Bees\\".  - Economics (, ) is a social science concerned with the factors that determine the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The term \\"economics\\" comes from the Ancient Greek from (', pronounced \\"eekos\\", \\"house\\") and (', \\"custom\\" or \\"law\\"), hence \\"rules of the house (hold for good management)\\". 'Political economy' was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested \\"economics\\" as a shorter term for \\"economic science\\" to establish itself as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences.  - Macroeconomics (from the Greek prefix \\"makro-\\" meaning \\"large\\" and economics) is a branch of economics dealing with the performance, structure, behavior, and decision-making of an economy as a whole. This includes  national, regional, and global economies. Macroeconomics and microeconomics, a pair of terms coined by Ragnar Frisch, are the two most general fields in economics. In contrast to macroeconomics, microeconomics is the branch of economics that studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions and the interactions among these individuals and firms in narrowly-defined markets.  - The Fable of The Bees : or , Private Vices , Public Benefits is a book by Bernard Mandeville , consisting of the poem , The Grumbling Hive : or , Knaves turn 'd Honest , along with prose discussion of the poem . The poem was published in 1705 , and the book first appeared in 1714 . The poem suggests many key principles of economic thought , including division of labor and the \`\` invisible hand '' , seventy years before these concepts were more thoroughly elucidated by Adam Smith . Two centuries later , the noted economist John Maynard Keynes cited Mandeville to show that it was \`\` no new thing ... to ascribe the evils of unemployment to ... the insufficiency of the propensity to consume '' , a condition also known as the paradox of thrift , which was central to his own theory of effective demand . At the time , however , it was considered scandalous . Keynes noted that it was \`\` convicted as a nuisance by the grand jury of Middlesex in 1723 , which stands out in the history of the moral sciences for its scandalous reputation . Only one man is recorded as having spoken a good word for it , namely Dr. Johnson , who declared that it did not puzzle him , but ' opened his eyes into real life very much ' . '' It was also reported that : Mandeville gave great offense by this book , in which a cynical system of morality was made attractive by ingenious paradoxes . ... His doctrine that prosperity was increased by expenditure rather than by saving fell in with many current economic fallacies not yet extinct . Assuming with the ascetics that human desires were essentially evil and therefore produced \`\` private vices '' and assuming with the common view that wealth was a \`\` public benefit '' , he easily showed that all civilization implied the development of vicious propensities ... . -- Leslie Stephen , in Dictionary of National Biography , quoted by Keynes 1964 , pp. 359 -- 560 .  - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.  - Gross output is an economic concept used to measure total economic activity in the production of new goods and services in an accounting period. It is a much broader measure of the economy than gross domestic product (GDP), which is limited mainly to final output (finished goods and services). In 2015, the Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated gross output in the United States to be 31.6 trillion, compared to 18.1 trillion for GDP.  - Political economy is a term used for studying production and trade, and their relations with law, custom, and government, as well as with the distribution of national income and wealth. \\"Political economy\\" originated in moral philosophy. It was developed in the 18th century as the study of the economies of states, or \\"polities\\", hence the term \\"political\\" economy.  - A paradox is a statement that, despite apparently sound reasoning from true premises, leads to a self-contradictory or a logically unacceptable conclusion. A paradox involves contradictory yet interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time.  - Richard Cantillon (1680s  ) was an Irish-French economist and author of \\"Essai sur la Nature du Commerce en Général\\" (\\"Essay on the Nature of Trade in General\\"), a book considered by William Stanley Jevons to be the \\"cradle of political economy\\". Although little information exists on Cantillon's life, it is known that he became a successful banker and merchant at an early age. His success was largely derived from the political and business connections he made through his family and through an early employer, James Brydges. During the late 1710s and early 1720s, Cantillon speculated in, and later helped fund, John Law's Mississippi Company, from which he acquired great wealth. However, his success came at a cost to his debtors, who pursued him with lawsuits, criminal charges, and even murder plots until his death in 1734.  - A legend is a narrative of human actions that are perceived both by teller and listeners to take place within human history and demonstrating human values, and which possesses certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. Legend, for its active and passive participants, includes no happenings that are outside the realm of \\"possibility\\", but may include miracles. Legends may be transformed over time, in order to keep them fresh and vital, and realistic. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted.  - Keynesian economics (; or Keynesianism) are the various theories about how in the short run, and especially during recessions, economic output is strongly influenced by aggregate demand (total spending in the economy). In the Keynesian view, aggregate demand does not necessarily equal the productive capacity of the economy; instead, it is influenced by a host of factors and sometimes behaves erratically, affecting production, employment, and inflation.  - An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, generally referred to by its shortened title The Wealth of Nations, is the \\"magnum opus\\" of the Scottish economist and moral philosopher Adam Smith. First published in 1776, the book offers one of the world's first collected descriptions of what builds nations' wealth, and is today a fundamental work in classical economics. By reflecting upon the economics at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the book touches upon such broad topics as the division of labour, productivity, and free markets.  - Adam Smith (16 June 1723 NS  17 July 1790) was a Scottish economist, philosopher, and author. He was a moral philosopher, a pioneer of political economy, and was a key figure during the Scottish Enlightenment era. He is best known for two classic works: \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\" (1759), and \\"An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations\\" (1776). The latter, usually abbreviated as \\"The Wealth of Nations\\", is considered his \\"magnum opus\\" and the first modern work of economics.  - Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry. Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph.  - A legendary creature is an animal or part-human being described in non-historical stories that sometimes involve the supernatural. In the classical era, monstrous creatures such as the Cyclops and the Minotaur appear in heroic tales for the protagonist to destroy. Other creatures, such as the unicorn, were claimed in accounts of natural history by various scholars of antiquity. Some legendary creatures have their origin in traditional mythology and were believed to be real creatures, for example dragons, griffins, and unicorns. Others were based on real encounters, originating in garbled accounts of travelers' tales, such as the Vegetable Lamb of Tartary, which supposedly grew tethered to the earth.  - The paradox of thrift (or paradox of saving) is a paradox of economics. The paradox states that an increase in autonomous saving leads to a decrease in aggregate demand and thus a decrease in gross output which will in turn lower \\"total\\" saving. The paradox is, narrowly speaking, that total saving may fall because of individuals' attempts to increase their saving, and, broadly speaking, that increase in saving may be harmful to an economy. Both the narrow and broad claims are paradoxical within the assumption underlying the fallacy of composition, namely that what is true of the parts must be true of the whole. The narrow claim transparently contradicts this assumption, and the broad one does so by implication, because while individual thrift is generally averred to be good for the economy, the paradox of thrift holds that collective thrift may be bad for the economy.  - Fable is a literary genre: a succinct fictional story, in prose or verse, that features animals, legendary creatures, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature that are anthropomorphized (given human qualities, such as the ability to speak human language) and that illustrates or leads to a particular moral lesson (a \\"moral\\"), which may at the end be added explicitly as a pithy maxim.  - The invisible hand is a term used by Adam Smith to describe the unintended social benefits of individual actions. The phrase was employed by Smith with respect to income distribution (1759) and production (1776). The exact phrase is used just three times in Smith's writings, but has come to capture his notion that individuals' efforts to pursue their own interest may frequently benefit society more than if their actions were directly intending to benefit society. Smith may have come up with the two meanings of the phrase from Richard Cantillon who developed both economic applications in his model of the isolated estate.  - The Scottish Enlightenment was the period in 18th and early 19th century Scotland characterised by an outpouring of intellectual and scientific accomplishments. By the eighteenth century, Scotland had a network of parish schools in the Lowlands and four universities. The Enlightenment culture was based on close readings of new books, and intense discussions took place daily at such intellectual gathering places in Edinburgh as The Select Society and, later, The Poker Club as well as within Scotlands ancient universities (St Andrews, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen).  - In macroeconomics, aggregate demand (AD) or domestic final demand (DFD) is the total demand for final goods and services in an economy at a given time. It specifies the amounts of goods and services that will be purchased at all possible price levels. This is the demand for the gross domestic product of a country. It is often called effective demand, though at other times this term is distinguished.  - John Maynard Keynes, 1st Baron Keynes (; 5 June 1883  21 April 1946), was a British economist. His ideas fundamentally changed the theory and practice of macroeconomics and the economic policies of governments. He built on and greatly refined earlier work on the causes of business cycles, and is widely considered to be one of the most influential economists of the 20th century and the founder of modern macroeconomics. His ideas are the basis for the school of thought known as Keynesian economics and its various offshoots.  - Rotterdam is a city in the Netherlands, located in South Holland, within the RhineMeuseScheldt river delta at the North Sea. Its history goes back to 1270 when a dam was constructed in the Rotte river by people settled around it for safety. In 1340 Rotterdam was granted city rights by the Count of Holland and slowly grew into a major logistic and economic centre. Nowadays it is home to Europe's largest port and has a population of 633,471 (city proper), ranking second in the Netherlands. The Greater Rijnmond area is home to approximately 1.4 million people and the Rotterdam The Hague Metropolitan Area makes for the 168th most populous urban area in the world. Rotterdam is part of the yet larger Randstad conurbation with a total population of 7,100,000.  - In economics, effective demand (ED) in a market is the demand for a product or service which occurs when purchasers are constrained in a different market. It contrasts with notional demand, which is the demand that occurs when purchasers are not constrained in any other market. In the aggregated market for goods in general, effective demand is the same thing as aggregate demand when the demand for goods is influenced by spillovers from quantity constraints from other markets. The concept of effective supply parallels the concept of effective demand. The concept of effective demand or supply becomes relevant when markets do not continuously maintain equilibrium prices.

Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?  *no;  *yes;","output":"*no; The two questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they address different subjects. The first question focuses on Intel's financial year-end on the last Saturday of December, while the second question is more personal and revolves around having the best financial year ever. Regarding the first question: Intel, like many other companies, has chosen to structure its financial year-end on the last Saturday of December for several reasons: 1. Fiscal-year alignment: Many technology companies in the United States use a fiscal year aligned with the calendar year. This practice enables easier comparison of financial performance between different companies in the industry. 2. Holiday sales: The last Saturday of December usually falls after the major holiday shopping season, which contributes significantly to their revenues. By including the holiday sales period in the fourth quarter, Intel can better capture the financial results of the holiday season in its financial statements. 3. Operational efficiency: Using a consistent day of the week as the year-end, such as the last Saturday, can make it easier for employees to close their books and minimize business disruption. This practice allows them to better coordinate the year-end closing procedures across various departments and geographies. 4. Regulatory compliance: Publicly traded companies like Intel are required to report their financial performance to the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) in the form of annual 10-K filings and quarterly 10-Q filings. Keeping their financial year-end in line with calendar years facilitates the company's compliance with these reporting requirements. Now, addressing the second question: To have your best financial year ever, consider implementing the following strategies: 1. Set clear financial goals: Establish reachable, specific financial objectives for the year. Your goals may include paying down debt, increasing your savings, or funding a specific investment. 2. Create a budget: Develop a realistic budget that accounts for your income, expenses, savings, and investments. Track your spending each month and adjust your budget as needed. 3. Automate your savings: Set up automatic transfers from your main checking account to a separate savings or investment account to ensure you consistently save money without needing to think about it. 4. Pay off high-interest debt: Focus on reducing your high-interest debts first, such as credit card debt. Devote a portion of your income to making more than the minimum payment, which can save you money on interest in the long run. 5. Be mindful of your spending: Adopt mindful spending habits by evaluating your expenses and eliminating unnecessary purchases. Make sure your spending is aligned with your financial goals and values. 6. Expand your income: Look for ways to increase your earnings through means such as pursuing career advancement opportunities, starting a side gig, or investing in income-generating assets. 7. Build an emergency fund: Ensure financial stability by setting aside money for emergencies such as unexpected medical bills, car repairs, or job loss. 8. Stay informed about your investments: Regularly review the performance of your investments and make adjustments as needed to stay on track with your financial objectives. 9. Educate yourself about personal finance: Continuously learn about personal finance topics, such as budgeting, investing, and tax planning, to make more informed financial decisions. 10. Seek expert advice: Consider speaking with a financial advisor to receive personalized guidance and help you achieve optimal financial results."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

She thought the","output":"wood's natural texture, the smell of fresh sawdust, and the way different grains came together to form unique, beautiful patterns had a certain charm that painting simply couldn't capture. Angela had discovered her love for carpentry during her junior year of high school, when she enrolled in a woodworking class on a whim. She never looked back. Angela was now in her mid-thirties, a skilled carpenter with her own workshop, and happy with the way her life had turned out. She still remembered the day she had left her boring desk job, trading it for a dusty workshop filled with the sounds of cutting, sawing, and hammering. Her friends and family had initially doubted her decision, but she was determined to prove herself, and prove herself she did. Over the years, Angela had built a successful carpentry business, creating custom furniture and home decor items for people all over the city. One day, she received an inquiry from an odd, yet intriguing, client. A wealthy art collector named Mr. Winston had recently purchased a rare, antique wooden carousel. The carousel was beautiful, but it had seen better days. With hopes of restoring the carousel to its former glory, he approached Angela in search of her woodworking expertise. Angela was enthralled by the prospect of working on such a unique and historic piece. After discussing the details of the project with Mr. Winston, she quickly agreed and the painstaking work began. The carousel had intricate wood carvings of various animals, such as horses, tigers, elephants, and giraffes. Each carving had an extraordinary level of detail, showcasing the mastery of the original craftsmen who had built the carousel. Angela knew she had to approach this project with care and precision. For weeks, she researched historical documents and studied the design styles of early carousel makers. She even reached out to other carpenters and art historians for advice on how to preserve the carousel's authenticity and charm throughout the restoration process. Once fully prepared, Angela carefully started working on the carousel. First, she had to repair the wooden components that had rotted or been damaged over the years. Each piece had to be replaced with the utmost caution, ensuring that it stayed true to the original design. She then took on the painstaking process of cleaning the delicate woodwork. Using a gentle, chemical-free cleaning solution, she meticulously worked her way through every angle and curve, removing decades of grime, dirt, and paint. Next, Angela focused on the carousel's mechanics. She hired a specialist to inspect and repair the gears, cogs, and bearings that allowed the carousel to spin smoothly and without a hitch. Through this collaboration, they managed to get the carousel fully operational once again. Finally, it was time to add the finishing touches. Angela's initial aversion to painting seemed like a hindrance, but she refused to let that stop her from completing the project to perfection. She enlisted the help of a renowned local artist who was skilled in recreating vintage paint styles. Together, they carefully chose historically accurate color palettes and precisely repainted the wood carvings. The day came for the grand unveiling of the restored carousel. Mr. Winston invited Angela and key members of the restoration team to attend a private event at his estate. With bated breath, they all watched as the stunning carousel was revealed. It was a masterpiece. The wood shone with a rich luster, the intricate carvings danced in the light, and the animals seemed almost alive as they spun in a whirl of vibrant colors. Mr. Winston was beyond pleased, and his joy turned into an enthusiastic applause as he shook Angela's hand, beaming with pride. Her work on the carousel restoration project had demonstrated Angela's immense skill and dedication as a carpenter. The success of the endeavor opened up new doors for her professionally, and spurred her on to challenge herself with even more ambitious projects in the future. Angela proved not only to herself, but to everyone around her that carpentry was much more than just a hobby or a profession - it was her true passion, and a craft that required equal parts creativity and skill."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Upon receiving a key from her Uncle Max, Cabella travels to Italy where she discovers the key is related to a house named Cabella near a village. While traveling she stops near a waterfall to swim and loses the key, but a mysterious man returns the key. She then travels to the village, finds the house, and uses the key to open it. The next day she goes to the market where the mysterious man works and learns from his cousin Maria that his name is Leo and he is deaf and mute.

Whether she's frustrated, embarrassed or angry, let your daughter know her feelings matter too.  Don't roll your eyes or tell her she's overreacting. For example, respond by saying, “I hear what you're saying. It sounds like you're really angry with your friends. That must be difficult.” If you're in a heated discussion or just having a serious conversation, always give her the opportunity to speak. Don't just brush off what she says. Make eye contact, nod while she's speaking and really listen. Repeat back what your teen said so that she knows you have listened to and acknowledged her feelings. One of the best ways to validate your daughter's feelings is to show your support with a hug. Sometimes your teen doesn't want to talk. Sometimes she's simply needs your affection and attention.   If your daughter is really upset you may want to say, “It sounds like you're going through a tough time. Can I give you a hug?” A hug can be a good resolution to an argument as well. Take a few minutes to cool off, then approach your daughter and summarize what her side of the argument was. Ask her for a hug afterwards to show that you love and support her. You may think she's too young to experience such issues, but if your teen mentions she's depressed or suicidal, acknowledge what she's saying and act on it.    One in five teenagers are diagnosed with mental health issues, so it's important to acknowledge her feelings.  Although occasional moodiness or bouts of sadness is fairly normal for teenagers, take note if she's withdrawing from friends and family or suddenly has lost interest in all of her favorite activities.  Be supportive and let her know she's loved and that this issue is worth your time and attention. Show that you've acknowledged her feelings by scheduling an appointment with a mental health professional. Go with her to the appointment, take notes and ask questions about treatment plans.

The Salvation Army, which owns the former home, is putting the red Victorian gates into storage.

The charity said fans would still get an \\"authentic experience\\", but one tour guide said they were \\"aghast\\". Replicas of the 100-year-old wrought iron gates have been made by metal work specialist Jim Bennett, from Aigburth, and given to The Salvation Army.

The long-term future of the site, which closed in 2005, is yet to be determined but the charity hopes to develop a centre for children with learning disabilities. \\"Although care has been taken to ensure the original gates to the site have remained in good condition, inevitably time has taken its toll,\\" said Maj Ray Irving, director of social services for The Salvation Army. \\"This means that the original gates can be kept safe from further deterioration and with the replica gates in place, allow for an authentic experience for the many thousands of people who come on a 'musical pilgrimage' to Strawberry Field.\\" Lennon wrote Strawberry Fields Forever, which was released in 1967, from his memories of playing in the area as a child.

(CNN) -- The world's top two players will battle it out for the French Open title on Saturday, but their route to the Roland Garros final could not have been more different. Relief was evident on the face of defending champion and world No. 2 Maria Sharapova who survived a third-set comeback from Victoria Azarenka to nail down a hard-fought 6-1 2-6 6-4 victory. Conversely, Serena Williams, the world No. 1, was so dominant against Sara Errani that the Italian ironically celebrated the only game she won in a match that lasted just 46 minutes and ended 6-0 6-1. Sharapova must now try and arrest her poor record against the American, having won just two of their 15 encounters. Saturday's meeting will be the first time since 1995 that the top two seeds have faced each other in the final.

Most grocery stores post the price per ounce (or kilogram) along with the total cost of a product. Compare the prices per ounce between 2 or 3 different brands to find which one offers a better deal. For example, say that 1 brand of peanut butter offers 20 oz for 8¢ an ounce, while another company offers 30 oz for 5¢ per ounce. While you’ll be buying a larger amount of peanut butter, the second company offers a much better deal.  If the price per ounce isn’t listed, a pocket calculator can be handy. Just divide the total price by the number of ounces. Consider buying private-label or store brands. In many cases, these rival the quality of the better-known brands at a significantly lower cost. When your grocery store offers a great discount on an item that you like, take advantage of the sale and stock up! The item probably won’t be on sale for very long, so you can save money by buying, say, 6 months’ worth of ground beef at once. This is especially helpful for nonperishable items or for foods that can be frozen, including meats and veggies. Keep the stockpiled foods in the freezer until you need them to prevent them from spoiling. Stocking up on a food that you won’t use defeats the purpose of this step. If you rarely eat artichokes but they’re on sale 10 for 1, it’s probably smart not to take advantage of that particular sale. For example, visit your grocery store early and shop for baked goods early in the day. That is when bakeries and grocery stores mark down their day-old items. Also try to shop for meat later in the day. That is when the meat department marks down items about to go past the “sell by” date. This meat is perfectly safe and can be frozen for later use. Your grocery store may have other recurring mark-downs that you can capitalize on. For example, some grocery stores slash their prices on Sunday evenings to prepare for new incoming inventory on Monday. Processed items may be convenient—and make up a large part of many people’s diets—but they’re usually more expensive and less nutritious. Instead of processed foods, look for whole grains and fresh produce that have more nutritional value. Also try cutting back on expensive meat and dairy products. Look for ways to get your protein from items like beans and nuts.  For example, buy inexpensive but healthy foods that are easy to fix, such as oatmeal and legumes. Shop on the periphery of the store where fresh produce is located. Avoid the center aisles where processed and packaged food is found. Wholesale clubs usually sell in bulk at cheaper prices than their competitors. They’re especially good for finding cheap packaged foods, and often also have affordable delis and bakeries. Try shopping for your processed and pre-packaged foods at a wholesale club. Also buy durable goods that you’ll need in the future, such as bath tissues, grains, canned food and dried beans. Common wholesale clubs include BJ’s, Costco and Sam’s Club.  These stores do charge an annual membership fee, but that’s easily offset if you shop there even 1–2 times a month. If you buy mostly fresh produce and not much packaged food, wholesale clubs are probably not for you.","output":"To save money on groceries, compare prices per ounce, consider private-label brands, take advantage of sales, know when stores mark down items, opt for nutritious whole foods over processed items, and utilize wholesale clubs for bulk purchases and durable goods."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Background: Many mutations have no effect on the proteins they encode. These mutations are considered neutral. Occasionally, a mutation may make a protein even better than it was before. Or the protein might help the organism adapt to a new environment. These mutations are considered beneficial. An example is a mutation that helps bacteria resist antibiotics. Bacteria with the mutation increase in numbers, so the mutation becomes more common. Other mutations are harmful. They may even be deadly. Harmful mutations often result in a protein that no longer can do its job. Some harmful mutations cause cancer or other genetic disorders.  Paragraph: David is a biochemist with a pharmaceutical company. He is testing three strains of bacteria, case A, case B, and case C. In case A the bacteria does not respond to antibiotics. In case B the bacteria resists antibiotics. Finally, in case C, the bacteria does not develop any immunity to antibiotics and eventually perishes.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which case the organism would less likely have genetic disorder, case B or case C? Answer:","output":"In case B, the organism would less likely have a genetic disorder.

The 1933 double eagle, a 20 gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president, a king and a Secret Service sting operation, was auctioned Tuesday last night for a record price for a coin, 7.59 million, nearly double the previous record. The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay. As auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy, the sale price \\"suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong,\\" said David Redden, a vice chairman at Sotheby's, who was the auctioneer. \\"This is an astonishing new record for a coin,\\" he said. In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996. Henrietta Holsman Fore, the director of the U.S. Mint, who witnessed the sale, said, \\"The monies we receive will go toward helping to pay down the debt and to fight the war on terrorism.\\" Fenton commented that the double eagle had been on \\"a long historic journey, with a very satisfying ending.\\" He added, \\"I am thrilled with the price.\\" The previous numismatic record holder was an 1804 U.S. silver dollar, which sold for 4.14 million in 1999. Sotheby's partner in the one-lot auction was Stack's Rare Coins, with which it shared the customary 15 percent commission. \\"I have never seen as much interest in the sale of any coin in my 30 years in the business,\\" said Lawrence R. Stack, the company's managing director. \\"This is the Mona Lisa of coins,\\" said Beth Deisher, editor of Coin World, the largest weekly coin publication in the United States, with a circulation of 85,000. \\"It is unique.

Here is an article: Barack Obama's strategy to pass health-care reform seems based on a simple principle: Whatever Bill Clinton did, do the opposite. Where Clinton and his team crafted their health-care reform plan in the executive branch, Obama has left the details of his effort almost entirely to Congress. Where Clinton pursued an ambitious reconstruction of the entire sector, Obama has sought to preserve existing insurance arrangements and win the support of industry players. Where Clinton spent a year developing his bill before even getting to Congress, Obama lashed his efforts to a tight (and apparently unrealizable) timetable. Even the atmospherics offer contrasts: Clinton's big push for reform came in a soaring 1993 speech before a joint session of Congress, in which he offered painstaking details of his plans; Obama made his argument to the nation at a news conference last week, addressing concerns more than specifying proposals. Obama's reluctance to follow Clinton's example is understandable: Few legislative failures have been as catastrophic as Clinton's on health-care reform. Yet the ghosts of the early 1990s still hover over today's debates. Much as opponents derided the Clinton effort as Clintoncare or Hillarycare, some now speak of Obamacare, and Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) recently chortled in a conference call that a defeat on health care would be Obama's \\"Waterloo.\\" The president, for his part, told PBS's Jim Lehrer last week that some Republicans are engaging in a 1994 redux. \\"They explicitly went after the Clintons, said: 'We're not going to get this done.' . . . It was a pure political play, a show of strength by the Republicans that helped them regain the House,\\" Obama said. \\"I think there are folks who think that we should try to dust off that old playbook.\\" Yet there are aspects of Clinton's approach that could, and should, inform Obama's effort -- and not just as examples of what not to do. Clinton's attempt to remake health care may be remembered now as a moment of colossal hubris and epic political misjudgment, but his project was bedeviled by a greater sin: prescience. Clinton got the politics of reform wrong, but in important ways, he got the policy right. He just got it right too soon. By the time Clinton and his team took office, the insurance market was changing. American consumers had traditionally relied on the most straightforward of insurance products: indemnity insurance. You went to the doctor or hospital of your choice, and that doctor or hospital sent your insurer the bill. Hopefully, your insurer paid it. That was that. The plans weren't confined to networks tangled in deductibles and co-pays. But they weren't holding down costs, either, and the system was becoming unaffordable. Managed care, a new system that was rapidly emerging, envisioned a more central role for insurers. After all, they were paying for your treatment, so why shouldn't they get some say in how it was conducted? The managed-care revolution of the mid-90s was, by the early years of that decade, clearly inevitable; the financing and delivery of health care could not remain separate forever. But this was a dangerous change. Insurers make money by denying claims. Money they spend on health care is money they lose (they even have a name for it: the \\"medical-loss ratio\\"). Private insurance is a bit like a fire department that turns a profit by letting buildings burn down. So Clinton sought to cage managed care inside managed competition, which would regulate the behavior of insurers and force them to compete for patients. This would give consumers more power against their insurance companies, drive the bad actors from the market and generally protect against the excesses of managed care. Clinton's plan also included a handful of other safeguards, like out-of-pocket caps and an independent appeals process, designed to protect consumers from deficient insurance. \\"Clinton attempted to grapple with that change that was coming,\\" recalls Sara Rosenbaum, director of George Washington University's School of Public Health and Health Services and one of the lead drafters of Clinton's bill, \\"but to also make sure that there would be a higher power than just the market.\\" But if Clinton's team of enlightened wonks could glimpse managed care over the horizon, the public wasn't as farsighted. Bill and Hillary weren't seen as meeting and taming the managed-care revolution. The act of writing legislation that included managed care made it seem as if they were proposing it. And there was no political margin in that. Managed care, after all, means less choice. It means provider networks and insurance bureaucrats and complexity. It would have been a hard sell under any circumstances, but the Clinton administration's chaotic political operation and continual drip of scandals made the job virtually impossible. The plan died a painful and public death in Congress and contributed to the GOP's huge gains in the 1994 elections. But then a funny thing happened: Managed care came anyway. By last year, only 7 percent of American workers were in \\"traditional\\" indemnity health plans, while the rest of us -- or at least those of us fortunate enough to have insurance -- were swimming in the alphabet soup of HMOs and PPOs and HDHPs. We're all in networks now. We don't get our choice of doctor. There's no appeals process. No out-of-pocket caps. Nothing to stop insurers from rejecting our coverage applications based on preexisting conditions. And if we don't like our insurer? Tough. \\"We got managed care,\\" says Chris Jennings, who was one of Clinton's top health-care staffers. \\"But we didn't get the things that would protect us from managed care. We got the Wild West version of it.\\" In the modern health-care system, there is no higher power than the insurance market. And the insurers who populate that market have grown all the stronger. The Justice Department judges an industry \\"highly concentrated\\" if a single company controls more than 42 percent of the market. By that definition, 94 percent of statewide insurance markets are highly concentrated. A recent study by the advocacy organization Health Care for America Now showed that in Indiana, WellPoint controls 60 percent of the insurance market; in Iowa, Wellmark accounts for 71 percent; and in Alabama, Blue Cross/Blue Shield holds 83 percent. In the past 13 years, there have been more than 400 corporate mergers involving health insurers. Economics textbooks tell us that concentrated markets reduce the competitive behavior that benefits consumers and lead to outsize profits for the dominant firms. Predictably, health-care premiums shot up more than 90 percent between 2000 and 2007, while the profits of the 10 largest insurers increased 428 percent over the same period. Clinton had promised us managed care within managed competition. Instead, the insurers took control of our care and managed to effectively end competition. Neat trick. This has not gone totally unnoticed in the political system. In September 2007, a young senator lamented that the number of insurers had fallen by 20 percent since 2000. The senator? Barack Obama. All of this has led to an interesting reversal in this year's health-care debate. In 1994, people feared that Clinton would restrict their choices. In 2009, people want Obama to bring their choices back. On June 2, Obama sent Sens. Ted Kennedy and Max Baucus, key players on reform, a letter laying out his \\"core belief\\" on a health overhaul: \\"that Americans should have better choices for health insurance.\\" He's tapping into something. A Washington Post-ABC News poll last month showed that 62 percent of Americans support the choice of a public insurance option. It's one of the most popular aspects of health-care reform. But if the public option would drive private insurers out of business and reduce consumer choice, the numbers flip, with 58 percent opposing it. What people support, in other words, is not public or private insurance, but choice in insurance. That, along with protection from escalating costs, is the inviolable principle of health-care reform. The irony is that some of the health reform proposals on the table this year are a bit of back to the future. The health insurance exchanges that Obama envisions -- regulated markets that the government would set up where insurers would compete for business -- are the successors to the managed competition that Clinton sought. The regulations on insurer behavior and the out-of-pocket caps are direct descendants of the Clinton bill. There are important ways, however, in which the bills currently working their way through Congress do not go as far as Clinton's plan did 15 years ago. In attempting to ensure that Americans can keep the coverage they like, they do not always ensure that people can leave insurers they do not like. The insurance exchanges, in particular, are limited to the self-employed, the uninsured and small businesses. Someone who works for a larger employer would not have any more choice under these proposals. Indeed, the problem with trying to make sure that everyone can keep what they have is that you can't change very much. This makes it hard for advocates to explain exactly how health-care reform will improve conditions for the insured, at least in the short term. Many in the White House say this is not a bug in the proposed system; it's a deliberate feature. The lesson of Clintoncare was that even if the American people want reform, they do not necessarily want change. And so Obama's health-care strategy involves a delicate effort to answer the question that doomed Clinton: How do you reform the health-care system without substantially changing it? But this is not the early 1990s. The indemnity insurance that most Americans enjoyed then is virtually nonexistent today. The mergers and takeovers and consolidations in the insurance market have given people less choice and thus less power. Today, the cost issue is more acute, the president is more popular, the Democrats have more seats in Congress, and the Republicans are more fractured. Obama, in other words, was right to dismiss those who would \\"dust off that old playbook.\\" But the ghosts still hover. Republicans are fixated on what worked for them in the last health-care battle, and Democrats are overly concerned with what contributed to their failure. Just as Clinton's plan was weighed down by the impression that it would change too much, history may leave Obama's effort vulnerable to the charge that it is changing too little.

While his agent, Paul Kinzer, told several U.S. media outlets that the 24-year old had gone to the police and spoke voluntarily about the incident, Jacobo Mateo Moquete, a spokesman for the Dominican national police, tweeted around 4 p.m. that Castro was still being detained along with six others and questioned in the incident. Moquete also tweeted that Castro’s home was raided in the early morning hours. About a half an hour later, Moquete tweeted that Castro had left the police station. The three time All-Star has been atop the wish list of many Mets fans this offseason who are clamoring for an upgrade over Wilmer Flores in 2015. They thought the Cubs, who acquired top shortstop prospect Addison Russell last summer, would now be more willing to part with Castro. The Mets and several rival general managers have checked on Castro’s availability several times this offseason, but have been told by the Cubs that they have no intention of trading him. It was the second time this December that Castro had been in the new in relation to a shooting at a nightclub. Kinzer told CBSChicago.com earlier this month Castro had been cleared of any involvement in a previous shooting. That has to be at least a little concerning for the Cubs as they head into 2015.

U.S. President Paul Hollister and FEMA Director Roy Nolan are informed about the situation. A magnitude 8.4 earthquake opens a crack which engulfs a train east of Redding, California. As a result, Governor Carla Williams, who had just seen her daughter and ex-husband off on a camping trip, agrees to help the Governor of Washington. Amanda Williams and her father Clark Williams arrive at a town named Browning, where everything is covered in a thick red haze.

Here is a question about this article: Faced with the stripping of their powers, Wu Sangui, later joined by Geng Zhongming and by Shang Kexi's son Shang Zhixin, felt they had no choice but to revolt. The ensuing Revolt of the Three Feudatories lasted for eight years. Wu attempted, ultimately in vain, to fire the embers of south China Ming loyalty by restoring Ming customs, ordering that the resented queues be cut, and declaring himself emperor of a new dynasty. At the peak of the rebels' fortunes, they extended their control as far north as the Yangtze River, nearly establishing a divided China. Wu then hesitated to go further north, not being able to coordinate strategy with his allies, and Kangxi was able to unify his forces for a counterattack led by a new generation of Manchu generals. By 1681, the Qing government had established control over a ravaged southern China which took several decades to recover. Manchu Generals and Bannermen were initially put to shame by the better performance of the Han Chinese Green Standard Army, who fought better than them against the rebels and this was noted by Kangxi, leading him to task Generals Sun Sike, Wang Jinbao, and Zhao Liangdong to lead Green Standard Soldiers to crush the rebels. The Qing thought that Han Chinese were superior at battling other Han people and so used the Green Standard Army as the dominant and majority army in crushing the rebels instead of Bannermen. Similarly, in northwestern China against Wang Fuchen, the Qing used Han Chinese Green Standard Army soldiers and Han Chinese Generals such as Zhang Liangdong, Wang Jinbao, and Zhang Yong as the primary military forces. This choice was due to the rocky terrain, which favoured infantry troops over cavalry, to the desire to keep Bannermen in the reserves, and, again, to the belief that Han troops were better at fighting other Han people. These Han generals achieved victory over the rebels. Also due to the mountainous terrain, Sichuan and southern Shaanxi were also retaken by the Han Chinese Green Standard Army under Wang Jinbao and Zhao Liangdong in 1680, with Manchus only participating in dealing with logistics and provisions. 400,000 Green Standard Army soldiers and 150,000 Bannermen served on the Qing side during the war. 213 Han Chinese Banner companies, and 527 companies of Mongol and Manchu Banners were mobilized by the Qing during the revolt. 400,000 Green Standard Army soldiers were used against the Three Feudatories besides 200,000 Bannermen.

Paragraph: Earths magnetic field helps protect Earth and its organisms. It protects us from harmful particles given off by the sun. Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest. This is also where relatively few organisms live. Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earths magnetic north pole. Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations. Recent research suggests that warblers and other migrating birds have structures in their eyes. These structures let them see Earths magnetic field as a visual pattern.

It's the beginning of summer, and an unusual heatwave is sweeping across the town. Despite the efforts of the townsfolk to keep cool and stay hydrated, things are about to take a dark and mysterious turn. The protagonist, Charlie, is an auto mechanic who works at his cousin's shop, the only one in town. When people begin to experience unexplained and simultaneous car trouble, they all look to Charlie for answers. Truck after truck arrives at the garage with the same bewildering issue: the battery has melted. While Charlie is initially baffled, he soon realizes that there must be an external factor causing these baffling issues. Alongside his faithful assistant, Haley, they engage in some detective work to figure out the cause of the melted batteries. As they dig deeper into the source of the heatwave, the plot thickens. The movie follows Charlie's attempts to get to the bottom of the phenomenon, as the lives of the townspeople and the town's economy are at stake. Astonville depends heavily on transportation for work, goods, and services. Charlie and Haley enlist the help of Emma, a brilliant scientist and Charlie's former high school sweetheart who now works at a popular tech company in the area. Together, they investigate both the grandiose natural phenomena occurring above and the strange electromagnetic field variations beneath the earth's surface. The trio discovers a dark secret; a covert and rogue governmental project hidden beneath the superficial beauty of Astonville. The project, codenamed \\"Solar Nexus\\", was designed to harness and control solar energy to be used as a powerful weapon of mass destruction. Accidentally activated during an unauthorized experiment, the Solar Nexus has begun melting the car batteries, as it feeds on their energy to charge itself up. The climax of the movie sees Charlie, Haley, and Emma confronting the rogue scientists and agents responsible for the Solar Nexus Project. They must find a way to shut down the machinery before the accumulated solar energy causes a catastrophic meltdown. On their dangerous quest to save the town of Astonville, the trio faces several risky encounters and life-threatening challenges. In the end, they successfully prevent the catastrophic meltdown with a risky maneuver, cleverly designed to redirect the energy back into the secret lab. The ensuing explosion destroys the Solar Nexus Project and all evidence of its existence, but Charlie, Haley, and Emma make it out in the nick of time. Post-explosion, the heatwave dissipates, and life in Astonville returns to normal except for Charlie, whose life has now been changed forever, as he must come to terms with the underground world of covert governmental projects that he now knows exist. Moreover, the relationships forged throughout this journey breathe a new sense of unity and hope in the town. \\"The Meltdown Mystery\\" will keep audiences on the edge of their seats with its captivating blend of sci-fi, mystery, and thrilling action sequences.

Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the context of the Treaty of Versailles. The Treaty of Versailles was signed on June 28, 1919, in the aftermath of World War I. The treaty was signed between the Allied Powers and Germany, and it aimed to impose severe restrictions on Germany to prevent future aggression and to ensure that they could not initiate another war. Step 2: Identify the major participants in the Treaty of Versailles. The major participants in the Treaty of Versailles included the United States, represented by President Woodrow Wilson; France, represented by Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau; Great Britain, represented by Prime Minister David Lloyd George; and Italy, represented by Prime Minister Vittorio Orlando. These four leaders were also known as the \\"Big Four.\\" Step 3: Determine who was not invited to the Treaty of Versailles. Given that the Treaty of Versailles focused on the aftermath of World War I, the Central Powers, which included Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria, were not formally invited to participate in the negotiations. However, following the treaty's conclusion, Germany was required to sign it, accepting the terms imposed upon them. Step 4: Provide the answer. Considering the context and participants at the Treaty of Versailles, the countries that were not invited to the treaty were the Central Powers, specifically Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria. While Germany was not initially invited to participate in the negotiations, they were ultimately required to sign the treaty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While you can technically read a book in natural light during the day, for evening or indoor reading when natural light is not available, an artificial light source like a lamp or an overhead light is necessary.

In the Treaty of Fontainebleau, the Allies exiled him to Elba, an island of 12,000 inhabitants in the Mediterranean, 20 km (12 mi) off the Tuscan coast.

Napoleon attempted suicide with a pill he had carried after nearly being captured by the Russians during the retreat from Moscow. Its potency had weakened with age, however, and he survived to be exiled while his wife and son took refuge in Austria.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer:  Bobby  for the following movie plot:  Doug (Barry Sullivan) and Helen Stilwin (Barbara Stanwyck) head off for a fishing vacation with their son Bobby (Lee Aker). Doug wants to return to beach he visited years before. The family is towing a small trailer with camping gear so they can fish and camp on the isolated beach south of Escondido in Mexico.As they leave drive, they get farther away from towns, services, and civilizations. When they need water for the cars radiator, they can only find a deserted service station. They leave the main road and encounter a police block. After a quick scan of the car, the Mexican authorities let them proceed, with no explanation for why they were stopped. When Helen asks Doug why he didn't push for an explanation, he tells her he didn't want them to look too closely at the car. He didn't want to explain why he was carrying his army pistol. Helen puts the gun in the glove box and they proceed.When they arrive at the beach, it is indeed isolated. An old, rotting jetty emerges far out into the water. As Doug and Helen are getting settled in and relaxing, Bobby climbs out to the jetty's end. Helen is worried the jetty is not safe and frantically calls Bobby back. As he return, his foot slips and is caught between two planks. Doug goes out to free him. As they are walking back over the precarious timbers, a large wave combined with Doug's weight causes the jetty to fall. Doug is trapped on the beach, his foot stuck under a timber too large to move.Helen tries to dig Doug out with a shovel, but the beach is solid rock. She retrieves the car jack and nearly has the large timber raised when the pin in the jack breaks. Doug and Helen decide that with a sturdy rope, she can pull the timber with the car. Helen will have to drive back to the deserted service station to find a rope. They estimate that Helen should have four hours before the rising tide covers Doug completely, threatening to drown him. Bobby stays with Doug and makes him a cup of coffee. Bobby tries unsuccessfully to wave down a fishing boat. When all hope is...

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? If you're able to drive and have access to a vehicle, a road trip can be a wonderful bonding experience between you and your friends. Pack a bag, load up the car, and hit the road together to explore someplace new and exciting.  If you are not yet old enough to drive, ask your parents about the possibility of taking a road trip together. Road trips take some planning (and money), though, so be sure to give your parents a few weeks to make arrangements. Decide in advance where you want to go. Driving aimlessly can be fun, but you can quickly find yourself lost, out of gas, or out of money. Choose whether to stay in hotels or camp. If you do camp, make sure it's feasible to camp in the conditions you'll be entering and plan for the weather wherever you'll be staying (which may mean preparing for snowy winter camping, depending on where you'll be). Make accommodation arrangements. If you'll be staying in hotels/motels, look into where you want to stay and consider booking a reservation. If you'll be camping, scout campgrounds and see if they accept reservations over the phone or online.  Choose a scenic route to get to your destination, if it's possible to do so safely. Know the conditions you'll be facing. Remember that some areas require chains on your tires to drive through icy mountain passes, which may be too dangerous for you to travel. Get your car checked out before the trip to make sure it's in good working condition. Bring whatever supplies you'll need. That includes emergency supplies in case you get stranded: extra blankets, food, water, batteries, a flashlight, road flares, gas money, and an extra charger for your cellphone. Winter break is a great time to reconnect with friends you haven't seen in a while. Whether you've been off at college or simply burdened by your studies in your home town, it can be difficult to spend time with friends while you're in school at any level.  Reach out to friends you don't see very often. Ride bikes together, play in the snow, or simply hang out watching movies or playing video games. Consider taking a trip to visit friends who live a few towns away or a state over. If you're not old enough to drive, ask your parents (and your friends' parents) about the possibility of taking an overnight trip. Have a sleep over with friends you've missed. Catch up on what's new with your friends. Get coffee together or go out for a meal. Depending on your financial situation, you and your family/friends may want to take a trip together to a warmer location. You can even take a trip alone, if you have sufficient funding and feel comfortable traveling solo. Spending a few days or a week on a warm, sunny beach might be just what you need to unwind from school and chase away the winter blues.  Start saving early and budget your money. Decide whether you'll need a hotel/motel, a rental car, and tickets to a theme park or other destination, and work those costs into your budget. If you're still young, ask your parents about whether a fun vacation might be possible. This type of trip can take months to plan, though, so be sure you ask well in advance of your winter break. Avoid traveling on major holiday weekends, as prices for flights tend to surge during these busy periods. You'll certainly be able to find lodging at a nationally-renown beach, but you can save a lot of money if you plan to stay at a smaller beach community off the beaten path. Just make sure that the area has what you need, including transportation and recreation options.  Find the best flight and/or hotel deals by searching a site like Expedia or BookingBuddy. These websites deliver prices from numerous travel pages to help you find the best prices, even on the same flight.  Plan on bringing one outfit per day, or scale down your suitcase by re-wearing some items. Just be sure you bring clothing that will be comfortable and appropriate for your destination.

As years went by, I wanted to get a new one, and my father agreed. We went to many stores and looked at many flyers  . At last we bought an HP computer. During the first week, I noticed that our computer had some problems. I tried to fix it, but failed. Finally I had to phone the HP company. After five hours' hard work, the computer still did not work. My dad didn't have a choice but to return the whole thing. A few days later, we decided that I should go on the internet and order some parts to build a new computer by myself. It was not an easy thing for me to deal with it, but in the end I finished. From these setbacks  , I have learned, and now believe if the computer that I bought from the store didn't have problems, then I would not learn how to build a new one.

The list of part-of-speech tags i.e. tagset of this corpus is 'ADJ': Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes, 'ADP': Adposition is a cover term for prepositions and postpositions, 'ADV': Adverbs are words that typically modify verbs for such categories as time, place, direction or manner, 'AUX': An auxiliary is a function word that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality, 'CCONJ': A coordinating conjunction is a word that links words or larger constituents without syntactically subordinating one to the other and expresses a semantic relationship between them, 'DET': Determiners are words that modify nouns or noun phrases and express the reference of the noun phrase in context, 'INTJ': An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or part of an exclamation, 'NOUN': Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing, animal or idea, 'NUM': A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction, 'PART': Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech, 'PRON': Pronouns are words that substitute for nouns or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context, 'PROPN': A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word) that is the name (or part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object, 'PUNCT': Punctuation marks are non-alphabetical characters and character groups used in many languages to delimit linguistic units in printed text, 'SCONJ': A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the status of a (subordinate) clause, 'SYM': A symbol is a word-like entity that differs from ordinary words by form, function or both, 'VERB': A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause, 'X': The tag X is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned a real part-of-speech category. Input: Sentence: Ok -- {{ fine }} .  Word: fine Output:","output":"In this task, you are asked to identify the part-of-speech tag of a specific word within a given sentence. The word is provided inside curly braces '{{ ... }}'. Here, you are given a list of part-of-speech tags to use when classifying words. Sentence: \\"Ok -- {{ fine }} .\\" Word: \\"fine\\" To solve this task, we need to: 1. Understand the sentence and the context of the word. 2. Determine the part-of-speech tag for the given word based on its grammatical role and meaning in the sentence. Solution: 1. In the sentence \\"Ok -- fine .\\", \\"fine\\" is used as an agreement or acceptance. It can be interpreted as the speaker responding to another person with affirmation or approval. 2. Based on the context and meaning, \\"fine\\" is functioning as an adverb, since its role is to modify verbs for categories such as time, place, direction, or manner. Therefore, we can use the tag 'ADV' to represent this word's part-of-speech. Output: ADV"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question. \\"Where was the cocktail \\"\\"daiquiri\\"\\" invented?\\"","output":"The daiquiri, a classic cocktail known for its simple yet balanced combination of rum, lime juice, and sugar, was invented in the late 19th century in the small mining town of Daiquirí, located near Santiago de Cuba, on the southeastern coast of Cuba. The invention of the daiquiri is attributed to an American mining engineer, Jennings Cox, who found himself in Cuba during the Spanish-American War. At the time, the Spanish-American War and other events had brought many Americans to Cuba. The cocktail's origins are grounded in the necessity for a refreshing, yet alcoholic beverage that would appeal to both the Americans and the locals alike in the tropical Cuban climate. Jennings Cox, as the story goes, had run out of gin while entertaining guests and decided to use the local liquor - rum. However, he did not want to use rum in its pure form, as it was considered lower-class, and opted to mix it with what was readily available, specifically, lime and sugar. The concoction was served over ice, and the initial mixed drink received a positive reception from guests at the gathering. Cox decided to name the drink after the mining town where it was created, and soon, the \\"daiquiri\\" gained immense popularity within the local Cuban community, among the American expats, and even among the military officers stationed in the area. One of these officers, Admiral Lucius W. Johnson, became particularly fond of the cocktail and, upon his return to the United States, brought the recipe back with him and introduced it to the Army and Navy Club in Washington, D.C. The cocktail’s popularity skyrocketed in the 1930s and 1940s, with the Prohibition era in the United States and the opening of Sloppy Joe's Bar in Havana, a famous bar frequented by American tourists who flocked to Cuba seeking a good time and alcohol. The Daiquiri then became a staple cocktail in American bars and a symbol of a tropical getaway. That being said, it is important to note that while Jennings Cox is often credited with inventing the Daiquiri, the basic concept of combining rum, lime, and sugar had already been known and consumed by both locals and sailors for many years in various Caribbean settings. The British Royal Navy was known to give its sailors rum rations mixed with lime juice (to prevent scurvy) and sometimes sugar. However, the fame and wide-spreading of the daiquiri, as we know it today, can be credited to Jennings Cox and those who further popularized it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After Alexander's conquests the region of Bithynia came under the rule of the native king Bas, who defeated Calas, a general of Alexander the Great, and maintained the independence of Bithynia. His son, Zipoetes I of Bithynia maintained this autonomy against Lysimachus and Seleucus I, and assumed the title of king (basileus) in 297 BCE. His son and successor, Nicomedes I, founded Nicomedia, which soon rose to great prosperity, and during his long reign (c. 278 – c. 255 BCE), as well as those of his successors, the kingdom of Bithynia held a considerable place among the minor monarchies of Anatolia. Nicomedes also invited the Celtic Galatians into Anatolia as mercenaries, and they later turned on his son Prusias I, who defeated them in battle. Their last king, Nicomedes IV, was unable to maintain himself against Mithridates VI of Pontus, and, after being restored to his throne by the Roman Senate, he bequeathed his kingdom by will to the Roman republic (74 BCE).\\",  answer the following question.

A young woman in labour makes her way to a parish workhouse and dies after giving birth to a boy, who is systematically named Oliver Twist by the workhouse authorities.

And in some hotels and restaurants men have to wear ties and women have to wear tidy dresses. In many ways, Americans are less formal than British people, but they are more careful with their clothes. At home, most Americans wear informal   or sports clothes. But when they go out in the evening, they like to look nice. In good hotels and restaurants, men have to wear jackets and ties, and women have to wear pretty clothes.

Step 4: Determine the most suitable option - Upon reflecting on these options, a gymnasium (E) is the most suitable choice as it is specifically designed for engaging in various exercises, including those that involve using a ball (e.g., medicine ball exercises, stability ball exercises, etc.).

An assistant police chief said he had an “awful feeling” that Sister Margaret Held and Sister Paula Merrill were murdered as part of a religious hate crime. The nuns, from Mississippi, USA, were found slain by a police officer on Thursday. Both women were nurses and worked with the Lexington Medical Clinic, one of the largest and oldest medical group in Central and Eastern Kentucky since 1920.

Given the question: Information:  - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.  - Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the 30th-most extensive and the 24th-most populous of the U.S. states. At nearly , Alabama has one of the nation's longest navigable inland waterways.  - The Straits of Florida, Florida Straits, or Florida Strait is a strait located south-southeast of the North American mainland, generally accepted to be between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, and between the Florida Keys (U.S.) and Cuba. It is 150 km (93 mi) wide at the narrowest point between Key West and the Cuban shore, and has been sounded to a depth of 6,000 feet. The strait carries the Florida Current, the beginning of the Gulf Stream, from the Gulf of Mexico.  - South Florida is a region of the U.S. state of Florida, comprising the southernmost part of the state. It is one of Florida's three most common \\"directional\\" regions, the others being Central Florida and North Florida.

South Florida is the only part of the continental United States with a tropical climate.  - Cuba, officially the Republic of Cuba, is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos. Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean meet. It is south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Haiti, and north of Jamaica. Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey.

It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River.  - A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs. Lagoons are commonly divided into coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons. They have also been identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines. There is an overlap between bodies of water classified as coastal lagoons and bodies of water classified as estuaries. Lagoons are common coastal features around many parts of the world.  - The Gulf of Mexico is an ocean basin largely surrounded by the North American continent. It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States, on the southwest and south by Mexico, and on the southeast by Cuba.

Review title: Pointless -- wasted my time! Product review: I'm not sure why I finished reading this book -- I guess I kept thinking it would improve! However, the main character Ella was just too dumb to believe. The plot never got off the ground, and then it was disintegrated with these little short stories about how people resolved their conflicts or fell in love, at meals in the restaurant -- nothing really seemed to fit together. The people weren't as real as in Scarlet Feather. I felt this book was a waste of my time, wish I'd spent the time reading a better book. A:","output":"The given review would significantly decrease the chances of buying the product. Here's why: The title of the review itself i.e. \\"Pointless -- wasted my time!\\" directly indicates the reviewer's strong negative sentiment towards the book. The use of the word \\"pointless\\" signals an absence of value, meaning, or purpose in the book according to the reviewer. Claiming that it \\"wasted my time\\" suggests the reader did not find the content engaging, enlightening, or entertaining, all of which are essential attributes for a book. The specific comments on various elements of the book (the character, the plot, and the writing style) further strengthen this negative outlook: 1. Character: The reviewer found the main character \\"too dumb to believe.\\" This criticism indicates that the character development in the book is unconvincing for the reviewer.  2. Plot: The reviewer stated that the \\"plot never got off the ground,\\" suggesting that they found the story directionless or lacking in substance. The reviewer also found that the interspersed short stories on how characters fall in love or resolve conflicts didn't fit together. This implies a lack of solidity and coherence in the book's narrative structure, which could be a crucial factor for a reader. 3. Authenticity: Comparing this book negatively with another (\\"The people weren't as real as in Scarlet Feather\\") indicates that the reviewer found the characters to be less relatable, believable, or realistic. Authenticity in characters is often crucial to reader engagement. Finally, the ending statement about regretting the time spent on this book amplifies all these negative points and would likely deter potential buyers. Therefore, in summary, the review significantly highlights various perceived shortcomings of the book, from character development and narrative structure to a general perceived lack of value, which would significantly decrease the chances of a potential buyer purchasing the product."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have a math problem to solve for \\"n\\". It looks like this: 5*n + 39 = -11 - 15 First, let's see what -11 - 15 equals. If you have -11 and take away 15 more, you get -26.

To do that, we'll divide both sides of the equal sign by 5: 5*n / 5 = -65 / 5 This simplifies to: n = -13 So, the solution to the math problem is n = -13.

The earthquake could cause the movement of the Earth's plates to slightly shift or change direction, impacting pressure build-up and release in surrounding areas. Indirect effects: 1. Earthquakes can cause a chain reaction in the crust, leading to additional stress and pressure build-up in neighboring regions. This is referred to as an \\"earthquake cascade\\" or a \\"domino effect.\\" Earthquakes can transfer stress to nearby faults, leading to an increased likelihood of future earthquakes in other areas. 2. The occurrence of an earthquake may create new fractures or faults in the crust, altering the way pressure builds up and is released in the future. Overall, the occurrence of an earthquake will have both direct and indirect effects on the pressure build-up and release process within the Earth's crust. This can lead to changes in the distribution of stress within the crust and, potentially, the likelihood of future earthquakes in the region."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: Kim Kardashian in trouble with FDA over drug post My reading habits consist of law and tech, so normally it’s easy to steer clear of Kim Kardashian. But the celebrity popped up in my news feeds all the same this week after the Food and Drug Administration scolded her for flogging an anti-morning sickness drug on Instagram FB . Kardashian is apparently pregnant, and wants to make a buck off the fact by talking about a drug called Diclegis. She posted an image of herself wielding a pill bottle, alongside a rambling caption that began: “OMG. Have you heard about this? As you guys know my #morningsickness has been pretty bad. I tried changing things about my lifestyle, including my diet, but nothing helped, so I talked to my doctor. He prescribed me #Diclegis, I felt a lot better and most importantly, it’s been studied and there was no increased risk to the baby.” The FDA was not amused. It issued a letter to the drug maker, complaining that Kardashian’s social media posts failed to mention any risks associated with the medicine (apparently, Diclegis is unsuitable or hasn’t been tested on women with certain conditions). The FDA asked the drug maker to take the posts down and respond to the letter. As of Friday, Kardashian appears to have removed the Instagram post; however, a related one on Twitter TWTR , also cited in the FDA letter, is still up: The tweet is interesting, and not only because it might violate the FDA’s instructions, which says Diclegis must “immediately cease misbranding DICLEGIS and/or cease introducing the misbranded drug into interstate commerce.” The other interesting aspect is that the tweet doesn’t appear to bear any mark, from Twitter or Kardashian herself, to show she is paid to endorse the product. This could violate the rules of a different agency: in 2013, the FTC made clear that celebrities must disclose paid endorsements on social media, just as they have long been required to do on TV or other forms of media. Undisclosed marketing arrangements can lead to trouble, as Sony and an ad agency discovered last year when the FTC brought a legal action last year for deceptive marketing on Twitter. The action stemmed from Sony and the agency’s failure to reveal their role behind a Twitter campaign that boosted the PlayStation with the hashtag #gamechanger. While Kardashian and Sony are hardly the first to trip over regulatory rules related to advertising, part of the problem may stem from the fact that platforms like Twitter and Instagram text are so small – there is little room for warnings or disclosures. But so far, the regulators appear to have little sympathy. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article can be summarized as follows: 1. Kim Kardashian, a popular celebrity, faced trouble with the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for promoting an anti-morning sickness drug called Diclegis on her Instagram and Twitter accounts. 2. Kardashian's social media posts failed to mention any risks associated with the drug, which the FDA claims constituted misbranding. Diclegis is said to be unsuitable or not tested on women with certain conditions. 3. The FDA issued a letter to the drug maker asking them to take down Kardashian's social media posts and respond to the letter. As of the time of the article, the Instagram post was removed, but a related tweet remained online. 4. The tweet did not appear to bear any mark or disclosure indicating that Kardashian was paid to endorse the product, which could violate Federal Trade Commission (FTC) rules. These rules require celebrities to disclose paid endorsements on social media, just like in traditional media. 5. The issue of regulatory rules related to advertising on platforms such as Twitter and Instagram might be due partially to the limited space for text, but regulators have shown little sympathy for this. In conclusion, the news article highlights Kim Kardashian's promotion of an anti-morning sickness drug on social media, her failure to disclose necessary risks, and the resulting run-in with regulatory bodies like the FDA and potentially the FTC."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The College paid £200,000 and contributed 4.5 hectares of land in return for exclusive use of the facilities during the daytime only. The UK Sports Council defended the deal on the grounds that the whole community would benefit, while the bursar claimed that Windsor, Slough and Eton Athletic Club was \\"deprived\\" because local people (who were not pupils at the College) did not have a world-class running track and facilities to train with. Steve Osborn, director of the Safe Neighbourhoods Unit, described the decision as \\"staggering\\" given the background of a substantial reduction in youth services by councils across the country, a matter over which, however, neither the College nor the UK Sports Council, had any control.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"A young man walking down the street.\\" if \\"A man is walking to work.\\"?","output":"No, it is not possible to conclude that \\"A young man walking down the street\\" if \\"A man is walking to work.\\" There are several reasons why this conclusion cannot be drawn based solely on the initial statement. First of all, the age of the man is not specified in the statement \\"A man is walking to work.\\" The term \\"man\\" could refer to a broad age range, from someone in their late-teens to someone in their 60s or older. Therefore, one cannot assume that the man in question is a young man. Secondly, the initial statement does not provide any information about the location where the man is walking. He could be walking on a sidewalk, through a park, in a shopping mall, or on a rural road. The phrase \\"walking down the street\\" could imply an urban or suburban setting, but the original statement does not provide evidence to support this assumption. Additionally, the destination of the man's walk is stated to be his place of work. This detail does not necessarily imply that the individual is \\"walking down the street.\\" As mentioned before, the man could be walking through various environments to reach his place of work, like on a beach, through a field, or in a hallway within a large building. The man's walk to work could also involve a combination of walking down the street and other forms of transportation (such as taking a bus, train, or driving a car). Furthermore, it is important to consider that the phrase \\"walking down the street\\" is open to interpretation. It could refer to walking on the actual road, where cars drive, which may not be the case if the man is walking on a sidewalk. For some, \\"walking down the street\\" may imply a leisurely stroll, which is not necessarily the same as walking to work if the man is in a rush or walking with a particular pace or sense of purpose. Lastly, the initial statement does not provide any information about the man's appearance, attire, or demeanor. These factors could potentially provide insight into whether or not the man is young or old, as well as his mode of walking (strolling, brisk walking, or power walking). However, the original statement does not provide any additional context that might help in drawing a more accurate conclusion about the age or specific walking style of the man. In conclusion, based on the given statement \\"a man is walking to work,\\" one cannot confidently deduce that a \\"young man is walking down the street.\\" Further information regarding the man's age, location, the route he is taking, and any additional details of his walking process would be essential to make a more accurate and reliable conclusion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In a new anti-Israel, anti-U.S. video, an American al Qaeda member makes reference to his Jewish ancestry for the first time in an official al Qaeda message. Adam Yahiye Gadahn, also known as Azzam the American, is seen in an earlier al Qaeda video. In the video, Adam Yahiye Gadahn, also known as Azzam the American, discusses his roots as he castigates U.S. policies and deplores Israel's offensive in Gaza that started in late December 2008 and continued into January. \\"Let me here tell you something about myself and my biography, in which there is a benefit and a lesson,\\" Gadahn says, as he elicits support from his fellow Muslims for \\"our weapons, funds and Jihad against the Jews and their allies everywhere.\\" \\"Your speaker has Jews in his ancestry, the last of whom was his grandfather,\\" he says. Growing up in rural California, Gadahn embraced Islam in the mid-1990s, moved to Pakistan and has appeared in al Qaeda videos before. He was indicted in the United States in 2006 on charges of treason and material support to al Qaeda, according to the FBI. Gadahn is on the FBI's Most Wanted List, with a reward of up to 1 million leading to his capture. FBI records show Gadahn's date of birth as September 1, 1978. The video -- in which Gadahn speaks Arabic, with English subtitles -- surfaced on Saturday. This account is based on an English transcript provided by As-Sahab Media, the media production company used by al Qaeda. Gadahn's Jewish ancestry has been reported in the news media. But terrorism analyst Laura Mansfield says it is the first time Gadahn acknowledged his Jewish ancestry in an official al Qaeda message. Gadahn says his grandfather was a \\"Zionist\\" and \\"a zealous supporter of the usurper entity, and a prominent member of a number of Zionist hate organizations.\\" \\"He used to repeat to me what he claimed are the virtues of this entity and encouraged me to visit it, specifically the city of Tel Aviv, where relatives of ours live,\\" says Gadahn, referring to Israel. He says his grandfather gave him a book by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called \\"A Place Among the Nations\\" -- in which the \\"rabid Zionist\\" sets out \\"feeble arguments and unmasked lies to justify the Jews' rape of Muslim Palestine.\\" But Gadahn says that despite his youth at the time, he didn't heed his grandfather's words. \\"How can a person with an ounce of self-respect possibly stand in the ranks of criminals and killers who have no morals, no mercy, no humanity and indeed, no honor?\\" he says in reference to Zionists and Israel. \\"Isn't it shameful enough for a person to carry the citizenship of America, the symbol of oppression and tyranny and advocate of terror in the world?\\" Mansfield thinks the video may have been made between late April and mid-May, before President Obama's speech in Cairo, Egypt, addressing U.S. relations with Muslims. Gadahn notes Obama's inauguration, Netanyahu's election in February, and Obama's speech in Turkey in April. Specifically mentioning the Gaza offensive and citing other hot spots such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Chechnya and Somalia, where the \\"Zio-Crusader alliance\\" is fighting his \\"brothers,\\" he says \\"this open-faced aggression\\" comes as Obama has risen to power. He scorns Obama's statements in his inaugural address and in Turkey that America isn't and won't be at war with Islam, and \\"other deceptive, false and sugarcoated words of endearment and respect.\\" He says Obama's language is similar to words Netanyahu uttered in the Knesset in 1996. Gadahn also backs the idea of targeting \\"Zio-Crusader\\" interests anywhere in the world, not just \\"within Palestine.\\" Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"An American al Qaeda member, Adam Yahiye Gadahn (also known as Azzam the American), has made reference to his Jewish ancestry for the first time in an official al Qaeda message.

However, some customers are furious that the petition even exists.      The Change.org petition, started earlier in September, says that the chain is letting its fans down by failing to serve a hearty and healthy meat-free option.      \\"Burger chains nationwide have been getting huge returns from meat alternatives, and In-N-Out could do the same.

As of Wednesday at 8:45 am, the petition was about 2,500 signatures away from its goal of 25,000 supporters.      However, the creators are also facing some backlash, in the comment section and on social media.

If you do not want a burger, do not go to a burger stand.\\"      In-N-Out's Facebook page has been flooded with anti-veggie burger commenters, far outnumbering positive discussion of a new vegetarian option.      Currently, the best vegetarians can hope for at In-N-Out is fries or a bunch of cheese and veggies between two burger buns.      While only about 3% of Americans identify as vegetarian or vegan, an increasing number of people are cutting meat from their diets — something the petition highlights. According to a 2015 study, 26% to 41% of Americans report that they cut down on the amount of meat they ate in the past year. ||||| \\"Southern California is a mecca for plant-based eating and food consciousness,\\" Friedrich said. \\"In-N-Out should be leading the charge on making it easier to eat food that is sustainably produced, healthy and humane. It will send a powerful message that their company cares about their consumer and recognizes the harms of factory farming, both of which it makes tremendous sense for a Southern California-based company to be leading on.\\" ||||| If you want a meat-free meal at In-N-Out, you’re going to be stuck eating multiple orders of French fries or a cheese-slathered bun. In-N-Out has been letting its fans down by failing to serve anything that would satisfy a burger-loving customer who wants a healthy, humane, and sustainable option.      Burger chains nationwide have been getting huge returns from meat alternatives, and In-N-Out could do the same. Chipotle has vegan sofritas, Whitecastle has veggie sliders--even fast-food kingpin Burger King has the BK Veggie!      The push for plant-based meats is growing, with Millennials leading the charge and backing up their desire to support ethical companies with a whopping 200 billion in annual buying power. Before customers can let their money do the talking, there has to be a meat-free option to spend it on. So please use your voice to tell the execs at In-N-Out that a veggie burger deserves a place on the menu!      As a company that prides itself on both customer satisfaction and ethical business practices, adding a meat-free option is a no-brainer. And by making this single addition, In-N-Out would be making a huge statement that it truly cares about its customers health and the health of the planet.

The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.” The version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway. The Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge. Beginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge. Andrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte’s.

Organisers said a mechanical fault was probably to blame but were awaiting the results of an official investigation. The National Transportation Safety Board is carrying out the inquiry. Fifty-four people were taken to hospital, some in critical condition, said Mike Houghton, head of the Reno Air Racing Association and CEO of the event. In pictures: Reno air crash Mr Houghton said the Mustang had not been flying too close to the ground prior to the crash. He said that there appeared to be a \\"problem with the aircraft that caused it to go out of control\\". \\"This is a very large incident, probably one of the largest this community has seen in decades,\\" Stephanie Kruse, a spokeswoman for the Regional Emergency Medical Service Authority, told the Associated Press. \\"The community is pulling together to try to deal with the scope of it. The hospitals have certainly geared up and staffed up to deal with it.\\" She said 15 of the injured were in a critical condition. Kathy Carter, a spokeswoman for Renown Medical Center in Reno, said that two people had died, not including the pilot. Earlier unconfirmed reports said up to 12 people might have been killed. The Mustang, named The Galloping Ghost, was flown by well-known racing pilot Jimmy Leeward, 74. Mr Houghton said that Mr Leeward, from Ocala, Florida, was a property developer who had been racing planes since the mid-1970s. He said that Mr Leeward's medical records had been \\"in tip-top condition\\". He added that most of Mr Leeward's family had been at Friday's event. Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval arrived at the scene and praised the emergency services for their \\"flawless reaction to what happened\\". Mr Leeward's website says he had flown in more than 120 races and had been a movie stunt pilot. Ronald Sargis, who was sitting in the box-seat area, said spectators could tell the plane was in trouble before it crashed. \\"About six or seven boxes down from us, it impacted into the front row,\\" Mr Sargis told KCRA-TV in Sacramento. He added: \\"It appeared to be just pulverized.\\" Jeff Martinez, a local weatherman who was just outside the air race grounds, said he saw the plane veer to the right and then crash into the ground. The Reno Gazette-Journal website had posted a witness video of the crash from YouTube, but YouTube has now withdrawn it, saying it breached its terms. Eyewitness Dr Gerald Lent, of Reno, told the newspaper: \\"It's just like a massacre. It's like a bomb went off. There are people lying all over the runway.\\" Maureen Higgins of Alabama, who has been coming to the show for 16 years, told the Associated Press that the pilot was on his third lap when he lost control. National Guard members who were already on site helped with the response, air show spokesman Mike Draper told CNN. Democratic Nevada Senator Harry Reid issued a statement saying he was \\"deeply saddened\\" about the tragedy. \\"My thoughts are with the families of those who have lost their lives and with those who were wounded in this horrific tragedy,\\" he said. The National Championship Air Races are held every year in September in Reno. There have been safety concerns in the past, with four pilots killed in 2007 and 2008.

Does \\"Solar power is the conversion of sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), or indirectly using concentrated solar power (CSP).\\" correctly answer the question of How is sunlight converted into electricity?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"Solar power is the conversion of sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), or indirectly using concentrated solar power (CSP)\\" provides a brief and accurate answer to the question of how sunlight is converted into electricity. However, to provide a more detailed and comprehensive explanation, let's delve deeper into these two prominent solar technologies, photovoltaics (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP). 1. Photovoltaics (PV): Photovoltaics, commonly known as PV, is the most prevalent method of converting sunlight into electricity. This technology primarily relies on solar cells, which are made of semiconductor materials such as silicon or other emerging options like perovskite and thin-film technologies. Solar cells work on the principle of the photovoltaic effect, which, in layman's terms, involves the generation of voltage or electric current upon exposure to sunlight. When photons of sunlight hit the solar cell's surface, they displace electrons from the atoms present in the semiconductor material. This process results in the creation of electron-hole pairs. These freed electrons then move towards a junction, which is formed through the incorporation of impurities into the semiconductor material. The junction creates an electric field that compels the electrons to flow in a specific direction, thus generating an electric current. Solar panels, which are the systems that we usually see on rooftops or large solar installations, consist of multiple solar cells connected in series or parallel configurations to produce usable electricity. This electricity is usually in the form of direct current (DC), which is then converted to alternating current (AC) using inverters for compatibility with the electrical grid or various devices and appliances. 2. Concentrated Solar Power (CSP): Concentrated solar power technology (CSP), on the other hand, involves converting sunlight into electricity indirectly by first using mirrors or lenses to focus sunlight onto a small area, which then produces heat. This produced heat is used to create steam, which turns turbines connected to generators, ultimately generating electricity. There are various types of CSP systems, including: a. Parabolic troughs: These systems use long, curved mirrors that focus sunlight onto a tube containing a heat transfer fluid that runs along the focal line of the parabolic mirrors. The heated fluid then goes to a heat exchanger to produce steam, which drives a turbine and generates electricity. b. Linear Fresnel reflectors: Linear Fresnel reflector systems use flat mirrors to focus sunlight onto elevated tubes containing a heat transfer fluid – in many ways, similar to parabolic troughs. The key difference lies in using flat mirrors, which can be easier and more inexpensive to produce and maintain. c. Solar power towers: These CSP systems use a field of heliostat mirrors that concentrate sunlight on a central receiver located at the top of a tall tower. The receiver, which usually contains molten salts, absorbs the concentrated sunlight, heating up the molten salts. The heated fluid is then used to generate steam and produce electricity. d. Parabolic dish systems: These systems use parabolic dish-shaped mirrors to focus sunlight onto a receiver located at the focal point of the dish. This concentrated sunlight heats up a gas or fluid within the receiver, which is then used to generate electricity using either a Stirling engine or microturbine. While PV tends to dominate the solar power market due to its ease of installation, scalability, and dropping costs, CSP offers advantages such as energy storage capabilities for dispatchable power production and higher efficiency when used in combination with traditional fossil fuel or nuclear power plants. In conclusion, sunlight is converted into electricity through two primary solar technologies: photovoltaics (PV), which directly converts sunlight through solar cells and the photovoltaic effect, and concentrated solar power (CSP), which indirectly produces electricity by harnessing concentrated sunlight to create steam that drives turbines and generators. Both technologies have their unique advantages and applications, and their adoption is essential for expanding renewable, clean energy generation worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The structure of this segment has to be slightly changed in Romanian to make sense, hence the introduction of \\"și-a\\" before \\"deschis\\"; this is also needed for grammatical agreement. 3. \\"Greece's Ministry of Tourism announced on Thursday (July 17th)\\" was translated to \\"a anunțat Ministerul Turismului din Grecia joi (17 iulie)\\". The word \\"on\\" is unnecessary in Romanian, so it was left out. The structuring of the date also changes; in Romanian, \\"July 17th\\" is simply \\"17 iulie\\". Therefore, the whole sentence in Romanian would be: \\"Organizația Națională de Turism a Greciei (ONTG) și-a deschis primul birou în București, a anunțat Ministerul Turismului din Grecia joi (17 iulie).\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Article: As the capital of China's Shaanxi Province, Xi'an's long history was properly summed up by our English-speaking guide: \\"If Xi'an is the grandmother of cities, Beijing is a youth and Shanghai is just a baby in the womb. \\" However, it was not until 1974, following the chance discovery of the Army of Terracotta Warriors by well-digging farmers, that Xi'an was once again pushed onto the international map. Three decades later, the local government is pouring funds into the tourism sector. Ancient monuments and museums are being restored, and various copies of Buddhist and Tang heritage are being constructed to help Chinese tourists rediscover their national heritage. One of those ancient monuments is the Big Wild Goose Pagoda-Xi'an's most sacred   monument-which was built in 652 by the monk Xuanzang ,who travelled across India for 18 years and returned with a precious collection of Buddhist sacred texts. In 1966,the Red Guards burnt the pagoda's scriptures, silk wall hangings and other relics in a bonfire that raged all night. But that destruction has largely been forgotten as tourists flock to the newly restored pagoda. The only original remainders-the empty shell of the seven-storey pagoda-light up at night, standing out in the city's skyline. Xi'an is also displaying the glories of the ancient Tang Dynasty, with a 165-acre Tang Paradise Theme Park that is visited by flocks of tourist groups. Although every bit of this Tang heritage is recreated, it is artistically pleasing, landscaped with ponds and lakes, classical gardens, bridges, palaces and pavilions. Explore the vast area on a golf cart, hopping on and off to see shortened operas from the Tang Dynasty days, laser shows on the lake, highly structured man-made waterfalls, as well as murals and statues of historical figures ,philosophers and poets. A 36km drive northeast takes you to Xi'an's most famous attraction, the Army of Terracotta Warriors.

It was not until the early 1990s that the islands joined the UK's postcode system, Jersey postcodes using the initials JE and Guernsey GY. Can we conclude that is jersey part of the uk royal mail?","output":"Here's the step-by-step analysis and justification of the information provided: 1. Since 1969, Jersey and Guernsey have operated postal administrations independently of the UK's Royal Mail. This suggests that these islands have their own separate postal systems, and they don't fall under the jurisdiction of the UK Royal Mail. 2. Both Jersey and Guernsey have their own postage stamps, which can be used for postage only in their respective Bailiwicks. This further confirms their independent postal systems. 3. UK stamps are no longer valid in these islands, but mail sent to them is charged at UK inland rates. This shows that while the islands have some connection with the UK, they are not part of the UK Royal Mail. 4. In the early 1990s, the islands joined the UK's postcode system, with Jersey postcodes using the initials JE and Guernsey GY. This signifies that they have integrated with a key UK system, but joining a postcode system doesn't necessarily make them part of the UK Royal Mail. Based on the analysis of these points, we can conclude that Jersey is not part of the UK Royal Mail, as it operates its own independent postal administration. However, the island maintains some connections with the UK, such as adopting the UK's postcode system and charging mail at UK inland rates."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hooper (Scotty Beckett) are fresh replacements assigned to separate companies in the 327th Glider Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. As a newcomer Layton receives a chilly welcome from his squad. PFC Holley (Van Johnson) returns to the company after recuperating from a wound sustained from fighting in the Netherlands. Instead of going on leave in Paris, the squad is trucked back to the front to help stop a surprise German breakthrough in the Ardennes. They stop that night in the town of Bastogne. The platoon is put up for the night in the apartment of a local young woman, Denise (Denise Darcel), with whom Holley hopes to fraternize. Jarvess (John Hodiak) is informed by Denise that she is taking care of two orphaned French girls. Jarvess later goes on guard in the village, where he runs into a group of battle weary soldiers. The soldiers inform Jarvess that they are making a \\"strategic withdrawal\\". The next morning, led by Platoon Sgt. Kinnie (James Whitmore), the men are ordered to dig in on the outskirts of town. Just as they are nearly done, they are ordered to a new location and have to dig in again. Holley, Layton and Kippton (Douglas Fowley) stand guard that night at a roadblock. A patrol of German soldiers, disguised as American soldiers, infiltrates their position and later blows up a nearby bridge. In the morning the squad awakes to a heavy winter storm. Roderigues (Ricardo MontalbÃ¡n), a Latino from Los Angeles, is delighted by the novelty of snow, but his foxhole mate Pop Stazak (George Murphy), awaiting a \\"dependency discharge\\" that will send him home, is unimpressed. Layton goes over to see his friend Hooper, only to find that he had been killed hours before, and that no one in his company knew his name.

Please briefly summarize this news article: 3 Ways to Get Online When Your Internet Is Down Early Wednesday morning, a massive Time Warner Cable outage left customers across the country without internet access. While the cable company reports most service was restored by 6 a.m., data from downdetector.com, a website that tracks internet outages, showed nearly 10,000 complaints at the height of the blackout. Time Warner services about 11.4 million high-speed internet customers nationwide. So what do you do if your internet goes down and you absolutely, positively need to get online? You can’t just run to Starbucks in your pajamas if the outage hits in the middle of the night, as this one did, so the best strategy is to plan ahead. Putting one of these backup methods in place ahead of time will keep you connected the next time your ISP decides to cut out. 1. Tethering. As any smartphone user knows, wired internet isn’t the only internet available. As long as you have a working cellular data connection, you can transfer your phone’s internet access to your laptop or desktop computer via a method called tethering. Both Android and iOS phones can tether, although the costs may differ. The only option for iPhone users is to purchase a tethering plan from your carrier, which can add around 20 a month to your bill. On Android, it’s possible to tether for free by installing third party apps, but carriers may add a charge if they notice increased data usage. For more, check out these iOS and Android tethering guides. 2. Mobile Broadband. Mobile broadband is similar to tethering in that you’re using cellular data to get your computer online. But instead of through your phone, it works via a separate device that provides a mobile internet connection, generally by generating a wifi hotspot. One advantage to mobile hotspots is that many offer prepaid plans. For example, Verizon offers plans for its 4G LTE Jetpack that allow users to buy as little as a week of service at a time. Another service called Karma provides pay-as-you-go internet for 14 per gigabyte. That means if your internet cuts out unexpectedly, you can jump on your hotspot’s wifi for a relatively small fee. However, the devices themselves can cost around 100 for the initial purchase. 3. Public Wifi. If all else fails, there’s always mooching off Starbucks or other free wifi locations. Apps for Android and iOS provide maps of publicly available wifi hotspots that can work in a pinch. But most people don’t know their internet or cell provider might also provide a network of wireless hotspots. Optimum, AT&T, and other ISPs provide maps of their wifi locations. In some cases, access is included in your pre-existing internet or cell service contracts. In other cases, wifi access might require an additional subscription. Services like Boingo also offer a mixture of free and paid-wifi hotspots, and map apps to help locate them.","output":"This news article is about three ways to get online when your internet is not working.

(i) negative; (ii) positive; The answer is:","output":"(ii) positive; The mentioned movie review sentence appears to evoke a positive sentiment. Being described as \\"wholesome\\" means that the film could be morally uplifting, enjoyable, and satisfying in a way that appeals to the audience's demure or good-natured sensibilities.

This combination suggests that the movie offers a refined balance of heartfelt, positive content while pushing boundaries or redefining standards.

However, context does matter, and while the given sentence primarily conveys a positive sentiment, individual interpretation may vary based on personal tastes and perspectives.

When I was writing the manuscript for Florentine, I enlisted the help of an army of recipe testers — about 80 people from all over the world — to test every recipe thoroughly. Only one came back to me consistently with problems. From Minnesota to Melbourne, three testers wrote to me that their very first attempt at making Tuscan gnudi (ricotta and spinach balls that, rather than be encased in pasta like for ravioli, are simply dusted in flour) resulted in a pot of simmering water with “dissolved” gnudi. It reminded me of Pellegrino Artusi’s potato gnocchi recipe in his famous cookbook from 1891, where he interrupts the recipe instructions to mention a signora who, upon attempting to stir the gnocchi cooking in the pot, finds they have disappeared – O dove’erano andati? “Where did they go?” In the case of the gnocchi, there was too little flour used, according to Artusi. But in the case of the gnudi, I already had a hunch. I grilled all three testers on a number of various factors — was the water just simmering, not on a rolling boil (which can destroy delicate gnudi), did they drain the spinach very well, and equally the ricotta (one said she even drained it overnight)? Did they use “proper” ricotta? Aha. “Proper” ricotta. The kind that was only made a day or so earlier, the leftovers of the cheese-making process, the real deal. The kind that you can see in a deli counter, standing on its own, that gets cut into a big wedge and weighed when you order it. Not the kind you buy at the supermarket, in a tub, that so often is grainy, more like the consistency of yogurt, has no structure, and is full of unnecessary gums or additives. All my recipe testers had used the second kind — to be fair, some were new to the idea of buying ricotta and in their neighbourhood only had access to this. In that case, it would have probably been better to make your own, or choose another recipe. According to the above context, answer the following question. When does the author suggest to used the right type of ricotta? OPTIONS: A). Any time - it'll have better structure B). not enough information C). Only when needed - the ricotta in the tub is just as good D). There is no right type of ricotta Answer:","output":"A).

Virginia George might go to Virginia to hunt foxes, as it is a suitable place among the given options with a natural habitat for them. Virginia, located in the United States, has a good population of foxes, which makes it a favorable destination for hunting enthusiasts like George. Answer A, the hen house, is incorrect because hen houses serve as a shelter for domesticated birds and not foxes. Although foxes may prey on the birds in a hen house, it is unlikely to be a suitable hunting ground for George. Answer B, a painting, refers to a visual artwork and is not an actual location where someone can hunt foxes. Answer D, California, is another potential option; however, Virginia is considered a more fitting location in terms of fox hunting traditions, culture, and available population. Even though foxes can be found in California, Virginia has a more established fox hunting community and history. Answer E, a lion's den, is a place where lions reside and is not a suitable location for hunting foxes. Foxes and lions have different habitats, and it would be highly unlikely for George to find and hunt foxes in a lion's den. Though this question provides various options, Virginia (C) is the best option as it offers the most appropriate environment for George to hunt foxes.

Can I change my eye colour using hypnosis? Pick from: (i). no. (ii). yes.","output":"Yes, both questions essentially have the same meaning, but with some slight differences in the techniques mentioned. Subliminal methods and hypnosis are psychological techniques that have been claimed to affect an individual's perception, thoughts, and behaviors. However, they differ in their approach and specific applications. Subliminal methods involve presenting messages, images, or stimuli that are not consciously perceived. These messages are believed to influence a person's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. This technique is typically employed in advertising, though claims about its effectiveness have been highly debated. Hypnosis, on the other hand, is a state of focused attention and heightened suggestibility. During hypnosis, a person is more receptive to suggestions made by the hypnotist. Hypnotherapy is sometimes used as a therapeutic technique to address issues like smoking cessation, weight loss, or phobias. In the context of the questions, both are asking about the possibility of changing eye color using psychological techniques. However, the specific method differs - one asks about subliminal messaging, while the other asks about hypnosis. While they have the same general intent, they refer to different psychological techniques. It is important to note that there is no scientific evidence supporting the idea that eye color can be changed using subliminal methods or hypnosis. Eye color is determined by genetics, and changes in eye color are typically due to natural processes like aging or disease, rather than psychological influences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Buy Photo Chase Dellwo, 26, survived an attack by a grizzly bear Saturday morning. He was attacked after surprising a 350-400 pound male grizzly he encountered while bow hunting for elk. (Photo: Tribune photo/Jo Dee Black)Buy Photo      The ability to suppress panic and an article clipped from a magazine and passed along by his grandmother helped Chase Dellwo, 26, survive a grizzly bear mauling Saturday morning northwest of Choteau.      He has a couple hundred stitches and staples in his head, some stitches on his face, a bruised and swollen left eye and deep puncture wounds on his right leg. He also has an incredible story to tell of a tangle with a 350-400 pound male grizzly. It is a story that has a good ending and no villains.      \\"I want everyone to know that it wasn't the bear's fault, he was as scared as I was,\\" Dellwo said from his hospital bed at Benefis Health System Sunday afternoon.      12 bears caught on video outside Yellowstone      Chase Dellwo and his brother Shane, 30, headed out Saturday morning to bow hunt for elk. The wind was blowing 30 to 40 miles per hour with snow and rain.      The brothers spotted an elk herd and decided to have Chase walk up a narrow creek bed, hoping he would drive the animals up to a ridge where Shane would wait.      \\"About 8 to 10 minutes in I heard a bull bugle, so I quickened my pace,\\" Chase said.      It wasn't until he was just three feet away that he realized he was approaching a bear that had been sleeping. The windy conditions meant the bear was as surprised as Dellwo.      \\"I had an arrow nocked, and I put my bow up in front of me and took two or three steps back,\\" he said. \\"There wasn't any time to draw my bow back.\\"      The bear knocked Dellwo off his feet and bit down on the top and back of his head.      \\"He let go, but he was still on top of me roaring the loudest roar I have ever heard,\\" Dellwo said.      The bear left and Dellwo managed to sit up.      \\"He came back and bit my lower right leg and gave it a pretty good shake and threw me a ways,\\" he said.      The bear came after him again.      \\"I remembered an article that my grandmother gave me a long time ago that said large animals have bad gag reflexes,\\" Dellwo said. \\"So I shoved my right arm down his throat.\\"      It worked. The bear left.      Dellwo started to walk out, bloodied and disoriented.      \\"I saw a six point elk on the way out, that was disappointing,\\" he said with a laugh.      He wasn't laughing at the time however.      \\"I forced myself to calm down and not to panic,\\" he said. \\"I was lost. I cleared the blood out of my eyes. If I had allowed myself to panic I would still be in there.\\"      He made it out of the drainage and found Shane.      \\"He was lifting his bow above his head and kind of waving it and I thought he had shot an elk,\\" Shane said. \\"He had to tell me he had been bitten by a bear.\\"      Shane was worried that Chase had sustained injuries to his abdomen or back that could be life threatening. Once they determined that was not the case, they high-tailed it to the Benefis Teton Medical Center.      \\"It took about 20 minutes, 20 minutes of driving too fast,\\" Chase said.      Shane called ahead and the hospital staff was waiting.      \\"Thank goodness we have that facility available,\\" he said.      Chase's wife Becca was at home in Belgrade when she got the call from her brother-in-law.      \\"Normally, I would be hunting with him,\\" she said. \\"I was just relieved when I saw him.\\"      She said the family is grateful for the excellent care Chase received at both Benefis Teton Medical Center and Benefis in Great Falls.      Chase expects to be released from the hospital in the next day or two and will probably sit out the rest of this archery season.      \\"I shoot with my left hand and my left eye is pretty beat up and swollen,\\" he said      But he plans to chase elk when rifle season opens.      Growing up in Teton County, Saturday's bear encounter was not his first.      \\"We had a bear in our house when we were kids and last fall there was one in the back of my dad's pickup,\\" Chase said. \\"I've had bears charge me before, but until Saturday, the closest was about 20 yards.\\"      Chase was not carrying bear spray and the windy conditions probably wouldn't have allowed it to be effective. The speed of the encounter wouldn't have allowed time to discharge any spray.      But when asked if he had advice for others after being mauled by a bear Saturday Chase and Becca answered in unison.      \\"Carry bear spray.\\"      Read or Share this story: http://gftrib.com/1LdQUbu ||||| GREAT FALLS, Mont.

Dellwo was walking up a creek bed, hoping to drive a herd of elk to a ridge where his brother was waiting.      He was only 3 feet from the bear when he noticed it. He said the grizzly had been sleeping and didn't see him coming, possibly because of the snow, rain and 30 to 40 mph winds.      Dellwo said he only had time to take a few steps back before the bear knocked him off his feet and bit his head.      \\"He let go, but he was still on top of me roaring the loudest roar I have ever heard,\\" Dellwo said.      The bear then bit Dellwo's leg and shook him, tossing him in the air.

Sardines are rising in popularity as people discover more about their health benefits... and that they aren't so stinky after all (especially less so after cooking!).  I've used numerous varieties of the Roland sardines: olive oil, s&b in olive oil, tomato sauce, etc.  The S&B version with low sodium and packed in water is my best recommendation/preference: a great value for the money, and practically a steal when you compare -per ounce- the price with other brands.

Westminster Abbey is an architectural marvel, having largely been built in the Gothic architectural style during the middle ages, but its roots can be traced back much earlier, to the time of a Benedictine monastery being established there in the 7th or 8th century. It's situated just to the west of the Palace of Westminster, or the House of Parliament, and is a stone's throw away from important locations such as St. James' Park to the north and the Victoria Tower Gardens to the south, with the River Thames flowing just a little to the south of the Abbey. It's highly accessible and well-connected due to London's extensive public transportation system. The closest tube station is Westminster, which is served by the Circle, District and Jubilee lines. It's also a short walk away from St James's Park tube station, which serves the Circle and District lines, and from Victoria tube station, which serves the Victoria, Circle, and District lines.\\" This response gives an apt answer regarding the location of Westminster Abbey, both in a geographical and infrastructural perspective.

CHAPTER IV  THE LITTLE MODEL  When in the preceding autumn Bianca began her picture called \\"The Shadow,\\" nobody was more surprised than Hilary that she asked him to find her a model for the figure. Not knowing the nature of the picture, nor having been for many years--perhaps never--admitted into the workings of his wife's spirit, he said:  \\"Why don't you ask Thyme to sit for you?\\"  Blanca answered: \\"She's not the type at all--too matter-of-fact. Besides, I don't want a lady; the figure's to be half draped.\\"  Hilary smiled.  Blanca knew quite well that he was smiling at this distinction between ladies and other women, and understood that he was smiling, not so much at her, but at himself, for secretly agreeing with the distinction she had made.  And suddenly she smiled too.  There was the whole history of their married life in those two smiles. They meant so much: so many thousand hours of suppressed irritation, so many baffled longings and earnest efforts to bring their natures together. They were the supreme, quiet evidence of the divergence of two lives--that slow divergence which had been far from being wilful, and was the more hopeless in that it had been so gradual and so gentle. They had never really had a quarrel, having enlightened views of marriage; but they had smiled. They had smiled so often through so many years that no two people in the world could very well be further from each other. Their smiles had banned the revelation even to themselves of the tragedy of their wedded state.

Article:The evacuation of the town, near the capital Damascus, is expected to begin on Friday. Syrian Red Crescent vehicles are poised to enter the town. Residents have faced near-constant bombardment and shortages of food, water and power. Civilians received their first supplies in four years only in June. It comes as US Secretary of State John Kerry hold talks on Syria with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Geneva. They are meeting in a bid to broker a temporary ceasefire in the city of Aleppo, where fighting between government and rebel forces has escalated in recent weeks, leaving hundreds dead. Under the terms of the Darayya deal, 700 armed men will leave for the rebel-controlled city of Idlib while 4,000 civilians will move to government shelters, Syrian state media reported. We are at Darayya main entrance near al-Basil roundabout. This area is just 7km (5 miles) from the Syrian capital, Damascus. Buses and ambulances are on standby to start the evacuation. We are now waiting for the  green light to begin the implementation of the operation as agreed by the two sides. Darayya has a strategic position - given its proximity to Daraa Road, it is not far from the capital and from the Mazzeh military airport, too. The armed opposition had used the town as a connection hub between western and eastern Ghouta, Damascus. Darayya saw some of the first protests against the Syrian government, an uprising that transformed into a full-blown civil conflict. The withdrawal of the rebels only a few miles from Damascus is a boost for President Bashar al-Assad, analysts say. \\"We are being forced to leave, but our condition has deteriorated to the point of being unbearable,\\" Hussam Ayash, an activist in the town, told the Associated Press news agency. \\"We withstood for four years but we couldn't any longer.\\" Meanwhile a monitoring group said 11 children had been killed in a barrel bomb attack by government forces in a rebel-held neighbourhood of Aleppo. They were among 15 people killed in the incident, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Russian and American teams in Geneva, involving military officials and diplomats, have been able to reach agreement on most details of a possible deal. It's up to John Kerry and Sergei Lavrov to try to close the last difficult gaps. One of the most sensitive issues is said to be the grounding of Syria's warplanes. Western sources say senior US defence officials are deeply sceptical, if not resistant, to closer military co-operation with Moscow. But achieving progress in Syria, especially in the battle against so-called Islamic State, is one of the White House's key goals. So John Kerry continues his determined diplomacy to reach some kind of deal with Russia. But today's evacuation in Darayya which involves the surrender of rebel forces, underlines the Syrian government's long-held view that the road to peace goes through local Syrian deals, largely on its terms. The UN says Russia, who has been supporting the Syrian government in its offensives, has agreed to a 48-hour pause in Aleppo to allow in much-needed aid. But the organisation added it was still waiting for agreement from other parties fighting on the ground. In another development, the US has urged \\"strong and swift action\\" after a UN investigation concluded that Syria used chemical weapons against its own people. A summary of the above article is?","output":"The long-besieged Syrian town of Darayya, near Damascus, is to begin evacuation on Friday following a deal struck between the government and rebels. The terms state that 700 armed men will head to Idlib, and 4,000 civilians to governmental shelters. However, in the war-ravaged city of Aleppo, fighting has intensified since mid-August; this led to US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov holding talks to try and broker a temporary ceasefire in the city which have proven inconclusive. In the meantime, the UN has expressed concerns that no action has been taken by the government, despite Russia approving a 48-hour ceasefire in Aleppo."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information:  - Bloomsbury is an area in the West End, central London, forming part of the London Borough of Camden and located between Euston Road and Holborn. It was developed by the Russell family in the 17th and 18th centuries into a fashionable residential area. It is notable for its array of garden squares, literary connections (exemplified by the Bloomsbury Group), and numerous cultural, educational and health-care institutions. Although Bloomsbury was not the first area of London to have acquired a formal square, Bloomsbury Square, laid out in 1660 by Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton, as Southampton Square was the first square to be named as such. Much of the district was planned and built by James Burton.  - Herodotus (\\"Hródotos\\") was a Greek historian who was born in Halicarnassus in the Persian Empire (modern-day Bodrum, Turkey) and lived in the fifth century BC (484 425 BC), a contemporary of Socrates. He is widely referred to as \\"The Father of History\\" (first conferred by Cicero); he was the first historian known to have broken from Homeric tradition to treat historical subjects as a method of investigationspecifically, by collecting his materials systematically and critically, and then arranging them into a historiographic narrative. \\"The Histories\\" is the only work which he is known to have produced, a record of his \\"inquiry\\" (or \\"historía\\") on the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, including a wealth of geographical and ethnographical information. Some of his stories were fanciful and others inaccurate; yet he states that he was reporting only what was told to him and was often correct in his information. Despite Herodotus' historical significance, little is known of his personal history.  - Assyria was a major Mesopotamian East Semitic-speaking kingdom and empire of the ancient Near East. It existed as an independent state from perhaps as early as the 25th century BC in the form of the Assur city-state, until its lapse between 612 BC and 599 BC, spanning the Early to Middle Bronze Age through to the late Iron Age.  - Reign. Astyages succeeded his father in 585 BCE, following the Battle of Halys, which ended a five-year war between the Lydians and the Medes. He inherited a large empire, ruled in alliance with his two brothers-in-law, Croesus of Lydia and Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, whose wife, Amytis, Astyages' sister, was the queen for whom Nebuchadnezzar was said to have built the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. but due to the recent evidence, the garden was likely built by the Assyrian King Sennacherib. Married to Aryenis, the sister of King Croesus of Lydia, to seal the treaty between the two empires, Astyages ascended to the Median throne upon his father's death later that year.  - Rusa II was king of Urartu between around 680 BC and 639 BC. It was during his reign that the massive fortress complex, Karmir-Blur, was constructed.  - Cyaxares (\\"Uvaxštra\\", , ; r. 625585 BC), the son of King Phraortes, and according to Herodotus was the third and most capable king of Media. According to Herodotus, Cyaxares, grandson of Deioces, had a far greater military reputation than his father or grandfather. He was the first to divide his troops into separate sections of spearmen, archers, and horsemen.  - Armenia ( tr. \\"Hayastan\\"), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. \\"Hayastani Hanrapetutyun\\"), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia on the \\"Armenian Highlands\\", it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Russia and Georgia to the north and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south.  - Rusa III was king of Urartu . He was called \`\` Son of Erimena , '' meaning that he was probably a brother of Rusa II. Little is known about his reign ; his name was inscribed on a massive granary at Armavir and on a series of bronze shields from the temple of Khaldi found at Rusahinili , now held in the British Museum . According to the Armenian historian Moses of Chorene , Rusa 's father Erimena can probably be identified with Paruyr Skayordi , who helped the Median king Cyaxares to conquer Assyria , for which Cyaxares recognized him as the king of Armenia , although the Medes ultimately reneged on this ; significantly later , during the reign of King Astyages , the Medes conquered and annexed Armenia . Rusa was the father of Sarduri IV.  - Aššur (Akkadian; 'shr; : shr : shr, Kurdish Asûr), also known as Ashur and Qal'at Sherqat, was an Assyrian city, capital of the Old Assyrian Empire (20251750 BC), Middle Assyrian Empire (13651050 BC), and for a time, the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911605 BC). The remains of the city are situated on the western bank of the Tigris River, north of the confluence with the tributary Little Zab River, in modern-day Iraq, more precisely in the Al-Shirqat District in the Saladin Governorate.  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - The Iron Age is an archaeological era, referring to a period of time in the prehistory and protohistory of the Old World (Afro-Eurasia) when the dominant toolmaking material was iron. It is commonly preceded by the Bronze Age in Europe and Asia with exceptions and the Stone Age in Africa. Meteoric iron has been used by humans since at least 3200 BC, but ancient iron production did not become widespread until the ability to smelt iron ore, remove impurities and regulate the amount of carbon in the alloy were developed. The start of the Iron Age proper is considered by many to fall between around 1200 BC to 600 BC, depending on the region. In most parts of the world, its end is defined by the widespread adoption of writing, and therefore marks the transition from prehistory to history.  - Azerbaijan, officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a country in the South Caucasus region, situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe. It is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia to the west and Iran to the south. The exclave of Nakhchivan is bounded by Armenia to the north and east, Iran to the south and west, while having an 8 km border with Turkey in the north west.  - Croesus ( \\"Kroisos\\"; 595 BC  c. 546 BC) was the king of Lydia who, according to Herodotus, reigned for 14 years: from 560 BC until his defeat by the Persian king Cyrus the Great in 546 BC (sometimes given as 547 BC).  - Phraortes (from , \\"Fravartiš\\", or \\"Frâda\\" via Ancient Greek ; died c. 653 BC), son of Deioces, was the second king of the Median Empire.  - Iran (, also , ; ' ), also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (' ), is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia, the \\"de facto\\" Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Azerbaijan; to the north by the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center.  - Urartu, also known as Kingdom of Van (Urartian: ' Assyrian: '; Babylonian: \\"Urashtu\\"), was an Iron Age kingdom centred on Lake Van in the Armenian Highlands. It corresponds to the biblical \\"Kingdom of Ararat\\".  - The Medes (Old Persian \\"\\", ) were an ancient Iranian people who lived in an area known as Media (northwestern Iran) and who spoke the Median language. They mainly inhabited the mountainous area of northwestern Iran and the northeastern and eastern region of Mesopotamia and located in the Kermanshah-Hamadan (Ecbatana) region Their emergence in Iran is thought to have occurred between 1000 BC to around 900 BC.  - The British Museum is dedicated to human history, art and culture, and is located in the Bloomsbury area of London. Its permanent collection, numbering some 8 million works, is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence and originates from all continents, illustrating and documenting the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present.    What is the relationship between 'rusa iii' and '585 bce'? The answer is:","output":"Rusa III was a king of Urartu, an Iron Age kingdom centered around Lake Van in the Armenian Highlands. He was called \\"Son of Erimena,\\" which suggests that he was probably a brother of Rusa II. Not much is known about Rusa III's reign, but during this period, the Median king Astyages came to power in 585 BCE. Astyages inherited a large empire, and his reign is significant in the context of Rusa III's era. To put it in relation to Rusa III, 585 BCE marks the beginning of Astyages' reign as the king of the Median Empire, which neighbored Urartu. Astyages succeeded his father, Cyaxares, who had been instrumental in conquering the Assyrian Empire. The historical events during Rusa III's reign were closely intertwined with the developments in the nearby Median Empire, particularly the rise of Astyages to power in 585 BCE."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

US Senate confirms Janet Yellen as US Federal Reserve chief Senate confirms Janet Yellen as next Federal Reserve Chair","output":"Based on the information provided in the two sentences, I would rate the similarity at a 4.5 out of 5.  Here is an analysis and explanation for my rating: Both sentences are conveying the same primary message: Janet Yellen has been confirmed by the US Senate for the position of Federal Reserve chief/chair. 1. Both sentences mention \\"Janet Yellen\\" as the individual being confirmed by the Senate for the role. 2. Both sentences mention that the position is related to the Federal Reserve. 3. Both sentences mention the US Senate as the institution confirming Janet Yellen for the role. There's a slight difference in the words used to describe the position - one sentence uses \\"US Federal Reserve chief\\" while the other uses \\"next Federal Reserve Chair.\\" While these might be perceived as minor differences in terms used, both refer to the same role.  It's worth noting that no rating is perfectly objective, and different raters might assign slightly different ratings based on their interpretation of the terms \\"chief\\" and \\"chair.\\" Nevertheless, it is clear that both sentences convey the same core message with high similarity. Hence, a rating of 4.5 out of 5 is appropriate for these two sentences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Jan watched the news every night after dinner with her father.  Given the question \\"Why did Jan do this?\\", is \\"go to her room\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"No, \\"go to her room\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"Why did Jan do this?\\" The question asks for the reason behind Jan's behavior of watching the news every night after dinner with her father. The answer should ideally shed light on why Jan chose to engage in this specific activity with her father. A more appropriate and detailed answer could be: Jan watched the news every night after dinner with her father for various reasons. One significant reason could be that it was a way for her to bond with her father on a daily basis. By participating together in an activity that her father enjoyed, Jan could connect with him in a meaningful way and strengthen their relationship. Another reason for their nightly news-watching habit could be Jan's interest in staying informed about current events and the world around her. This interest might have been instilled in her by her father, who likely placed importance on being aware of what was happening globally. Through this shared interest, Jan and her father could engage in more in-depth conversations and discussions about the news, enhancing their mutual understanding of the world and nurturing critical thinking skills. Furthermore, the routine of watching news together every night after dinner might have been a method of creating a sense of structure and stability within Jan's daily life. Following dinner, she knew she had a set time during which she could relax and spend quality time with her father, thus providing a comforting and consistent part of her day. In conclusion, the answer to the question \\"Why did Jan do this?\\" should revolve around Jan's motives and goals in engaging in the activity of watching the news every night with her father. “Go to her room” does not provide any relevant explanation or information about Jan's decision-making process and is therefore not a valid answer."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Wilhelm was one of eleven children born to poor tenant farmers John and Ethel (nee Stanley) Wilhelm in Huntersville, North Carolina. He played baseball at Cornelius High School in Cornelius, North Carolina. There, he began experimenting with a knuckleball after reading about pitcher Dutch Leonard. Though Wilhelm was primarily a starting pitcher in the minor leagues, he had been called up to a Giants team whose strong starting pitchers had led them to a National League (NL) pennant the year before. Giants manager Leo Durocher did not think that Wilhelm's knuckleball approach would be effective for more than a few innings at a time. He assigned Wilhelm to the team's bullpen.  Wilhelm made his MLB debut with the Giants on April 18, 1952 at age 29, giving up a hit and two walks while only recording one out. On April 23, 1952, in his third game with the New York Giants, Wilhelm batted for the first time in the majors. Facing rookie Dick Hoover of the Boston Braves, Wilhelm hit a home run over the short right-field fence at the Polo Grounds. Although he went to bat a total of 432 times in his career, he never hit another home run.  Pitching exclusively in relief, Wilhelm led the NL with a 2.43 ERA in his rookie year. He won 15 games and lost three. Wilhelm finished in the top ten in Most Valuable Player Award voting that season, becoming the first relief pitcher to finish that high. He finished second in the Rookie of the Year Award voting. Wilhelm made 69 relief appearances in 1953, his win-loss record decreased to 7-8 and he issued 77 walks against 71 strikeouts. Wilhelm was named to the NL All-Star team that year, but he did not play in the game because team manager Charlie Dressen did not think that any of the catchers could handle his knuckleball. The Giants renewed Wilhelm's contract in February 1954.  In 1954, Wilhelm was a key piece of the pitching staff that led the 1954 Giants to a world championship. He pitched 111 innings, finishing with a 12-4 record and a 2.10 ERA. During one of Wilhelm's appearances that season, catcher Ray Katt committed four passed balls in one inning to set the major league record; the record has subsequently been tied twice. When Stan Musial set a record by hitting five home runs in a doubleheader that year, Wilhelm was pitching in the second game and gave up two of the home runs. The 1954 World Series represented Wilhelm's only career postseason play. He pitched  2 1/3 innings over two games, earning a save in the third game. The team won the World Series in a four-game sweep.  Wilhelm's ERA increased to 3.93 over 59 games and 103 innings pitched in 1955, but he managed a 4-1 record. He finished the 1956 season with a 4-9 record and a 3.83 ERA in  89 1/3 innings. Sportswriter Bob Driscoll later attributed Wilhelm's difficulties in the mid-1950s to the decline in the career of Giants catcher Wes Westrum, writing that baseball was \\"a game of inches, and for Hoyt, Wes had been that inch in the right direction.\\" Answer this question using a quote from the following article: When did Wilhelm first start playing baseball?","output":"Wilhelm first started playing baseball when he was studying at Cornelius High School in Cornelius, North Carolina. His interest in the sport began deepening as he started experimenting with a knuckleball after reading about famous pitcher Dutch Leonard.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: Like with owning a kitten, what is a common danger when participating in the sport of fencing? Possible A: small cuts, puncture wound, competition, injury, panting  Why is \\"small cuts\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"The answer \\"small cuts\\" aligns with human common sense because fencing entails using foils, epees, or sabres, which are pointy and may cause physical injuries. Even with protective equipment, there's still a likelihood of receiving minor injuries, such as bruises or small cuts, during a bout or sparring session because it's an interactive sport involving sharp, swift, and precise movements.  The tools of fencing are specifically designed to minimize serious injury; they have blunt ends and the athletes wear protective gear, including jackets, masks, gloves, and chest protectors. Nevertheless, accidents can still happen and cause small cuts or bruises, especially if the participants don't observe proper safety rules or techniques. In contrast, \\"panting\\" is a normal response to physical exertion but not specifically a danger, while \\"competition\\" is a part of almost every sport but isn't inherently dangerous. Thus, from the provided options, \\"small cuts\\" and \\"injury\\" match the idea of a 'common danger' directly tied to the sport of fencing. Remember that while small cuts are common in fencing, severe injuries are quite rare due to the strict safety measures followed in this sport. Regular training, maintaining equipment, and properly respecting the sport and its safety rules can significantly reduce the chance of injury."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The crew is comprised of Captain Dan Holland (Robert Forster), Lt. Charles Pizer - the hotshot first officer (Joseph Bottoms); utility droid LF#396, informally known as VINCENT (voice of Roddy McDowall); Dr. Alex Durant (Anthony Perkins) - navigator and science officer; Dr. Kate McCrae (Yvette Mimieux) - medical officer and empath, who maintains a telepathic rapport with VINCENT via her ESP; and embedded journalist Harry Booth (Ernest Borgnine). After five years of fruitless searching, the Palomino is now on her way home for a refit when VINCENT notices a large, swirling blue accretion disk and recommends a course correction. VINCENT identifies the disk as a black hole, the largest discovered in recent history. While the crew nervously discuss the destructive potential of black holes, VINCENT reveals something else: an apparently derelict ship standing off from the black hole's event horizon (line of no return) and somehow able to keep station, when it almost certainly should have been sucked in. Pizer and Booth are more shocked to see a ship so far from home (when the Palomino should have been the first spaceship to reach this deep in space) than they are to see the black hole. VINCENT identifies the ship as USS Cygnus, with the German scientist Hans Reinhardt (Maximilian Schell) commanding, which disappeared nearly 20 years earlier after apparently failing to heed recall orders after its mission, the same as Palomino's, was declared a failure. (In addition, Booth remembers Reinhardt as arrogant, pompous, and utterly heedless of the value of taxpayers' money.) The Cygnus, however, holds another significance for the crew of Palomino: its XO, Frank McCrae, is Kate's father.Against his better judgment, Holland accepts the recommendations of Pizer and Durant and comes about to rendezvous with Cygnus.

OPTIONS: (1). description (2). entity (3). abbreviation (4). human (5). numeric (6). location","output":"The current monarch of the United Kingdom is Queen Elizabeth II. She is an entity, so the answer to this question would be considered an \\"entity\\" (option 2). Let me elaborate further on Queen Elizabeth II and provide some context regarding the monarchy in the United Kingdom. Queen Elizabeth II, born on April 21, 1926, is the longest-reigning monarch in British history. She ascended to the throne on February 6, 1952, following the death of her father, King George VI. Elizabeth II was crowned queen on June 2, 1953, in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey, London. Queen Elizabeth II's full name is Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor. As the eldest daughter of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth (the Queen Mother), she was destined to become queen following her father's passing. She has been married to her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, since 1947. Prince Philip passed away on April 9, 2021. The royal couple has four children: Prince Charles (Prince of Wales), Princess Anne (Princess Royal), Prince Andrew (Duke of York), and Prince Edward (Earl of Wessex). The monarchy is a constitutional institution in the United Kingdom, which means the monarch's actions are governed by a constitution that outlines the separation of powers among different branches of government. Although the Queen holds a symbolic and ceremonial role, she has minimal involvement in the day-to-day running of the country. Instead, the responsibility of governing falls on elected officials in Parliament, led by the Prime Minister. Nevertheless, Queen Elizabeth II plays a significant role in the continuity and stability of the United Kingdom. As the head of state, she represents the country on official visits, both domestically and abroad, and she maintains close ties with the armed forces. The Queen also plays a crucial role in national unity by providing a sense of continuity through times of change and upheaval. In conclusion, the answer to the question, \\"Who is the monarch of the United Kingdom?\\" is Queen Elizabeth II, which is considered an \\"entity\\" (option 2). The monarchy holds an important place in British society and history, and Queen Elizabeth II has served her nation with dedication and style for over six decades."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - Vitis vinifera (common grape vine) is a species of \\"Vitis\\", native to the Mediterranean region, central Europe, and southwestern Asia, from Morocco and Portugal north to southern Germany and east to northern Iran. There are currently between 5,000 and 10,000 varieties of \\"Vitis vinifera\\" grapes though only a few are of commercial significance for wine and table grape production.  - Rockpile AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in Sonoma County , California , northwest of the town of Healdsburg . Established on February 28 , 2002 , Rockpile AVA was Sonoma County 's twelfth designated wine appellation . The wine region consists of approximately 15,400 acres ( 62 km2 ) in northwestern Sonoma County . All of the AVA has an elevation in excess of 800 feet ( 244 m ) above sea level . Eleven vineyards are currently located within the AVA and there are approximately 160 acres ( 1 km2 ) of planted wine grapes .  - Vitis labrusca (fox grape) is a species of grapevines belonging to the \\"Vitis\\" genus in the flowering plant family Vitaceae. The vines are native to eastern North America and are the source of many grape cultivars, including Catawba, Concord, Delaware, Isabella, Niagara, and many hybrid grape varieties such as Agawam, Alexander and Onaka. Among the characteristics of this vine species in contrast to the European wine grape \\"Vitis vinifera\\" are its \\"slip-skin\\" that allows the skin of the grape berries to easily slip off when squeezed, instead of crushing the pulp, and the presence of tendrils on every node of the cane. Another contrast with European \\"vinifera\\" is the characteristic \\"foxy\\" musk of \\"V. labrusca\\", best known to most people through the Concord grape. This musk is not related to the mammalian fox, but rather to the earthy, redolent aromas characteristic of the grapes that were known by early American settlers in the New World. The term \\"foxy\\" became a sort of catchall for the wine tasting descriptors used for these American wines that were distinct from the familiar flavors of the European viniferous wines.  - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City.

As I see it , the Bush Administration was constantly avowing that it did n't lie about pre-war intelligence , and immigration reform was unlikely to pass regardless of when it was attempted .  But the larger problem with these answers is the notion that Bush 's political mistakes were more grave than the numerous substantive errors that he made while in the White House .

Here is a question about this article: Logically, no number of positive outcomes at the level of experimental testing can confirm a scientific theory, but a single counterexample is logically decisive: it shows the theory, from which the implication is derived, to be false. To say that a given statement (e.g., the statement of a law of some scientific theory) -- [call it \\"T\\"] -- is \\"falsifiable\\" does not mean that \\"T\\" is false. Rather, it means that, if \\"T\\" is false, then (in principle), \\"T\\" could be shown to be false, by observation or by experiment. Popper's account of the logical asymmetry between verification and falsifiability lies at the heart of his philosophy of science. It also inspired him to take falsifiability as his criterion of demarcation between what is, and is not, genuinely scientific: a theory should be considered scientific if, and only if, it is falsifiable. This led him to attack the claims of both psychoanalysis and contemporary Marxism to scientific status, on the basis that their theories are not falsifiable. What is the answer to this question: What political theory did Popper say did not meet his falsifiability criterion?","output":"Popper said that contemporary Marxism did not meet his falsifiability criterion, which means that he believed it wasn't a genuinely scientific theory."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sent 2: The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Sent 3: Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Sent 4: Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding.

Sent 7: KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. Sent 8: After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Sent 9: Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. Sent 10: According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Sent 11: Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Sent 12: Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. Sent 13: We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. Sent 14: The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. Sent 15: By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Sent 16: Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.

Write an article with the title: \\"Dez Bryant: Madden Rating Is 'Insult'\\" Article:","output":"Title: Dez Bryant: Madden Rating Is 'Insult' Introduction: Dez Bryant, a well-known professional football player, recently expressed his dissatisfaction with his Madden rating, calling it an \\"insult.\\" As one of the most popular sports simulation video games, Madden NFL has been a staple among football fans since it was first released in 1988. Players eagerly anticipate each year's iteration, with updated ratings and features. For professional athletes like Bryant, their representation and performance in the game are also crucial for their marketability, personal brand, and fan base. This article will delve into Bryant's reaction to his rating, why players in general care about their Madden ratings, and discuss the potential impact on the player's career going forward. Bryant's Rating and Reaction: Dez Bryant, a talented wide receiver who has previously played for the Dallas Cowboys and more recently for the Baltimore Ravens, expressed his disappointment with his current Madden rating. In the latest version of the game, Bryant received a rating of 77, which the player took issue with, calling it an \\"insult.\\" Given that Madden ratings range from 0 to 99, a score of 77 can be considered above average. However, for a player of Bryant's caliber, who has consistently been a top performer on the field and a fan favorite, this rating is seen as a significant downgrade and an undervaluation of his talents. Why Players Care About Their Madden Rating: Madden ratings are not only numerical representations of a player's skills and abilities, but they can also influence public perception and fan support. A higher rating reflects prestige and excellence, while a lower rating might indicate a player is underperforming or not living up to their potential. Athletes, like anyone else, appreciate public recognition and validation for their hard work and dedication. Additionally, a higher Madden rating can translate to better endorsement deals, jersey sales, and bargaining power with team management. The importance of these ratings extends beyond the virtual realm and into the real-world experiences and perception of the players. Impact on Career: While it remains unclear if a revised Madden rating will ultimately change Bryant's performance or public opinion about his skills, it is evident that the situation has affected his confidence. It is crucial for any professional athlete to believe in their abilities and maintain a strong sense of self-worth. Without that, the pressure to perform well on the field can become overwhelming.  In the case of Dez Bryant, it is crucial for him to not let the rating define his abilities and to remind both himself and the fans of his past achievements and current potential. A more accurate rating in future editions of Madden NFL could certainly boost his confidence and, in turn, improve his play on the field. Conclusion: Dez Bryant's disappointment with his Madden rating reflects the significant role these ratings play in the lives and careers of professional athletes. Though not everyone may agree with Bryant's assessment of his own abilities, his reaction serves as a poignant reminder that there are real people behind the virtual representations on our screens. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of accurate representation in video games, especially in the world of sports simulation games, where the line between virtual and reality is continually being blurred."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Coming off their win against the Eagles, the Redskins had a short turnaround and traveled to Cowboys Stadium to take on their hated rival the Dallas Cowboys for the 2012 edition of the annual Thanksgiving Day game. Washington had reason to be nervous, as they were 1-6 all-time on Thanksgiving, and 0-6 against Dallas. In the first, Washington got the ball first, but went three-and-out. After a Sav Rocca punt, Dallas had decent field position, and quickly reached the red zone. However, Washington's defense then stiffened, and held Dallas to a Dan Bailey 30-yard field goal. The teams then exchanged punts, and the first quarter concluded without any further scoring. In the second, Washington had the ball inside their own 35, and quarterback Robert Griffin III used a play-action pass, and found a streaking Aldrick Robinson for a 68-yard strike, and Washington took its first lead of the game, at 7-3. On Dallas' ensuing possession, Dallas moved the ball into Washington territory, but after Tony Romo completed an 11-yard pass to Dez Bryant that had Dallas in Washington territory, Redskins cornerback Josh Wilson hit him, and dislodged the football, which was subsequently recovered by safety DeJon Gomes into Dallas territory. Washington would capitalize, with their drive culminating in an Alfred Morris 1-yard touchdown run to extend Washington's advantage to 14-3. Dallas would then punt after just three plays, and Washington marched near midfield, before Griffin connected with wide receiver Pierre Gar&#231;on across the middle, and Garcon proceeded to streak to the endzone for a 59-yard score, and Washington led 21-3 with just over 2 minutes remaining in the half. Dallas would attempt to run a two-minute drill, but Romo's pass, intended for Cole Beasley was intercepted by DeAngelo Hall and returned inside the Dallas 25. With mere seconds remaining in the half, Griffin found Santana Moss in the corner of the endzone for a score, and a 28-3 halftime lead. In the third, Dallas marched down the field on their opening possession, but the drive stalled again, and Dallas settled for another Bailey field goal, this time from 33 yards out. The majority of the rest of the quarter proved to be a defensive struggle, as Romo was intercepted again, this time by London Fletcher, but Washington could not capitalize on it. After a Rocca punt, Dallas was pinned inside their 20, but Romo connected with a wide-open Dez Bryant, who streaked 85 yards to the end zone, and before you could blink, Dallas was back in the game, at 28-13 Washington. Going into the fourth, Washington was driving, in an attempt to extend their lead back to three scores. They would succeed in this endeavor, as Griffin found tight end Niles Paul for a 30-yard touchdown on third-and-inches, and Washington took a 35-13 lead with just under 13 minutes to go. Dallas, however, would not give up, as expected. To save time, Dallas ran a no-huddle offense, and was able to march down the field, and find Felix Jones for a 10-yard touchdown, and a subsequent quarterback draw by Romo cut the lead to 35-21 with just under 10 minutes remaining. On Washington's next possession, disaster struck. Robert Griffin III lofted a throw over the middle that he overthrew horribly, and it was easily intercepted by Charlie Peprah and returned inside the Washington 20. However, Washington's defense put Dallas into a 4th down situation, but Romo found Dez Bryant in the left corner of the end zone, and with over 8 minutes remaining, Dallas was now within a touchdown, as Washington's lead was merely 35-28. With his mettle about to be tested, Robert Griffin III led an efficient, clock-chewing drive that concluded with a Kai Forbath 48-yard field goal to extend Washington's advantage to 38-28 with just under three minutes remaining. Dallas, needing a touchdown, onside kick recovery, and field goal to send it to overtime, again marched into Washington territory, but couldn't get to the endzone, as Dez Bryant caught a pass in the endzone that was dislodged at the last minute by Madieu Williams, and Dallas had to settle for a 51-yard field goal by Bailey. This cut the score to 38-31, and Dallas lined up for an onside kick, needing a touchdown to tie the game, with 18 seconds remaining. However, it was recovered by DeAngelo Hall and returned to the Dallas 2, as Hall opted not to score, instead letting Robert Griffin III kneel-down to seal the deal. Griffin went 20-for-28 for 311 yards, 4 touchdowns and 1 interception, becoming the first rookie QB in NFL history to throw 4 passing touchdowns in back-to-back games. With the win, Washington improved to 5-6, 2-1 in the NFC East, and into second place in the NFC East by virtue of the tiebreaker over Dallas. Washington also won its first Thanksgiving game since the 1973 season, when they defeated the Detroit Lions. Washington improved to 2-6 all-time on Thanksgiving, and 1-6 against Dallas.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Obama tries to reset with gay community Washington (CNN) -- Gay rights activist Kevin Cathcart remembers keenly the day President Barack Obama announced his support for same-sex marriage. There sat Obama, who for years had frustrated many in the gay community by not supporting same-sex marriage, telling ABC's Robin Roberts that conversations with his daughters and friends led him to change his mind. \\"When it finished I hit the replay button and I watched it again,\\" said Cathcart, executive director of LAMBDA Legal, a gay civil rights organization. \\"Then I hit the replay button and watched it again.\\" Obama hosted a White House reception Friday in honor of Gay Pride month, an event that brought the president full circle with a community whose support helped launch him into the Oval Office. \\"After decades of inaction and indifference, you have every reason and right to push loudly and forcefully for equality,\\" Obama said at the event. \\"But three years ago I promised you this, I said that even if it took more time that I would like, we would see progress, we would see success, we would see real and lasting change, and together that's what we're witnessing.\\" It is also a community that, according to a recent CNN analysis of the president's biggest openly gay \\"bundlers,\\" or fundraisers, helped add at least 8 million to Obama's campaign coffers between January and the end of March. \\"President Obama has the enormous admiration and appreciation of not just gay people, but people who care about gay people: our family, loved ones and friends. He has shown moral leadership and taken tremendous steps to end discrimination against gays,\\" said Evan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry. The president \\"made such a heartfelt and personal description of how he had changed his mind (on allowing gays to legally marry). It's the very same journey that a majority of Americans have taken.\\" According to a recent CNN/ORC International Poll, 54% of Americans support legalizing marriages between gay and lesbian couples, with 42% opposed. Sixty percent of Americans also say they have a close friend or family member who is gay. This would seem to suggest good news for Obama, a man who Newsweek magazine recently dubbed America's \\"first gay president.\\" Given his opposition to same-sex marriage and the pressure an openly gay staffer faced from conservatives, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney will be hard-pressed to get similar support from the gay and lesbian community. \\"My sense is that Romney perceives that not only to secure the nomination but to get the support of the Republican base he needs, he has to take a hard right stand on the issue of same-sex marriage,\\" said Craig Rimmerman, professor of public policy and political science at Hobart and William Smith Colleges and author of \\"From Identity to Politics: The Lesbian and Gay Movements in the United States.\\" Romney has not received an endorsement from Log Cabin Republicans, a national gay and lesbian GOP organization. Up until about eight weeks ago, some gay rights activists were feeling similarly tepid about Obama, Cathcart said. Follow us on Twitter @CNNPolitics Join us on Facebook/CNNPolitics As a candidate in the last presidential election, Obama enjoyed rock star status among the gay and lesbian community. High-profile, openly gay figures such as musician Melissa Etheridge and DreamWorks SKG mogul David Geffen joined a grassroots army of supporters at campaign rallies for the Illinois senator. But once in office, President Obama's efforts at pressing the case for gay rights were more muted, gay rights activists said. Some in the community even felt betrayed. \\"The administration has done a great deal, but a lot of it was under the radar and less visible and people were focused on the big things,\\" Cathcart said. \\" 'Don't ask, don't tell' took a long time and his evolution on marriage took a long time.\\" Still, some activists found reason to hope for change. The Obama administration criticized a measure in North Carolina, a swing state, that banned same-sex marriage and made civil unions illegal. The president took the same position on a similar Minnesota proposal. On Friday, when the Pentagon held its first Gay Pride event, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta highlighted the administration's biggest accomplishment in the gay rights cause: repealing \\"don't ask, don't tell,\\" the military's ban on openly gay and lesbian members serving in the forces. \\"The successful repeal of 'don't ask, don't tell' proved to the nation that just like the country we defend, we share different backgrounds, different values and different beliefs but together we are the greatest military force in the world,\\" Panetta said Friday in a video message to troops. The administration's push to emphasize the White House's support of gay rights is meant to signal to supporters in that community that the president still stands with them, Rimmerman said. \\"My sense is that it is going to firm up his support in the lesbian and gay community,\\" Rimmerman said. Obama \\"has been quite cautious in how he approaches significant policy changes. He was afraid to take the lead on this issue until he felt it could be politically justified. It suggests to me a degree of caution that's probably unwarranted given what he promised as a candidate.\\"","output":"This news article discusses President Barack Obama's efforts to reset his relationship with the gay community. Gay rights activist Kevin Cathcart remembers the day Obama announced his support for same-sex marriage and describes how it marked a turning point for Obama's standing within the LGBTQ+ community. The article highlights how Obama hosted a White House reception in honor of Gay Pride month, which brought him closer to the community and reaffirmed their support. It mentions how LGBTQ+ supporters raised significant funds for Obama's campaign, highlighting his appeal to not only the community but also their friends and family members. Additionally, it contrasts Obama's support for same-sex marriage with Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's opposition, revealing how the latter faces challenges in gaining support from the LGBTQ+ community. Although some activists felt disappointed with the Obama administration not delivering on the \\"big things,\\" progress was made on several fronts, including the repeal of the \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" policy in the military. As such, Obama's support for gay rights has not only strengthened his relationship with the LGBTQ+ community but also secured their continued backing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If I tell you that Planting trees can remove pollutants in a number of ways, and ask you the question \\"what can planting trees reduce?\\", is the correct answer \\"pollutants\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the correct answer is \\"pollutants.\\" Planting trees can help reduce pollutants in several ways, as they act as natural air and water filters. Some of these ways include: 1. Absorption of carbon dioxide: Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during the process of photosynthesis, and in turn release oxygen. This process helps to reduce the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is a major greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. An increase in the number of trees helps to store more carbon and reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that accumulates in the atmosphere. 2. Particulate matter filtration: Trees can help remove particulate matter (PM) from the air by trapping these particles on their leaves and bark surfaces. PM is a type of air pollutant that has been linked to various health issues, such as respiratory disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. By trapping PM on their surfaces, trees play a role in improving air quality and public health. 3. Reduction of other pollutants: Trees can also act as filters for other air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. These pollutants are known to cause negative health effects on humans and animals, as well as damage to the environment. By absorbing these pollutants, trees can help to improve overall air quality. 4. Erosion and sediment control: Tree roots stabilize soil and reduce erosion, preventing sediment from entering waterways and contributing to water pollution. Additionally, trees can act as buffers, filtering out pollutants from surface water runoff before they reach water bodies like lakes or rivers. 5. Chemical pollutant breakdown: Certain trees have the ability to break down chemicals, such as heavy metals, into less harmful components through a process called phytoremediation. This process involves using plants to remove, stabilize, or break down contaminants in soil, water, and air. 6. Temperature regulation: Trees provide shade and help to cool urban environments, thereby reducing the urban heat island effect. This can lead to reduced energy consumption for cooling and a decrease in emissions from power plants. 7. Noise pollution reduction: Trees can absorb and reduce noise pollution by acting as a natural sound barrier, which can contribute to a more comfortable and healthy living environment. In summary, planting trees can indeed reduce various types of pollutants, including those in the air, water, and soil. This process not only contributes to improved air and water quality, but also provides numerous other environmental, public health, and economic benefits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: Various forms of ONJ have been described over the last 160 years, and a number of causes have been suggested in the literature. Question: what is the disease osteonecrosis of the jaw? Answer:","output":"Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a severe bone disorder that affects the jawbone, specifically the maxilla or mandible. The term 'osteonecrosis' refers to the death of bone tissue, which occurs due to disrupted blood supply to the bone, leading to bone deterioration and eventual collapse. In the case of ONJ, this bone damage and tissue death affect the jaw, causing pain, swelling, infection, and eventually the exposure of the bone in the oral cavity. Various forms of ONJ have indeed been described over the last 160 years, and numerous factors have been recognized as potential causes of the disease. Some of the key causes and risk factors include: 1. Bisphosphonate medications: These drugs are primarily used to treat and prevent osteoporosis and bone metastases in patients with cancer. Long-term use of bisphosphonates has been linked to ONJ, with the risk increasing in patients receiving high doses or intravenous administration of the medication. 2. Radiation therapy: Patients who undergo radiation treatment to the head and neck area due to cancer are also at risk of developing ONJ. This type of ONJ is usually referred to as radiation-induced osteonecrosis of the jaw. 3. Dental procedures: Invasive dental treatments or surgeries, including dental extractions, periodontal surgery, and dental implant placement, can also predispose patients to ONJ, especially if they are already receiving bisphosphonates or undergoing radiation therapy. 4. Trauma or injury: Trauma to the jawbone, such as fractures or dislocations, can also lead to poor blood circulation and bone tissue death, resulting in ONJ. 5. Infections: Bacterial, fungal, or viral infections in the oral cavity can also cause ONJ by compromising blood flow to the jawbone and leading to bone tissue damage. 6. Systemic factors: Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, vascular diseases, autoimmune disorders, and immune suppression, can increase the risk of ONJ by affecting bone health and blood supply to the jawbone. Diagnosis of ONJ is primarily based on clinical examination, medical and dental history, and imaging studies such as X-rays, MRI, or CT scans. Treatment of ONJ is often complex and multidisciplinary, involving various specialists such as oral surgeons, oncologists, and dentists. Treatment strategies may include antibiotics for infection control, pain management, surgical intervention to remove necrotic bone and promote regeneration, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy for improving blood supply to the affected area. Preventive measures, such as regular dental check-ups and maintaining good oral hygiene, are also crucial in mitigating the risk of ONJ, particularly for patients with known risk factors or who are receiving bisphosphonates or radiation therapy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: I heard a car door slam behind me and turned to see an elderly but spry woman heading my way. The night before, a gang of vandals had swept through the cemetery desecrating graves, crushing headstones and stealing funereal objects. My parents' graves, situated on a wind-swept hill overlooking the cemetery, had not been spared. A large marble urn that stood between two granite columns had been pried loose and spirited away, leaving faded silk flowers strewn on the ground. I was holding a bouquet of them in my arms when the woman walked up and gave me a crushing hug. \\"Honey,\\" she said, \\"you don't know me, but when I saw you standing up here on this hill, I knew that you must be one of the girls and I couldn't help myself but to drive up here and let you know how much me and my whole family loved both of your parents. They were real special people.\\" I thanked her for her kind words as we stood side by side gazing down at the graves of Govs. George Wallace and Lurleen Wallace. After a few moments, the woman leaned into me and spoke almost in a conspiratorial whisper. \\"I never thought I would live to see the day when a black would be running for president. I know your daddy must be rolling over in his grave.\\" Not having the heart or the energy to respond, I gave her bony arm a slight squeeze, turned and walked away. As I put the remnants of the graveyard spray in the trunk of my car, I assumed that she had not bothered to notice the Barack Obama sticker on my bumper. When I was a young voter and had little interest in politics, my father would mark my ballot for me. As I thought about the woman in the cemetery, I mused that if he were alive and I had made the same request for this election, there would be a substantial chance, though not a certainty, that he would put an \\"X\\" by Obama's name. Perhaps it would be the last chapter in his search for inner peace that became so important to him after becoming a victim of hatred and violence himself when he was shot and gravely injured in a Laurel, Maryland, shopping center parking lot. Perhaps it would be a way of reconciling in his own mind that what he once stood for did not prevent freedom of opportunity and self-advancement from coming full circle; his final absolution. George Wallace and other Southern governors of his ilk stood defiantly in the 1950s and '60s in support of racial segregation, a culture of repression, violence and denial of basic human rights. Their actions and the stark images of their consequences that spread across the world galvanized the nation and gave rise to a cry for an end to the American apartheid. The firestorms that were lit in Birmingham, Oxford, Memphis, Tuscaloosa, Montgomery, Little Rock and Selma were a call to arms to which the people responded. And now a new call to arms has sounded as Americans face another assault on freedom. For if the stand in the schoolhouse door was a defining moment for George Wallace, then surely the aftermath of Katrina and the invasion of Iraq will be the same for George W. Bush. The trampling of individual freedoms and his blatant contempt for the rights of the average American may not have been as obvious as an ax-handle-wielding governor, but Bush's insidiousness and piety have made him much more dangerous. Healing must come, hope will be our lodestar, humility will reshape the American conscience, and honesty in both word and deed will refresh and invigorate America, and having Barack Obama to lead will give us back our power to heal. My father lived long enough to come to an understanding of the injustices borne by his deeds and the legacy of suffering that they left behind. History will teach future generations that he was a man who used his political power to promote a philosophy of exclusion. As his daughter, who witnessed his suffering in the twilight of his years and who witnessed his deeds and heard his words, I am one who believes that the man who, on March 7, 1965, listened to the reports of brutality as they streamed into the Governor's Mansion from Selma, Alabama, was not the same man who, in March of 1995, was welcomed with open arms as he was rolled through a sea of African-American men, women and children who gathered with him to welcome another generation of marchers, retracing in honor and remembrance the historic steps from Selma to Montgomery. Four years ago, the young Illinois senator who spoke at the Democratic National Convention mesmerized me. I hoped even then that he would one day be my president. Today, Barack Obama is hope for a better tomorrow for all Americans. He stands on the shoulders of all those people who have incessantly prayed for a day when \\"justice will run down like waters and righteousness as a mighty stream\\" (Amos 5:24). Perhaps one day, my two sons and I will have the opportunity to meet Barack Obama in person to express our gratitude to him for bringing our family full circle. And today, the day after the election, I am going to ride to the cemetery so that if asked, I can vouch for the fact that the world is still spinning but my father lies at peace. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peggy Wallace Kennedy.","output":"In this story, a woman visits her parents' graves in a cemetery. Vandals have recently damaged the cemetery, including her parents' graves. While she's there, an older lady comes to talk to her.

The woman thinks about her father's past and how he might have felt about Barack Obama running for president.

Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth. Alkali soils owe their unfavorable physico-chemical properties mainly to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate, which causes the soil to swell[1] and difficult to clarify/settle. They derive their name from the alkali metal group of elements, to which sodium belongs, and which can induce basicity. Sometimes these soils are also referred to as alkaline sodic soils. Alkaline soils are basic, but not all basic soils are alkaline.  Pat has 2 acres of land next to Tim's property. Tim's land is of similar size. The clay soil on Tim's property is very alkaline, so he had to amend it with aluminum salts to make it more acidic in order to grow crops. The soil on Pat's parcel has a good structure and high infiltration capacity. Pat gets twice as much food of his land every year.  Which soil is more basic, the one on Pat's or the one on Tim's? The answer to this question is:","output":"The soil on Tim's property is more basic. This is because Tim's land has a very alkaline soil, which means it has a high pH (greater than 8.5). As mentioned in the description, alkaline soils have a poor soil structure and a low infiltration capacity due to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate, which causes the soil to swell and become difficult to settle. These properties make Tim's soil more basic. In comparison, Pat's soil has a good structure and high infiltration capacity, which indicates that it is not an alkaline (or basic) soil. As a result, Pat is able to grow twice as much food on his land every year compared to Tim, who had to amend his soil with aluminum salts to make it more acidic in order to grow crops. In conclusion, Tim's soil is more basic than Pat's soil due to its alkaline nature, poor soil structure, and low infiltration capacity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They expressed satisfaction with the content of the movie, describing it as \\"great fun\\" and something they had been looking forward to watching on DVD. This enthusiasm indicates that they enjoyed the movie and were pleased with the overall experience. On the other hand, the customer also expressed dissatisfaction with the format of the movie; they seem disappointed that it is only available in full screen. They mention a similar scenario with the release of \\"Hot Dog,\\" which was also only available in full screen. The customer's lamenting of the full-screen format suggests that they were not entirely satisfied with the product from a technical standpoint. Additionally, the customer's mention of playing \\"Who's underwear is that\\" with the host Fitz, implies that they might be looking for more light-hearted entertainment following the experience of watching the movie, or perhaps they are referring to an inside joke or game related to the content.

In this in-depth exploration, BusinessWeek Online takes a closer look at how hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons and others raved about the revolutionary device that changed the way we communicate and express ourselves through our gadgets. A Symbol of Style and Identity For those who recall the iconic ad campaigns featuring celebrities like David Beckham endorsing the Razr, it is clear that the mobile phone was an instant symbol of style and innovation. Russell Simmons, the renowned hip-hop impresario, captured the essence of the Razr V3 by calling it \\"hot.\\" For him, the phone embodied a unique and refined fashion statement, likening it to a \\"cool pair of sneakers or a watch.\\" The notion of having one's mobile device serve as an extension of one's identity and taste became a significant cultural trend in the mid-2000s. Revolutionary Design and Innovation One of the reasons behind the Razr V3's enormous success was its groundbreaking design. With a thickness of just half an inch and weighing a mere 3.35 oz., the phone boasted the appearance of a classic straight-edge razor - a clear inspiration for its name. The handset easily fit into the pockets of its users while making a striking visual impact with its streamlined, anodized aluminum shell. More than just an aesthetic marvel, the Motorola Razr V3 was also packed with a host of advanced features, such as a video clip player, a zoom camera, and polyphonic speakers. These cutting-edge capabilities were cleverly incorporated into a matchbook-thin frame barely wider than a credit card, highlighting Motorola's commitment to pushing the boundaries of mobile technology. The Lasting Impact of the Motorola Razr V3 The Razr V3's legacy has been palpable since its launch; it pioneered many design and technology trends that beguiled the mobile phone industry for years to come. Many other manufacturers followed suit, producing sleek and elegant devices as a response to the Razr's wild popularity. Later iterations of the Razr series continued to make waves, showcasing improvements in design and functionality. Ultimately, the Motorola Razr V3 was a watershed moment in the mobile phone industry, illustrating that a mobile device could be both a technological powerhouse and an object of desire, conveying one's personal style and taste. While technology has come a long way since the Razr's heyday, its innovative and trailblazing spirit can still be felt in the sleek smartphones we use today."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Did you know that the British and the French had a race whi1e they were building the Chunnel? The race was to see who could get to the middle of the tunnel first. The British won by a little bit. It took 15,000 workers over seven years to dig the tunnel. The tunnel was finished in 1994. The completed Chunnel cost about  21 billion. But it all paid off, because it became very popular, very quick. Millions of people use it. Now it is getting even more popular. There are three complete tunnels in the Chunnel.

Before starting the experiment, Jacob is told that liquid A molecules have strong intermolecular forces, while liquid B molecules have weak intermolecular forces. Jacob now has to decide how to use this information to guide  him as he develops the experimental procedures for these two liquids.  and a hint : Vapor pressure is a measure of the pressure exerted by a gas above a liquid in a sealed container. While viscosity and surface tension increase as the strength of intermolecular forces increase, vapor pressure decreases . This is because the stronger the intermolecular forces are, the harder it is for liquid molecules to escape into the gas phase. Vapor pressure a measure of how much of a substance is in the gas phase when that substance is at equilibrium; that is, the number of molecules in the gas and liquid phases are not changing. The more molecules that are able to escape into the gas phase, the higher the vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is also proportional to temperature. As temperature increases, vapor pressure also increases.  Please answer this question : When both liquids are at equilibrium, which liquid will have less molecules in the liquid phase? A:","output":"Liquid B will have less molecules in the liquid phase when both liquids are at equilibrium.

Maurice Merleau-Ponty (French: [moRis meRlo poti]; 14 March 1908 - 3 May 1961) was a French phenomenological philosopher, strongly influenced by Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. The constitution of meaning in human experience was his main interest and he wrote on perception, art, and politics. He was on the editorial board of Les Temps modernes, the leftist magazine established by Jean-Paul Sartre in 1945. At the core of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy is a sustained argument for the foundational role perception plays in understanding the world as well as engaging with the world. In his Phenomenology of Perception (first published in French in 1945), Merleau-Ponty developed the concept of the body-subject (le corps propre) as an alternative to the Cartesian \\"ego cogito.\\" This distinction is especially important in that Merleau-Ponty perceives the essences of the world existentially. Consciousness, the world, and the human body as a perceiving thing are intricately intertwined and mutually \\"engaged.\\" The phenomenal thing is not the unchanging object of the natural sciences, but a correlate of our body and its sensory-motor functions. Taking up and \\"communing with\\" (Merleau-Ponty's phrase) the sensible qualities it encounters, the body as incarnated subjectivity intentionally elaborates things within an ever-present world frame, through use of its pre-conscious, pre-predicative understanding of the world's makeup. The elaboration, however, is \\"inexhaustible\\" (the hallmark of any perception according to Merleau-Ponty). Things are that upon which our body has a \\"grip\\" (prise), while the grip itself is a function of our connaturality with the world's things. The world and the sense of self are emergent phenomena in an ongoing \\"becoming.\\"  The essential partiality of our view of things, their being given only in a certain perspective and at a certain moment in time does not diminish their reality, but on the contrary establishes it, as there is no other way for things to be copresent with us and with other things than through such \\"Abschattungen\\" (sketches, faint outlines, adumbrations). The thing transcends our view, but is manifest precisely by presenting itself to a range of possible views. The object of perception is immanently tied to its background--to the nexus of meaningful relations among objects within the world. Because the object is inextricably within the world of meaningful relations, each object reflects the other (much in the style of Leibniz's monads). Through involvement in the world - being-in-the-world - the perceiver tacitly experiences all the perspectives upon that object coming from all the surrounding things of its environment, as well as the potential perspectives that that object has upon the beings around it.  Each object is a \\"mirror of all others.\\" Our perception of the object through all perspectives is not that of a propositional, or clearly delineated, perception; rather, it is an ambiguous perception founded upon the body's primordial involvement and understanding of the world and of the meanings that constitute the landscape's perceptual gestalt. Only after we have been integrated within the environment so as to perceive objects as such can we turn our attention toward particular objects within the landscape so as to define them more clearly. This attention, however, does not operate by clarifying what is already seen, but by constructing a new Gestalt oriented toward a particular object. Because our bodily involvement with things is always provisional and indeterminate, we encounter meaningful things in a unified though ever open-ended world.  From the time of writing Structure of Behavior and Phenomenology of Perception, Merleau-Ponty wanted to show, in opposition to the idea that drove the tradition beginning with John Locke, that perception was not the causal product of atomic sensations. This atomist-causal conception was being perpetuated in certain psychological currents of the time, particularly in behaviourism. According to Merleau-Ponty, perception has an active dimension, in that it is a primordial openness to the lifeworld (the \\"Lebenswelt\\").  This primordial openness is at the heart of his thesis of the primacy of perception. The slogan of Husserl's phenomenology is \\"all consciousness is consciousness of something\\", which implies a distinction between \\"acts of thought\\" (the noesis) and \\"intentional objects of thought\\" (the noema). Thus, the correlation between noesis and noema becomes the first step in the constitution of analyses of consciousness. However, in studying the posthumous manuscripts of Husserl, who remained one of his major influences, Merleau-Ponty remarked that, in their evolution, Husserl's work brings to light phenomena which are not assimilable to noesis-noema correlation. This is particularly the case when one attends to the phenomena of the body (which is at once body-subject and body-object), subjective time (the consciousness of time is neither an act of consciousness nor an object of thought) and the other (the first considerations of the other in Husserl led to solipsism).  The distinction between \\"acts of thought\\" (noesis) and \\"intentional objects of thought\\" (noema) does not seem, therefore, to constitute an irreducible ground. It appears rather at a higher level of analysis. Thus, Merleau-Ponty does not postulate that \\"all consciousness is consciousness of something\\", which supposes at the outset a noetic-noematic ground. Instead, he develops the thesis according to which \\"all consciousness is perceptual consciousness\\". In doing so, he establishes a significant turn in the development of phenomenology, indicating that its conceptualisations should be re-examined in the light of the primacy of perception, in weighing up the philosophical consequences of this thesis.  The highlighting of the fact that corporeity intrinsically has a dimension of expressivity which proves to be fundamental to the constitution of the ego is one of the conclusions of The Structure of Behavior that is constantly reiterated in Merleau-Ponty's later works. Following this theme of expressivity, he goes on to examine how an incarnate subject is in a position to undertake actions that transcend the organic level of the body, such as in intellectual operations and the products of one's cultural life.  He carefully considers language, then, as the core of culture, by examining in particular the connections between the unfolding of thought and sense--enriching his perspective not only by an analysis of the acquisition of language and the expressivity of the body, but also by taking into account pathologies of language, painting, cinema, literature, poetry and song.  This work deals mainly with language, beginning with the reflection on artistic expression in The Structure of Behavior--which contains a passage on El Greco (p. 203ff) that prefigures the remarks that he develops in \\"Cezanne's Doubt\\" (1945) and follows the discussion in Phenomenology of Perception. The work, undertaken while serving as the Chair of Child Psychology and Pedagogy at the University of the Sorbonne, is not a departure from his philosophical and phenomenological works, but rather an important continuation in the development of his thought.  As the course outlines of his Sorbonne lectures indicate, during this period he continues a dialogue between phenomenology and the diverse work carried out in psychology, all in order to return to the study of the acquisition of language in children, as well as to broadly take advantage of the contribution of Ferdinand de Saussure to linguistics, and to work on the notion of structure through a discussion of work in psychology, linguistics and social anthropology.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What stadium did the team who played at Old Trafford have to locate to after their stadium was damaged by stray bombs?  Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of war materiel during the Second World War, such as the Avro Manchester and Avro Lancaster heavy bombers, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power the Spitfire, Hurricane, Mosquito and the Lancaster. The engines were made by Ford, under licence. The 17,316 workers employed in Ford's purpose-built factory had produced 34,000 engines by the war's end. The facility was designed in two separate sections to minimise the impact of bomb damage on production. The wood-working factory of F. Hills & Sons built more than 800 Percival Proctor aircraft for the RAF between 1940 and 1945, which were flight tested at the nearby Barton Aerodrome. Other companies produced gun bearings, steel tracks for Churchill tanks, munitions, Bailey bridges, and much else. ICI built and operated the first facility in the UK able to produce penicillin in quantity.As an important industrial area, the park suffered from extensive bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of December 1940. On the night of 23 December 1940, the Metropolitan-Vickers aircraft factory in Mosley Road was badly damaged, with the loss of the first 13 MV-built Avro Manchester bombers in final assembly. The new Ford factory producing aircraft engines was bombed only a few days after its opening in May 1941. Trafford Hall was severely damaged by bombing, and was demolished shortly after the war ended.In the December 1940 air raids, stray bombs aiming for Trafford Park landed on Old Trafford football stadium, the nearby home of Manchester United, but this air raid only resulted in minor damage and matches were soon being played at the stadium again. On 11 March 1941, however, stray bombs aimed at Trafford Park fell onto Old Trafford for a second time, causing serious damage to the stadium. It was comprehensively rebuilt after the war and re-opened in 1949, until which time Manchester United played their home games at Maine Road, the stadium of Manchester City in Moss Side.At the outbreak of war in...","output":"After their stadium, Old Trafford, was damaged by stray bombs during the Second World War, the team, Manchester United, had to locate to Maine Road, the stadium of Manchester City in Moss Side, for their home games.

Unfortunately, my recent visit to John's Riverside Retreat (JRR) fell short of my expectations, leaving me not only utterly disappointed but also frustrated over the wasted time and money.  Upon arriving at JRR, the first impression was unsettling, as the location was anything but picturesque. Situated by a rather murky and unclean riverside, this alleged \\"retreat\\" overlooked an industrial park, which emitted constant noise and polluted the air with an unpleasant odor. The lack of greenery or any scenic views made it hard to relax and enjoy what I had hoped would be a serene escape. Entering JRR's main building, I was met with an unwelcoming reception area. The staff seemed aloof and uninterested, neglecting to provide essential information or even a warm greeting. It took them almost half an hour to locate my reservation. When I asked about possible activities or recommendations on how to make the most of my time, they handed me a generic brochure without any elaboration. The room was another disappointment. Damaged furniture, stained bed linens, and a bathroom with poor water pressure and rusted fixtures were a far cry from the \\"luxurious accommodations\\" advertised on their website. The air conditioning was inefficient, failing to keep the room at a comfortable temperature, despite my attempts to adjust the settings. Dining at JRR was no better. The restaurant menu was limited, and the few dishes offered lacked both quality and flavor. I opted for the highly recommended \\"Chef's Special,\\" which turned out to be a bland, overcooked dish, with no indication that any thought or effort had been put into its preparation. The service was also subpar. The waitstaff seemed undertrained and disorganized, with several orders being mixed up and delivered to the wrong tables. Hoping to salvage my stay, I decided to participate in one of the advertised activities – a \\"guided nature hike\\" in the nearby area. To my dismay, the experience was far from enjoyable. The supposedly \\"experienced\\" guide seemed uninformed and unprepared, getting us lost on more than one occasion. Furthermore, certain parts of the trail had not been maintained, resulting in a slippery and unsafe hiking experience. By the end of my stay at John's Riverside Retreat, I felt more stressed and discontented than when I arrived. Between the lack of cleanliness, poor customer service, dismal amenities, and overall disarray, I cannot recommend this establishment to anyone. As a seasoned traveler, I highly advise potential visitors to look elsewhere for a more fulfilling and enjoyable experience. John's Riverside Retreat is regrettably a disaster, and one that should be avoided at all costs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Though someone voluntarily gave the money, it might be with specific expectations or stipulations governing its use. 4. Assessment of expenditure: The statement suggests that the money might be wasted on windfalls. Without understanding the context of this expenditure, it is hard to determine if this is a fair assessment. For example, what one person deems an irresponsible spending decision, another person might view as a worthy investment depending on their perspectives, values, and priorities. Conclusively, the statement \\"The money might, after all, be wasted on windfalls\\" cannot be viewed as substantial evidence that \\"The money had been given voluntarily.\\" The two concepts are not mutually inclusive.

Answer:","output":"The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (French: Déclaration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen) is a fundamental document of the French Revolution, defining the individual and collective rights of all human beings and citizens. It was adopted on August 26, 1789, by the National Constituent Assembly (Assemblée nationale constituante), which was the transitional legislative body during the early stages of the French Revolution. The Declaration was heavily influenced by the works of prominent philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the principles of the Enlightenment. The creation of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen involved multiple key figures who contributed to its conception, drafting, and adoption. Some of these influential figures include: 1. Marquis de Lafayette: A French military officer, visionary, and ardent advocate of American independence, Lafayette played an instrumental role in drafting the Declaration. He was inspired by the American Declaration of Independence and Thomas Jefferson's writings, who also had an indirect influence on Lafayette's draft. 2. Abbé Sieyès: As a leading intellectual and political writer, Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès was a critical member of the National Constituent Assembly. He played a vital role in shaping the course of the Revolution and promoted the idea of fundamental rights for all citizens. 3. Jean-Jacques Rousseau: A prominent philosopher of the Enlightenment, Rousseau's works, particularly 'The Social Contract,' were influential in shaping the principles behind the Declaration. His ideas about the sovereignty of the people and the need for a social contract between the rulers and the governed fueled the revolutionary movement in France. 4. Montesquieu: Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu, was another influential Enlightenment philosopher whose ideas about the separation of powers and checks and balances in government had a profound impact on the development of the Declaration. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen included seventeen articles that established universal individual rights such as equality before the law, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the right to property. Apart from asserting these rights, it also outlined the responsibility of the government to protect and uphold them. In summary, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was a collective effort of various prominent figures from the French Revolution.

OK, so I know of this movie because of a friend of mine's in it and I actually visited the set when they were filming, so from a personal stand-point, I was intrigued to finally view this obscure little gem. If you dig at all on info regarding this movie, you'll find it's mired in legal troubles (even over 7 years after being filmed) so, if you are at all like me -- then you'll do whatever it takes to obtain a copy. My source? Ebay. About 15 but I felt ripped because when I got it today in the mail, it was a very rough, grainy copy of a \\"SCREENER ONLY\\" release, complete with annoying top mini time-code but alas, I could still enjoy it but not as much as if I had a proper copy, something I suggest you obtain if you want the full impact this film may or may not have on you. From what I have gleaned, it's been released on DVD in Germany & now Spain. With that, good luck & happy searching/bidding...;). The score/sndtrk is worth it alone. Very eclectic and varied (somethinbg rare these days IMHO in film) -- I think that will be my next sndtrk/score to locate, but I digress...  Now, onto the review. The film opens as Billy Zane's character is injecting a nurse in the mental ward he is apparently locked up in. He steals her clothes (even shoes) and quickly moves into a series of holding up a bank/loan shop but after escaping with the loot, well, I guess this is where the \\"plot\\" begins -- he inadvertently looses it. After perpetrating several campy over-the-top crimes & dalliances to various A to C-list celebs to locate the money, he finds himself somehow in a cemetery where a funeral -- I think for the dead guy he shoots in the loan office/bank, and -- even with 1950's police cars and cops looking all over for him steadily throughout -- he never gets seen or nabbed. (He sees daily newspapers reporting his \\"crimes\\") This I liked, because it gave the thin plot an extension. After all, it's a MOVIE (see: fiction) & director Iris Iliopulos does what I think is everything possible to 1) Bring Wood's vision to fruition and 2) Give it an updated feel, yet have shots of authentic 50's police cars intertwined with, ahh, local L.A..99 stores -- so well hence my 9 rating. If the period and props were authentic -- I would have given it a 10. Now it wraps it self up kinda weird and I won't spoil it for anyone but let's just say the final ending is somewhat disappointing for it, to me, it had promise, action and comedy -- all up till the end, so...with ALL that said --locate a copy at your own discretion. Just realize that, as there is no dialouge (except for some narration and singing) this may be up your alley -- maybe not-- but I definitely think it's worth a watch. The actors all do fine performances and it's only the inconsistency in proper period pieces that really made me long for just that correction -- then I would say by all means check this film out for it's not like anything these studios put out these days (or will in the future, too) I am sure. What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is mostly positive with some minor criticisms. The reviewer seems to have enjoyed the movie overall, praising the score/soundtrack, the performances of the actors, and the director's attempt to bring Wood's vision to life with an updated feel. They appreciated the humor, action, and the decision to keep the dialogue minimal. The reviewer's main criticisms are concerning the inconsistency in proper period pieces and the disappointing ending. Despite these issues, the reviewer still recommends the film as something worth watching and different from what major studios typically produce. They gave the movie a 9/10 rating, stating they would have given it a perfect score if the period and props had been more authentic."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An aftershock is a smaller earthquake that follows larger earthquake, in the same area of the main shock, caused as the displaced crust adjusts to the effects of the main shock. Large earthquakes can have hundreds to thousands of instrumentally detectable aftershocks, which steadily decrease in magnitude and frequency according to known laws. In some earthquakes the main rupture happens in two or more steps, resulting in multiple main shocks. These are known as doublet earthquakes, and in general can be distinguished from aftershocks in having similar magnitudes and nearly identical seismic waveforms. What's the best answer to this question: can an aftershock be stronger than an earthquake? Options are: [a]. no. [b]. yes....A:","output":"[b]. yes. An aftershock can be stronger than the initial earthquake. Although it doesn't happen very often, there are instances when aftershocks can surpass the main earthquake in magnitude. When this occurs, seismologists may reclassify the initial earthquake as a foreshock, and the aftershock becomes the new mainshock. This can happen because the entire fault line may not have ruptured during the first event, and the accumulated stress may trigger a more powerful event afterward. In most cases, however, aftershocks are smaller and less intense than the main earthquake, as stated in the given information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: featured image of wasp are industry a shelter built from people","output":"In the given sentence, the most important words are \\"featured image\\", \\"wasp\\", \\"industry\\", \\"shelter\\", and \\"people\\". Let's analyze the importance of each word: 1. Featured Image: The term \\"featured image\\" refers to the main or key visual element associated with the content. It is a way to catch the attention of the reader, and provides an idea about the core subject matter. In this context, the featured image may be highlighting a wasp or the shelter, suggesting that the image is a central part of the narrative. 2. Wasp: This word refers to a type of insect that is typically known for its slender body, narrow waist, and stinging ability. In the sentence, the wasp is the primary subject, providing context for what the featured image focuses on. It is also possible that the wasp plays a vital role in the industry or process related to the shelter built by people. 3. Industry: \\"Industry\\" refers to the economic sector, process, or trade that is associated with the manufacturing or production of a specific good or service. In this sentence, the industry could be related to the way shelters are built, or it could represent an area or field where people study wasps. Either way, it's a crucial component that adds context and importance to the situation. 4. Shelter: A \\"shelter\\" is a place or structure providing protection from weather, danger, or other environmental factors. In this context, the shelter is built by people, possibly integrating or utilizing the wasp (or some elements associated with the wasp) as a part of its structure or function. This could reflect an innovative or bio-inspired architectural or design concept. 5. People: \\"People\\" refers to human beings who are involved in the process or context being described in the sentence. In this case, it is the people who built the shelter, perhaps using the wasp or wasp-related elements as inspiration or for functional benefits. This word establishes the human connection to the topic, emphasizing the relevance to our lives. The other words in the sentence, such as \\"of,\\" \\"are,\\" \\"a,\\" and \\"from,\\" are function words that provide grammatical structure and organization. These words are important for understanding the grammatical relationships between the content words, but their significance is more limited compared to the key words identified above."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think of extra-thick french fries, and you'll have the right idea of the size needed. Place on folded paper towels and cover with more paper towels.","output":"Gently press down on the tofu sticks with the paper towels to absorb the excess moisture, being careful not to break or crumble the fragile pieces. Allow the tofu to rest for about 10 minutes so that the paper towels can absorb even more moisture, ensuring that the tofu cooks evenly and crisply when fried. While the tofu is resting, prepare the batter or coating by mixing together flour, cornstarch, and spices such as garlic powder, paprika, and black pepper (and salt, if desired) in a medium-sized bowl. This step will help add texture and flavor to the tofu sticks, making them even more enjoyable to eat. To further enhance the flavor, consider adding additional ingredients like finely chopped herbs, grated parmesan, or nutritional yeast. Whip up a simple, light, and smooth batter by gradually adding ice-cold water to the dry ingredients, mixing gently but thoroughly until the desired consistency is reached - not too thick or too runny. Next, prepare the frying station by pouring a suitable frying oil (such as vegetable or peanut oil) to a depth of about 1-2 inches in a heavy-bottomed pan, like a cast iron skillet or a deep fryer. Make sure the oil is hot enough by heating it to around 350-375°F (175-190°C); this can be measured by using a deep-fry thermometer. Alternatively, you can test the oil temperature by carefully dropping a small piece of batter into it. If the oil sizzles and the batter floats up to the surface within a few seconds, it should be hot enough. Now that the oil is hot and the tofu has had time to rest, begin by dipping one tofu stick at a time into the batter. Ensure that all sides of the tofu are evenly coated with a thin layer of the mixture. Then, gently lower the battered tofu stick into the hot oil using heat-resistant tongs or a slotted spoon. Do not overcrowd the frying pan, as this can cause the tofu to stick together and the oil temperature to drop, leading to uneven cooking and a greasy final product. Fry the tofu sticks in small batches, turning them occasionally to achieve a uniform, golden-brown crust on all sides. This process should take about 2-3 minutes per batch, depending on the thickness of the sticks and the temperature of the oil. Once the tofu sticks are fried to perfection, use a slotted spoon or tongs to carefully lift them from the oil, allowing any excess oil to drip back into the pan. Place the cooked tofu sticks onto a paper towel-lined plate or a cooling rack to drain any residual oil and to keep them crisp while you finish cooking the remaining batches. Finally, while the fried tofu sticks are still hot, season them with a sprinkle of salt or any additional desired spices for added flavor. Serve your fried tofu sticks immediately, alongside your favorite dipping sauces such as ketchup, sweet chili sauce, or a creamy vegan garlic aioli. These delicious, crispy, and satisfying fried tofu sticks are an excellent alternative to traditional french fries, making them a perfect appetizer or side dish that everyone can enjoy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor.

Sentence 2: Topkape now lies in ruins and that is why it was abandoned.   If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"The first sentence states that Sultan Abdul Mecit moved into the newly built Dolmabahce Palace in 1853, and by 1909, Topkapi Palace was completely abandoned. It gives us information about the timeline of the abandonment of Topkapi Palace, as well as the reason for its abandonment, which is due to the move to Dolmabahce Palace. The second sentence states that Topkapi Palace now lies in ruins and that is why it was abandoned. This sentence provides a different reason for its abandonment, attributing the cause to its ruined state. Now, to determine the truth of the second sentence, it is important to understand the historical context and condition of Topkapi Palace. Topkapi Palace, built in the 15th century, served as the main residence of the Ottoman sultans for almost 400 years. While it is true that Sultan Abdul Mecit moved to Dolmabahce Palace in 1853 and that Topkapi Palace was abandoned by 1909, attributing the abandonment solely to the palace being in ruins is not entirely accurate.  The move from Topkapi Palace to Dolmabahce Palace was mostly due to a desire for a more modern and lavish palace that represented the evolving tastes and ambitions of the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century. Dolmabahce Palace was built with a European architectural style, symbolizing the empire's growing interest in Western influences. Though it is true that Topkapi Palace was in need of maintenance and some structures may have been in disrepair at the time, one cannot definitively say that the entire palace was in ruins. After the Turkish Republic was founded in 1923, Topkapi Palace was converted into a museum, and extensive restoration work began to preserve and restore its historic structures. Today, Topkapi Palace stands as a key tourist site and an important representation of Turkey's history and Ottoman heritage. Given this context, while the second sentence might have an element of truth in pointing out the decayed state of some structures, it is not entirely accurate to say that Topkapi Palace lies in ruins as the sole reason for its abandonment. We can conclude that while the first sentence is true, the second sentence is only partially true at best, as it oversimplifies the reasons for the abandonment of Topkapi Palace."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Sousveillance is the recording of an activity by a participant in the activity, typically by way of small wearable or portable personal technologies. The term \\"sousveillance\\", coined by Steve Mann, stems from the contrasting French words \\"sur\\", meaning \\"above\\", and \\"sous\\", meaning \\"below\\", i.e. \\"surveillance\\" denotes the \\"eye-in-the-sky\\" watching from above, whereas \\"sousveillance\\" denotes bringing the camera or other means of observation down to human level, either physically (mounting cameras on people rather than on buildings), or hierarchically (ordinary people doing the watching, rather than higher authorities or architectures doing the watching).  - The Corps of Royal Marines (RM) is the United Kingdom's amphibious light infantry force, forming part of the Naval Service, along with the Royal Navy. The Royal Marines were formed in 1755 as the Royal Navy's infantry troops. However, the marines can trace their origins back to the formation of the English Army's \\"Duke of York and Albany's maritime regiment of Foot\\" at the grounds of the Honourable Artillery Company on 28 October 1664.  - The Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1537 by King Henry VIII and is considered one of the oldest military organisations in the world. Today it is a registered charity whose purpose is to attend to the \\"better defence of the realm\\", this purpose is primarily achieved by the support of the HAC Regiment and a detachment of Special Constabulary to the City of London Police. The word \\"artillery\\" in \\"Honourable Artillery Company\\" does not have the current meaning that is generally associated with it, but dates from a time when in the English language that word meant any projectile, including for example arrows shot from a bow. The equivalent form of words in modern English would be either \\"Honourable Infantry Company\\" or \\"Honourable Military Company.\\"  - Behavior is the range of actions and mannerisms made by individuals, organisms, systems, or artificial entities in conjunction with themselves or their environment, which includes the other systems or organisms around as well as the (inanimate) physical environment. It is the response of the system or organism to various stimuli or inputs, whether internal or external, conscious or subconscious, overt or covert, and voluntary or involuntary.  - The 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group is a Royal Marines unit of the British Armed Forces . The unit resources include communications , information operations , information systems , intelligence , surveillance , and Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance ( ISTAR ) . It is a redesignation of the former brigade headquarters battalion , the UK Landing Force Command Support Group , which was previously known as HQ & Signals Squadron RM. The unit 's title harks back to the original 30 Commando ( which in turn became 30 Assault Unit RM ) , formed in 1942 . This unit was tasked to move ahead of advancing Allied forces , or to undertake covert infiltrations into enemy territory by land , sea or air , to capture much needed intelligence , in the form of codes , documents , equipment or enemy personnel . In 2013 , 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group were granted the freedom of Littlehampton , West Sussex , in honour of the original unit being based in the town during the Second World War .  - The Crown dependencies are three territories of the United Kingdom: the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea, and the Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey in the English Channel. Being independently administered jurisdictions, they do not form part of either the United Kingdom or the British Overseas Territories. They are self-governing possessions of the Crown (defined uniquely in each jurisdiction). Internationally, the dependencies are considered \\"territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible\\" rather than as sovereign states. As a result, they are not member states of the Commonwealth of Nations. However, they do have a relationship with the Commonwealth, the European Union, and other international organisations and are members of the BritishIrish Council. They are not part of the European Union (EU), although they are within the EU's customs area.  - The British Armed Forces form the military of the United Kingdom, tasked with defence of the country, its overseas territories, and the Crown dependencies. They also promote the UK's wider interests, support international peacekeeping efforts, and provide humanitarian aid.  - The English Army existed while England was an independent state and was at war with other states, but it was not until the Interregnum and the New Model Army (raised by Parliament to defeat the Royalists in the English Civil War) that England acquired a peacetime professional standing army. At the restoration of the monarchy, Charles II kept a small standing army, formed from elements of the Royalist army in exile and elements of the New Model Army, from which the most senior regular regiments of today's British Army can trace their antecedence. Likewise, Royal Marines can trace their origins back to the formation of the English Army's \\"Duke of York and Albany's maritime regiment of Foot\\" at the grounds of the Honourable Artillery Company on 28 October 1664.  - Postal interception is the act of retrieving another person's mail for the purpose of ensuring that the mail is not delivered to the recipient, or to spy on them.  - The military, also called the armed forces, are forces authorized to use deadly force, and weapons, to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state. The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, food production and banking.  - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Light infantry (or skirmishers) are soldiers whose job was to provide a skirmishing screen ahead of the main body of infantry, harassing and delaying the enemy advance. Light infantry was distinct from medium, heavy or line infantry. Heavy infantry were dedicated primarily to fighting in tight formations that were the core of large battles. Light infantry fought in open-order, often in close co-ordination with heavy infantry, where they could screen the heavy infantry from harassing fire, and the heavy infantry could intervene to protect the light infantry from attacks of enemy heavy infantry or cavalry. Heavy infantry originally had heavier arms and more armour than light infantry, but this distinction was lost as the use of armour declined and gunpowder weapons became standardized.  - Humanitarian aid is material and logistic assistance to people in need. It is usually short-term help until the long-term help by government and other institutions replaces it. Among the people in need belong homeless, refugees, victims of natural disasters, wars and famines. The primary purpose of humanitarian aid is to save lives, reduce suffering and respect to human dignity. Humanitarian aid is material or logistical assistance provided for humanitarian purposes, typically in response to humanitarian crises including natural disasters and man-made disaster. The primary objective of humanitarian aid is to save lives, alleviate suffering, and maintain human dignity. It may therefore be distinguished from development aid, which seeks to address the underlying socioeconomic factors which may have led to a crisis or emergency.  - Peacekeeping refers to activities intended to create conditions that favor lasting peace. Research generally finds that peacekeeping reduces civilian and battlefield deaths and reduces the risk of renewed warfare.  - Surveillance (or ) is the monitoring of the behavior, activities, or other changing information, usually of people for the purpose of influencing, managing, directing, or protecting them. This can include observation from a distance by means of electronic equipment (such as CCTV cameras), or interception of electronically transmitted information (such as Internet traffic or phone calls); and it can include simple, no- or relatively low-technology methods such as human intelligence agents and postal interception. The word \\"\\" comes from a French phrase for \\"watching over\\" (\\"sur\\" means \\"from above\\" and \\"veiller\\" means \\"to watch\\"), and is in contrast to more recent developments such as sousveillance.  - The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service.  - A troop is a military sub-subunit, originally a small formation of cavalry, subordinate to a squadron. In many armies a troop is the equivalent element to the infantry section or platoon. Exceptions are the Royal Horse Artillery and the US Cavalry, where troops are subunits that compare to an infantry company or artillery battery.   - Internet traffic is the flow of data across the Internet.

Fed up with her dead-end job with a Minneapolis car rental agency, Martha quits, cashes her final paycheck, and uses the money to purchase an airline ticket to the least expensive international destination she can find - London. At the airport, she meets Daniel, a successful music label executive, who covertly arranges for her to be upgraded to First Class and seated next to him on the flight. When she sells the ticket to another passenger and Daniel finds his seatmate is an obnoxiously loud woman instead of the girl of his dreams, he moves back to the Economy section and takes the vacant seat next to Martha. Before landing in London, he offers her the use of a deluxe suite in a luxury hotel at his company's expense in exchange for a lunch date the following day. Through a series of flashbacks and flashforwards, we learn Laurence, a former bridge champion who now teaches the game to wealthy women, went to the airport to pick up Daniel but missed him because the flight landed early. Instead, he literally runs into Martha, who hits him with a luggage cart while searching for the exit. She coerces him into taking her into the city and invites him to the suite for dinner. While she is in the bathroom, a bouquet of flowers from Daniel is delivered to the suite, and when Laurence sees the attached card, he departs without explanation.

Following the accession of James VII in 1685, Bruce gradually fell from favour, and was distrusted by the new regime. After the Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William of Orange as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years. Bruce was imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle again in 1708 and was only released a short time before his death, at the beginning of 1710.He was buried in the family mausoleum at Kinross Kirk. The ruins of the church still stand beside Kinross House, the mausoleum remains intact in the churchyard. Dating from 1675 it is probably by William Bruce in design, initially to house his parents. Bruce's surviving account books show purchases of books on music, painting and horticulture, as well as numerous foreign-language works, suggesting that William Bruce was a learned man. He studied horticulture extensively, and applied his knowledge of the subject in his own gardens at Kinross.

Answer this question: ooga chaka ooga ooga guardians of the galaxy??","output":"The phrase \\"ooga chaka ooga ooga\\" mentioned in the context of \\"Guardians of the Galaxy\\" refers to a memorable scene from the 2014 Marvel Studios film, directed by James Gunn. This movie, which is part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), is an action-packed and humorous superhero film featuring a group of unlikely and diverse heroes who form the team known as the Guardians of the Galaxy. In the opening scene of the movie, the film's protagonist, Peter Quill (played by Chris Pratt), who later becomes known as Star-Lord, is seen exploring an abandoned planet. As he does so, he listens to music on an old Walkman cassette player with headphones, playing the song \\"Hooked on a Feeling\\" by the 1970s Swedish rock band, Blue Swede. The song, originally written by Mark James and first recorded by B.J. Thomas in 1968, was given a significant update by Blue Swede in their 1974 version – including the distinctive \\"ooga chaka\\" chant. The song became synonymous with Guardians of the Galaxy, as it was prominently featured in its promotional trailers and contributed greatly to the film's unique atmosphere. The Guardians of the Galaxy are a band of cosmic misfits, each with their own unique abilities and backgrounds. The team consists of: 1. Peter Quill (Star-Lord) - A human who was abducted from Earth as a child by alien bounty hunters. He grows up to become a skilled pilot, thief, and adventurer. 2. Gamora (played by Zoe Saldana) - A green-skinned, genetically enhanced assassin who is the adopted daughter of the supervillain Thanos. 3. Drax the Destroyer (played by Dave Bautista) - A physically powerful warrior from a species called the Kylosians, seeking revenge on Ronan the Accuser for the murder of his family. 4. Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) - A genetically and cybernetically enhanced raccoon with a strong affinity for weapons and a sarcastic attitude. 5. Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) - A sentient tree-like being with great strength and the ability to regenerate, whose vocabulary is limited to the phrase \\"I am Groot\\" in various inflections. The film follows the group as they come together, initially for selfish reasons, but later learn to work as a team to stop the main antagonist, Ronan the Accuser (played by Lee Pace), who is trying to acquire a powerful artifact known as the Orb. The Orb contains an Infinity Stone, which possesses immense destructive power and is sought after by Thanos himself. The group ultimately bonds over their shared sense of loss and desire to save the galaxy, thereby becoming true Guardians of the Galaxy. The inclusion of \\"Hooked on a Feeling\\" and its memorable \\"ooga chaka ooga ooga\\" intro created an instant connection with fans, who found the music choice and overall soundtrack to be as much a part of the Guardians of the Galaxy story as the characters themselves. The film was both critically acclaimed and financially successful, with a sequel, \\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,\\" released in 2017, and an upcoming third installment planned for the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Although it does not explicitly mention that the two stores are located next to each other, we can reasonably infer from the context that they are in close proximity, or at least within the same street scene. The second sentence simply rephrases this information, specifying that the leather goods store stands next to the Hair and Wigs store. This interpretation aligns with the given information from the original sentence. So, it can be regarded as a true statement, as it does not introduce any inaccuracies or contradict the information provided in the initial sentence. However, it's important to note that the second sentence adds the assumption that the stores are located directly next to each other, which is an inference based on the described scene; the original sentence might not imply that the stores are immediately adjacent.

Q:Given the background: Hemophilia is the name of a group of hereditary diseases that affect the body's ability to control blood clotting. Hemophilia is caused by a lack of clotting factors in the blood. Clotting factors are normally released by platelets. Since people with hemophilia cannot produce clots, any cut can put a person at risk of bleeding to death. The risk of internal bleeding is also increased in hemophilia, especially into muscles and joints. This disease affected the royal families of Europe.  and the situation: Two twin sisters were taken to the doctor's office by their parents.

In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi touted the agreement in a letter to her Democratic colleagues, saying negotiators \\"fought for and achieved drastic reductions to the Trump/GOP plan,\\" including much less funding for the wall than Trump requested and a limit on the number of immigrants that can be...

The Apprentice reality TV star, 59, discussed the Slovenian model's appearance on shock jock Howard Stern's new K-Rock radio show yesterday (07DEC05), reports PageSix.com.      Trump says, \\"You know, they just blow up, right?      \\"Like a blimp - in the right places. In her case, the right places. I mean she really has become a monster - in all the right places.      \\"I mean monster in the most positive way. She has gotten very, very large - in all the right places.\\"      However, despite loving his wife's pregnancy shape, Trump says his crush on supermodel Heidi Klum has finished since she gave birth to her two kids LENI and HENRY.      Trump reveals, \\"I looked at her the other day, and it's off. There's no question.\\" ||||| Donald Trump informed the public almost a decade ago that he'd stopped crushing on Heidi Klum, but he brought her up again in an interview published over the weekend, and this time the supermodel talked back.      \\"Sometimes I do go a little bit far,\\" the presidential hopeful told the New York Times while discussing, among other things, how he gets away with outrageous comments. \\"Heidi Klum,\\" he added after a pause. \\"Sadly, she’s no longer a 10.\\"      Klum's name, however, wasn't just pulled out of thin air.

I mean she really has become a monster — in all the right places.\\"      He meant monster, he said, \\"in the most positive way.\\" But Klum, who at that point had given birth to two of her four children, apparently wasn't floating his boat anymore.      \\"I looked at her the other day, and it's off,\\" Trump told Stern, dissing his supposed crush. \\"There's no question.\\"      Alas, in 2005, social media wasn't what it is in 2015. But now it is 2015, so that's where Klum made her stand Monday, posting a video on Instagram in response to Trump's NYT comment.      In the video, Klum is rocking a T-shirt emblazoned with a paper \\"10,\\" wind machine going and everything, when someone in a cheesy Trump mask comes up behind her and rips off the number — only to reveal \\"9.99.\\" The supermodel shrugs it off, blasts a smile and goes on with her photo shoot.

Trump is the biggest gainer in the poll, up 6 points since July according to the first nationwide CNN/ORC poll since the top candidates debated in Cleveland on Aug. 6. Carson gained 5 points and Fiorina 4 points. Trump has also boosted his favorability numbers among Republicans and Republican-leaning voters, 58% have a favorable view of Trump now, that figure stood at 50% in the July survey.      These nationwide findings follow recent polling in Iowa and New Hampshire showing Trump also leads the Republican field in those two key early states.      Bush, who held the top spot in the field in most CNN/ORC polls on the race between last fall and Trump's entry into the race in June, has seen his favorability ratings drop alongside his standing in the contest. Overall, 56% hold an unfavorable view of the former Florida governor and 42% of Republican voters have a negative impression. That's an increase in negative views among all adults (up from 43% since July) and among Republican voters (up from 34% unfavorable).      While Kasich and Fiorina remain largely unknown nationally, those Republicans who do have an opinion of these two -- both widely seen as debate standouts -- tend to tilt positive. Fiorina has a 45% favorable to 11% unfavorable rating among Republican voters, with 43% unable to rate her, while Kasich's is 32% favorable to 20% unfavorable, with 49% unable to rate him.      The poll suggests those behind Trump love him: He holds a 98% favorability rating among his supporters. But those Republican voters who aren't supporting Trump are skeptical that he would help the party. Most Republicans (58%) say the party would have a better chance to win in 2016 with someone else at the top of the ticket, including 72% of those who don't currently back the businessman.      Still, Trump has quickly won the trust of Republican voters on several top issues. According to the poll, 45% say they trust Trump more than any other Republican candidate on the economy -- up 25 points since June, 44% say they trust Trump over the others on illegal immigration -- up 30 points since June -- and 32% trust him most to handle ISIS, no other candidate comes close on any of these issues.      JUST WATCHED Trump campaign defends immigration plan Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump campaign defends immigration plan 05:40      On the economy and illegal immigration, Trump is far and away the top choice even among those Republicans who support someone else for the nomination (33% who say they will most likely vote for someone else say Trump is their most trusted on the economy, 29% say so on illegal immigration). Trump is also most trusted on social issues, 19% say he's their top choice to handle that. Bush follows at 15%.      On two of these issues, Trump is more trusted among conservative Republicans than among moderate Republicans: When it comes to both the economy and illegal immigration, 50% of conservatives say they trust Trump, compared with 35% among moderates on each of those issues.      The poll finds evidence of a slight gender gap in support for Trump, who has faced public questions recently about his treatment of women, though he does lead the field among both men and women. Trump stands at 27% among Republican men and at 20% among Republican women, a gap just outside the margin of error for each group.      Bush is second among both men and women, standing just a hair behind Trump at 17% among women but well behind among men (10% of GOP men back Bush, no other candidate reaches double digits).      Trump is less trusted by women to handle the economy (50% of male GOP voters say they trust Trump most, 40% of women voters do) and slightly less so on social issues (21% among men, 15% among women).      But there is no gender gap among Republicans on favorable views of Trump: 60% of Republican women voters have a positive impression as do 57% of GOP men. Outside the Republican Party, women are less apt to hold a favorable view of Trump, just 17% of women voters who are independents or Democratic leaners see him favorably, compared with 29% of non-Republican male voters.      JUST WATCHED New poll: Trump takes lead in Iowa, Walker drops Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH New poll: Trump takes lead in Iowa, Walker drops 02:00      There is also an education divide in Trump's support, with those Republican voters who lack college degrees more apt to back Trump than college graduates: 28% among the non-college graduate group vs. 16% among those who have graduated from college.      Few other demographic divides emerge in Republican preferences, according to the poll. Rand Paul fares best among voters under age 50, 10% among the younger group vs. 1% among the older one, and supporters of the Tea Party movement are more likely to favor Ted Cruz, 10% vs. 2% among those Republicans who do not support the tea party.      Among the most enthusiastic Republican voters, the mix of candidates at the top of the field changes. While Trump holds the top slot across the board with the support of roughly a quarter of Republican voters regardless of their level of enthusiasm, the group of candidates following Trump shifts among those who say they are \\"extremely enthusiastic\\" about the election. In that group, Carson has 13%, Rubio 11%, boosting both ahead of Bush, who holds 9% and ties with Cruz for 4th, Kasich holds 8% support and Fiorina and Walker tie at 7%.      Bush has his best showing among those who are least enthusiastic. Among the group that says they are somewhat enthusiastic or less, 23% back Trump, 16% Bush, 10% Walker, with all others at 6% or less.      The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone Aug. 13-16 among a random national sample of 1,001 adults. The sample included 466 registered voters who are Republicans or independents who lean toward the Republican Party. For results among those Republican voters, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. For results among the full sample, it is 3 points. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"In 2005, Donald Trump made comments about his then-pregnant wife Melania, comparing her expanding waistline to a blimp, in a radio show interview with Howard Stern.

Fast forward to 2015, Trump revisited his comments on Klum in a New York Times article, remarking that \\"sadly, she's no longer a 10.\\" Klum responded to Trump's comment through a playful Instagram video, seemingly shrugging off his remarks.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person whose paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance? is inside the article: Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral...., can you guess it ?

Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.”  Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier.

This law has since been modified to require three-point seat belts in outboard-seating positions, and finally three-point seat belts in all seating positions. Initially, seat belt use was voluntary.

Q:The young man (boy, really) played with his fingers in the garish light cast from the lone bulb in the concrete bunker. He scratched at an imaginary itch on his right hand (just below his thumb) to take his mind off the man in the lab coat who sat across from him at the beaten, scarred, wood table. It didn't work. And whoever this man in the lab coat was, he was insistent about paperwork. He had three inches clipped onto a weathered clipboard which he flipped through with precision. \\"Can I offer you a glass of water?\\" asked the boy's captor in a calm, sensitive tenor. The boy, Kurt, continued to scratch the imaginary itch, which had leapt magically from his right hand to the left. Eventually the falseness of the itch would be deduced, and the lab coated man would disappear out of the cell and return with... God knows what. He had seen torture hundreds-if not thousands-of times on TV, and he was glumly certain that there would be no commercial breaks for him. \\"Can I offer you a glass of water?\\" The question was repeated without urgency, like a forgetful waiter. The itch now leaped with the dexterity of a trained flea onto the boy's leg, and the dutiful fingers followed. He watched as the man in the lab coat, without name tag or company insignia, studied his stack of papers attached to the clipboard. Several yellow forms near the top half inch were labeled 27B. The man frowned and wrote a note on the top page. \\"Note: Find out who isn't duplicating 27B in Pink.\\" \\"I'm sorry,\\" he said, \\"I wasn't listening.

Dawn's younger sister, 8-year-old Missy, is a spoiled, manipulative little girl who pesters Dawn and dances around the house in a tutu. Their mother is a shrewd woman who always dotes on Missy and sides with her in disputes with Dawn. Their father is a meek, immature, selfish man who sides with Dawn's mother in arguments with Dawn. Mark is the only one in the family who is even remotely friendly or respectful to Dawn and even that isn't saying a whole lot. Dawn's only friend is an effeminate fifth-grade boy named Ralphy, with whom she shares a dilapidated clubhouse in her backyard. At school, Dawn is verbally bullied by literally every student she comes into contact with. She is teased and ridiculed and her locker is covered in graffiti. After her teacher unfairly keeps her after school, she is threatened with rape by a bully named Brandon McCarthy, who also has trouble socializing. At home, Dawn's mother punishes her for calling Missy a lesbian and refusing to be nice to her (the same verbal way that other students at the school call Dawn). Dawn is suspended for three days after she accidentally hits a teacher in the eye with a spitball. She refuses to tell her parents or the school principal about the bullying, aware that it will only lead to worse bullying for herself.

Question: A court case with a tough judging might result in what? Options:  A. being judged  B. responsibility  C. go to jail  D. feeling guilty  E. killing A:","output":"A court case with a tough judging might result in a combination of outcomes from the given options. The primary consequences of a tough judging would be Option A: being judged and Option B: responsibility. This is because a strict judging process ensures that the legal proceedings are thoroughly assessed and analyzed. The individuals involved in the case would experience an intense examination to determine their legal responsibilities and how they should be held accountable for their actions. Other possible outcomes, such as Option C: going to jail, could be a specific consequence of responsibility depending on the nature of the case and the charges being levied against the person. If found guilty, the individual could be sentenced to prison as a result of their actions. Option D: feeling guilty may be a psychological outcome experienced by the parties involved in the court case. While guilt is not a direct result of a tough judging, it might emerge as a response to the realization of one's actions and their consequences. The level of guilt an individual experiences would vary based on the circumstances and their emotional state. Option E: killing is an extreme and unlikely outcome resulting from a tough judging in a court case. While violence or other adverse consequences might arise in very rare and specific circumstances (e.g., if the court case were related to organized crime), this is not a typical result, and it does not align with common sense. In conclusion, a court case with a tough judging will generally result in being judged and the assignment of responsibility to the involved parties. Depending on the specific charges and case, this may lead to other outcomes like going to jail or feeling guilty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"recycling reduces what when making something?\\" is \\"pollution\\", given that  recycling reduces pollution when making something? Choices: (I). Yes; (II). No;","output":"(I). Yes Recycling does indeed reduce pollution when making something, making \\"pollution\\" the right answer to the question. Recycling is the process of collecting, sorting, and processing waste materials into new products, as opposed to extracting raw materials and processing them to create new products. By recycling, we can significantly reduce pollution in several ways: 1. Energy conservation: Recycling saves a considerable amount of energy compared to manufacturing items from new, raw materials. Producing new materials, such as aluminum, glass, paper, or plastics, can be energy-intensive. Recycling these materials instead dramatically reduces the amount of energy required, thus curtailing pollution associated with energy production. 2. Greenhouse gas emissions reduction: The energy savings from recycling translates into fewer greenhouse gas emissions. Many recycling processes produce far fewer greenhouse gas emissions compared to those associated with new, raw material production. This, in turn, helps combat climate change and its related consequences. 3. Air and water pollution reduction: Manufacturing processes that rely on new raw materials often involve the release of pollutants into the air, discharging chemical-laden water, and emitting other contaminants into the environment. Recycling mitigates the need for these processes, which directly results in reduced pollution levels. 4. Resource preservation: Extracting and processing raw materials consumes natural resources such as forests, water reserves, and mineral deposits. Recycling allows us to reuse these materials and relieves pressure on non-renewable resources, preserving them for future generations. 5. Waste reduction: Recycling reduces the amount of waste that goes to landfills or gets incinerated. Landfills can contaminate the air and groundwater, while incineration releases toxic gases and other pollutants. By recycling more waste, we reduce the environmental impact of both landfilling and incineration. In conclusion, recycling plays a critical role in reducing pollution at various stages of product manufacturing. While it is essential to recognize that recycling is not a one-size-fits-all solution to pollution, it still offers a valuable means to lessen our overall environmental impact. Additionally, promoting recycling initiatives and supporting sustainable manufacturing practices can help encourage further pollution reduction on a global scale."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Process:  - The saliva breaks down the chemicals in the food a bit, which helps make the food mushy and easy to swallow - Your tongue helps out, pushing the food around while you chew with your teeth - The esophagus moves food from the back of your throat to your stomach - Strong muscles in the walls of the stomach and gastric juices break down food in your stomach - Your stomach moves the food into the intestines to complete digestion -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person is dehydrated happens, how will it affect more digestion occurs.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of dehydration can have an indirect effect on the digestion process. I will explain the effects step-by-step: 1. Saliva production: Dehydration can lead to a decrease in saliva production. Since saliva is essential in the initial breakdown of food and in making the food easier to swallow, reduced saliva can make it harder for food to be broken down and swallowed properly. 2. Swallowing: With less saliva, swallowing may become difficult and less efficient. This can result in the food not being fully prepared for the next stages of digestion. 3. Esophagus function: Dehydration can affect the proper functioning of the esophagus muscles. This may slow down the movement of food from the back of the throat to the stomach, resulting in a delayed or less efficient digestion process. 4. Stomach function: Dehydration can cause the stomach lining to produce less gastric juice, which is necessary for the breakdown of food. This may result in incomplete digestion, leading to discomfort and indigestion. 5. Intestinal function: Dehydration affects the absorption of water and electrolytes in the intestines. This can cause an imbalance in the normal processes of the digestive system, leading to constipation or diarrhea, depending on the severity of the dehydration. In conclusion, dehydration can have indirect effects on the digestion process by affecting various stages, from saliva production to intestinal function. Proper hydration is essential for maintaining optimal digestive health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If \\"A man wearing an orange t-shirt and a hard hat is working with the wood-chipping machine.\\", does this mean that \\"There are people who are very busy in the backyard.\\"?","output":"Based on the statement \\"A man wearing an orange t-shirt and a hard hat is working with the wood-chipping machine,\\" we can make some inferences about the situation, but we cannot definitively conclude that \\"There are people who are very busy in the backyard.\\" Let's try to analyze the given information and explore the possibilities. First, let's focus on the man. He is wearing an orange t-shirt and a hard hat, which indicates that he might be a worker engaged in some manual labor or construction-related work. The hard hat is a specific piece of safety equipment often used in construction sites or hazardous work areas to protect the wearer's head from possible injuries. This suggests that the man is taking necessary safety precautions while working, emphasizing that his work might involve certain risks. Second, we know that the man is working with a wood-chipping machine. A wood-chipping machine is a piece of equipment commonly used in forestry, landscaping, and construction industries to reduce wood (such as tree branches, limbs, and trunks) into smaller wood chips. This method of processing is a time-saving and efficient way to handle wood, particularly when dealing with large amounts of it. This information implies that the man could be working on a project that involves cutting or removing trees, clearing land, or handling wood material in some capacity. Now, let's try to address the latter part of the assumption: \\"There are people who are very busy in the backyard.\\" While it is possible that this work is taking place in a backyard, we do not have enough information from the given statement to know for sure. The wood-chipping work could also be occurring in a public park, a construction site, or any other location where tree or wood handling is required. Additionally, the statement only mentions one person – the man wearing an orange t-shirt and a hard hat – and we cannot determine whether there are other people present or if they are busy working as well. It is possible that the man is the only person operating the wood-chipping machine, or he may be part of a larger team working together. In conclusion, while we can deduce some information about the man's work and infer that he may be engaged in some labor-intensive task related to wood handling, we cannot definitively confirm that \\"There are people who are very busy in the backyard.\\" To make this conclusion, we would need more context and information about the location of the work and the presence of other people involved in the project."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Sugar--free beets that still taste sweet, tastier tomatoes and brighter-colored fruits and vegetables that stay ripe longer are all foods that are being grown now. How can they carry traits, such as being tastier, brighter, and riper? They are genetically engineered. Genetic engineering is like making a change in a recipe. For example, when you make cakes, you mix together all of the usual ingredients. If you add an extra ingredient, like salt, the cakes will taste differently. Genes are ingredients in the recipe for life. They carry the traits of living things. Your genes dictate what color hair and eyes you'll have, how tall you'll be, as well as many other traits. Genes carry traits for plants, too. By adding genes to a plant, you can sometimes create new traits. For example, adding a certain gene to a potato plant can make the potato plant distasteful to bugs . This makes some farmers happy because they don't have to use chemicals to keep bugs away from their plants. It sounds great, but some people are opposed to the idea of food that is genetically engineered. Ronnie Cummins, from the Campaign for Food Safety, is against it. He says that one of the major concerns is allergies . Supermarkets don't always label foods that are genetically engineered. A customer could unknowingly buy food that has an added gene from another plant that he or she is allergic to. It could be dangerous. Gary Burton from Monsanto, a seed company that engineers food, disagrees. He says his company tests for allergies. Burton believes that genetic engineering is a valuable tool for making better food. The technology can help farmers use less insecticide and grow healthier crops. Burton thinks there are many advantages. But Cummins says that we just don't know what will happen in the future if we keep adding genes to foods. We could mistakenly create a monster. People have different opinions about genetic engineering. One side supports it and thinks it will only help us. The other side is opposed to playing with nature and fears...

Answer the following question: Process:  - A hurricane usually starts as an organized thunderstorm activity that stretches at least 100 miles across and maintains its identity for more than 24 hours - Under the right conditions it can develop further and start to spin around a low-pressure center - If it develops it&#x27;s classified as a &#x27;tropical cyclone&#x27; or &#x27;tropical depression&#x27; - If the system strengthens and wind speeds rise past 39 mph, the system is dubbed a &#x27;tropical storm&#x27; - If the pressure in the center drops even further and the winds really pick up and forms a clearly defined &#x27;eye&#x27; it&#x27;s a hurricane -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a tropical storm develops further happens, how will it affect MORE POWERFUL hurricanes.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis refers to the idea that if a tropical storm develops further, it may have an effect on the formation and strength of more powerful hurricanes. To answer this question, let's break down the process step-by-step: 1. A tropical storm, as mentioned, starts as an organized thunderstorm activity under the right conditions and can develop into a tropical cyclone or tropical depression. 2. If the system strengthens and wind speeds rise past 39 mph, it becomes a tropical storm. 3. If the pressure in the center drops even further and a defined 'eye' forms, it's classified as a hurricane. Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis and its potential effects on more powerful hurricanes. 1. If a tropical storm develops further, the energy and atmospheric conditions in the surrounding area could be affected. This may lead to changes in the overall environment, which can impact the formation of more powerful hurricanes. 2. A stronger tropical storm could potentially use up a significant amount of heat energy from the ocean surface, which might reduce the available energy for subsequent storms to develop. 3. If the tropical storm intensifies into a hurricane, it could potentially impact the atmospheric conditions necessary for the formation of more powerful hurricanes. For example, it could alter wind patterns, create large-scale circulation disturbances, or modify the vertical temperature and humidity profile. 4. Indirectly, the perturbation could affect other aspects of the process, such as altering ocean currents or causing oceanic upwelling, which might affect the formation and strength of future hurricanes. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that when a tropical storm develops further, it can indeed have direct and indirect effects on the formation and strength of more powerful hurricanes. These effects might include altering atmospheric conditions, using up available energy, and impacting oceanic factors that contribute to hurricane formation and intensification."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Piranha 3DD Movie plot: A year after the massacre on Lake Victoria by prehistoric piranhas, an eradication campaign has left the lake uninhabitable, and the town itself has been largely abandoned as a result of the drying-up of the lake. Meanwhile, at Cross Lake, two farmers (Gary Busey and Clu Gulager) search the waters to recover the body of a dead cow. Piranha eggs that have been laid inside the cow hatch, and the farmers are killed by the swarm, but before they both die, one farmer pops out of the water, bites the head off one of the piranhas and spits it into the air before sinking back into the water. Maddy (Danielle Panabaker), a marine biology student, returns home for the summer to the waterpark she co-owns. She finds to her horror that the other co-owner, her step-father Chet (David Koechner), plans to add an adult-themed section to the waterpark with \\"water-certified strippers\\", and re-open it as \\"Big Wet\\". At a party at the waterpark that night, Maddy encounters several old acquaintances, including her policeman ex-boyfriend Kyle (Chris Zylka) and Barry (Matt Bush), who has secretly had a crush on her since grade school. She also runs into two of her close friends, Ashley (Meagan Tandy) and Shelby (Katrina Bowden). Shelby and her boyfriend Josh (Jean-Luc Bilodeau) go skinny-dipping in the lake, where a piranha makes its way inside her vagina.

Travis, handcuffed to the van during foreplay and unable to escape, is devoured while Ashley, on the roof of the van, calls for help. With no one around to hear her cries, the van sinks into the lake and she is eaten alive by the killer fish. The next day, Maddy is consoling Shelby about their missing friends.

Species in this family belong to the cryptobranch dorid nudibranchs , i.e. they are able to retract their gills into a gill pocket ( cryptobranch = hidden gills ) . Most are small and hard to identify . Most are thought to feed at night on sponges , while during the day they search for dark areas or remain hidden under rocks . One example of a discodoridid is the \`\` Pacific sea lemon '' or \`\` speckled sea lemon '' , Peltodoris nobilis , which occurs off the coast of British Columbia to Baja California from low - tide waters to a depth of about 200 m. Not only is this species yellow with a bumpy surface , but it also gives off a strong fruity citrus smell when handled , adding to its resemblance to a lemon .  - Doridacea is a taxonomic grouping of dorid nudibranchs, shell-less marine gastropod mollusks. included in the clade Euctenidiacea of the clade Nudibranchia.  - Doridoidea, commonly known as dorid nudibranchs (and previously known as the taxon Cryptobranchia), are a taxonomic superfamily of medium to large, shell-less sea slugs, marine gastropod mollusks in the clade Doridacea, included in the clade Nudibranchia.

Article: Believe it or not, oceans and seas are easy to be harmed by the development of human society. They are also influenced by man-made pollution easily. It is human beings that do great harm to the ocean ecosystems . The coral reefs are fine ecosystems that provide food and protection for many ocean creatures. The coral in almost all of the oceans is in danger from pollution.Chemicals from factories end up in the seas and oceans and destroy coral reefs. If the coral systems die some ocean creatures will be sure to die out. Protecting the ocean also has something to do with the protection of ocean wildlife like dolphins. The fishing industry depends on modern ways to catch many fish in order to earn more money. But the nets for fishing also _ other sea animals. The fishing boat workers are advised to check their nets and set other ocean animals free. But the boats are in a hurry to make money and often other ocean animals are caught with fish. Offshore oil spills  can destroy the ocean environment because oil kills all ocean life. The world depends on oil and because there is a great amount of oil off the shore of many countries, the need for oil is more important than the risk of the oil spill. However, the fact is that one human mistake can lead to an ocean environmental accident that will cause years of damage to the fine ocean ecosystems. Oil spills will kill all the creatures in the area of the spill. The oil will be washed up on shore and destroy the ecosystems along the shore including birds. Everyone who cares about the environment should be interested in protecting the ocean, and all of us should do something for the protection of the ocean. Question: Why do people continue to get oil in the sea at the risk of oil spills? Options: A: Because they believe the oil spill can be stopped. B: Because there is a large amount of oil in the sea. C: Because they are in great need of oil. D: Because getting oil in sea is easier than on land. Answer:","output":"The most accurate answer to why people continue to get oil from the sea despite the risk of oil spills is option C: \\"Because they are in great need of oil.\\" The text mentions that the world heavily relies on oil, suggesting a significant need for it. The reference to the vast amount of oil offshore further implies that this need prompts people to overlook the risks, including pollution and potential oil spill accidents, associated with extracting oil from underneath the sea. The text does not provide information supporting the other options. It does not suggest that people proceed with offshore drilling because they believe oil spills can be stopped (option A), because there is a large amount of oil in the sea (option B), or because acquiring oil from the sea is easier than on land (option D). Overall, it seems that an urgent and high demand for oil drives people to endure the potential environmental risks of offshore drilling."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Anouvong succeeded to the throne in 1805 upon the death his brother, Chao Inthavong, \\"Xaiya Setthathirath IV\\", who had succeeded their father, Phrachao Siribounyasan \\"Xaiya Setthathirath III\\". Anou was known by his father's regal number until recently discovered records disclosed that his father and brother had the same regal name.  - Thao Suranari ( Thai :  ) is the royally bestowed title of Lady Mo , ( also known as Ya Mo (  , \`\` Grandma Mo '' ) ( 1771 -- 1852 ) , who was the wife of the deputy governor of Nakhon Ratchasima ( Korat ) , the stronghold of Siamese control over its Laotian vassals . In 1826 Vientiane King Anouvong invaded Siam seeking complete independence . Anuvong 's forces seized the city of Nakhon Ratchasima by a ruse when the governor was away . The invaders evacuated the inhabitants , intending to resettle them in Laos . Lady Mo is credited with saving her people by harassing the enemy . Varying stories describe her either getting the invading soldiers drunk , or leading a rebellion of the prisoners on the way back to Vientiane . The generally accepted version is that , when the Lao invaders ordered the women to cook for them , Lady Mo requested knives so that food might be prepared . That night , when the invaders were asleep , she gave the knives to the imprisoned men . They surprised the Lao troops , who fled , and the prisoners escaped . Thai King Rama III soon sent an army in pursuit , led by General Sing Singhaseni (   ) . He defeated Anuvoung 's forces in three days of fighting and completely destroyed Anuvoung 's capital city of Vientiane . King Rama III awarded her the title Thao Suranari , ( or Lady Suranari -- \`\` the brave lady '' ) in recognition of her courageous acts . A statue of Thao Suranari stands in the centre of Nakhon Ratchasima , and is a popular object of devotion . A festival in her honour is held each year at the end of March and the beginning of April . The statue was designed by Phra Thewaphinimmit (  ) ( 1888 -- 1942 ) and sculpted by Silpa Bhirasri .

He succeeded his father, Rama II, as the King of Siam. His succession was unusual according to the traditions because Nangklao was a son of a concubine rather than a queen. His accession was perceived by foreign observers as having usurped the prior claim of Prince Mongkut, who was a legitimate son of Rama II born to a queen, Srisuriyendra. Under the old concept of Thai monarchy, however, a proper king must emulate Maha Sammata in that he must be \\"elected by the people.\\" Ironically, Prince Mongkut may have later contributed to this misconception, when he feared that his own accession might be perceived by foreign observers as a usurpation.  - A regnal name, or reign name, is a name used by some monarchs and popes during their reigns, and used subsequently to refer to them. The term is simply the adjective \\"regnal\\", of or relating to a reign, monarch, or kingdom, modifying \\"name\\". Since ancient times, monarchs have frequently, but not always, chosen to use a different name from their original name when they accede to the monarchy. The regnal name is usually followed by a regnal number (ordinal), usually written as a Roman numeral (VI rather than 6), to provide a unique identification for that monarch among other monarchs of that realm. In some cases, the monarch has more than one regnal name, but the regnal number is based on only one of those names, for example Charles X Gustav of Sweden, George Tupou V of Tonga. If a monarch reigns in more than one realm, he or she may carry different ordinals in each one, as they are each assigned chronologically, and some realms may have had different numbers of rulers of the same regnal name previously. For example, the same person was both King James I of England (along with Ireland) and King James VI of Scotland.  - Vientiane ( \\"Viang chan\\") is the capital and largest city of Laos, on the banks of the Mekong River near the border with Thailand. Vientiane became the capital in 1563 due to fears of a Burmese invasion, but ironically, the city was razed and looted to the ground in 1827 by the Siamese (Thai). Vientiane was the administrative capital during French rule and, due to economic growth in recent times, is now the economic centre of Laos.  - Phra Bat Somdet Phra Poramenthra Maha Mongkut Phra Chom Klao Chao Yu Hua, or Rama IV, known in English-speaking countries as King Mongkut (18 October 18041 October 1868), was the fourth monarch of Siam (Thailand) under the House of Chakri, ruling from 1851 to 1868.     Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'country of citizenship' with 'thailand'. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, several entities hold the relation 'country of citizenship' with 'Thailand'.  1. Thao Suranari (also known as Lady Mo or Ya Mo), the wife of the deputy governor of Nakhon Ratchasima, a stronghold of Siamese control over its Laotian vassals, was a Thai citizen. Known for her bravery during King Anouvong's invasion of Siam in 1826, she helped her people escape from the invading forces and was honored by King Rama III with the title Thao Suranari, meaning 'the brave lady'. 2. Nangklao or Rama III, who was the third monarch of Siam (now Thailand) under the House of Chakri, ruling from 21 July 1824 to 2 April 1851, was also a Thai citizen. Despite being a son of a concubine rather than a queen, Nangklao ascended to the throne following the death of his father, Rama II. 3. King Mongkut, or Rama IV, was another Thai citizen. Born Phra Bat Somdet Phra Poramenthra Maha Mongkut Phra Chom Klao Chao Yu Hua, he was the fourth monarch of Siam under the House of Chakri, ruling from 1851 to 1868. 4. Phra Thewaphinimmit, who designed the statue of Thao Suranari, and Silpa Bhirasri, who sculpted it, were likely citizens of Thailand, as they were involved in honoring an historically significant Thai figure. 5. Field Marshal Phibul Songkham, who led the Thai nationalist movement in the 1930s and possibly embellished the story of Thao Suranari to serve his nationalistic agenda, is also a Thai citizen.  Each of these entities, given their significant roles within the history, culture, and leadership of Thailand (historically Siam), would have held Thai citizenship."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: After a number of states have started a revolt against the leadership of the Miss America Organization headed by former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson, the national organization has terminated the licenses of four states and threatening another 15 with probation.      The rebellion ignited when a number of states said they were not happy with the way Carlson and CEO Regina Hopper ran the organization. It was also around the same time some of the state officials were unhappy with the elimination of the swimsuit competition — but officials say the revolt wasn’t because of that.      Although the organization went on a spree of revoking licenses, they did, however, thank the officials who supported them.st Miss America pageant without a swimsuit competition.      According to the Associated Press, Georgia, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania were among the states that were notified that their licenses have been revoked. A fourth state has also been added to that list, according to state officials, but it has not been revealed. As a result, these states will no longer be affiliated with the Miss America Organization. They must also turn over bank accounts with scholarship money to the national organization.      The states whose licenses were terminated have to find a replacement for their current leaders. They can request an appeal hearing from Miss America’s executive committee.      In August, former Miss America winners Suzette Charles (Miss America 1984) and Heather Whitestone (Miss America 1995) came forward to confirm Cara Mund’s (Miss America 2017) claims that Carlson, a former Miss America herself, bullied her and others. They called for her and Hopper to resign, along with 23 former Miss Americas. ||||| FILE – In this Sept. 10, 2017, file photo, Miss North Dakota Cara Mund reacts after being named Miss America during the Miss America 2018 pageant in Atlantic City, N.J.

The Miss America Organization is... (Associated Press)      ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — The other heel has dropped at the Miss America Organization, which had endured a revolt by dozens of states this summer against the national leadership of the pageant headed by former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson.      The crowning of the latest Miss America took place last month with the pageant's national leadership largely silent on the calls for their resignation from many states.      But now the national organization is undertaking a purge of rebellious state officials, terminating the licenses of four states, threatening about 15 with probation — and thanking others whose officials stood by the national leadership in the first Miss America pageant without a swimsuit competition.      States whose licenses are terminated must replace current leaders. They can request an appeal hearing from Miss America's executive committee.      The Miss America Organization would not say how it decided which states to terminate and which to threaten with probation, issuing a statement to The Associated Press that read, in its entirety, \\"The process regarding Miss America state licensees is confidential.\\"      State officials say their dissatisfaction stemmed not from the elimination of swimsuits, but by the way Carlson and CEO Regina Hopper ran the organization since taking over in January.      Georgia and West Virginia are among states that were notified in recent days that their state licenses are being terminated, Paul Perkins, a lawyer representing both states, told The Associated Press. And a Pennsylvania state pageant official, Chet Welch, confirmed his state has gotten a termination notice as well.      One other state also has been terminated, according to state officials and a former national board member, but its officials did not respond to messages seeking comment Monday.      Other states have been asked to explain — in writing — why they acted as they did in the run-up to the pageant.      \\"They are upset, but now they are scared, too,\\" said Jennifer Vaden Barth, a former national board member and a former Miss North Carolina. \\"This just validates why people are upset and why they felt the need to speak out in the first place.\\"      A state organization that has its license terminated can no longer claim to be affiliated with the Miss America Organization and must, among other things, turn over bank accounts with scholarship money to the national organization.      Vaden Barth formed a GoFundMe account called the Miss America Organization Leadership Change Fund that has raised over 22,000 to help states defend themselves and advocate for new leadership at the top.      When this year's pageant was held last month, 46 of the 51 state pageant organizations (the District of Columbia is included) had called on the two to resign, along with 23 former Miss Americas.      It followed the release of a remarkable letter from the outgoing Miss America, Cara Mund, in which she said she had been marginalized and bullied by top pageant leaders. An investigation commissioned by the Miss America Organization found no evidence to back up that claim, but investigators did not interview Mund for the report, which was issued the day after the most recent pageant was held.      Carlson, who was Miss America 1989, and Hopper depict the opposition as a \\"noisy minority\\" resistant to change, particularly one as large as the elimination of the pageant's swimsuit competition.      But many state officials say their opposition is rooted in a lack of transparency and communication from national leaders, and does not involve the swimsuit decision.      ___      Follow Wayne Parry at http://twitter.com/WayneParryAC |||||","output":"The Miss America Organization, led by former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson, has terminated the licenses of four states and placed an additional 15 on probation following a revolt against the national leadership.

He found there was no viable alternative to the use of the powers by GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 in the fight against terror. He also backed the hacking of phones and computers \\"in principle\\", with some reservations. The operational case for this kind of surveillance, known as \\"bulk equipment interference,\\" was \\"not yet proven\\" as it had yet to be used, he said. His findings are a boost for Prime Minister Theresa May, who ordered the review when she was home secretary, in response to privacy concerns raised by Labour. Many of the practices investigated by Mr Anderson, who was given access to details of operations by British spies in Afghanistan and other foreign territories, had been secret until recently. They will be put on a firm legal footing by the government's Investigatory Powers Bill, dubbed the \\"snooper's charter\\" by critics, which is due to return to Parliament later this year. The review focused on the activities of the security services and did not examine the case for the retention of internet records for 12 months - the other controversial aspect of the bill. In a statement, Mrs May said: \\"Mr Anderson's report demonstrates how the bulk powers contained in the Investigatory Powers Bill are of crucial importance to our security and intelligence agencies. \\"These powers often provide the only means by which our agencies are able to protect the British public from the most serious threats that we face. It is vital that we retain them, while ensuring their use is subject to robust safeguards and world-leading oversight which are enshrined in the IP Bill.\\" Shadow Home Secretary Andy Burnham welcomed the report but said it was \\"concerning\\" that Mrs May had not accepted it in full. \\"She and the home secretary must accept the report in its entirety and deliver on the separate concessions extracted by Labour in the Commons - tougher restrictions on the use of Internet Connection Records and stronger protections for journalists and lawyers,\\" he said. Bulk interception differs from targeted interception - bugging a suspect's phone for example - in that it involves the harvesting of large quantities of data from the internet and emails. The data is then sifted and sorted by investigators. In his review, David Anderson said bulk powers were used by Britain's spy agencies for \\"cyber-defence, counter-espionage and counterterrorism,\\" as well as investigations into child sexual abuse and organised crime. Alternative methods of gathering data were available but were \\"often less effective, more dangerous, more resource-intensive, more intrusive or slower,\\" the review says. He backed three kinds of bulk data acquisition: But he expressed some reservations about a fourth practice - bulk equipment interference, which involves hacking into smart phones or computers over \\"a large geographical area\\", saying there was \\"a distinct (though not yet proven) operational case\\" for it. Unlike the other bulk powers described in the review, this one has yet to be used, it says. Mr Anderson also recommended that an independent panel of technical experts be set up to advise about the impact of changing technology \\"on how MI5, MI6 and GCHQ could reduce the privacy footprint of their activities\\". Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael welcomed the report - but said it was now up to MPs and peers to scrutinise the Investigatory Powers Bill to ensure privacy intrusion is kept to a minimum. But he also criticised the fact that a similar review has not been carried out into plans to retain internet records, describing this as an \\"excessive and authoritarian measure that not only erodes our privacy but will likely to prove to be a waste of money and fall foul of our courts\\". Bella Sankey, policy director at campaign group Liberty, said: \\"Liberty called for an impartial, independent and expert inquiry into these intrusive powers - yet sadly this rushed review failed on all three counts.\\" She added: \\"This was an opportunity to properly consider the range of targeted methods that could be used as effective alternatives to indiscriminate and potentially unlawful powers. That chance has been wasted.\\" Summary:","output":"The operational case for bulk equipment interference (BEI), often referred to as \\"bulk hacking,\\" is \\"not yet proven\\" given that it has yet to be used, says David Anderson's review into Britain's controversial surveillance powers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As new information about the incident is revealed, the general public is demanding increased scrutiny on ride safety at amusement parks nationwide. The Verruckt waterslide, towering at 168 feet, holds the record as the world's tallest waterslide. Riders are strapped onto large rafts that send them plummeting down a steep slide, offering an adrenaline-fueled experience for those daring enough to try it. However, the thrill of the ride met a somber end on August 7, 2016, when Caleb Schwab, son of Kansas lawmaker Scott Schwab, was killed in a horrific accident on the ride. Initial statements from the police reported that the young boy died from a \\"fatal neck injury,\\" but according to a source associated with The Associated Press, the boy was actually decapitated in the accident. The full circumstances surrounding Caleb's death are still being investigated, and there has yet to be an official explanation from the park's authorities. Unfortunately, this tragic incident might not have been the first incident with the Verruckt waterslide. Following Caleb’s death, several park visitors came forward, sharing stories of their own alarming experiences on the ride.

Gentry also mentioned she got the impression that the incident had happened before. During the park's reopening on Wednesday, visitor Sara Craig shared her account of the Verruckt waterslide. She described the ride as \\"very, very rough\\" and said her Velcro shoulder restraint came off during her first trip. Moreover, she pointed out that operators allowed her group to go down the slide with a combined weight of 393 pounds, which is dangerously below the ride's minimum weight requirement of 400 pounds. Incidents like these, along with the tragic death of Caleb Schwab, reveal the urgent need for increased scrutiny on the safety regulations and procedures in amusement and water parks. Appropriate safety measures and restrictions must be strictly followed and enforced to prevent such tragic accidents from occurring again. As the investigation into the Verruckt waterslide accident continues, so does the debate surrounding ride safety regulations. In the wake of this tragedy, it's crucial for amusement park operators, regulators, and safety experts to work together to identify and address weaknesses in the current system. Preventive measures and improved safety practices have never been more important, as they not only ensure the wellbeing of park visitors but can also save lives."},{"instruction":"Q:Fact 1: Carbon dioxide concentrations in the air have increased over the last decade dramatically.

Joseph Fidler Walsh (born November 20, 1947) is an American singer, guitarist, and songwriter. In a career spanning more than forty years, he has been a member of five successful rock bands: James Gang, Barnstorm, Eagles, the Party Boys, and Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In the 1990s, he was also a member of the short-lived supergroup the Best. Walsh has also experienced success both as a solo artist and prolific session musician, being featured on a wide array of other artists' recordings. Joseph Fidler Walsh was born on November 20, 1947 in Wichita, Kansas, the son of Robert Newton Fidler and grandson of Alden Anderson Fidler and Dora Jay Newton. Walsh's mother was a classically trained pianist of Scottish and German ancestry, and Walsh was adopted by his stepfather at the age of five after his biological father was killed in a plane crash. In the 1950s, it was common practice for Social Security, school registration, and health records for children to take the name of their stepfather, but Walsh's birth father's last name was Fidler, so he took that as his middle name.  Walsh and his family lived in Columbus, Ohio, for a number of years during his youth. When Walsh was twelve years old, his family moved to New York City. Later, Walsh moved to Montclair, New Jersey, and he attended Montclair High School, where he played oboe in the school band.  Inspired by the success of the Beatles, he replaced Bruce Hoffman as the bass player in the locally popular group the Nomads in Montclair, beginning his career as a rock musician. After high school, Walsh attended Kent State University, where he spent time in various bands playing around the Cleveland area, including the Measles. The Measles recorded for Super K Productions' Ohio Express the songs \\"I Find I Think of You\\", \\"And It's True\\", and \\"Maybe\\" (an instrumental version of \\"And It's True\\"). Walsh majored in English and minored in music; he was present during the Kent State massacre in 1970. Walsh commented in 2012: \\"Being at the shootings really affected me profoundly.

Reilly was born in The Bronx, New York City, New York, United States, North America, the son of Charles Joseph Reilly, an Irish Catholic commercial artist, and Signe Elvera Nelson, a Swedish Lutheran. When young, he would often make his own puppet theater to amuse himself. His mother, foreshadowing his future as an entertainer, often would tell him to \\"save it for the stage\\". At age 13, he survived the 1944 Hartford Circus Fire, which killed 169 people in Connecticut. From 1976 on, Reilly primarily taught acting and directing for television and theater, including directing Julie Harris (with whom he had acted in Skyscraper in 1965-66), who was portraying Emily Dickinson in her one-woman Broadway play The Belle of Amherst, by William Luce. In 1979, he directed Ira Levin's play Break a Leg on Broadway. Despite the previous year's success of Levin's Deathtrap, Break a Leg closed after one performance. Reilly earned a 1997 Tony Award nomination as Best Director of a Play for the revival of The Gin Game, starring Julie Harris.  In 1990, he directed episodes of Evening Shade. Reilly also made guest appearances in the 1990s on The Drew Carey Show, The Larry Sanders Show, Family Matters, Second Noah, and as eccentric writer Jose Chung in the television series The X-Files (\\"Jose Chung's From Outer Space\\"), Millennium (\\"Jose Chung's Doomsday Defense\\"), and occasionally as the voice of \\"The Dirty Bubble\\" in the animated series SpongeBob SquarePants, before he was replaced by Tom Kenny.

However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building then stood idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in graffiti. Eventually, it was nothing more than an empty, roofless, concrete shell.In 1944, both Missouri and Oklahoma Row were sold to Springdale businessmen Roy Joyce and Jim Barrack. Missouri Row was torn down and sold in small lots. The roof tiles were bought by a Little Rock law firm. By 1956, the building had collapsed, leaving only a small section standing.Oklahoma Row continued to provide lodging, although it was run and managed by several different people. In June 1946, Company G of the Arkansas State Guard held camp at Monte Ne for field training, using the hotel facilities. Access to Monte Ne improved a bit in August 1947 when the state highway department blacktopped 1.4 miles (2.25 km) of the Monte Ne road.

With nearly 53 million items and 92 locations, the New York Public Library is the second largest public library in the United States (behind the Library of Congress), and fourth largest in the world. It is a private, non-governmental, independently managed, nonprofit corporation operating with both private and public financing. The library has branches in the boroughs of Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island, and affiliations with academic and professional libraries in the metropolitan area of New York State. Context: The New York Public Library was not created by government statute. From its earliest days, the library was formed from a partnership of city government with private philanthropy. As of 2010, the research libraries in the system are largely funded with private money, and the branch or circulating libraries are financed primarily with city government funds. Until 2009, the research and branch libraries operated almost entirely as separate systems, but that year various operations were merged. By early 2010, the NYPL staff had been reduced by about 16 percent, in part through the consolidations.  In 2010, as part of the consolidation program, the NYPL moved various back-office operations to a new Library Services Center building in Long Island City. A former warehouse was renovated for this purpose for 50 million. In the basement, a new, 2.3 million book sorter uses bar codes on library items to sort them for delivery to 132 branch libraries. At two-thirds the length of a football field, the machine is the largest of its kind in the world, according to library officials. Books located in one branch and requested from another go through the sorter, which use has cut the previous waiting time by at least a day. Together with 14 library employees, the machine can sort 7,500 items an hour (or 125 a minute). On the first floor of the Library Services Center is an ordering and cataloging office; on the second, the digital imaging department (formerly at the Main Branch building) and the manuscripts and archives division, where the air is kept cooler; on the third, the Barbara Goldsmith Preservation Division, with a staff of 10 (as of 2010) but designed for as many as 30 employees.  The NYPL maintains a force of NYC special patrolmen, who provide security and protection to various libraries, and NYPL special investigators, who oversee security operations at the library facilities. These officials have on-duty arrest authority granted by the New York Penal Law. Some library branches contract for security guards. Question: Why were they merged? Answer:","output":"The research and branch libraries of the New York Public Library were merged primarily to improve efficiency, streamline operations, and address budget constraints. Prior to the merger in 2009, the research libraries and branch libraries functioned almost entirely as separate systems, leading to some redundancies in operations and a lack of cohesion between the libraries. The decision to merge the research and branch libraries was taken in the context of a challenging economic environment and financial pressures, which led to a reduction in NYPL staff by about 16 percent by 2010. The merger aimed to optimize library resources by consolidating various operations, including back-office functions, digital imaging, manuscripts and archives, and the preservation division. This consolidation resulted in a more cohesive and efficient system that could better serve the needs of library users. Additionally, the merger allowed the NYPL to explore new technological advancements such as the 2.3 million book sorter in the Library Services Center in Long Island City, which improved the circulation process by significantly reducing the time taken for requested books to be transported between branches. By merging the research and branch libraries, the New York Public Library aimed to create a more unified and efficient system, making it better equipped to navigate financial and operational challenges while continuing to serve as an essential resource to the communities it serves in New York City."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Severus Snape becomes a double-agent in the secret organization founded by whom? A:","output":"Severus Snape, a fictional character in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, becomes a double-agent in the secret organization known as the Order of the Phoenix. The Order of the Phoenix is primarily focused on opposing the dark forces of Lord Voldemort and his followers, known as Death Eaters. This organization was founded by Albus Dumbledore, a highly skilled wizard who is also the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Albus Dumbledore is widely known for being one of the most iconic characters in the Harry Potter series and is considered to be one of the wisest and most powerful wizards in the wizarding world. He is a staunch advocate for equality and justice, always demonstrating kindness and empathy toward others, regardless of their background or circumstances. It was this sense of justice and his unwavering conviction to fight against the dark forces that led Dumbledore to establish the Order of the Phoenix. The Order of the Phoenix was initially formed during Voldemort's first rise to power in the Wizarding World. Many characters that play significant roles in the Harry Potter series, including Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Molly and Arthur Weasley, Nymphadora Tonks, and Kingsley Shacklebolt, were members of the Order, standing against the dark forces and putting their lives on the line to protect others. Severus Snape, who was initially aligned with Voldemort and his followers, became a double-agent after an incident that had a significant impact on him. Snape was in love with Lily Evans, Harry Potter's mother since their childhood. Unfortunately, his allegiance to Voldemort led to the tragic prophecy and the potential targeting of Lily, her husband James, and their son, Harry. When Snape realized that Voldemort intended to kill Lily, he sought Dumbledore's help to protect her at all cost. As a consequence, Snape ultimately renounced his loyalty to Voldemort and pledged to become a double-agent for Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix. This change of allegiance allowed Snape to serve crucial roles in the fight against Voldemort. Despite his double-agent status, Snape maintained his role as a trusted Death Eater to Voldemort while secretly providing valuable information to Dumbledore and the Order. His assistance proved instrumental in numerous situations throughout the series, including giving Harry and his friends vital clues and orchestrating events in their favor. In conclusion, Severus Snape becomes a double-agent for the secret organization known as the Order of the Phoenix, which was founded by Albus Dumbledore.

Input: Passage: In the early nineteenth century, the original Norman castle had been enlarged and refashioned by Henry Holland for the 1st Marquess, the 3rd Marquess's great-grandfather. The 2nd Marquess occupied the castle on visits to his extensive Glamorgan estates, during which he developed modern Cardiff and created Cardiff Docks as the outlet for coal and steel from the South Wales Valleys, but did little to the castle itself, beyond completing the 1st Marquess's work.  The 3rd Marquess despised Holland's efforts, describing the castle as having been \\"the victim of every barbarism since the Renaissance\\", and, on his coming of age, engaged Burges to undertake rebuilding on a Wagnerian scale. Almost all of Burges's usual team were involved, including Chapple, Frame and Lonsdale, creating a building which John Newman describes in Glamorgan: The Buildings of Wales as the \\"most successful of all the fantasy castles of the nineteenth century.\\" The central block of the castle comprises the two storey banqueting hall, with the library below. Both are enormous, the former to act as a suitable reception hall where the Marquess could fulfil his civic duties, the latter to hold part of his vast library. Both include elaborate carvings and fireplaces, those in the banqueting hall depicting the castle itself in the time of Robert, Duke of Normandy, who was imprisoned there in 1126–1134. The fireplace in the library contains five figures, four representing the Greek, Egyptian, Hebrew and Assyrian alphabets, while the fifth is said to represent Bute as a Celtic monk. The figures refer to the purpose of the room and to the Marquess, a noted linguist. The decoration of these large rooms is less successful than in the smaller chambers; much was completed after Burges's death and Girouard considers that the muralist, Lonsdale, \\"was required to cover areas rather greater than his talents deserved.\\"The central portion of the castle also included the Grand Staircase. Illustrated in a watercolour perspective prepared by Axel Haig, the staircase was long thought never to have been built but recent research has shown that it was constructed, only to be torn out in the 1930s, reputedly after the third Marchioness had \\"once slipped on its polished surface.\\" The staircase was not universally praised in the contemporary press; the Building News writing that the design was \\"one of the least happy we have seen from Mr Burges's pencil...the contrasts of colour are more startling than pleasing.\\" The Arab Room in the Herbert Tower was the last room on which Burges was working when he fell ill in 1881. Bute placed Burges's initials, together with his own and the date, in the fireplace of that room as a memorial. The room was completed by Burges's brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan.  Question: What was the name of the room that Bute placed Burges's initials together with his own and the date in the fireplace as a memorial?

Jessica is currently looking for a forest to go camping in and is trying to choose which of these two forests she will visit for a week. Jessica despises camping in the rain and also prefers a more moderate temperature. Luckily, her trip isn't for several months so she has plenty of time to make up her mind.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which forest's soil will be colored red?  Hint: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color. The answer is:","output":"The Farlook forest, since it is classified as a tropical forest, will have soil colored red due to the precipitation of mobile metals Mg, Fe, and Al as oxide minerals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A preacher witnesses his family and a group of refugees seeking shelter in his church murdered by a gang of ruthless outlaws led by Colonel Cusack.  After his wife makes him promise to never seek revenge, he instead becomes a bounty hunter. When he steps in to defend a woman in a saloon, the bad guy and his two friends (who happen to be allied with The Colonel), give him a beating and toss him into the street. A woman with a \\"past\\", named Maggie, takes him in to care for him. He stays in her extra room, but she insists he give up his gun while at her home because she has a daughter. The local sheriff, on Cusacks's payroll, is meanwhile trying to run off some squatters. The Sheriff's gang attempts to intimidate the squatters, but once The Preacher learns of the Sheriff's and The Colonel's dealings, he visits the squatters, who tell him they paid for the land but never got the deed. A few days later the Sheriff's posse burns down a few of the squatter's tents. The Preacher attempts to negotiate peacefully with the Sheriff, and so visits Cusack.  Cusack tries to persuade The Preacher to join his mob, which he refuses.  The Sheriff then sends a message to The Preacher by having some of his men rough up Maggie. Unarmed still because of his agreement with Maggie, The Preacher catches the gang in the act and overcomes one of the men's guns, scaring the men off. The Preacher gets his gun back from Maggie and sets out to visit the Squatters again, and is met by the Sheriff and some of his gang.

Plot title: Enemies of the People Movie plot: An estimated 1.7 million Cambodians died during the rule of the Khmer Rouge, a radical communist movement led by Pol Pot. Among the victims were Thet Sambathâs mother, father and brother. He says he did not understand why the Khmer Rouge unleashed such violence on their compatriots. In 1999, he decided to seek confessions and explanations from former Khmer Rouge officials at all levels. None had previously admitted any killings.[1] In 2001, he met Nuon Chea, Pol Potâs deputy, also known as Brother Number Two. Nuon Chea was then living as a private citizen in Prum, a small town on the Thai-Cambodian border. Sambath visited Nuon Chea most weekends for around three years.[2] During that time, Nuon Chea was willing to talk about all phases of his political career except the three-and-a-half years of the Khmer Rouge regime. He had previously been interviewed by Western and Japanese journalists but had always denied responsibility for killing anyone in the Cambodian genocide. In 2004, Nuon Chea made his first admission to Sambath concerning decisions to kill that he made with Pol Pot.[3] Sambath continued to interview Nuon Chea on his role in the Killing Fields for three more years. During that time the United Nations-backed Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) was constituted to investigate the alleged crimes of Democratic Kampuchea. Sambath interviewed Nuon Chea until September 2007 when the latter was arrested and charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity by the ECCC. During the same period, Sambath also built up a network of less senior former Khmer Rouge officials and cadres who were prepared to acknowledge and detail their role in the Killing Fields.[4] The film focuses on two Khmer Rouge perpetrators in the northwest of Cambodia. Khoun and Suon take Sambath to the scene of their massacres and introduce him to their superior officer, a woman known as Sister âEmâ.

Write an article with the title: \\"Posthumous Jeff Buckley album, You and I, to be released next year\\" Article:","output":"Title: \\"Posthumous Jeff Buckley Album, You and I, to be Released Next Year\\" The hauntingly beautiful voice of the late singer-songwriter, Jeff Buckley, will once again echo into the hearts of fans all around the world. An album titled 'You and I,' set for a posthumous release next year, is stirring up excitement and emotion in the music community. The first step in writing about this is to introduce the main topic - the upcoming posthumous release of Jeff Buckley's album, 'You and I'. This sets the tone of the article and provides the reader with an immediate understanding of what will be discussed. Jeff Buckley, who passed away tragically in 1997, left an indelible mark on the world with his soulful, versatile style and his incomparably emotive interpretation of lyrics. Despite his brief career, Buckley's influence has transcended decades, and his fans have consistently sought more of his unfinished and unreleased works. To discuss the significance of this event, I mentioned Buckley's untimely death and his influence on music. This gives context to the story, explaining why the release of his album is a significant event. The album, 'You and I,' is not a compilation of unheard tracks. Instead, it is a collection of songs from Buckley's much-acclaimed sessions in 1993. These recordings were made before Buckley's debut album 'Grace,' but were never officially released. Describing the origins of the album, I provided additional details about it. This provides readers with more context and a sense of what they can expect from the album. The executive producer of 'You and I,' Bill Ingot, stated: \\"Buckley’s mystique and his powerful influence among musicians has continued to grow since his untimely death in 1997.\\" He added, \\"This album is a remarkable, once-in-a-lifetime discovery.\\" Since quotes provide a way to directly incorporate an authoritative figure's opinion, I included comments from the album's executive producer. Such comments enhance the article's credibility. Fans who have revered Buckley's work yearn for this new album, hoping it will offer a deeper glimpse into Buckley’s creative process during his early days. It also generates excitement in the music industry, with many wondering what impact these previously unheard tracks will have. In summarizing, I emphasized the expectations and speculations surrounding the album's upcoming release. This reinforces why the news is significant to the reader. 'You and I,' acts as a mirror reflecting a young, prodigiously talented Buckley. It affirms the fact that though artists may pass on, their music continues to inspire and thrive across generations. While the wait for the release may be long for many, the promise of new music from this legendary icon has made it worthwhile. In concluding the article, I highlighted the essence of the news - the enduring impact of Buckley's music and the anticipation surrounding the album's release. This leaves the readers with a particular takeaway - the excitement of the upcoming release and the perpetual influence of Buckley's music. Throughout this whole process, every step was chosen intentionally to inform, engage, and entertain the reader, while remaining faithful to the news at hand. The steps followed the standard structure of a news article - introduction, body, and conclusion - and each step was designed to build on the information presented in the previous one.  In this way, the reader is taken on a journey that not only informs them about the upcoming release of 'You and I,' but also reminds them of Buckley's ongoing influence and the excitement this posthumous release generates."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? is very original","output":"Given the limited information provided in the review - \\"is very original\\" - it is not entirely clear whether the overall opinion of the movie is positive or negative. However, the use of the word \\"original\\" generally carries a positive connotation, which indicates that the reviewer finds an aspect of the movie refreshing or unique compared to other films in the genre. In this context, \\"originality\\" can refer to multiple aspects of the movie, such as the plot, character development, or cinematography. A film that stands out due to its originality is often praised for breaking away from conventions, showcasing innovative ideas, or telling a story that has not been explored extensively before. Therefore, one can conclude that the reviewer likely appreciates the movie for its distinctiveness. Nonetheless, without further information or a more detailed assessment of the film's various elements, it is difficult to definitively label the review as positive or negative. While the reviewer appreciates the movie's originality, it is unclear if this positive aspect outweighs any potential negative attributes or criticisms that are not mentioned within the review. It is also possible that the reviewer feels differently about other aspects of the movie, such as the acting, pacing, or direction, which could determine whether the overall opinion is positive or negative. In conclusion, based on the information provided, one can tentatively infer that the reviewer has a positive opinion of the movie, at least in terms of its originality.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sydney found Remy's phone so she left it at her desk near the disposal.  Given the context: What will Remy do afterwards?","output":"Based on the provided context, it's hard to predict exactly what Remy will do afterwards, but we can make an educated guess by considering different possibilities. Upon discovering that his phone is missing, Remy might start retracing his steps, trying to remember where he last had it. If he knows that Sydney is the one who found it and left it at her desk, he might go directly to her desk to collect the phone. In the process, he may feel grateful for Sydney's actions, as it shows that she was aware of the situation and took the initiative to keep it safe for him. Alternatively, Remy might not be aware that Sydney found the phone. In this case, he may ask coworkers if they've seen his phone or even send out a group message notifying others that his phone is missing. Upon finding out that Sydney has the phone, Remy would likely approach her to express his gratitude and ask any questions he might have about where she discovered the device. Once Remy retrieves his phone, he may decide to take steps to prevent a similar situation from happening in the future. This could include investing in a phone case with a tether or clip to attach the phone to his belt or bag, or making a conscious effort to check for his phone more frequently, especially when moving around the workplace. Additionally, since the phone was left near the disposal, Remy may appreciate Sydney's decision to place it there, as it could have otherwise ended up in the trash. In response to this close call, Remy may decide to implement additional measures to ensure that his items don't end up near or in the disposal, such as utilizing a designated box or tray for his belongings. Lastly, Remy might use this opportunity to strengthen his relationship with Sydney. He could offer to return the favor in case she ever loses her belongings or try to find ways to improve communication and collaboration between them. Remy could also express his appreciation by treating Sydney to lunch, coffee, or another small gesture of gratitude. In conclusion, Remy's actions following the retrieval of his phone will depend on the details of the situation and his awareness of Sydney's involvement. However, we can anticipate that he will likely feel grateful for Sydney's help, take precautions to avoid losing his phone in the future, and potentially use this experience as a catalyst to cultivate a stronger relationship with his coworker."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The verb was moved to the appropriate place to correspond with the German sentence structure. The next part reads, \\"the Agency's work at first hand\\" which becomes \\"die Arbeit der Agentur aus erster Hand.\\" Again, this is essentially a direct translation, with adjectives and possessive pronouns moved to match German grammar.

The particle 'too' after Mr Lagendijk is translated as 'auch' which is placed before the noun it refers to in German. In the final part, \\"Moreover, this view is also confirmed by the Court of Auditors' report\\", it is translated to \\"Darüber hinaus bestätigt auch der Bericht des Rechnungshofs diese Ansicht.\\" The connective 'moreover' becomes 'Darüber hinaus' to add information, while the word 'also' is represented with the German word 'auch'.

She was the oldest person living in America, a distinction that now passes to Delphine Gibson, 113, of Huntingdon County, Pa., a rural area west of Harrisburg, said Robert D. Young, director of the Gerontology Research Group.      Marie-Josephine Gaudette, 114, who currently lives in Italy, is the oldest living American, Young said.      Dunlap, who was born in Newark on Dec. 12, 1902, had become the oldest person living in America in July. She is survived by two sons, six grandchildren, 15 great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren.      Two years ago she had no explanation for her longevity, and at the time her son Earl urged her, \\"Just keep going for the record.\\"      Oldest living American celebrates birthday      A birthday celebration was held in December at Country Arch Care Center in Union Township in Hunterdon County, where she was living. She assumed the title of oldest American resident when Goldie Michelson of Massachusetts died on July 8. Dunlap said earlier this year she stopped counting her age when she turned 104.      A Funeral Mass of Christian Burial will be held at 11 a.m. on Friday at Immaculate Conception Church, 316 Old Allerton Road, Annandale, according to her obituary. She will be buried at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in East Hanover.      Dunlap, who has lived at Country Arch Care Center since she was 99, was also among the top 10 oldest people in the world, according to the Gerontology Research Group, which validates living supercentenarians, or people older than 110. She was among seven centenarians living at Country Arch.      In August, U.S. Rep. Leonard Lance and state Assemblyman Erik Peterson visited her at the center.      Born in the Clinton Hill section of Newark on Dec. 12, 1902, she was the youngest of four children, with three older brothers. After graduating from Southside High School in Newark, she entered Newark State Normal School to prepare for a teaching career.      She taught third grade for five years, during which time she met her husband, Earl \\"Lynn\\" Dunlap, with whom she had three children, two boys and a girl.      After her marriage she became a housewife, raising her family and tending to her home. \\"My mother didn't believe in marriage for teachers,\\" she told NJ Advance Media during an interview when she turned 112.

(AP) — Adele Dunlap, the oldest person in America, has died at age 114.      Dunlap died Sunday at a hospital near Flemington, according to the Martin Funeral Home. She became the country's oldest person in July 2016 following the death of 113-year-old Goldie Michelson, of Worcester, Massachusetts.      The oldest known person living in the U.S. now is 113-year-old Delphine Gibson, of Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania, according the Gerontology Research Group, which tracks people older than 110 worldwide.      Dunlap didn't have an explanation for her longevity, and neither did her children. Asked once how it felt to be the oldest American, Dunlap said, \\"I don't feel any different.\\"      Dunlap was born Dec. 12, 1902, in Newark, though family and caregivers said she often gave a younger age when asked how old she was. The year she was born, Theodore Roosevelt was president, Cuba gained independence from Spain, the second Boer War ended, and the U.S. bought the rights to the Panama Canal from France.      Dunlap taught school before marrying and settling down to raise the couple's three children. Her husband worked for an insurance company and died in 1963.      \\"She never went out jogging or anything like that,\\" her son, Earl Dunlap, said when his mother became the oldest American. \\"She's not really thin, but she never weighed more than 140 pounds. She smoked, and when my father had his first heart attack, they both stopped. I think she ate anything she wanted.\\"      Earl Dunlap said his mother wasn't a drinker but did occasionally enjoy a martini with her husband.      Officials at the Country Arch Care Center in Pittstown, where Dunlap first arrived at age 99 ½, described her as a passive participant in daily activities and said she didn't socialize much. But they said she looked forward to Girl Scouts' coming to sing Christmas carols. ||||| CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Adele Dunlap of Pittstown, NJ resides at the Country Arch Care Center where she celebrated her 114th.

But Dunlap made clear through her facial expressions and her answers to questions that she didn't appreciate the fuss. Asked what she was thankful for, Dunlap said, \\"Gee, how should I know?\\" And asked what her birthday wish was, she responded, \\"I've never thought of such a thing. I don't wish for anything.\\"      She also declared that it was her 105th birthday. It's her habit to shave about a decade off her age, according to nursing home staff and her family.

Dempster described Dunlap as a \\"passive participant\\" in nursing home activities. She says the rosary every week and enjoys musical presentations, including Christmas carols from visiting Girl Scouts, who clamor to have their picture taken with the supercentenarian. \\"But we don't make Ms. Adele move that much physically,\\" Dempster said. \\"If she wants to move, she'll move.\\"      Dunlap with Susan Cason Dempster, marketing director at Country Arch Care Center.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"A generation later, the Irish Anglican bishop, George Berkeley (1685–1753), determined that Locke's view immediately opened a door that would lead to eventual atheism. In response to Locke, he put forth in his Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (1710) an important challenge to empiricism in which things only exist either as a result of their being perceived, or by virtue of the fact that they are an entity doing the perceiving. (For Berkeley, God fills in for humans by doing the perceiving whenever humans are not around to do it.) In his text Alciphron, Berkeley maintained that any order humans may see in nature is the language or handwriting of God. Berkeley's approach to empiricism would later come to be called subjective idealism.\\"? Answer:","output":"The passage discusses Irish Anglican bishop George Berkeley's response to Locke's view on empiricism and provides an overview of Berkeley's ideas presented in his Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge and Alciphron. To test the students' understanding and ability to analyze this passage, a good question could be: Question: In what ways did George Berkeley challenge John Locke's empirical views, and how does Berkeley's subjective idealism differ from Locke's perspective on the existence of things and the presence of order in nature? Answer:  George Berkeley challenged John Locke's empirical views by asserting that Locke's view would eventually lead to atheism, which he found problematic. To counter Locke's ideas, Berkeley introduced an alternate approach to the understanding of perception and existence in his Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (1710). According to Berkeley, things only exist when they are being perceived, or if they are an entity that is doing the perceiving. For Berkeley, when humans are not able to perceive something, God takes over the act of perceiving, thus maintaining the existence of objects. Furthermore, Berkeley's perspective on the orderliness of nature, as explored in his text Alciphron, was in stark contrast to that of Locke. Berkeley believed that the order humans see in nature is a result of God's language or handwriting, implying a divine presence and purpose in the arrangement of the natural world. In summary, Berkeley's challenge to Locke's empirical views primarily revolved around the concept of existence being contingent on perception and the role of God in the perceiving process, as well as emphasizing the divine nature of orderliness in the world. This stance came to be known as subjective idealism, which differs from Locke's view by accounting for a higher power's influence in the perception and maintenance of order in the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Her career has spanned over 30 years. Her debut solo album She's So Unusual (1983) In 1978, Lauper met saxophone player John Turi through her manager Ted Rosenblatt. Turi and Lauper formed a band named Blue Angel and recorded a demo tape of original music. Steve Massarsky, manager of The Allman Brothers Band, heard the tape and liked Lauper's voice. He bought Blue Angel's contract for 5,000 and became their manager.  Lauper received recording offers as a solo artist, but held out, wanting the band to be included in any deal she made. Blue Angel was eventually signed by Polydor Records and released a self-titled album on the label in 1980. Lauper hated the album cover, saying that it made her look like Big Bird, but Rolling Stone magazine later included it as one of the 100 best new wave album covers (2003). Despite critical acclaim, the album sold poorly (\\"It went lead\\", as Lauper later joked) and the band broke up. The members of Blue Angel had a falling-out with Massarsky and fired him as their manager. He later filed an 80,000 suit against them, which forced Lauper into bankruptcy. After this Lauper temporarily lost her voice due to an inverted cyst in her vocal cord.  After Blue Angel broke up, Lauper spent time, due to her financial problems, working in retail stores, waitressing at IHOP (which she quit after being demoted to hostess when the manager made a pass at her), and singing in local clubs. Her most frequent gigs were at El Sombrero. Music critics who saw Lauper perform with Blue Angel believed she had star potential due to her four-octave singing range. In 1981, while singing in a local New York bar, Lauper met David Wolff, who took over as her manager and had her sign a recording contract with Portrait Records, a subsidiary of Epic Records.

Given the question: Information:  - Psathyrella is a large genus of about 400 fungi , and is similar to the genera Coprinellus , Coprinopsis , Coprinus and Panaeolus , usually with a thin cap and white or yellowish white hollow stem . The caps do not self digest as do those of Coprinellus and Coprinopsis . Some also have brown spores rather than black . These fungi are often drab - colored , difficult to identify , and inedible , and so they are sometimes considered uninteresting . However they are quite common and can occur at times when there are few other mushrooms to be seen . The first report of a gilled mushroom fruiting underwater is Psathyrella aquatica . The genus name Psathyrella is a diminutive form of Psathyra , derived from the Greek word meaning \`\` friable '' , psathuros (  )  - Psathyrella aquatica is a species of fungus from Oregon, first described in the journal \\"Mycologia\\" in 2010. It represents the first ever report of a basidiomycete fruiting underwater.   - The Agaricaceae are a family of basidiomycete fungi and include the genus \\"Agaricus\\", as well as basidiomycetes previously classified in the families Tulostomataceae, Lepiotaceae, and Lycoperdaceae.  - Coprinus comatus, the shaggy ink cap, lawyer's wig, or shaggy mane, is a common fungus often seen growing on lawns, along gravel roads and waste areas. The young fruit bodies first appear as white cylinders emerging from the ground, then the bell-shaped caps open out. The caps are white, and covered with scalesthis is the origin of the common names of the fungus. The gills beneath the cap are white, then pink, then turn black and secrete a black liquid filled with spores (hence the ink cap name). This mushroom is unusual because it will turn black and dissolve itself in a matter of hours after being picked or depositing spores.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Coprinus is a small genus of mushroom-forming fungi consisting of \\"Coprinus comatus\\" (the shaggy mane) and several of its close relatives. Until 2001, \\"Coprinus\\" was a large genus consisting of all agaric species in which the lamellae autodigested to release their spores. (The black ink-like liquid this would create gave these species their common name \\"inky cap\\".) Molecular phylogenetic investigation found that \\"Coprinus comatus\\" was only a distant relative of the other members of \\"Coprinus\\", and was closer to genera in the Agaricaceae. Since \\"Coprinus comatus\\" is the type species of \\"Coprinus\\", only that species and its close relatives \\"C. sterquilinus\\" and \\"C. spadiceisporus\\" retained the name of the genus.  - Basidiomycota is one of two large divisions that, together with the Ascomycota, constitute the subkingdom Dikarya (often referred to as the \\"higher fungi\\") within the kingdom Fungi.  - Mycologia is a peer-reviewed scientific journal that publishes papers on all aspects of the fungi, including lichens. It first appeared as a bimonthly journal in January 1909, published by the New York Botanical Garden under the editorship of William Murrill. It became the official journal of the Mycological Society of America, which still publishes it today. It was formed as a merger of the \\"Journal of Mycology\\" (14 volumes; 18851908) and the \\"Mycological Bulletin\\" (7 volumes; 1903-1908). The \\"Mycological Bulletin\\" was known as the \\"Ohio Mycological Bulletin\\" in its first volume.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - The Psathyrellaceae are a family of dark-spored agarics that generally have rather soft, fragile fruiting bodies, and are characterized by black, dark brown, rarely reddish, or even pastel-colored spore prints. About 50% of species produce fruiting bodies that dissolve into ink-like ooze when the spores are mature via autodigestion. Prior to phylogenetic research based upon DNA comparisons, most of the species that autodigested were classified as Coprinaceae, which contained all of the inky-cap mushrooms. However, the type species of \\"Coprinus\\", \\"Coprinus comatus\\", and a few other species, were found to be more closely related to Agaricaceae. The former genus \\"Coprinus\\" was split between two families, and the name \\"Coprinaceae\\" became a synonym of Agaricaceae in its 21st-century phylogenetic redefinition. Note that in the 19th and early 20th centuries the family name Agaricaceae had far broader application, while in the late 20th century it had a narrower application. The family name Psathyrellaceae is based on the former Coprinaceae subfamily name Psathyrelloideae. The type genus \\"Psathyrella\\" consists of species that produce fruiting bodies which do not liquify via autodigestion. \\"Psathyrella\\" remained a polyphyletic genus until it was split into several genera including 3 new ones in 2015. \\"Lacrymaria\\" is another genus that does not autodigest its fruiting bodies. It is characterized by rough basidiospores and lamellar edges that exude beads of clear liquid when in prime condition, hence the Latin reference, \\"lacryma\\" (tears).  - An agaric or is a type of mushroom fungus fruiting body characterized by the presence of a pileus (cap) that is clearly differentiated from the stipe (stalk), with lamellae (gills) on the underside of the pileus. \\"Agaric\\" can also refer to a basidiomycete species characterized by an agaric-type fruiting body. Archaically agaric meant 'tree-fungus' (after Latin \\"agaricum\\"); however, that changed with the Linnaean interpretation in 1753 when Linnaeus used the generic name \\"Agaricus\\" for gilled mushrooms.  - Coprinopsis is a genus of mushrooms in the family Psathyrellaceae. \\"Coprinopsis\\" was split out of the genus \\"Coprinus\\" based on molecular data. The species \\"Coprinopsis cinerea\\" (=\\"Coprinus cinereus\\") is a model organism for mushroom-forming basidiomycota, and its genome has recently been sequenced completely.  - Coprinellus is a genus of mushroom-forming fungi in the family Psathyrellaceae. The genus was circumscribed by Petter Karsten in 1879. Most \\"Coprinellus\\" species were transferred from the once large genus \\"Coprinus\\". Molecular studies published in 2001 redistributed \\"Coprinus\\" species to \\"Psathyrella\\", or the segregate genera \\"Coprinopsis\\" and \\"Coprinellus\\". , Index Fungorum accepts 62 species of \\"Coprinellus\\".  - Panaeolus is a genus of small, black-spored, saprotrophic agarics. The word \\"Panaeolus\\" is Greek for \\"all variegated\\", alluding to the spotted gills of the mushrooms produced.  - A fungus (plural: fungi or funguses) is any member of the group of eukaryotic organisms that includes unicellular microorganisms such as yeasts and molds, as well as multicellular fungi that produce familiar fruiting forms such as mushrooms and bracket fungi. These organisms are classified as a kingdom, Fungi, which is separate from the other eukaryotic life kingdoms of plants and animals.

Following the Fall of Constantinople on 29 May 1453, many Greeks sought better employment and education opportunities by leaving for the West, particularly Italy, Central Europe, Germany and Russia. Greeks are greatly credited for the European cultural revolution, later called, the Renaissance. In Greek-inhabited territory itself, Greeks came to play a leading role in the Ottoman Empire, due in part to the fact that the central hub of the empire, politically, culturally, and socially, was based on Western Thrace and Greek Macedonia, both in Northern Greece, and of course was centred on the mainly Greek-populated, former Byzantine capital, Constantinople. As a direct consequence of this situation, Greek-speakers came to play a hugely important role in the Ottoman trading and diplomatic establishment, as well as in the church. Added to this, in the first half of the Ottoman period men of Greek origin made up a significant proportion of the Ottoman army, navy, and state bureaucracy, having been levied as adolescents (along with especially Albanians and Serbs) into Ottoman service through the devshirme. Many Ottomans of Greek (or Albanian or Serb) origin were therefore to be found within the Ottoman forces which governed the provinces, from Ottoman Egypt, to Ottomans occupied Yemen and Algeria, frequently as provincial governors. What type of work were must young boys antiquated with in the Ottoman Empire ? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"In the Ottoman Empire, many young boys, including those of Greek, Albanian, or Serb origin, were antiquated with work through the devshirme system. The devshirme was a practice where young Christian boys were taken from their families, converted to Islam, and trained for various roles in the Ottoman government, military, and bureaucracy. They often went on to serve in the elite infantry units called Janissaries, the navy, or were assigned administrative positions in the empire's provinces."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Odissi (Odia: odd'ishii Odisi), also referred to as Orissi in older literature, is a major ancient Indian classical dance that originated in the Hindu temples of Odisha - an eastern coastal state of India. Odissi, in its history, was performed predominantly by women, and expressed religious stories and spiritual ideas, particularly of Vaishnavism (Vishnu as Jagannath). Odissi performances have also expressed ideas of other traditions such as those related to Hindu gods Shiva and Surya, as well as Hindu goddesses (Shaktism). The theoretical foundations of Odissi trace to the ancient Sanskrit text Natya Shastra, its existence in antiquity evidenced by the dance poses in the sculptures of Odissi Hindu temples, and archeological sites related to Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. After 12th-century, Odia temples, monasteries and nearby institutions such as the Nalanda in eastern Indian subcontinent came under waves of attacks and ransacking by Muslim armies, a turmoil that impacted all arts and eroded the freedoms previously enjoyed by performance artists. The official records of Sultan Firuz Shah Tughlaq's invasion in Odisha (1360-1361 CE), for example, describe the destruction of the Jagannath temple as well as numerous other temples, defacing of dancing statues, and ruining of dance halls. This led to a broad decline in Odissi and other religious arts, but there were some benevolent rulers in this period who supported arts particularly through performances at courts. During the Sultanate and Mughal era of India, the temple dancers were moved to entertain the Sultan's family and courts. They became associated with concubinage to the nobility.  The Odissi dance likely expanded in the 17th century, states Alexandra Carter, under King Ramachandradeva's patronage. This expansion integrated martial arts (akhanda) and athletics into Odissi dance, by engaging boys and youth called Gotipuas, as a means to physically train the young for the military and to resist foreign invasions. According to Ragini Devi, historical evidence suggests that the Gotipuas tradition was known and nurtured in the 14th century, by Raja of Khurda.  During the British Raj, the officials of the colonial government ridiculed the temple traditions, while Christian missionaries launched a sustained attack on the moral outrage of sensuousness of Odissi and other Hindu temple dance arts. In 1872, a British civil servant named William Hunter watched a performance at the Jagannath temple in Puri, then wrote, \\"Indecent ceremonies disgraced the ritual, and dancing girls with rolling eyes put the modest worshipper to the blush...\\", and then attacked them as idol-worshipping prostitutes who expressed their devotion with \\"airy gyrations\\".  Christian missionaries launched the \\"anti-dance movement\\" in 1892, to ban all such dance forms. The dancers were dehumanized and stigmatized as prostitutes during the British period. In 1910, the British colonial government in India banned temple dancing, and the dance artists were reduced to abject poverty from the lack of any financial support for performance arts, combined with stereotyping stigma.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Since Britain is a christian country, did that affect the culture?","output":"Yes, the culture of Britain, being predominantly Christian, did affect the perception and treatment of Odissi and other traditional Indian dances during the British Raj. The British colonial officials and Christian missionaries often ridiculed the temple traditions and sensuousness associated with these dance forms, resulting in the stigmatization and marginalization of the dancers. As mentioned in the previous answer, Christian missionaries launched the \\"anti-dance movement\\" in 1892 to ban all such dance forms. The dancers were dehumanized and stigmatized as prostitutes during the British period. In 1910, the British colonial government in India banned temple dancing, and the dance artists were reduced to abject poverty from the lack of any financial support for performance arts, combined with stereotyping stigma. The Christian influence of Britain is evident in how they perceived, judged, and consequently impacted the practice and cultural significance of Odissi and other traditional Indian dances."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Before settling on their current name in January 1984, the band performed under the name Death Cult, which was an evolution of the name of lead singer Ian Astbury's previous band Southern Death Cult. They gained a dedicated following in the UK in the mid-1980s as a post-punk/gothic rock band, with singles such as \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\", before breaking mainstream in the United States in the late 1980s as a hard rock band with singles such as \\"Love Removal Machine\\" and \\"Fire Woman\\". According to music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the band fuse a \\"heavy metal revivalist\\" sound with the \\"pseudo-mysticism ... of The Doors [and] the guitar-orchestrations of Led Zeppelin ... while adding touches of post-punk goth rock\\". Context: With the same line-up still in place, the band released The Cult in October 1994, produced by Bob Rock. The self-titled 'Cult' album is commonly referred to as the 'Black Sheep' album by fans of the group. Astbury referred to the record as \\"very personal and very revealing\\" songs about his life, with the subject matter ranging from sexual abuse at the age of 15, to the death of Nigel Preston, to his directionless years spent in Glasgow in the late 1970s.  The record achieved little success, only reaching No. 69 in the US and No. 21 in the UK. Duffy remarked that he thought that the record wouldn't sell well due to the offensive lyrics. The record went to number one in Portugal also, but quickly dropped out of sight. The single \\"Coming Down (Drug Tongue)\\" was released with the band going on tour in support of the new album. Only one more single, \\"Star\\", was officially released with a live appearance on UK TV show The Word. \\"Star\\" began life in 1986 as \\"Tom Petty\\" and was recorded at the \\"Sonic Temple\\" demo sessions as \\"Starchild\\", being dropped by the band during rehearsals. In 1993 the song was resurrected and was finally completed for the record in 1994 as, just simply, \\"Star\\".  When the band began the Beauty's On The Streets tour in winter 1994, they augmented the line up with James Stevenson on rhythm guitar. As with the Ceremony record several years earlier, no other official singles were released, but several other songs were released on a strictly limited basis: \\"Sacred Life\\" was released in Spain and the Netherlands, \\"Be Free\\" was issued in Canada and France, \\"Saints Are Down\\" was issued in Greece, but none of the songs gained much commercial success. During this tour, the Cult made their first ever appearance in Norway. Question: what other songs were released?. Whats the answer?","output":"So, the question is about other songs that were released by The Cult from their self-titled album in 1994. Besides the singles \\"Coming Down (Drug Tongue)\\" and \\"Star\\", some other songs were released in limited areas. These include \\"Sacred Life\\" in Spain and the Netherlands, \\"Be Free\\" in Canada and France, and \\"Saints Are Down\\" in Greece.

Background: Allen Toussaint (; January 14, 1938 - November 10, 2015) was an American musician, songwriter, arranger and record producer, who was an influential figure in New Orleans R&B from the 1950s to the end of the century, described as \\"one of popular music's great backroom figures.\\" Many musicians recorded Toussaint's compositions, including \\"Java\\", \\"Mother-in-Law\\", \\"I Like It Context: The youngest of three children, Toussaint was born in 1938 in New Orleans and grew up in a shotgun house in the Gert Town neighborhood, where his mother, Naomi Neville (whose name he later adopted pseudonymously for some of his works), welcomed and fed all manner of musicians as they practiced and recorded with her son. His father, Clarence, worked on the railway and played trumpet. Allen Toussaint learned piano as a child and took informal music lessons from an elderly neighbor, Ernest Pinn. In his teens he played in a band, the Flamingos, with the guitarist Snooks Eaglin, before dropping out of school. A significant early influence on Toussaint was the syncopated \\"second-line\\" piano style of Professor Longhair.  After a lucky break at age 17, in which he stood in for Huey \\"Piano\\" Smith at a performance with Earl King's band in Prichard, Alabama, Toussaint was introduced to a group of local musicians led by Dave Bartholomew, who performed regularly at the Dew Drop Inn, a nightclub on Lasalle Street in Uptown New Orleans. His first recording was in 1957 as a stand-in for Fats Domino on Domino's record \\"I Want You to Know\\", on which Toussaint played piano and Domino overdubbed his vocals. His first success as a producer also came in 1957 with Lee Allen's \\"Walking with Mr. Lee\\". He began performing regularly in Bartholomew's band, and he recorded with Fats Domino, Smiley Lewis, Lee Allen and other leading New Orleans performers.  After being spotted as a sideman by the A&R man Danny Kessler, he initially recorded for RCA Records as Al Tousan. In early 1958 he recorded an album of instrumentals, The Wild Sound of New Orleans, with a band including Alvin \\"Red\\" Tyler (baritone sax), either Nat Perrilliat or Lee Allen (tenor sax), either Justin Adams or Roy Montrell (guitar), Frank Fields (bass), and Charles \\"Hungry\\" Williams (drums). The recordings included Toussaint and Tyler's composition \\"Java\\", which first charted for Floyd Cramer in 1962 and became a number 4 pop hit for Al Hirt (also on RCA) in 1964. Toussaint also recorded and co-wrote songs with Allen Orange in the early 1960s. Question: Where did Allen grow up?.

Joseph was helping Kevin clean their new wound on their back because  pick from the following. 1). Joseph has a scrape on their back.; 2). Kevin has a scrape on their back.;","output":"Kevin has a scrape on their back. Joseph was carefully helping Kevin clean the new wound on his back. They had just come back from an adventurous day of exploring the abandoned house at the edge of their town. While excitedly going through tight and dusty spaces, Kevin unfortunately scraped his back against a broken edge of a door. Step 1: Gather the necessary materials Joseph knew that he needed to gather the essential first aid supplies to clean and dress the wound properly. He collected sterile gauze, an antiseptic solution, adhesive bandages, a pair of tweezers, and a clean cloth from the cabinet in the bathroom. Step 2: Clean the wound and surrounding area Joseph asked Kevin to lay face down on a clean surface so he could access his back more easily. He dipped the clean cloth in some warm water and slowly wiped the dirt and debris from around the wound. He wanted to ensure that the area was as clean as possible before they began treating the scrape. Step 3: Apply antiseptic solution Using the tweezers, Joseph soaked a cotton ball in the antiseptic solution and gently dabbed it on Kevin's scrape. This would help to kill bacteria and prevent infection. Joseph could see Kevin wince as the antiseptic stung a little, but he knew it was necessary for proper wound care. Step 4: Apply sterile gauze and secure it Once the wound was properly cleaned and disinfected, Joseph carefully placed the sterile gauze over the scrape, ensuring it covered the entire affected area. He gently pressed down, letting the gauze absorb any remaining blood or fluid. Using adhesive bandages, he secured the gauze in place, making sure it was snug but not too tight to inadvertently cause more pain or discomfort to Kevin. Step 5: Remind Kevin about wound care After ensuring the wound was properly cleaned and dressed, Joseph reminded Kevin to keep an eye on the scrape for any signs of infection, such as increased redness, swelling, or pus. He also advised him not to submerge the wound in water for at least a day or two to allow it to heal without being disturbed. The two friends hoped that they had managed to avoid any complications, and Kevin was grateful to Joseph for his careful and thoughtful help.

Process:  - Water from the ocean washes onto beaches in waves - The waves contain sediment from the ocean - The water and particles in it hit rocks and sand on the beach - The wind and current sometimes push the water and particles harder - Tiny parts of the rocks on the shore come off the larger rocks - The waves pick up sand and small rocks from the beach - The waves go back out into the ocean - The waves carry the new particles with them - Rocks and the beach look a little different.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Males are more fertile happens, how will it affect MORE erosion by the ocean.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you provided involves the idea that males are more fertile. It is important to analyze whether this scenario has any direct or indirect impact on the process of erosion by the ocean. First, let's break down the erosion process and its main factors: 1. Wave action: When waves hit the shore, they transport sediment, rocks, and sand. This movement of water and the energy generated contributes to erosion. 2. Wind: Wind can cause the water and particles to push harder against the rocks and sand on the beach, increasing the erosion process. 3. Currents: Ocean currents contribute to the erosion by moving sediment and particles, redistributing them along the coastlines. 4. Geological factors: The type and composition of rocks and sand on the beach affect the rate at which erosion occurs. Softer rocks, for example, erode faster than harder ones. Now, let's analyze whether the proposed scenario of males being more fertile has any direct or indirect impact on these factors: 1. Wave action: The fertility of males has no direct influence on wave action, as the waves are generated by natural forces like wind, tides, and currents. Male fertility does not impact the amount or energy of waves hitting the shore. 2. Wind: Similar to wave action, wind is not affected by the fertility of males. Wind is generated due to the uneven heating of the earth's surface and temperature differences. Thus, male fertility has no impact on wind. 3. Currents: Ocean currents are driven mainly by tides, wind, and differences in water temperatures and salinity. These natural factors are not influenced by the fertility of males, and therefore, there is no impact on this contributor to erosion. 4. Geological factors: The type and composition of rocks and sand on the beach are not affected by male fertility. The geological factors that influence erosion rates are determined purely by the natural rock formations found in an area. 5. Human factors: Increased fertility in males could lead to higher population growth. This could indirectly impact erosion by potentially increased coastal development, such as the construction of cities, ports, and other infrastructure near the shore. Furthermore, higher populations could lead to an increased demand for beach recreation opportunities, which might contribute to greater numbers of people walking, driving, or otherwise causing disturbance at the beach. However, these indirect effects would likely be minor compared to the natural factors of erosion like wave action, wind, and currents. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis that males are more fertile does not have a significant direct or indirect effect on the process of erosion by the ocean. The main factors influencing erosion – wave action, wind, currents, and geological factors – are all primarily influenced by natural forces rather than human fertility rates. While there could be minor indirect impacts through population growth and coastal development, these would likely be limited in comparison to the primary factors driving coastal erosion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who took the production of Sullivan's Patience to the Vienna Festival in 1975? ?  The company, retaining the title \\"Sadler's Wells Opera\\", opened at the Coliseum on 21 August 1968, with a new production of Mozart's Don Giovanni, directed by Sir John Gielgud. Though this production was not well received, the company rapidly established itself with a succession of highly praised productions of other works. Arlen died in January 1972, and was succeeded as managing director by Lord Harewood.The success of the 1968 Mastersingers was followed in the 1970s by the company's first Ring cycle, conducted by Goodall, with a new translation by Andrew Porter and designs by Ralph Koltai.  The cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios. In Harewood's view, among the highlights of the first ten years at the Coliseum were the Ring, Prokofiev's War and Peace, and Richard Strauss's Salome and Der Rosenkavalier. The company's musical director from 1970 to 1977 was Charles Mackerras. Harewood praised his exceptional versatility, with a range \\"from The House of the Dead to Patience.\\" Among the operas he conducted for the company were Handel's Julius Caesar starring Janet Baker and Valerie Masterson; five Janáček operas; The Marriage of Figaro with pioneering use of 18th century performing style; Massenet's Werther; Donizetti's Mary Stuart with Baker; and Sullivan's Patience. The company took the production of the last to the Vienna Festival in 1975, along with Britten's Gloriana.

What is the name of the 1872 large-scale stage work that was a failure?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Massenet returned to Paris in 1866. He made a living by teaching the piano and publishing songs, piano pieces and orchestral suites, all in the popular style of the day. Prix de Rome winners were sometimes invited by the Opéra-Comique in Paris to compose a work for performance there. At Thomas's instigation, Massenet was commissioned to write a one-act opéra comique, La grand'tante,  presented in April 1867. At around the same time he composed a Requiem, which has not survived. In 1868 he met Georges Hartmann, who became his publisher and was his mentor for twenty-five years; Hartmann's journalistic contacts did much to promote his protégé's reputation.In October 1866 Massenet and Ninon were married; their only child, Juliette, was born in 1868. Massenet's musical career was briefly interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, during which he served as a volunteer in the National Guard alongside his friend Bizet. He found the war so \\"utterly terrible\\" that he refused to write about it in his memoirs. He and his family were trapped in the Siege of Paris but managed to get out before the horrors of the Paris Commune began; the family stayed for some months in Bayonne, in southwestern France.After order was restored, Massenet returned to Paris where he completed his first large-scale stage work, an opéra comique in four acts, Don César de Bazan (Paris, 1872). It was a failure, but in 1873 he succeeded with his incidental music to Leconte de Lisle's tragedy  Les Érinnyes and with the dramatic oratorio, Marie-Magdeleine, both of which were performed at the Théâtre de l'Odéon. His reputation as a composer was growing, but at this stage he earned most of his income from teaching, giving lessons for six hours a day. The answer to this question is:","output":"Don César de Bazan (Paris, 1872).  My step-by-step reasoning: 1. The context states that Massenet returned to Paris and completed his first large-scale stage work. 2. This work is described as an opéra comique in four acts. 3. The name of this work is given as Don César de Bazan (Paris, 1872). 4. It is mentioned that this work was a failure."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given a hypothesis and an update.

Information:  - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - Homogenic is the third international solo album by Icelandic musician Björk, released in September 1997. Produced by Björk, Mark Bell, Guy Sigsworth, Howie B and Markus Dravs, it was released on One Little Indian Records. The music of \\"Homogenic\\" was a new style for Björk, focusing on similar-sounding music combining electronic beats and string instruments with songs in tribute to her native country Iceland. \\"Homogenic\\" was originally to be produced in her home in London, but was later recorded in Spain. \\"Homogenic\\" marked the first of several production collaborations between Björk and Mark Bell, whom Björk would cite as a major influence on her musical career. The album peaked at number twenty-eight on the \\"Billboard\\" 200, and at number four on the UK Albums Chart.  - \`\` Alarm Call '' is a song by Björk released as the fourth single from her fourth studio album Homogenic , peaking at # 33 in the UK . The sped - up \`\` radio version '' of the song ( which was also featured in the video ) was used in the 1999 film The Mod Squad .  - One Little Indian Records is a London-based independent record label that rose from the ashes of punk rock record company Spiderleg Records. It was set up in 1985 by members of various anarcho-punk bands, and managed by former Flux of Pink Indians bassist Derek Birkett.  - Trip hop is a subgenre of electronic music that originated in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom, especially Bristol. Deriving from later idioms of acid house, the term was first used by the British music media and press as a way to describe the more experimental variant of breakbeat emerging from the Bristol Sound scene, which contained influences of soul, funk and jazz. It has been described as \\"Europe's alternative choice in the second half of the '90s\\", and \\"a fusion of hip hop and electronica until neither genre is recognisable\\". Trip hop music fuses several styles and has much in common with other genres; it has several qualities similar to ambient music, and its drum-based breakdowns share characteristics with hip hop. It also contains elements of R&B, dub and house, as well as other electronic music. Trip hop can be highly experimental.  - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate.  - Björk Guðmundsdóttir (born 21 November 1965), known as Björk, is an Icelandic singer, songwriter, producer, DJ, and actress. Over her four-decade career, she has developed an eclectic musical style that draws on a wide range of influences and genres spanning electronic, pop, experimental, classical, trip hop, IDM, and avant-garde styles. She initially became known as the lead singer of the alternative rock band The Sugarcubes, whose 1987 single \\"Birthday\\" was a hit on US and UK indie stations and a favorite among music critics. Björk embarked on a solo career in 1993, coming to prominence as a solo artist with albums such as \\"Debut\\" (1993), \\"Post\\" (1995), and \\"Homogenic\\" (1997), while collaborating with a range of artists and exploring a variety of multimedia projects.   - The UK Albums Chart (currently called the Official Albums Chart) is a list of albums ranked by physical and digital sales and (from March 2015) audio streaming in the United Kingdom.

Question: What does Herod order his guard to do if Herod loses the fight with Cort? Movie plot title: The Quick and the Dead Movie plot: Duncan McKaskel (Tom Conti) and his wife, Susanna (Kate Capshaw), a married couple who, along with their 12-year-old son, Tom (Kenny Morrison), are travelling West hoping to start a new life. They have left a cholera-stricken wagon train and, alone, arrive in a small dilapidated town. Here, they meet no-good Doc Shabbitt (Matt Clark) and ask for directions. He suggests they stay in a deserted local building, but McKaskel senses danger and they leave. Shabbit decides to steal two of their horses. Con Vallian (Sam Elliott) is chasing a half-breed Indian, the latest recruit to Shabbit's gang who, it transpires, Vallian has tracked for hundreds of miles for personal reasons. Vallian witnesses the homesteader's encounter with Shabbit and turns up at the McKaskel's wagon during supper. He advises them their horses have been stolen. Against Susanna's advice, Duncan rides into town and tries to reclaim the horses. An intense gunfight ensues when Vallian, who has secretly followed him, shoots some of the Shabbit gang. When Doc Shabbitt finds that his son, who was about to shoot McKaskel in the back, has been killed, he vows to pursue the family and seek revenge.

Question: What is the job of the primary motor cortex? Context: The brain contains several motor areas that project directly to the spinal cord. At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. At a higher level are areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, which is responsible for coordinating movements of the arms and legs. At a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex, a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the pyramidal tract. This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements. Other motor-related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas. Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. When Scott was a boy, he sometimes travelled with his father from Selkirk to Melrose, where some of his novels are set. At a certain spot the old gentleman would stop the carriage and take his son to a stone on the site of the Battle of Melrose (1526).  During the summers from 1804, Scott made his home at the large house of Ashestiel, on the south bank of the River Tweed 6 miles (9.7 km) north of Selkirk. When his lease on this property expired in 1811, Scott bought Cartley Hole Farm, downstream on the Tweed nearer Melrose. The farm had the nickname of \\"Clarty Hole\\", and when Scott built a family cottage there in 1812 he named it \\"Abbotsford\\". He continued to expand the estate, and built Abbotsford House in a series of extensions. The farmhouse developed into a wonderful home that has been likened to a fairy palace. Scott was a pioneer of the Scottish Baronial style of architecture, therefore Abbotsford is festooned with turrets and stepped gabling. Through windows enriched with the insignia of heraldry the sun shone on suits of armour, trophies of the chase, a library of more than 9,000 volumes, fine furniture, and still finer pictures. Panelling of oak and cedar and carved ceilings relieved by coats of arms in their correct colours added to the beauty of the house.  It is estimated that the building cost Scott more than PS25,000 (equivalent to PS1,900,000 in 2016). More land was purchased until Scott owned nearly 1,000 acres (4.0 km2). A Roman road with a ford near Melrose used in olden days by the abbots of Melrose suggested the name of Abbotsford. Scott was buried in Dryburgh Abbey, where his wife had earlier been interred. Nearby is a large statue of William Wallace, one of Scotland's many romanticised historical figures. Abbotsford later gave its name to the Abbotsford Club, founded in 1834 in memory of Sir Walter Scott. Answer this question \\"Why did he name it like that\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Scott named his home \\"Abbotsford\\" because there was a Roman road with a ford near Melrose that was used by the abbots of Melrose in olden days.

She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. What is the answer for the question: Whose palace was El Greco obliged to leave? from the following article ?  By the time El Greco arrived in Rome, Michelangelo and Raphael were dead, but their example continued to be paramount, and somewhat overwhelming for young painters. El Greco was determined to make his own mark in Rome defending his personal artistic views, ideas and style. He singled out Correggio and Parmigianino for particular praise, but he did not hesitate to dismiss Michelangelo's Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel; he extended an offer to Pope Pius V to paint over the whole work in accord with the new and stricter Catholic thinking. When he was later asked what he thought about Michelangelo, El Greco replied that \\"he was a good man, but he did not know how to paint\\". And thus we are confronted by a paradox: El Greco is said to have reacted most strongly or even condemned Michelangelo, but found it impossible to withstand his influence. Michelangelo's influence can be seen in later El Greco works such as the Allegory of the Holy League. By painting portraits of Michelangelo, Titian, Clovio and, presumably, Raphael in one of his works (The Purification of the Temple), El Greco not only expressed his gratitude but also advanced the claim to rival these masters. As his own commentaries indicate, El Greco viewed Titian, Michelangelo and Raphael as models to emulate. In his 17th century Chronicles, Giulio Mancini included El Greco among the painters who had initiated, in various ways, a re-evaluation of Michelangelo's teachings.Because of his unconventional artistic beliefs (such as his dismissal of Michelangelo's technique) and personality, El Greco soon acquired enemies in Rome. Architect and writer Pirro Ligorio called him a \\"foolish foreigner\\", and newly discovered archival material reveals a skirmish with Farnese, who obliged the young artist to leave his palace. On 6 July 1572, El Greco officially complained about this event. A few months later, on 18 September 1572, he paid his dues to the Guild of Saint Luke in Rome as a miniature painter. At the end of that year, El Greco opened his own workshop and... Answer:","output":"The answer to the question is that El Greco was obliged to leave the palace of Farnese.

Context: GoDaddy has pulled the plug on another online peddler of violence. The popular internet registration service last week shut down altright.com, a website created by white nationalist leader Richard Spencer and popular with many in the so-called alt-right movement. The takedown is the latest example of how companies like GoDaddy are increasingly responding to growing public pressure to clamp down on violent sites in the wake of the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last summer. GoDaddy, which registers domains for more than 75 million websites around the world, said it generally does not delist sites that promote hate, racism and bigotry on the ground that such content is protected as free speech. But it said altright.com had \\"crossed the line and encouraged and promoted violence in a direct and threatening manner.\\" \\"In instances where a site goes beyond the mere exercise of these freedoms, however, and crosses over to promoting, encouraging or otherwise engaging in specific acts of violence against any person, we will take action,\\" GoDaddy said in a statement emailed to VOA.

Have the collar on your dog for a week before turning it on. Begin using your electronic remote training collar. Reinforce commands your dog understands. Control bad behavior.\\" Article:","output":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Using an Electronic Remote Training Collar for Your Dog Introduction An electronic remote training collar, often referred to as a shock collar or e-collar, can be an effective tool for training your dog, especially for reinforcing commands and controlling bad behavior. With proper usage, these collars can help you build a strong bond with your dog, promote consistent obedience, and establish additional boundaries. This article provides a step-by-step guide on using an electronic remote training collar, based on the provided instructions, to ensure that you use it safely and effectively. Step 1: Read the Instructions that Come with the Collar Before using your new electronic remote training collar, read the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Different collars may have unique features like a range in their effective distance, various levels of stimulation, or even specific programming modes. By reading the instructions thoroughly, you'll become familiar with your collar's functionalities and learn how to use it properly. Step 2: Install the Batteries Both the collar and the transmitter require batteries to function. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines on how to install the batteries properly and ensure that they are secure before proceeding. Make sure you have replacement batteries on hand, as the life of a battery can vary widely depending on usage and brand. Step 3: Attach the Collar to Your Dog's Neck Once the batteries are in place, it's time to attach the collar to your dog's neck. Ensure that the collar is snug enough so it doesn't move around too much, but loose enough for your dog to feel comfortable – a good rule of thumb is to allow two fingers to fit between the collar and your dog's neck. Avoid placing the collar too close to the ears, as this can cause accidental stimulation. Step 4: Acclimation Period Before utilizing the electronic remote training collar to reinforce commands, your dog needs to acclimate to wearing the collar itself. Veterinarians and expert dog trainers recommend allowing your dog to wear the collar for a week without activating it. This period ensures that the dog doesn't associate the collar with any specific training sessions or negative experiences. Step 5: Begin Using Your Electronic Remote Training Collar Now that your dog has had a week to adjust to the collar, you can begin using it for training purposes. Start by reinforcing commands your dog already understands, such as \\"sit,\\" \\"stay,\\" and \\"come.\\" Initially, use a lower stimulation level to avoid overwhelming your dog. Gradually increase the level to maintain their attention and correct their behavior as needed. Step 6: Reinforce Commands Your Dog Understands As you start using the collar's remote to provide feedback during your training sessions, it's crucial to reinforce commands the dog already knows. This reinforcement will help solidify the connection between your commands, the collar's stimulation, and the desired behavior. Make sure to consistently issue the same commands, as this will establish a routine and help your dog understand your expectations. Step 7: Control Bad Behavior In addition to reinforcing positive behavior, an electronic remote training collar can also assist in correcting unwanted behaviors, like excess barking or jumping on visitors. It's important to be careful and use lower-stimulation levels to prevent your dog from becoming fearful or anxious. Persistent unwanted behaviors may require further evaluation and intervention from a professional dog trainer. Conclusion An electronic remote training collar has the potential to be an effective tool for training your dog. By carefully following the manufacturer's guidelines and ensuring battery installation, proper collar fitting, and a thorough acclimation process, you will increase the collar's effectiveness in reinforcing appropriate behaviors and controlling unwanted ones. Remember, your dog's overall well-being should always be your top priority, meaning that patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement are key components of a successful training experience using an electronic collar."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: Reflection of the original signal also occurs when it hits an extended conductive surface, in a fashion similar to a mirror. This effect can also be used to increase signal through the use of a reflector, normally placed behind the active element and spaced so the reflected signal reaches the element in-phase. Generally the reflector will remain highly reflective even if it is not solid; gaps less than 1⁄10 generally have little effect on the outcome. For this reason, reflectors often take the form of wire meshes or rows of passive elements, which makes them lighter and less subject to wind. The parabolic reflector is perhaps the best known example of a reflector-based antenna, which has an effective area far greater than the active element alone.

Context: Oklahoma City has a very active severe weather season from March through June, especially during April and May. Being in the center of what is colloquially referred to as Tornado Alley, it is prone to especially frequent and severe tornadoes, as well as very severe hailstorms and occasional derechoes. Tornadoes have occurred in every month of the year and a secondary smaller peak also occurs during autumn, especially October. The Oklahoma City metropolitan area is one of the most tornado-prone major cities in the world, with about 150 tornadoes striking within the city limits since 1890. Since the time weather records have been kept, Oklahoma City has been struck by thirteen violent tornadoes, eleven F/EF4s and two F/EF5. On May 3, 1999 parts of southern Oklahoma City and nearby suburban communities suffered from one of the most powerful tornadoes on record, an F5 on the Fujita scale, with wind speeds estimated by radar at 318 mph (510 km/h). On May 20, 2013, far southwest Oklahoma City, along with Newcastle and Moore, was hit again by a EF5 tornado; it was 0.5 to 1.3 miles (0.80 to 2.09 km) wide and killed 23 people. Less than two weeks later, on May 31, another outbreak affected the Oklahoma City area, including an EF1 and an EF0 within the city and a tornado several miles west of the city that was 2.6 miles (4.2 km) in width, the widest tornado ever recorded.
