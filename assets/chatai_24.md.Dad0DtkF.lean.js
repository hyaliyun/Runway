Movie plot title: Requiem for a Dream Movie plot: During the summer in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, widow Sara Goldfarb constantly watches television, particularly infomercials hosted by Tappy Tibbons. After receiving an unexpected phone call that she has won a spot to participate on a television game show, she becomes obsessed with regaining the youthful appearance she possesses in an old photograph. To reach her goal, she goes to a doctor to discuss weight loss. The doctor gives her a prescription for weight-loss amphetamine pills throughout the day and a sedative at night. As the months go by, Sara's tolerance for the pills adjusts and as a result she is no longer able to feel the same high the pills once gave her. When her invitation does not arrive, she increases her dosage from double to triple and, as a result, begins to suffer from amphetamine psychosis. Meanwhile, Sara's son Harry is young and has an adventurous life with his girlfriend Marion Silver and best friend Tyrone C. Love. He and his friends are all heroin addicts, and Harry funds his habit through petty theft, including from his own mother who turns a blind eye. Tyrone decides that to support themselves, they should enter the illegal drug trade around Coney Island. With the promised money, each addict hopes to achieve their dreams. At first, the trio's drug dealing business thrives. However, Tyrone is imprisoned after fleeing the scene of a drug-gang assassination and Harry uses most of their earned money to post bail. After the assassination, the three find it much more difficult to find heroin due to supply being restricted by the Florida-based wholesalers. Eventually, Tyrone hears that the wholesaler is making a shipment, but the price is doubled and the minimum amount is high. Harry suggests that Marion ask for the needed cash from her psychiatrist in exchange for sex, which she does begrudgingly, and at a cost to her relationship with Harry. Tyrone and Harry go to meet the wholesaler, but the rest of the local low-level dealers are also there, and tensions are running high. There is... The answer to this question is:","output":"In the movie \\"Requiem for a Dream,\\" it is Tyrone C. Love who is being taunted by prison guards. After being imprisoned due to fleeing the scene of a drug-gang assassination, Tyrone experiences the harsh realities of prison life, including mistreatment and taunts from the guards. The situation parallels the other characters' downward spirals caused by their addiction and obsession, highlighting the film's exploration of the destructive nature of drug addiction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sırbistan şeker rafinelerinin özelleştirilmesinin ardından basın tarafından eleştirilen Kostiç şöyle diyor: \\"Tamamlanan özelleştirmelerin sürekli olarak denetlenmesi iyi bir şey değil. Translate this to English?","output":"Following the privatization of Serbian sugar refineries, Kostić, who has been criticized by the press, says: \\"The continuous monitoring of completed privatizations is not a good thing.\\" In this statement, Kostić seems to be responding to criticisms from the press about the privatization of Serbia's sugar refineries. These criticisms might be related to concerns about a lack of transparency, the influence of private interests, or the potential negative impact on local economies and communities. However, Kostić argues that constantly monitoring the privatization process after it has been completed is not beneficial. One reason Kostić might believe continuous monitoring is not a good idea could be that it may create an environment of uncertainty for investors, which in turn could hinder the growth and development of privatized industries. Instead, he might prefer a more hands-off approach from the authorities after privatization has taken place, allowing the market and private actors to determine the future course of the industry without undue interference from the public sector. Moreover, Kostić might think that criticisms from the press are exaggerated or unfounded, and that the privatization of sugar refineries has led to positive outcomes, such as increased efficiency, better resource allocation, and a more competitive market. In this context, Kostić may believe that the press should focus more on these positive aspects and devote less attention to scrutinizing the privatization process after it is completed. This could help create a more conducive environment for foreign investment and private sector growth in Serbia. On the other hand, the press and other critics might argue that continuous monitoring is necessary to ensure that privatized industries are operating in a fair and transparent manner, and that they are meeting their obligations to local communities and the environment. In their view, leaving privatized industries entirely to market forces could result in negative consequences, such as job losses, income inequality, and environmental degradation. In summary, Kostić's statement highlights a broader debate about the benefits and drawbacks of privatization, as well as the appropriate level of public oversight and scrutiny following the privatization process. While Kostić believes that continuous monitoring of completed privatizations is not a good idea, others may hold different views about the role of public authorities and the press in ensuring fair and responsible private sector operations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What story did Roy begin to tell Alexandria? Movie title: The Fall Movie plot: Los Angeles, 1915: stuntman Roy Walker (Lee Pace) is hospitalized, as he is bedridden and possibly paralyzed after a jump he took in his first film. He meets Alexandria (Catinca Untaru), a young Romanian-born patient in the hospital who is recovering from a broken arm, and begins to tell her a story about her namesake. Alexandria is told she has to leave, but Roy promises to tell her an epic tale if she returns the next day. The next morning, as Roy spins his tale of fantasy, Alexandria's imagination brings his characters to life. Roy's tale is about five heroes: a silent Indian warrior (Jeetu Verma), a muscular ex-slave named Otta Benga (Marcus Wesley), an Italian explosives expert called Luigi (Robin Smith), Charles Darwin (Leo Bill) with a pet monkey called Wallace, and a masked swashbuckling bandit. An evil ruler named Governor Odious (Daniel Caltagirone) has committed an offense against each of the five, who all seek revenge. The heroes are later joined by a sixth hero, a mystic. Alexandria vividly imagines her friends and people around her appearing as the characters in Roy's story. Although Roy develops affection for Alexandria, he also has an ulterior motive: by gaining her trust, he tricks her into stealing morphine from the hospital pharmacy so that he can attempt suicide; a choice driven by his love leaving him for the actor for whom he provided the stunt footage. However, Alexandria returns with only three pills, having mistaken the \\"E\\" on the piece of paper Roy gave her for a \\"3\\". The stories become a collaborative tale to which Alexandria also contributes. Alexandria herself becomes a character: while Roy is the masked bandit, she is his daughter. Roy talks Alexandria into stealing a bottle of morphine tablets locked in a fellow patient's cabinet, and then downs it all. The next morning, Roy awakens from his sleep and realizes he is only alive because his neighboring patient is receiving a placebo rather than actual morphine. Alexandria, desperate to help Roy, sneaks out of bed to the pharmacy.... A:","output":"The story that Roy begins to tell Alexandria in the movie \\"The Fall\\" is about her namesake.

Ai Kago (Jia Hu  Ya Yi , Kago Ai), born February 7, 1988 in Yamatotokada, Nara, Japan, is a Japanese singer, actress, author, and former Guinness World Record holder. Kago began her career at the age of 12 as a member of the idol group Morning Musume. In the same year, she became a founding member of Minimoni. Throughout the second half of 2010, Kago became unhappy with the direction of her work. Around the same time, she began dating restaurant owner Haruhiko Ando, who acted as an in-between for her agency and herself. Since beginning a relationship with Ando, Kago cancelled several jobs at the last minute, causing her agency to suspend her activities. Despite this, she participated in a live performance and opened a separate blog without permission.  Kago parted ways with R&A Promotions in November 2010 despite her contract ending in March 2013. As a response, in 2011, Kazuyuki Ito, president of Mainstream (an associate of R&A Promotions), declared that the agency planned on suing for 100 million yen in damages for contract violations. During that time, Kago's career was also derailed by her personal life. In September 2011, Ando was arrested for alleged extortion and claiming to have connections with the yakuza. In the same month, Kago was rushed to a nearby hospital after agency officials found her on the floor of her apartment with cuts to her wrists. Her life was reported to be not in danger, though there were speculations that it was a planned suicide. Following the incident, she and Ando registered their marriage, and Kago became pregnant.  After spending 2012 out of the public eye with the birth of her daughter, Minami, Kago transferred to a new agency in 2013. Planning to revive her music career, she formed an idol group, which was later named Girls Beat!! The group would be crowd-sourced using lyrics, music, and costume ideas submitted by fans. Remi Kita and Ryona Himeno were recruited as the other two members after passing the auditions.  Girls Beat!! released their first single, \\"Sekai Seifuku\\" on July 22, 2014. Their activities were abruptly put on hold when an arrest warrant was put out for Ando in October on suspicions of loaning money at illegal interest rates. Kago later filed for divorce, planning to continue activities once the divorce was finalized. Although Kago was eventually successful in doing so, in August 2015, her contract with her agency expired, though she continued activities with Girls Beat!! in November. On February 29, 2016, she graduated from the group.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: what happened in 2011?","output":"In 2011, several events occurred in Ai Kago's life.

And they delivered a diplomatic bonbon. The three officials told South Korea that Pyongyang is willing to hold a new round of high-level meetings between late October and early November, South Korea's Unification Ministry said in a statement Saturday. \\"Within my memory...there was never ever such a high-level visit. Never,\\" said North Korea analyst Andrei Lankov, from Seoul's Kookmin University. Lankov said two of the three visitors \\"are essentially number two and number three in North Korean official hierarchy.\\" The visit and offer for high-level dialogue come as a surprise for many who believed that the tensions between the two countries would further escalate, particularly due to Kim Jong Un's absence. The three high-ranking North Korean officials, Choe Ryong Hae, Kim Yang Gon, and Hwang Pyong So, met with South Korea's National Security Adviser, Kim Kwan-jin, and Unification Minister, Ryoo Kihl-jae, expressing their intentions for resuming inter-Korean talks. In response to the North's offer for high-level meetings, South Korea has cautiously welcomed the proposal and urged Pyongyang to commit to denuclearization before engaging in further talks. \\"We have consistently maintained that the door for dialogue and communications is open… However, the North should show its sincerity in pursuing denuclearization through concrete actions,\\" said South Korean Unification Ministry spokesperson, Lim Byeong Cheol. As the proposed meetings would mark a major shift in diplomatic relations between the two Koreas, regional and global powers are closely monitoring the situation. The United States, which has been involved in previous Six-Party Talks aimed at North Korea's denuclearization, has expressed support for the inter-Korean dialogue while emphasizing the importance of North Korea taking denuclearization seriously. In the meantime, the unprecedented visit has stirred speculations about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's health and whereabouts. North Korean state media reported that Kim Jong Un had been suffering from \\"discomfort\\" and showed images of him walking with a limp. Analysts are discussing how Kim's health issues and his prolonged absence from public life might impact the current power dynamics within North Korea and potentially affect the planned high-level talks. Should the high-level meetings go ahead as proposed, the topics of discussion are expected to include denuclearization efforts, the reunion of separated families, and the reestablishment of economic cooperation between the two Koreas. Experts have stressed the importance of engaging diplomatically with North Korea, rather than relying exclusively on sanctions and isolation, as this may help create a more conducive environment for advancing peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. However, these developments come with cautious optimism. The history of inter-Korean talks has seen numerous setbacks and failed agreements. The most recent high-level talks, held in February 2014, resulted in a planned reunion of separated families but little progress on other pressing issues. Nevertheless, the prospect of renewed inter-Korean dialogue marks a significant step forward and could potentially pave the way for improving relations between the two Koreas and a gradually more stable and peaceful Korean Peninsula."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Nothing, it seemed, was too small or inconsequential to send back and forth. In May 1996, Hillary Clinton clipped a \\"Mixed Media\\" cartoon and sent it to Blair and her husband, Jim, with a note that read, \\"It is rare that I can send you a comic strip you and Jim haven't seen -- but this one is too good not to share.\\"","output":"The cartoon, clearly inspired by the current political climate, depicted a satirical view of Washington D.C.

Given the fact that:  The surface is heated by the Sun and some of that heat radiates back into the air. This makes the temperature higher near the surface than at higher altitudes.  Answer the question:   Devon's cat, Fluffy, is looking for a nice warm spot to lay out in the sun. Because of how the sun heats the earth, and how some heat radiates into the air, the cat laying on the ground, rather than high up in a tree branch, would keep the cat cooler or warmer? The answer to this question is:","output":"Given the fact that the surface is heated by the Sun and some of that heat radiates back into the air, making the temperature higher near the surface than at higher altitudes, Fluffy the cat laying on the ground would likely be warmer than if she were high up in a tree branch. Step 1: Understand the relationship between solar heating and temperature. The Sun heats the Earth's surface, and some of the heat is radiated back into the air. This causes a temperature gradient with height, with higher temperatures near the surface and cooler temperatures at higher altitudes. Step 2: Determine location preferences for the cat. Fluffy is seeking a warm spot to lay in the sun. As the temperature is generally higher near the surface, she would prefer to be closer to the ground for maximum warmth. Step 3: Compare surface temperature to higher altitudes. The temperature near the surface is generally higher than temperatures at higher altitudes. Since Fluffy wants to find a warm spot, being closer to the ground with higher temperatures would be preferred compared to being in a tree branch at a higher altitude where it would be cooler. The answer to this question is: warmer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Z hygienickýho ústavu.

Sentence from a movie review: , really stupid  Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","output":"Based on the sentence provided from the movie review, which states \\", really stupid,\\" it can be inferred that the movie was seen negatively by the reviewer. The use of the term \\"really stupid\\" implies a strong disdain or lack of appreciation for the content, plot, or overall quality of the film.  When assessing a movie review, it is important to consider the language and tone employed by the reviewer. In this case, the phrase \\"really stupid\\" is an indicator that the reviewer had a negative experience while watching the movie. This perspective could have stemmed from a range of factors, such as poor acting, an uninteresting story, illogical plot developments, or issues with production aspects like visual effects or sound quality. It is crucial, however, to recognize that a single sentence from a movie review might not provide the complete picture of a reviewer's opinions. A longer excerpt or the full review would offer more context to understand whether the negativity expressed in the sentence is pervasive throughout the review or if there are any redeeming qualities mentioned. Additionally, it is always helpful to read multiple reviews from different sources to gain a comprehensive understanding of how a movie is being received by critics and the general public alike. In conclusion, based on the sentence provided, the movie was seen negatively by this particular reviewer. While this may give an indication of the overall sentiment towards the movie, it is essential to examine additional reviews and context to form a well-rounded opinion about the film's reception."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Prevents the marginalisation of non-believers Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","output":"To prevent the marginalisation of non-believers, it is necessary to present evidence that showcases the benefits of avoiding discrimination based on religious beliefs or the absence thereof. Several studies, initiatives, and examples demonstrate that fostering an inclusive environment for both believers and non-believers alike can lead to more harmonious communities and a stronger framework for human rights and equality. 1. Legal Frameworks and Policies: Laws such as the United States' First Amendment and the European Convention on Human Rights protect an individual's freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, which also extends to non-believers. Upholding these laws can reduce instances of discrimination and marginalisation. For example, in the 2014 case of Town of Greece v. Galloway, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled to allow non-believers to lead prayers at public meetings as long as a policy of nondiscrimination is followed, demonstrating the voice given to non-believers in the legal process. 2. Human Rights Reports: International human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have documented instances of discrimination against non-believers around the world. By drawing attention to these cases, these organizations are working towards preventing marginalisation and advocating for equal rights for all, regardless of religious beliefs or lack thereof. 3. Educational Programs: Several studies have shown that education can positively impact tolerance and acceptance of diverse beliefs. Implementing comprehensive religious education programs that include discussions on atheism, agnosticism, and secularism can foster understanding and respect for non-believers by debunking misconceptions and stereotypes. 4. Interfaith and Secular Organizations: Groups such as the Interfaith Youth Core, the Parliament of the World's Religions, and the Secular Student Alliance work to promote cooperation and understanding among people of different faiths or no faith at all. By emphasizing the value of dialogue, these organizations help to reduce the marginalisation of non-believers and create more inclusive environments in schools, workplaces, and communities. 5. Public Opinions and Surveys: Surveys conducted by organizations such as the Pew Research Center show a growing acceptance of non-religious individuals within society. For instance, a 2019 Pew study indicated that 65% of Americans said it was not necessary to believe in God to be moral and have good values, representing a shift in public opinion that can contribute to reducing discrimination against non-believers. 6. Media Representation: Increasing positive media representation of non-believers in literature, film, and television can help to dispel negative stereotypes and validate their experiences as valuable members of society. Examples include popular television series like \\"The Big Bang Theory\\" and \\"House M.D.\\", where non-believing characters are shown as intelligent, empathetic, and well-rounded members of their respective communities. 7. Personal Testimonies: Sharing personal narratives of non-believers on platforms such as blogs, podcasts, and public speaking events can humanize individuals who do not subscribe to religious beliefs and contribute to breaking down barriers between believers and non-believers. These firsthand accounts can assist in fostering empathy and promoting inclusivity among diverse groups. 8. Anti-discrimination Laws: Some countries, such as the United Kingdom, have specific anti-discrimination laws that protect individuals from discrimination based on religious beliefs, including lack of religious beliefs. By enforcing these laws, governments can ensure equal treatment for non-believers and, over time, contribute to the normalization and acceptance of non-religious individuals in society. In conclusion, preventing the marginalisation of non-believers is possible through legal frameworks, human rights advocacy, educational initiatives, interfaith and secular organizations, public opinion shifts, media representation, personal testimonies, and anti-discrimination laws. These elements provide evidence that promoting inclusivity for people with different beliefs or no beliefs at all can lead to more harmonious societies and stronger human rights protection."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To figure out your skin type, first wash and dry your face and wait an hour. Then, note how dry or oily your skin is. A more detailed guide can be found here. Once you know your skin type, there are a few basic categories into which your skin will likely fall. Most skin will range from ‘oily’ to ‘dry,’ with ‘normal’ between the two. The other two main categories are ‘sensitive’ and ‘mature.’  Moisturizers for dry skin are generally petroleum or oil-based. Oily skin calls for a water-based moisturizer. It should also be noncomedogenic to prevent your pores from clogging. Normal skin also needs a water-based moisturizer, but one which contains some oils, though much less than dry skin needs. Sensitive skin needs a moisturizer with medicinal or soothing properties. Look for moisturizers with chamomile or aloe, but stay away from those with fragrances, dyes, or acids. For older mature skin, you should look for a petroleum-based moisturizer rich in oils. There are many moisturizers on the market designed for mature skin that contain ingredients to help reduce wrinkles as well.  Try out body butter for a natural, oil-based option.

Camille Anna Paglia (; born April 2, 1947) is an American academic and social critic. Paglia has been a professor at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, since 1984. Paglia is critical of many aspects of modern culture, and is the author of Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson (1990) and other books. Paglia was born in Endicott, New York, the eldest child of Pasquale and Lydia Anne (nee Colapietro) Paglia. All four of her grandparents were born in Italy. Her mother immigrated to the United States at five years old from Ceccano, in the province of Frosinone, Lazio, Italy. Additionally, Paglia has stated that her father's side of the family were from the Campanian towns of Avellino, Benevento, and Caserta. Paglia attended primary school in rural Oxford, New York, where her family lived in a working farmhouse. Her father, a veteran of World War II, taught at the Oxford Academy high school, and exposed his young daughter to art through books he brought home about French art history. In 1957, her family moved to Syracuse, New York, so that her father could begin graduate school; he eventually became a professor of Romance languages at Le Moyne College. She attended the Edward Smith Elementary School, T. Aaron Levy Junior High and William Nottingham High School. In 1992 Carmelia Metosh, her Latin teacher for three years, said, \\"She always has been controversial. Whatever statements were being made (in class), she had to challenge them. She made good points then, as she does now.\\" Paglia thanked Metosh in the acknowledgements to Sexual Personae, later describing her as \\"the dragon lady of Latin studies, who breathed fire at principals and school boards\\".  She took a variety of names when she was at Spruce Ridge Camp, including Anastasia (her confirmation name, inspired by the film Anastasia starring Ingrid Bergman), Stacy, and Stanley. A crucially significant event for her was when an outhouse exploded after she poured too much lime into the latrine. \\"That symbolized everything I would do with my life and work. Excess and extravagance and explosiveness. I would be someone who would look into the latrine of culture, into pornography and crime and psychopathology... and I would drop the bomb into it\\".  For more than a decade, Paglia was the partner of artist Alison Maddex. Paglia legally adopted Maddex's son (who was born in 2002). In 2007 the couple separated but remained \\"harmonious co-parents,\\" in Paglia's words, who lived two miles apart.  Paglia has claimed to identify as transgender and stated that she has \\"never identified at all with being a woman\\". What did she do at spruce ridge camp?","output":"At Spruce Ridge Camp, Camille Paglia took on a variety of names, including Anastasia (her confirmation name, inspired by the film Anastasia starring Ingrid Bergman), Stacy, and Stanley.

Q: CONTEXT: Historia  Es difícil atribuir con precisión una fecha segura a la construcción del castillo de Cuéllar. El recinto amurallado ya figura en documentos de 1264, siendo Alfonso X el Sabio quien concede al concejo de Cuéllar la posibilidad de invertir la recaudación de ciertas multas en el arreglo del mismo. A pesar de ello, en el paño de muralla sobre el que se asienta el castillo se hallaron, tras una restauración, restos de una muralla del siglo XI. También de época anterior, quizá de finales del siglo XII o principios del XIII sea la puerta mudéjar que se localiza en la fachada sur del castillo, por lo que las hipótesis más completas sugieren que el castillo debió surgir a la par que el recinto amurallado. La primera noticia en la que se cita el castillo como tal data de 1306, cuando el 2 de octubre de dicho año Fernando IV otorga desde Burgos un documento similar al de su abuelo Alfonso X el Sabio, concediendo el empleo de la recaudación de las multas en “el refazimiento del castillo”.

Given the question: I have a new situation: Stef is a young girl interested in the geography of the world. For her birthday, she got two different representations of the Earth. Her grandparents gave her a map that uses the Mercator projection and her uncle gave her a globe. She is comparing how certain countries look differently on the two gifts and trying to figure out why that is. She is specifically looking at Norway, a country near the North Pole, and Mexico, a country close to the equator.  But I can use this background: The Mercator projection is best within 15 degrees north or south of the equator. Landmasses or countries outside that zone get stretched out of shape. The further the feature is from the equator, the more out of shape it is stretched. For example, if you look at Greenland on a globe, you see it is a relatively small country near the North Pole. Yet, on a Mercator projection, Greenland looks almost as big the United States. Because Greenland is closer to the pole, the continent's shape and size are greatly increased. The United States is closer to its true dimensions.  What is an answer for this question: Will Norway be less accurately represented on the globe or the map? The answer is:","output":"Norway will be less accurately represented on the map using the Mercator projection compared to the globe. This is due to the limitations of the Mercator projection, which inevitably distorts the size, shape, and areas of landmasses as one moves further away from the equator.  The Mercator projection is designed to be more effective and accurate within 15 degrees north or south of the equator. As a country's latitude increases, the distortion in size and shape becomes more pronounced. In the case of Norway, it is situated at a high latitude, being close to the North Pole. Therefore, its representation on the Mercator map will be significantly distorted compared to its appearance on the globe. On the other hand, the globe provides a more accurate representation of the Earth's surface, as it maintains the correct proportions, sizes, and shapes of landmasses. It is a three-dimensional model, which eliminates the distortion involved in flat maps, like the Mercator projection. Mexico, being a country close to the equator, would be more accurately represented on both the Mercator map and the globe. However, it is still worth noting that the globe will always provide a more precise representation, as it avoids the inherent distortion problems that arise from transferring a three-dimensional object (Earth) onto a two-dimensional surface (map). In summary, Norway will be less accurately represented on the Mercator map compared to the globe due to the distortions caused by the Mercator projection at higher latitudes. Comparatively, the globe provides the most accurate representation of countries and landmasses, regardless of their location on the Earth since it maintains the correct proportions and sizes of these features without distortion."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Paragraph: \\"New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg recently took aim at the Peach State. Bloomberg was on CNN several weeks ago to discuss a report that named Georgia among the states with the weakest gun laws. \\"\\"Do the states where they have weaker laws have more crime?\\"\\" asked CNN's Kiran Chetry. \\"\\"There's no argument about that,\\"\\" Bloomberg replied. National Rifle Association spokeswoman Rachel Parsons called Bloomberg's claim \\"\\"absolutely ridiculous.\\"\\" \\"\\"If that were the case, Washington, D.C., Chicago and New York would be some of the safest cities in our country, and they are simply not,\\"\\" Parsons said. \\"\\"Yet, they have some of the strictest gun laws in the country.\\"\\" The nation's capital had a higher violent crime rate than any of the 50 states in each of the past three years, according to FBI data. New York was at the other end of the spectrum, the data showed. The Big Apple had the lowest crime rate among the nation's 25 largest cities, the FBI data showed. But Bloomberg answered a question about states, so let's dig into his claim a little deeper. The report, \\"\\"Trace the Guns: The Link Between Gun Laws and Interstate Gun Trafficking,\\"\\" was put together for a group called Mayors Against Illegal Guns and completed in September. Bloomberg, an independent, is co-chair of the coalition. Georgia mayors listed as coalition members include Atlanta's Kasim Reed, East Point's Earnestine Pittman, Roswell's Jere Wood and Savannah's Otis Johnson. Ten states, half of them located in the South, are listed in the report as having weak gun laws. They are Alabama, Alaska, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nevada, South Carolina, West Virginia and Virginia. Bloomberg, a vocal advocate of gun control, filed lawsuits against eight gun shops in Georgia and in 19 other states in 2006 he argued had relatively lax gun laws. Most of the cases were settled. Others defaulted, and a couple of cases were dismissed. Researchers looked at several topics concerning violence and where the guns came from that were used in the crimes, using data from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. In each of the past four years, the report found Georgia led the nation in the number of guns sold here that were used in crimes in other states.Per capita, Georgia was 10th on the list. The researchers reached that conclusion by dividing the number of guns sold by 100,000 residents. Mississippi was first.New York ranked next to last on the list, ahead of Hawaii. The report contains a checklist of 10 \\"\\"key gun laws\\"\\" and which states have passed those laws and which ones have not to determine which states have weak gun laws. The laws include whether a state requires background checks for all handgun sales at gun shows, if the state prohibits gun possession by violent misdemeanantsand whether the state requires reporting of lost or stolen guns. Georgia has enacted two of the 10 laws. Georgia requires state inspection of gun dealers. Gun dealers who don’t conduct background checks of prospective gun owners can go to jail. Some groups, such as the National Shooting Sports Foundation, have criticized the findings, saying crime has \\"\\"plummeted\\"\\" in states said in the study to have weaker gun laws. We reviewed two sets of data to see whether Bloomberg is correct about states that have weak gun laws still have more crime. One supported his argument; the other one offered mixed results. The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps track of firearm deaths by state. Eight of the 10 states said to have \\"\\"weak\\"\\" gun laws were in the top half of states with firearm deaths, according to the most recent CDC figures. The most recent figures, from 2007, were adjusted for population. The results were similar from 2003 to 2006. Georgia ranked between 14th and 20th during those five years. We also looked at the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports, which show violent crime rates for each state and Washington, D.C. Five of the states said to have \\"\\"weak\\"\\" gun laws were in the top half of states of violent crime in 2009. Georgia ranked 20th. Washington, D.C., was first; its violent crime rate was more than twice any state on the list. The results were similar in 2008 and 2007. The FBI warns against using the data to make comparisons, noting they don't take into account variables that might impact a state's crime rate. Harvard University's Department of Health Policy and Management tracks firearm research, frequently does reports on the subject and is considered experts in this field. We talked to two members of its faculty, Matt Miller and David Hemenway, about Bloomberg's answer to the question during the CNN interview. Both men have done studies on similar subjects and believe there is a correlation between places with more guns and homicide. \\"\\"Where there are more guns, there are more deaths and homicides,\\"\\" Miller said. They said there's less research and data on whether states with weaker gun laws have more crime or states with more guns have higher crime rates. \\"\\"Most crimes don't involve guns,\\"\\" Hemenway said. \\"\\"If there's causation at all, it's not clear.\\"\\" So where does this leave us? The CDC numbers do show states with weaker gun laws tend to have more firearm deaths. The FBI data shows some of those states had more violent crime, but others were in the middle of the pack nationally. There are many types of crime, and not all are committed with firearms.\\" Claim: Georgia and other states with weak gun laws have more crime. Output:","output":"Part #1: The claim will always have supporting proof in the paragraph, and the paragraph will have a clear point of view supporting the claim. Usage: The report, \\"Trace the Guns: The Link Between Gun Laws and Interstate Gun Trafficking,\\" found that in each of the past four years, Georgia led the nation in the number of guns sold that were used in crimes in other states.

Summarize this article: To effectively treat breast eczema or an outbreak of psoriasis on your breast, you will likely need a prescription strength corticosteroid product. Topical corticosteroid products, including those available over-the-counter, should not be applied to your breast area without first consulting your physician. Psoriasis outbreaks occur anywhere on the body, including the breast tissue.  Psoriasis patches appear as thick, silvery, sometimes reddened patches, that are itchy and often painful. If you develop a psoriasis outbreak on your breast area, contact your doctor before you apply any medication. Be sure your doctor intends for you to apply medications you may already have on your breast tissue. Breast eczema outbreaks most often occur in the area of the nipple. The area often appears as an itchy, reddened area, and is sometimes accompanied by crusty formations and drainage from the sores. Due to the similarity in the rash associated with breast eczema and a more serious condition, Paget's disease, a medical examination is warranted. Take care to keep the area dry, and avoid harsh soaps or perfumed products. In addition to topical products, your doctor may prescribe oral medications to help treat any infection that may have started, as well as medications that can help control the itching.  Topical products that may be prescribed include corticosteroids that reduce inflammation and promote healing, as well as newer agents, called calcineurin inhibitors. The newer agents are only used in people with severe and repeated flare-ups of eczema. Examples of the newer agents include tacrolimus and pimecrolimus. These agents help your skin to heal, and prevent further flares of eczema or atopic dermatitis. These medications alter the way your immune system works. With outbreaks of both psoriasis and eczema, regardless of where they form on your skin, scratching the areas can lead to complications.  Scratching can cause the condition to spread beyond the immediate area, can cause further skin irritation, and possibly lead to infection. Many people scratch at night without realizing it. Try putting band-aids over your fingertips when you sleep, or sleep with socks over your hands to help avoid scratching. Summary:","output":"To treat breast eczema or psoriasis outbreaks effectively, a prescription strength corticosteroid is often needed. Consult a physician before applying any medication to the breast area, as these conditions can resemble Paget's disease, which requires medical examination. Keep the affected area dry and avoid harsh soaps or perfumes. Doctors may prescribe topical corticosteroids, oral medications, or newer agents such as calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and pimecrolimus) to treat the infection, control itching, and prevent further flare-ups. Avoid scratching the skin, as it can cause the condition to spread, increase irritation, and potentially lead to infection. To prevent unconscious scratching, place band-aids over fingertips or wear socks on hands during sleep."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Amoore is best known for proposing the stereochemical theory for olfaction, which is a significant contribution to the understanding of how the sense of smell functions. 4. Area of specialization: Amoore's focus on the stereochemical theory for olfaction suggests that he specialized in sensory biochemistry, particularly the study of how living organisms perceive and process sensory information related to smell. 5. The stereochemical theory for olfaction: This theory, proposed by John E. Amoore, postulates that the sense of smell is based on the interaction between molecules in the environment (odour molecules) and specialized olfactory receptors in the nose. According to the theory, the shape and stereochemical properties of the odorant molecules play a crucial role in determining how these molecules are perceived and identified by the olfactory receptors. This idea emphasizes the importance of molecular structure in the way our olfactory system works and has paved the way for further research in this area. In summary, John E. Amoore was a British biochemist who made significant contributions to the field of sensory biochemistry, specifically in the area of olfaction. He is best known for proposing the stereochemical theory for olfaction, which has had a major impact on the understanding of how the sense of smell functions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jessica's lungs were much blacker unlike Laura's because","output":"Jessica had been smoking avidly for over a decade, while Laura always kept a safe distance from cigarettes and any form of smoke. Growing up, they both faced their unique set of challenges, but they always seemed to pull through together - as best friends often do. However, the stark difference in their lifestyle choices began taking a toll on their relationship. Despite being aware of the health risks associated with smoking, Jessica couldn't find it within herself to quit. Her life had been tumultuous: an abusive father, an absent mother, and barely anyone she could rely on. As a teenager, she fell into the wrong company and picked up smoking as a way to cope. Laura, on the other hand, grew up in a close-knit family. Nurtured and supported, she managed to forge a headstrong personality. She was driven to overcome whatever challenges life threw her way without resorting to unhealthy habits. Laura's perseverance made her the epitome of resilience, and she often encouraged Jessica to put an end to her smoking habit. As the years rolled by, the once inseparable duo began drifting apart. Jessica's chronic smoking not only darkened her lungs but also caused her a persistent cough and shortness of breath. When witnessing Jessica gasping for air after going up just a few steps, Laura felt a pang of helplessness. Laura, now a successful public health advocate, couldn't bear to watch her best friend suffer. Deciding to take matters into her own hands, she approached Jessica with an action plan: a roadmap to quit smoking. Initially hesitant, Jessica humored Laura's best intentions, and they spent hours discussing how they could hold onto their friendship and work together on breaking the chains of addiction. They agreed on a daily dose of nicotine patches, therapy sessions, and healthier ways to alleviate stress. As the weeks turned into months, Jessica started noticing improvements in her health. Just like the color of her skin changed, she hoped her lungs would one day return to a healthier, lighter shade. Jessica's progress was visible, and the ever-increasing distance between the two friends began to close, as they walked together towards a better, healthier life. At times, Jessica stumbled on the journey and was tempted to light a cigarette in moments of weakness. But Laura was always there to catch her, reminding her of the reasons they had embarked on this journey. In the midst of the healing process, Jessica visited a doctor for a check-up. Reviewing her most recent scans, the doctor noticed her lung function had shown some minor improvements. Although her lungs hadn't completely regained their former health, it was a step in the right direction. On hearing the news, Jessica couldn't hold back her tears. Finally, her commitment to live a healthier life seemed to be taking shape, and her friendship with Laura had become stronger than ever. With the years going by, Jessica's lungs gradually began to heal, and the content of their conversations shifted from smoking to their shared dreams, the future, and enjoying life together. Laura didn't save Jessica's life - she offered her the tools to rebuild it on her own. The journey was not an easy one, but Jessica had the unrelenting support and tough love from her best friend, and that's what made all the difference. In the end, Jessica's lungs may not have become as flawless as Laura's, but their relationship proved that, when faced with adversity, the bond of true friendship can conquer even the darkest of challenges. And at the heart of it all, a once inseparable duo learned that the strongest foundation of any friendship is love, support, and the belief that change is indeed possible."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Cut a cold cucumber into slices, and then place a slice on each of your closed eyelids. Leave them there for 15-20 minutes before removing the cucumber slices. Rinse your eyelids off afterwards. Put the tea bags in the refrigerator to get them cold, and then place one on each closed eyelid. Take the chamomile tea bags off after 20-25 minutes. The tea bags will tighten up your eyelids, making your eyes look fresh and bright. For this mask, you’ll need 4 teaspoons (20 ml) of aloe vera gel, 2 teaspoons (9.9 ml) of oatmeal, 4 teaspoons (20 ml)  of yogurt and 2-4 slices of cucumber. Blend the ingredients together to create a paste, and then leave the mask on your closed eyelids for 10-20 minutes. Rinse the mask off afterwards. You can also split off a piece of an aloe leaf and apply the gel directly to your eyelids. Wait for it to dry for roughly 20 minutes before washing it off. Cold water is great for tightening your skin. Try to rinse your face, especially around your eyes, with cold water frequently. You can use ice cubes to gently rub your eyelids as well. Egg whites are known for improving skin elasticity. Using only the egg whites and not the yolks, dip a cotton ball or Q-tip in the egg white. Once some of the egg white has been absorbed, apply it to your eyelids. You eyes should stay closed the whole time until the egg white has dried and you can rinse it off.  Remove any eye makeup beforehand so that this method will work better. If you get egg whites in your eye, rinse your eye out thoroughly with clean water. Because grapes have lots of polyphenols in them that help to reduce inflammation, eating them can help with your droopy eyelids. Eating lots of grapes isn't going to have a huge effect on your asymmetrical eyes, but it can only help. You may have noticed that your eyes feel heavier when you’re tired. Getting a good night’s rest will improve your skin overall, and should help tighten up the skin around your eyes. A solid 8 hours of sleep each night is recommended.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.

Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape  — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations. Question: What did the author probably do with the colomba she made from the Field's recipe? Options:  A. not enough information  B. she probably ate them all  C. she probably didn't eat any  D. she probably ate some and shared it with others  === The correct answer is A:","output":"not enough information"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

James Randi began a series of conferences known as \\"The Amazing Meeting\\" - TAM - which quickly became the largest gathering of skeptics in the world, drawing audiences from Asia, Europe, South America, and the UK. It also attracted large percentage of younger folks. Randi has been regularly featured on many podcasts, including The Skeptics Society's official podcast Skepticality and the Center for Inquiry's official podcast Point of Inquiry. From September 2006 onwards, he has occasionally contributed to The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe podcast with a column titled \\"Randi Speaks.\\" In addition, The Amazing Show is a podcast in which Randi shares various anecdotes in an interview format.  In 2014 Part2Filmworks released An Honest Liar, a feature film documentary, written by Tyler Measom and Greg O'Toole, and directed and produced by Measom and Justin Weinstein. The film, which was funded through Kickstarter, focuses on Randi's life, his investigations, and his relationship with longtime partner Jose Alvarez, a.k.a. Deyvi Pena. The film was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival, at Toronto's Hot Docs film festival, and at the June 2014 AFI Docs Festival in Silver Spring, Maryland and Washington, D.C., where it won the Audience Award for Best Feature. It has since been captioned in ten different languages, shown worldwide, and was also positively received by critics. The film was featured on the PBS Independent Lens series, shown in the U.S. and Canada, on March 28, 2016.  In 2017, he appeared in animated form on Holy Koolaid, in which he discussed the challenge of finding the balance between connecting sincerely with his audience and at the same time tricking/fooling them with an artful ruse and indicated that this is a balance many magicians struggle with. Question: What did the foundation do Answer:","output":"The James Randi Educational Foundation, also known as JREF, was created by James Randi in 1996 to help people learn about and understand magic tricks, science, and how to be a good thinker. The foundation wanted everyone, especially kids, to know the difference between real science and things that just look like magic or pretend to be true but aren't. They did this by writing about interesting topics in their blog, having meetings where scientists and smart people came to talk, and by making podcasts where they shared stories and information. The foundation worked hard to make sure people knew how to ask good questions and not believe in things that aren't true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Chihiro is whiny and unhappy about the move, especially when she notices that the bouquet her friend gave her as a good-bye gift is wilting. In sight of their new house, they take a wrong turn and follow a bumpy, decayed old road through the woods; Chihiro sees an odd old statue through the trees as they drive by. The road ends at a tunnel leading to an abandoned theme park. It gives Chihiro the creeps, but her parents persuade her to go in with them and look around.After wandering across a grassy landscape and a dry riverbed, they climb a stone staircase and come to a street lined with restaurants and shops. Most are deserted, but the aroma of cooking leads them to the one restaurant that's well stocked with food -- though it's mysteriously deserted. Mom and Dad are hungry and start eating, despite Chihiro's objections. The food is delicious, and Chihiro wanders away to explore while they eat. She finds a towering, ornate building that she recognizes as a bathhouse (a spa resort); there's a train track running under it. She meets a boy (voice: Jason Marsden) in traditional dress who is alarmed to see her; he tells her to leave and get back across the river before it gets dark. Chihiro runs back to her parents, but they're still eating -- and they've turned into pigs. Strange, dark, ghostly figures appear in all the shops and streets, frightening Chihiro and separating her from the pigs that were her parents. Chihiro runs back to the river, which was nearly dry when they came over but is now full and large, and she doesn't even recognize the buildings on the far side. As a riverboat approaches, she notices that her body has become transparent.The riverboat lands a big crowd of people in costume -- or maybe they're not people; at first they're only visible as paper masks.

Before writing what I did and what he did please let me tell you I was just a teenagerand it all seemed new, so kindly don't judge me. Even if you want to..I am anonymous for the same reason. So this happened when I was 16 year old. I belong to a very humble and conservative family, from Indore. @I never had a lot of exposure to guys, until we went to attend a marriage of one of our wealthy relatives in Delhi.. it was one of the best times I had, as we had a group of 4–5 similar aged cousins, though most of them were very distant relatives. One of them was a 19 year old dude, and he was kind of cute. But I never thought I would have this urge to you know… it was teenage and everything seemed new and exciting. So the second day, after having roamed all around Noida, we finally returned to our hotel and that guy accompanied me to my room. I asked him if he wants to come in as my parents were involved in the late night Sangeet rehearsals. He nodded gently and before I could know, we were cuddling and watching TV. I felt like a rebel, though it was the strangest and least expected thing I had done. Then he kissed me. Before I knew it I let him in my mouth …and he kept rolling his tongue on mine. It was my first kiss, and I don't regret it. The warmth of his mouth, the wetness of his lips and his breath felt like the only thing I ever wanted. I was a teen so please not judge. Sadly… before we could proceed, rest of our cousins called us to play Antakhshree with them. Never have we met since, but we often exchange messages on Facebook.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Earthquakes seemed to outline a special feature of earth's crust. Earthquakes let scientists know where the crust was moving. This led to the discovery that the Earths crust was broken up into regions, or plates. Earthquakes happen most often along these plate boundaries. This was evidence that continents can move. The movements of the plates are called plate tectonics. The Earths crust is divided into plates. There are about a dozen large plates and several small ones. Each plate is named for the continent or ocean basin it contains. Scientists know he plates are in motion. They now know the direction and speed of this motion . Plates dont move very fast. They move only a few centimeters a year. This is about the same rate fingernails grow. So you might wonder, what could cause this motion? What supplies the energy to cause this change?  Question: \\"Why is it likely that scientists only learned about plate boundaries from studying earthquakes?\\" Response: \\"Plates don't move very fast. Sent 13: They move only a few centimeters a year\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question. The question asks why scientists likely only learned about plate boundaries from studying earthquakes, and the response focuses on the speed of plate movement.  A more appropriate answer would be: It is likely that scientists only learned about plate boundaries from studying earthquakes because earthquakes are the most visible and measurable manifestation of the movements and interactions between tectonic plates. Earthquakes frequently occur along plate boundaries, where the Earth's crust is most active and dynamic. When tectonic plates move and interact with each other, they generate tremendous force and stress, resulting in the release of energy in the form of earthquakes. By measuring and studying the location, frequency, and magnitude of earthquakes around the globe, scientists were able to identify patterns and ultimately determine the locations of plate boundaries. In addition to earthquakes, other geological processes and features, such as volcanic activity and mountain formation, also provide evidence of plate boundaries. However, earthquakes have served as a critical source of information for scientists in understanding the complex dynamics of the Earth's crust and the existence of tectonic plates. The study of earthquakes has led to significant advancements in the field of plate tectonics, enhancing our understanding of the Earth's geological processes and the forces that shape our planet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Milk Movie plot: As the opening credits roll, old black and white newsreel footage from what looks like the 50s and early 60s flashes by of men being rounded up (and roughed up) by the police. Newspaper headlines break up the footage, announcing police raids of gay bars: \\"Crackdown of Homosexual Bars\\", \\"Men Charged in Taverns\\", etc. The men are all very well-dressed, clean-cut, and incredibly embarrassed, holding their hands over their faces, some with their suit coats over their heads. They are loaded up into paddy wagons as police push and shove them, snickering. Some of the men sit in large rooms, awaiting questioning and photographic, looking like their whole lives have just been destroyed.The narration of this film is carried out by Harvey Milk speaking into a tape recorded in 1978, dictating a letter to be read (or in this case, listened to) only in the event of his assassination. As he narrates, we catch glimpses of Milk in front of various groups, giving speeches, using attention-getting opening lines that vary with every crowd. In front of Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender (LGBT) crowds, he opens with \\"My name is Harvey Milk and I want to recruit you.\\" In front of burly straight union workers, he opts for, \\"My name is Harvey Milk, and sorry I am not what you expected, but I left my high heels at home\\".In narration, Milk explains gay activists are targets for being so visible. There's a sudden newsreel clip of what looks like actual footage of a very young Diane Fienstein making the announcement both Milk and San Francisco Mayor George Moscone were assassinated (NOTE: for the unaware, that's California's current Senator Diane Fienstein, who in 1978 was president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, who became Mayor upon Moscone's assassination, and later, of course, United States Senator).Milk, narrating his \\"Only Read If I Am Assassinated Letter\\" frames the rest of the movie, taking the audience to important points chronologically, beginning in 1970 New York.Milk, dapper in a very Sears & Roebuck 70s gray suit...

Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife.

How Baking Soda Reacts With Vinegar; B. How Rust Can Be Scraped off of Metal; C. How Metals Respond to Electrical Currents; D. How Elements Can Change Phase When Heated;","output":"The correct answer is A. How Baking Soda Reacts With Vinegar. Below is an explanation of each title and why option A is the correct choice among the other titles: A. How Baking Soda Reacts With Vinegar This title is specifically about a chemical change because it involves the reaction between baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3) and vinegar (acetic acid, CH3COOH). When these two substances react, they undergo a chemical change that produces new substances, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), and sodium acetate (NaC2H3O2). This reaction is a perfect example of a chemical change, as it results in the formation of entirely new compounds. B. How Rust Can Be Scraped off of Metal Although rust is a product of a chemical change (oxidation of iron in the presence of moisture), this title specifically addresses the physical removal of rust from the metal surface. The act of scraping rust off of metal is a mechanical or physical process, not a chemical one. Therefore, this title is not specifically about a chemical change. C. How Metals Respond to Electrical Currents This title is related to the physical properties of metals and their ability to conduct electricity. The flow of electrical current through metals involves the movement of electrons within the material, but this process doesn't involve a chemical change in the metal itself. This title does not address a chemical change and is strictly about the physical properties of metals in response to electrical currents. D. How Elements Can Change Phase When Heated This title refers to phase transitions, such as when a solid turns into a liquid (melting) or a liquid into a gas (evaporation). These phase changes happen when heat is applied, raising the temperature of an element or compound to its melting or boiling point. However, phase changes are physical changes, not chemical ones. The element's or compound's identity remains the same throughout the process, with only the arrangement and motion of its particles changing as it transitions between solid, liquid, and gas phases. In conclusion, out of the four given titles, A. How Baking Soda Reacts With Vinegar is the one that is specifically about a chemical change, as it involves a reaction between two substances that results in the formation of new chemical compounds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: John is an amateur astronomer. Last week he was observing the sky with his telescope. First he pointed his telescope at planet Mars. He noted it as case A. Then he pointed his telescope to planet Jupiter, which is farther form the Sun than Mars is. He noted it as case C. Finally, he pointed the telescope to a faraway planet called WASP-17b. He noted that as case B.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which case would see faster movement, case A or case C?  Hint: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: Answer:","output":"To answer the question of which case would see faster movement, either case A (observing Mars) or case C (observing Jupiter), we need to consider the information provided in the hint: 1. A planet's year (sidereal period) depends on its distance from its star. 2. The farther a planet is from its star, the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. 3. As a planet approaches periastron (closest approach to its star), its speed increases; as it reaches apastron (farthest separation from the star), its speed decreases. Considering the above points, since Mars is closer to the Sun than Jupiter, it will have a shorter sidereal period and will be more affected by the Sun's gravity. Consequently, Mars will generally have a faster orbital speed than Jupiter. Therefore, in the given cases, case A (observing Mars) would see faster movement compared to case C (observing Jupiter)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Tampons are the most common menstrual hygiene product for women in America because they are convenient and simple to use.  A tampon is made of absorbent cotton and is worn inside the vagina to absorb menstrual fluid as it leaves the cervix. They are available in a variety of absorbencies including light, regular, heavy, and super to coincide with the days of your flow. Tampons are disposable and are thrown away after use, and must be changed at least every eight hours. Never wear a tampon longer than eight hours or wear one that is more absorbent than you need, as this can lead to a rare but serious condition called Toxic Shock Syndrome. Disposable pads (also called sanitary towels or sanitary napkins) fit inside the underwear and come in various lengths and absorbencies. They are made of an absorbent material called cellulose and must be thrown away after use. Some women use them as back-up protection with tampons, and other women prefer pads because they are uncomfortable with inserting something in their vagina. Because they have a leak-proof plastic backing, disposable pads can trap smells more than most other hygiene options. Some women chose to purchase or make pads made of absorbent materials like cotton, Zorb, or microfiber. Cloth pads do not contain the same chemicals as disposable pads and do not have the same smell that many women notice when blood is absorbed by a disposable pad. They do require regular laundering and can be slightly bulkier than disposable pads. Menstrual cups are very popular in Europe and have recently begun gaining popularity among American women. Some menstrual cups like Softcup are disposable and inserted like a diaphragm. Reusable menstrual cups like the DivaCup or Lunette are made of medical-grade silicon and are inserted into the vagina and worn against the opening of the cervix. In both cases, the muscles of the vagina wall hold the cup in place. They can be worn for 12 hours, including while in the water or while sleeping. Because they are worn internally, they can help reduce the smell of menstrual blood during your period.  The user removes the cup every four to 12 hours, pours the collected blood into the toilet or sink, and washes the cup before reinserting. Wearing a tampon for an extended time can lead to leaks, and wearing a pad for too long can lead to odors.  During your heavy days, you may need to change it every hour or two. On light days, don't go more than three to four hours without changing it during the day. Again, never leave a tampon in for more than eight hours, even for overnight wear, and never wear a tampon that is a higher absorbency than you need to reduce your risk of TSS. Your period will most likely be regular and predictable, but sometimes \\"breakthrough bleeding\\" can occur between periods, or your period can be early. It's best to be prepared with the right supplies at all times.  Keep a tampon or pad with you in your purse, locker, and/or car for emergencies. Keep a supply of tampons or pads in your bathroom so that you won't have to run to the store when your period starts. Don't be afraid to ask a female friend for a tampon or pad if you need one. Even a stranger in the bathroom will likely be willing to help you out if you are in need. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article talks about different ways women can take care of themselves during their period. There are different products like tampons, pads, and cups that can be used to soak up the blood. Women should choose what's best for them and should always remember to change these products regularly to stay clean and healthy.

Its most striking feature is the great Norman screen, running up without buttresses or projections to the parapet and hiding the bases of the square, richly decorated towers of the west front. The plain centre of the screen is the work of Remigius, the first bishop. The rest of it is relieved with rich arcading of Late Norman and Early English periods. The wooden spires which crowned the towers were removed in 1807. In 1192 Hugh of Avalon determined to rebuild the Norman building of Remigius, which an earthquake had shaken. To him we owe the choir and eastern transept. His successors completed the western transept and began the west end of the nave. So much money had to be spent in rebuilding the central tower, which fell in 1239, that the canons could not rebuild the nave entirely, but had to incorporate the Norman end by Remigius. Unfortunately the axis of the west front does not correspond to that of the nave, which is too wide for its height. The low vaulting is a serious defect in the choir built by St. Hugh, but of the superb beauty of the Angel Choir, which encloses his shrine, there can be no doubt. In its richness of sculpture it is one of the masterpieces of Gothic architecture in England. The interior of the cathedral is remarkable for the harmony of its style, which is Lancet-Gothic, and the dim lighting of the nave only adds to its impressiveness.

Your task is to classify whether the given title is suitable or not for the research paper based on the given paragraph. Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Paragraph: The carbohydrate binding profile of the red algal lectin KAA-2 from Kappaphycus alvarezii was evaluated by a centrifugal ultrafiltration-HPLC method using pyridylaminated oligosaccharides. KAA-2 bound exclusively to high mannose type N-glycans, but not to other glycans such as complex type, hybrid type, or the pentasaccharide core of N-glycans. This lectin exhibited a preference for an exposed a1-3 Man on a D2 arm in a similar manner to Eucheuma serra agglutinin (ESA-2), which shows various biological activities, such as anti-HIV and anti-carcinogenic activity. We tested the anti-influenza virus activity of KAA-2 against various strains including the recent pandemic H1N1-2009 influenza virus. KAA-2 inhibited infection of various influenza strains with EC 50 s of low nanomolar levels. Immunofluorescence microscopy using an anti-influenza antibody demonstrated that the antiviral activity of KAA-2 was exerted by interference with virus entry into host cells. This mechanism was further confirmed by the evidence of direct binding of KAA-2 to a viral envelope protein, hemagglutinin (HA), using an ELISA assay. These results indicate that this lectin would be useful as a novel antiviral reagent for the prevention of infection.

Students will be heading back to class next week for the first time since their Oklahoma elementary school was destroyed by an EF5 tornado – killing seven pupils. Plaza Towers has now been rebuilt following the tornado that flattened Moore on 20 May 2013, causing an estimated 2billion in property damage. The elementary school, which cost 12million to refurbish, has installed seven benches  to represent the children who lost their lives. Scroll down for video. Construction continues on the exterior of the new Plaza Towers elementary school in Moore, Oklahoma. The school was destroyed by an EF5 tornado on 20 May 2013, killing seven students. A tree which was ravaged by the tornado, and at one time showed signs of revival, was named the 'Hope Tree' by fourth grade teacher Kimberly Martinez. Officials from the elementary school and Moore Public Schools led a media tour of the new building on Tuesday. Michelle McNear, assistant superintendent for elementary education and instruction for Moore Public Schools said: ‘I don't want to be ... a district that is remembered by May 20. ‘We want to be remembered as a district and a community as how we worked through it and the way we handled things.’ A memorial dedicated to the pupils who were killed is expected to be completed later this year. Pre-K teacher Erika Rowell points out the steel-beam reinforced wall in her classroom at the new Plaza Towers. The four rooms in this quad and the hallway are a FEMA-approved safe area. A container full of helmets to protect the pupils are shown during the tour of the new school on Tuesday. A brick wall with a panther painted on it, salvaged from the old Plaza Towers elementary school, has been incorporated into the new school. It will include silhouettes of seven children with personal touches such as a soccer ball to represent each child. The silhouettes will not have names, but the families will know which one represents their child based on the personal touches. Moore Public Schools Superintendent Robert Romines said the memorial ‘is very symbolic to the students we lost’. The new brick building includes a designated Federal Emergency Management Agency-approved safe area with four classrooms and a hallway where students can congregate when there's severe weather. The classrooms are equipped with bathrooms, and the hallway has no windows — setups designed to prevent storm debris from flying and injuring students. A memorial at the entrance of the school, dedicated to the seven students who were killed, is expected to be completed later this year. This classroom, with a separate bathroom, can be used as a safe room for severe weather or other lockdown situtaitons. The old Plaza Towers did not have a safe room. Students also will be welcomed by a large brick wall with a panther on it. Officials were able to salvage the panther wall from the old Plaza Towers and install it into the new building. Principal Patrick Chase said students chose the name ‘Paws’ for the panther. ‘It's probably my favorite feature of the building,’ said Mr Chase. The first day of school is Aug 19. This is the elementary school before the devastating tornado that flattened Moore in May last year.

I ran home as quickly as possible. Later on, I heard it was a neighbor, an old man who has been living alone at home. He's NOT a sleep walker. He enjoys having a walk at night. So I seldom see him in the neighborhood in the day. It's said that he was a soldier many years ago. He has two children, a son and a daughter. His son has a family in Shanghai. His daughter went abroad, in Sydney. He has been living alone since his wife died several years ago. Without any children living with him, he feels lonely and helpless. I feel sorry for the old man.

Giordano described the work as the \\"theology of painting\\", and was inspired to paint A Homage to Velázquez (National Gallery, London). By the early 18th century his oeuvre was gaining international recognition, and later in the century British collectors ventured to Spain in search of acquisitions. Since the popularity of Italian art was then at its height among British connoisseurs, they concentrated on paintings that showed obvious Italian influence, largely ignoring others such as Las Meninas.An almost immediate influence can be seen in the two portraits by Mazo of subjects depicted in Las Meninas, which in some ways reverse the motif of that painting. Ten years later, in 1666, Mazo painted Infanta Margaret Theresa, who was then 15 and just about to leave Madrid to marry the Holy Roman Emperor. In the background are figures in two further receding doorways, one of which was the new King Charles (Margaret Theresa's brother), and another the dwarf Maribarbola. A Mazo portrait of the widowed Queen Mariana again shows, through a doorway in the Alcázar, the young king with dwarfs, possibly including Maribarbola, and attendants who offer him a drink.  Mazo's painting of The Family of the Artist also shows a composition similar to that of Las Meninas. Francisco Goya etched a print of Las Meninas in 1778, and later used Velázquez's painting as the model for his Charles IV of Spain and His Family. As in Las Meninas, the royal family in Goya's work is apparently visiting the artist's studio. In both paintings the artist is shown working on a canvas, of which only the rear is visible. Goya, however, replaces the atmospheric and warm perspective of Las Meninas with what Pierre Gassier calls a sense of \\"imminent suffocation\\". Goya's royal family is presented on a \\"stage facing the public, while in the shadow of the wings the painter, with a grim...  Guess a valid title for it!

One day Michael decides to head out to the cliff and notices the sky looks much more red than normal. He also remembers that on the previous day he couldn't see his shadow at all.  But I can use this background: When light passes through Earth's atmosphere, photons interact with it through scattering. If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called direct radiation and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. Indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an overcast day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why sunsets are red. Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun's rays pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset.

Then a terrible thing happened. The man calmly walked all over the child's body with his heavy boots, and left her screaming on the ground. It was an inhuman thing to do. I ran after the man, caught him and fetched him back. There was already a small crowd around the screaming child. The man was perfectly cool, but he gave me a very evil look, which made me feel sick in my stomach. The child's family then arrived, and also a doctor. The child had been sent to fetch the doctor for a sick neighbor, and was on her way home again.

A: Answer:","output":"A: The process by which plants gain energy and produce sugar is called photosynthesis.  Step 1: Absorption of sunlight Justification: Sunlight acts as the energy source required for photosynthesis to take place. Step 2: Conversion of light energy Justification: Plants contain chlorophyll, a pigment that absorbs sunlight and converts it into chemical energy stored in molecules called ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). Step 3: Carbon dioxide uptake Justification: Plants gain carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through small openings called stomata on their leaves. This carbon dioxide is essential for the production of sugar. Step 4: Water absorption Justification: Plants absorb water from the soil through their roots, which is then transported to the leaves. Water is required for the production of oxygen, an important byproduct of photosynthesis. Step 5: The Calvin Cycle Justification: The Calvin Cycle is a series of chemical reactions that occur in the chloroplasts of plant cells. During this cycle, the energy stored in ATP and NADPH is used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose, the sugar required for energy and growth. Overall, photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose (sugar) for energy and growth, while releasing oxygen as a byproduct."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Can we draw the following conclusion? It was founded in the year 2008","output":"Based on the information provided, it cannot be conclusively determined that Virgin Vodka, Virgin Cola, and Virgin Computers were founded in the year 2008. The quote from Richard Branson does not offer any specific details about the founding dates of these ventures, nor is the year 2008 explicitly mentioned in the context. To draw any conclusions about the founding year of these businesses, additional information and context would be required. To understand Virgin Group's scope and history better, we can explore their diverse portfolio and track record over the years. Virgin Group was initially founded in 1970 as a mail-order record business by Richard Branson and Nik Powell. The company has since expanded into various industries, including travel, telecommunications, music, space, and more. Some key moments in Virgin Group's history include: 1. 1972: The opening of the first Virgin Records store, which was the foundation for Virgin's music business and ultimately grew into the well-known Virgin Megastores. 2. 1984: The launch of Virgin Atlantic Airways, which marked the company's entrance into the aviation industry. 3. 1992: Virgin Records was sold to EMI Group, funding the creation of Virgin Communications and providing capital for other ventures. 4. 1999: Virgin Mobile was established, entering the telecommunications sector. 5. 2004: Virgin Galactic was founded with the goal of offering commercial space travel. As for the specific ventures mentioned in the quote - Virgin Vodka, Virgin Cola, and Virgin Computers - their founding years are as follows: 1. Virgin Cola was launched in 1994, as a direct competitor to other popular soft drink brands like Coca-Cola and Pepsi. However, it was unable to gain significant market share and gradually faded from the market. 2. Virgin Vodka was introduced around the late 1990s, but eventually was discontinued due to poor sales and lack of market impact. 3. Virgin Computers, though mentioned in the quote, does not appear to be a significant product line, and its founding year cannot be confirmed based on the information available. However, it could possibly refer to the 'Virgin PC' initiative that was launched in 1998, which aimed to provide affordable computers to consumers. In conclusion, the given quote from Richard Branson does not provide enough evidence or context to support the claim that Virgin Vodka, Virgin Cola, and Virgin Computers were founded in the year 2008. To draw accurate conclusions about the founding years of these ventures, it's essential to delve into more background information and historical context on the Virgin Group and each respective business."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is \\"If the object is black, meaning it absorbs all the light that hits it, then its thermal light emission is maximized.\\" the correct answer? pick from the following. a). yes b). no","output":"b). no Electromagnetic fields do not obey the law mentioned in your statement. The statement you provided refers to the thermal radiation emitted by a black object (a black body), which is related to black body radiation and the Stefan-Boltzmann law, not the underlying laws governing electromagnetic fields. The laws that electromagnetic fields obey are known as Maxwell's Equations. These equations mathematically describe the behavior of electromagnetic fields and consist of four fundamental equations: 1. Gauss's Law for Electricity (Electric Flux): This law states that the electric flux through any closed surface is proportional to the total electric charge enclosed within that surface. Mathematically, it can be written as: ∮E·dA = Q/ε₀ where E is the electric field, dA is the differential area vector, Q is the total charge enclosed, and ε₀ is the permittivity of free space. 2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: This law states that the magnetic flux through any closed surface is always zero, which indicates that the magnetic field lines are continuous, forming loops without beginning or end. Mathematically, it can be written as: ∮B·dA = 0 where B is the magnetic field. 3. Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction: This law relates the time-varying magnetic field to the electromotive force (EMF) induced in a closed loop or wire. The EMF is equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic flux through the loop. Mathematically, it can be written as: ∮E·dl = -d(∫B·dA)/dt where E is the electric field, B is the magnetic field, and t is time. 4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's Addition (Ampère-Maxwell Law): This law states that the magnetic field generated in any closed loop is proportional to the sum of the electric current flowing through the loop and the time-varying electric flux. Mathematically, it can be written as: ∮B·dl = μ₀(I_enc + ε₀ d(∫E·dA)/dt) where B is the magnetic field, I_enc is the enclosed electric current, μ₀ is the permeability of free space, and ε₀ is the permittivity of free space. These four equations form the foundation of classical electromagnetism, governing the behavior of electromagnetic fields in various situations. They demonstrate the relationships between electric and magnetic fields and how they evolve and interact in different scenarios."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He said he stabbed the person \\"just over a look\\".      His spokesman later said his remarks had been \\"in jest\\".      Mr Duterte has previously said he killed criminal suspects as mayor of the city of Davao.

Mr Duterte has encouraged extrajudicial killings of those involved in the drugs trade, and said he would \\"be happy to slaughter\\" three million drug addicts in the country.      Addressing the Filipino community in Da Nang, he said he had killed a person during his violent teenage years, when he said he was in numerous fights and \\"in and out of jail\\".

It is not clear if he was referring to the same incident in his speech.      He also claims to have thrown corrupt officials out of helicopters, warning officials he would do it again if they embezzled financial aid. His spokesman described that claim as an \\"urban legend\\".      Speaking about human rights during his Vietnam visit, Mr Duterte proposed a \\"world summit\\" on the issue - but not looking solely at human rights abuses in the Philippines.      \\"What makes the death of people in the Philippines more important than the rest of the children in the world that were massacred and killed?\\" the Manila Bulletin quoted him as saying.      Since he took office, police say they have killed almost 4,000 people in anti-drug operations. More than 2,000 others have been killed in connection with drug-related crimes.      In September, the proposed budget for the human rights commission investigating the deaths was cut to 1,000 pesos - the equivalent of 20 (£15). It had asked for 1.72bn pesos (34m).      Mr Duterte is due to hold bilateral talks with US President Donald Trump in the Philippines in the coming days - the first meeting between the pair.

Referencing human rights criticisms of his policies, Duterte said that he wasn't afraid to go to jail, and apparently used the anecdote to illustrate that.      \\"Jail? Jeez. When I was a teenager, I was in and out of jail,\\" he said , in a mixture of Tagalog and English.      \\"One fight there, another here -- at the age of 16, I killed someone. A person, really. During a fight. Stabbing. That was when I was 16 years old, just because we just looked at each other,\\" he added, prompting laughter from the audience.      The controversial leader, who was elected largely on a platform of zero-tolerance against the Philippines' drug scourge, suggested that his approach to the war on drugs, mirrored that of his young self.      His approach was \\"even more so as president,\\" he said. \\"You f**k with my countrymen, I won't let you off the hook. Never mind about the human rights advocates.\\"      Duterte's spokesman Harry Roque told CNN affiliate CNN Philippines in a text: \\"I think it was in jest.

Speaking to the local Filipino community in the Vietnamese city of Da Nang on Thursday, Duterte also threatened to slap a UN rights rapporteur if he met her, and used obscene language to hit back at critics of his deadly drugs crackdown.      “When I was a teenager, I would go in and out of jail. I’d have rumbles here, rumbles there,” said Duterte, who is in Da Nang for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit.      “At the age of 16, I already killed someone. A real person, a rumble, a stabbing. I was just 16 years old. It was just over a look. How much more now that I am president?”      Duterte won last year’s presidential elections after promising to eradicate illegal drugs with an unprecedented crackdown that would see up to 100,000 people killed. Since he took office 16 months ago, police say they have killed 3,967 people. Another 2,290 people were murdered in drug-related crimes, while thousands of other deaths remain unsolved, according to government data.      Duterte, 72, remains popular with many Filipinos who believe he is making society safer. But critics at home and abroad say he is orchestrating a campaign of extrajudicial mass murder, carried out by corrupt police and hired vigilantes.      He at times denies inciting police or others to kill, but also consistently generates headlines for his abusive language and incendiary comments defending the drug war.      Duterte said last year he would be “happy to slaughter” 3 million drug addicts and branded then US president Barack Obama a “son of a whore” for criticising the crackdown.      Duterte also said in December last year that he had personally shot dead criminal suspects when he was mayor of southern Davao city to set an example for the police.      His then spokesman later sought to clarify the remarks, saying the killings took place during a “legitimate police action”.      Esquire magazine quoted Duterte as saying in an interview before he became president that he “maybe” stabbed someone to death when he was 17 years old, in what may be a reference to the incident described in Da Nang.      In an election campaign rally, Duterte also said he was expelled from college for shooting a fellow student who was insulting him. The victim reportedly survived.      Duterte’s aides have repeatedly told journalists not to believe everything the president says, cautioning that he often jokes or indulges in “hyperbole”.      His new spokesman, Harry Roque, indicated that may be the case with his stabbing-to-death claim. “I think it was in jest. The Pres uses colourful language when w Pinoys (Filipinos) overseas,” Roque said in a text message.      In Da Nang, Duterte also targeted the United Nations’ special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, Agnes Callamard, who has been a frequent critic of the drug war. “This rapporteur,” he said, after referring to Callamard by name. “I will slap her in front of you. Why? Because you are insulting me.”      Duterte’s latest comments come days before he hosts the US president, Donald Trump, and other leaders for the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) summit.      Trump is due to fly into Manila from Vietnam along with other world leaders on Sunday evening before two days of talks.      Trump has praised Duterte’s handling of the drug war, telling the Philippine leader in a telephone call in April that he was doing a “great job”.      Human rights campaigners have said the summit will be a public relations coup for Duterte, with Trump and other leaders expected to ignore the drug war controversy.      “Duterte will enjoy the gift of tacit silence from east Asian leaders on his murderous drug war during the upcoming summit,” Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, told AFP.      Adding to a sense of confidence ahead of the event, Duterte on Thursday also proposed hosting a global summit on human rights in which all nations would be placed under the microscope.      “Let us investigate all violations of human rights committed by all governments,” he said, specifically naming the US, France and Russia. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte recently claimed that he stabbed a person to death when he was a teenager, according to a speech he made to Filipino expatriates in Vietnam's Da Nang city.

This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, \\"We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies.\\" Regent President John Ehrman said, \\"The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some 1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease.\\" The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.","output":"Subject Line: \\"Regent Energy Partners with Millennium Energy Ventures to Develop a 500 MW Power Plant in San Juan County, NM\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: It was 3:12 a.m. when nine-year-old Glenn Kreamer awoke to the smell of burning. Except for the crackling  of flames somewhere below there was not a sound in the two-storey house at Baldwin, Long Island. With his father away on night duty at a local factory, Glenn was worried about the safety of his mother, his sister Karen, 14 and his 12-year-old brother Todd. He ran downstairs through the smoke-filled house to push and pull at Karen and Todd until they sat up. Then he helped each one through the house to the safety of the garden. There, his sister and brother, taking short and quick breaths and coughing, collapsed on the lawn.     The nine-year-old raced back into the house and upstairs to his mother's room. He found it impossible to wake her up. Mrs. Kreamer, a victim of the smoke, was unconscious, and there was nobody to help Glenn carry her to the garden. But the boy remained calm and , as a fireman said later, \\"acted with all the self-control of a trained adult.\\"    On the bedroom telephone, luckily still working, Glenn called his father and, leaving Mr. Kreamer to telephone the fire brigade and ambulance service, got on with the task of saving his mother.    First he filled a bucket with water from the bathroom and threw water over his mother and her bed. Then, with a wet cloth around his head he went back to the garden.    He could hear the fire engine coming up, but how would the firemen find his mother in the smoke-filled house where flames had almost swallowed up the ground floor? Grasping firmly a ball of string  from the garage, Glenn raced back into the house and dashed upstairs to his mother's room. Tying one end of the string to her hand, he ran back, laying out the string as he went, through the hall and back out into the garden.

Article: The next generation of smart phone could combine the date from its gyroscopes   with a built-in compass to allow you to track your indoor movements even without GPS.          Research described it in the international Journal of Innovative Computing and Applications by Shahid Ayub of Lancaster University, and his colleagues there and at HW Communications, suggests that the embedded inertial sensors   in many smart phones have added the facility to be used for localization and tracking applications. The primary benefit of using smart phones is that no additional infrastructure would need to be installed for monitoring personnel movements in a wide variety of situations not least staff, equipment and inventory movements in warehouse facilities, shopping malls and factories. In contrast, other technology being proposed would require new equipment,such as RFID technologies. However, smart phones do not yet have the ability to pinpoint their location without recourse to the GPS system, which is not accessible indoors and has the added disadvantage of using up battery power very quickly even if it could be used. Inertial navigation only provides the necessary information   to a specified starting point the team says. This is useful for anyone with a non-GPS smart phone who wishes to track the route they take when walking or jogging if they specify their starting point. The team suggests that pedestrians indoors could be positioned using a combination of the smart phone accelerometer   and an built-in digital compass, something that will become available in future smart phones. They have now investigated the potential of three different smart phone placement modes: idle, hand held and listening, which could be used with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) techniques to allow users to record the path they follow or for various kinds of workplace or other monitoring requirements. \\"The technique could be used in underground tube stations, airports , train stations where there is no infrastructure installed for tracking or...

That's why he created the Lampbrella--a lamp post  with its own \\"umbrella\\".

It has an inside electric motor  which can open or close the umbrella freely. The Lampbrella will offer people cover whenever it starts raining. After three minutes of not being used the canopy is closed. According to the designer, the Lampbrella would move at a very low speed in order not to cause harm to people. What's more, it would be grounded to protect from a possible lightning hit. Each Lampbrella would offer enough cover for several people. Being 2 meters off the ground, it would only be a danger for the tallest man.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Equifax breach that exposed sensitive data for as many as 143 million US consumers was accomplished by exploiting a Web application vulnerability that had been patched more than two months earlier, officials with the credit reporting service said Thursday.      \\"Equifax has been intensely investigating the scope of the intrusion with the assistance of a leading, independent cybersecurity firm to determine what information was accessed and who has been impacted,\\" company officials wrote in an update posted online . \\"We know that criminals exploited a US website application vulnerability. The vulnerability was Apache Struts CVE-2017-5638. We continue to work with law enforcement as part of our criminal investigation, and have shared indicators of compromise with law enforcement.\\"      The flaw in the Apache Struts framework was fixed on March 6. Three days later, the bug was already under mass attack by hackers who were exploiting the flaw to install rogue applications on Web servers. Five days after that, the exploits showed few signs of letting up . Equifax has said the breach on its site occurred in mid-May, more than two months after the flaw came to light and a patch was available.      Thursday's disclosure strongly suggests that Equifax failed to update its Web applications, despite demonstrable proof that the bug gave real-world attackers an easy way to take control of sensitive sites. An Equifax representative didn't immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on this possibility.      As Ars warned in March, patching the security hole was labor intensive and difficult, in part because it involved downloading an updated version of Struts and then using it to rebuild all apps that used older, buggy Struts versions. Some websites may depend on dozens or even hundreds of such apps, which may be scattered across dozens of servers on multiple continents. Once rebuilt, the apps must be extensively tested before going into production to ensure they don't break key functions on the site.      Equifax's update confirms a report published last week by a firm called Baird Equity Research. It provided no source for the claim that Equifax was breached through an unidentified Apache Struts vulnerability. Two days later, the Apache Software Foundation issued a statement saying it didn't know one way or the other if a Struts vulnerability was involved. CVE-2017-5638 is separate from CVE-2017-9805, an Apache Struts vulnerability that was patched last week.      Apache Struts is a framework for developing Java-based apps that run both front-end and back-end Web servers. It is relied on heavily by banks, government agencies, large Internet companies, and Fortune 500 companies. Experian, one of the three big credit reporting services, and annualcreditreport.com, which provides free credit reports, both reportedly rely on Apache Struts as well.      Up to now, Equifax has said only that criminals exploited an unspecified application vulnerability on its US site to gain access to certain files. Now, we know that the flaw was in Apache Struts and had been fixed months before the breach occurred. ||||| Capping a week of incompetence, failures, and general shady behavior in responding to its massive data breach, Equifax has confirmed that attackers entered its system in mid-May through a web-application vulnerability that had a patch available in March. In other words, the credit-reporting giant had more than two months to take precautions that would have defended the personal data of 143 million people from being exposed. It didn't.      As the security community processes the news and scrutinizes Equifax's cybersecurity posture, numerous doubts have surfaced about the organization's competence as a data steward. The company took six weeks to notify the public after finding out about the breach. Even then, the site that Equifax set up in response to address questions and offer free credit monitoring was itself riddled with vulnerabilities. And as security journalist Brian Krebs first reported, a web portal for handling credit-report disputes from customers in Argentina used the embarrassingly inadequate credentials of \\"admin/admin.\\" Equifax took the platform down on Tuesday. But observers say the ongoing discoveries increasingly paint a picture of negligence—especially in Equifax's failure to protect itself against a known flaw with a ready fix.      A 'Relatively Easy' Hack      The vulnerability that attackers exploited to access Equifax's system was in the Apache Struts web-application software, a widely used enterprise platform. The Apache Software Foundation said in a statement on Saturday (when rumors swirled that the March Struts bug might be to blame) that, though it was sorry if attackers exploited a bug in its software to breach Equifax, it always recommends that users regularly patch and update their Apache Struts platforms. \\"Most breaches we become aware of are caused by failure to update software components that are known to be vulnerable for months or even years,\\" René Gielen, the vice president of Apache Struts, wrote.      In this case, Equifax had ample opportunity to update.      \\"This vulnerability was disclosed back in March. There were clear and simple instructions of how to remedy the situation. The responsibility is then on companies to have procedures in place to follow such advice promptly,\\" says Bas van Schaik, a product manager and researcher at Semmle, an analytics security firm. \\"The fact that Equifax was subsequently attacked in May means that Equifax did not follow that advice. Had they done so this breach would not have occurred.\\"      Penetration testers and other security researchers say that it would have been simple for an attacker to exploit the flaw and get into the system. \\"Once they identified Equifax's systems as vulnerable, actually exploiting the vulnerability to gain access to the Equifax servers and network will unfortunately have been relatively easy,\\" says van Schaik, who recently discovered and disclosed a different Apache Struts bug. \\"It's hard to say how difficult it will have been for the attackers to get their hands on customer data once they found their way into Equifax's servers and network. But the timeline suggests that time was on the attackers' side.\\"      After exploiting the vulnerability to gain a foothold, the attackers may have found scores of unprotected data immediately or may have worked over time—between mid-May and the end of July—to gain more and more access to Equifax's systems. \\"Generally when you successfully exploit a web-application bug like this you will become the system user who owns the web server process,\\" says Alex McGeorge, the head of threat intelligence at the security firm Immunity. \\"Security best practices dictate that this user have as little privilege as possible on the server itself, since security vulnerabilities in web applications and web servers are so commonly exploited.\\" In practice, though, McGeorge says that hackers could have found credentials or other information in plaintext right away if Equifax didn't have proper protections in place.      Mounting Concerns      The company's attempts at damage control have been boilerplate at best. \\"Equifax has been intensely investigating the scope of the intrusion with the assistance of a leading, independent cybersecurity firm to determine what information was accessed and who has been impacted,\\" the company said in a statement Wednesday. \\"We continue to work with law enforcement as part of our criminal investigation.\\"      Lawmakers are planning two hearings to scrutinize the situation, though, and have requested detailed information about the breach from Equifax. Dozens of people whose personal data was exposed have already filed lawsuits against the company. Peter Kaplan, the acting director of public affairs at the Federal Trade Commission, told WIRED in a statement that \\"the FTC typically does not comment on ongoing investigations. However, in light of the intense public interest and the potential impact of this matter, I can confirm that FTC staff is investigating the Equifax data breach.\\" And politicians have additionally called on federal watchdog and protection agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to initiate their own investigations.      Equifax will suffer scrutiny and losses because of the breach, but the real victims are the individuals whose data was potentially compromised. And Equifax has particular responsibility to protect its consumer data, since much of it doesn't even come from customers who directly choose to do business with the firm, but surfaces instead from credit check requests for anyone living and working in the US. \\"I am concerned,\\" Immunity's McGeorge says. \\"This is a thing that you use whether you realize it or not, because all commerce data goes through them. You do have a stake in this.\\" ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"A big company called Equifax, which has a lot of very important information about people in the US, let some bad people steal that information because they didn't fix a security problem on their website.

His defense attorneys on Thursday filed a notice in U.S. District Court indicating his intent to make the move. The death penalty case is set to be tried Nov. 7.      But prosecutors also have the same right, and it’s unlikely that they would agree to forgo a jury trial.      In capital cases, 12 jurors are chosen in a question-and-answer process that can last weeks. If they unanimously decide that a defendant is guilty, the jurors also determine whether he should be executed. A judge must adopt any death verdict.      The 22-year-old Roof would face execution if convicted in the June 17 killings of nine black worshippers at Emanuel AME Church.      “The defendant hereby states that he is willing to waive jury, and to be tried and sentenced by the court,” Roof’s lead attorney, David Bruck, wrote in Thursday’s filing. “However, counsel for the government has informed defense counsel that the government will not consent to waive jury at either stage of this case.”      The defense filing amounts to a procedural formality. After setting a trial date earlier this week, presiding Judge Richard Gergel issued orders laying out the dates when opposing attorneys must file certain motions.      Whether Roof planned to waive his jury right was first on that list. The deadline for the paperwork was Friday, and prosecutors must respond by June 21.      The government’s stance on the issue could not immediately be confirmed. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Richardson, the lead prosecutor, declined to comment, and a spokeswoman for his office could not be reached.      The authorities said Roof, an Eastover resident, posted an online manifesto about his beliefs of white supremacy before traveling to Charleston and killing the parishioners because they were black. He was indicted on 33 federal charges, including hate crimes, but allegations that he used a gun to violate the churchgoers’ free exercise of religion qualify him for the ultimate punishment.      The slayings garnered considerable attention worldwide. Such pretrial publicity and the case’s racial implications are commonly cited as reasons for federal defendants to waive their right to a jury trial.      Federal court rules, though, state that the government must consent and that the judge must approve.      “The number of people who waive a right to a jury in a capital case is extremely small because it takes 12 jurors to agree,” said Charlie Condon, a former state attorney general. “But (Roof’s lawyers) probably think the judge would be more favorable than the 12 jurors.”      Reach Andrew Knapp at 843-937-5414 or twitter.com/offlede. ||||| CLOSE Dylann Roof doesn't want a jury to decide his fate. The Charleston church shooting suspect's lawyers filed a request in federal court asking for a judge to hear the case without a jury when his trial begins in November.      Dylann Roof (Photo: AP)      Dylann Roof, the suspect charged with fatally shooting nine people at a historic black church in Charleston, S.C., last June, is seeking to waive his right to a jury trial, according to court papers.      Lawyers for Roof, 22, of Columbia, S.C., indicated the suspect's intent in a notice they filed Thursday in U.S. District Court. The move would leave Roof's future up to a judge.      \\"Pursuant to this order, the defendant hereby states that he is willing to waive jury, and to be tried and sentenced by the court,\\" read the notice filed by Roof lawyers David Bruck, based in Lexington, Va., and Michael O'Connell, based in Mount Pleasant, S.C.      The notice also indicated, though, that a lawyer for the federal government has informed Roof's lawyers that that \\"the government will not consent to waive jury at either stage of this case.\\"      Roof's trial is set to begin Nov. 7. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.      On June 17, 2015, Roof staged a massacre at the Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church during a Bible study session. Among those who died were Pastor Clementa Pinckney. It is the oldest AME church in the South and was cofounded by slave revolt organizer Denmark Vesey.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who recorded guitar tracks for \\"Joy to the World\\" after not having been in the studio for some time? is inside the article: Santamental, released in October 2003, is a collaborative project featuring several prominent musicians such as guitarists Eddie Van Halen, Slash, Steve Vai, and drummer Gregg Bissonette. When Lukather's record company, Bop City Records, approached him about recording a Christmas album, he responded with a quip about his suitability for the project. The company wanted him to do the record knowing he would approach the project with a unique angle and produce something different from the typical Christmas album. Lukather recruited keyboardist Jeff Babko and guitarist Larry Carlton, who Lukather had worked with previously, to help arrange the songs. The project was a challenge to Lukather, who had to be creative to turn the traditionally simple songs into something interesting for listeners without altering the fundamental structures. He said of the album, \\"But I never dreamt in a million years that I'd do a Christmas record.\\"The musicians Lukather chose for Santamental, most of whom were involved in the hard-rock genre, lent a heavy feel to the album. Van Halen recorded guitar tracks for \\"Joy to the World\\" after not having been in the studio for some time but immediately made an impression on Lukather with his level of playing. Vai provided guitar work for \\"Carol of the Bells\\" along with Lukather's son Trevor, then 14 years old. Slash, who recorded his part in one take, played on the Lukather/Stan Lynch composition \\"Broken Heart for Christmas\\". Lukather spoke highly of Slash after the project, calling him the \\"Keith Richards of our generation\\". Well-known session guitarist Michael Landau played on the song \\"Look Out For Angels\\", and there is a version of \\"Jingle Bells\\" featuring a big band and sung by Sammy Davis, Jr. Santamental was recorded in six days, after which Lukather proclaimed it \\"his first and last Christmas album\\"., can you guess it ?

As he weighs his loyalty to the firm against doing the right thing, he must embrace his inner courage and embark on a life-altering journey of redemption, justice, and self-discovery. Plot: Harold Stone is a quiet, reserved bookkeeper who has consistently maintained the financial records of the highly respected law firm, Anderson and Goldstein, for the past 20 years. His life is predictable, monotonous, and unassuming - much like his personality. One day, while going through the company's books, Harold stumbles upon discrepancies in the firm's accounts. While making sense of these irregularities, Harold discovers that the firm's managing partners, Robert Anderson and Elliot Goldstein, have devised an illegal money laundering operation to pay off judges and manipulate trials in their favor. Unsure of how to handle this devastating discovery, Harold seeks advice from his hot-shot lawyer friend, Frankie Silverman, who asks him to gather more evidence to enable them to take down the partners. Aided by a fearless ex-investigative journalist turned firm secretary, Samantha, Harold risks everything to retrieve an encrypted flash drive containing indisputable evidence of the conspiracy. As they dig deeper, Harold and Samantha uncover extensive layers of corruption that extend beyond Anderson and Goldstein, implicating prominent government officials, wealthy businessmen, and even the police. They also discover that their every move is being closely surveilled by an unknown figure. They soon realize that upending the firm's balance of power might be fraught with more danger than they anticipated. Meanwhile, Harold's personal life is in turmoil. His wife, Laura, cannot understand why he has changed and begins to suspect that Harold is having an affair with Samantha. Harold's teenage son, Kevin, experiences a troubling legal situation of his own when the school bully falsely accuses him of assault. As Harold's whole life starts to fall apart, he begins to question whether he has made the wrong choice by pursuing justice. As the film reaches its climax, Harold and Samantha are faced with numerous trials that test their resilience, trust, and loyalty. With the clock ticking, they are ultimately forced to confront the true extent of their determination to fight for justice. Will Harold's newfound bravery and sense of morality triumph over the darkness within the firm and his own life? The Redemption of Harold Stone is a gripping drama and thriller that explores the themes of betrayal, redemption, and the fight for justice against impossible odds. In a world of corruption and deceit, the film teaches us that courage and truth can triumph, and that change can come from the most unlikely of places."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Who will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near their farm?  Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms.  Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. The answer is:","output":"Kenny will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near their farm. The given paragraph states that Bobby has recently received a large order of potatoes, which led him to increase the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny, on the other hand, grows tomatoes that are not in season right now, so his usage of fertilizer is currently low. In addition, the paragraph mentions that there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. The hint provided explains that rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil, causing runoff to carry it away and end up in bodies of water, such as ponds and oceans. Nitrogen, a component of fertilizer, results in uncontrolled algae growth when present in high amounts in bodies of water. Algae consume carbon dioxide in the water, and after they die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers consume all the oxygen in the water, creating a dead zone – an area in a body of water with little to no oxygen, inhibiting the growth of life. Since Bobby is using a higher amount of fertilizer and there has been heavy rainfall in the area, it is highly likely that more nitrogen from his farm will reach the nearby ponds. Consequently, this will contribute to a higher level of oxygen being used up by algae growth and decomposers, potentially leading to dead zones. In contrast, Kenny's currently low usage of fertilizer indicates that he will cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near his farm, as there is less nitrogen being introduced into the water through runoff."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Select from the following. [1]. yes [2]. it is not possible to tell [3]. no And the answer is:","output":"[3]. no The hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The premise states that The New Yorker began offering something, with Brown generating buzz for it in order to increase circulation. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that Brown decided not to create any buzz for the offering. These two statements directly contradict each other. As a result, the hypothesis cannot be supported by the premise provided. The premise does not offer enough information to be clear on the context or subject of the buzz Brown is creating; however, it does establish that Brown is actively and intentionally generating buzz for some purpose related to The New Yorker. The hypothesis suggests an opposite course of action, creating a clear contradiction and preventing the hypothesis from being entailed by the premise. To further strengthen this point of view, let's examine some key aspects of the premise and hypothesis: 1. The premise specifically mentions that Brown generated buzz to increase circulation. This detail strengthens the connection between Brown's actions and their intended purpose, further distancing the premise from the hypothesis, which proposes that Brown did not create any buzz at all. 2. The contrast between the two statements serves as evidence that the hypothesis does not simply suggest an alternative course of action or a possible outcome but instead directly contradicts the information provided in the premise. This reinforces the conclusion that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. 3. Finally, it's important to consider that the premise and hypothesis focus on distinctly different actions for Brown. If the hypothesis were to suggest a different approach to boost circulation without contradicting Brown's initial buzz creation as mentioned in the premise, it might be possible to argue that the hypothesis is entailed or at least supported by the information provided. However, in its current form, the hypothesis directly negates the premise, making it impossible to be entailed by it. In conclusion, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise because it directly contradicts the information provided. Instead of presenting a connected or supportive idea, the hypothesis challenges and negates the core component of the premise, namely Brown's intentional and successful generation of buzz to fuel circulation for The New Yorker."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1998, Moore released his first solo album, Dead Air For Radios, under the name Chroma Key on his self-created record label, Fight Evil Records. Mark Zonder and Joey Vera of Fates Warning served as his support musicians for that record. The album featured a dark, ambient sound, closer to Peter Gabriel and Tori Amos than the complex and intricate Dream Theater style. In hindsight, Dream Theater fans noticed that Moore had subtly explored this style of composition in \\"Space-Dye Vest.\\"  In 2000, Moore moved to Los Angeles, California, where he recorded the digitally-themed You Go Now. The line-up for that record was Moore, David Iscove (guitars) and Steve Tushar (loops, programming). During his westcoast stay, Moore earned a BFA at California Institute of the Arts, where he created a little-known documentary called Octember Revolution, which depicted a Southern California gated community intervention. He then moved to Costa Rica, where he worked for Radio For Peace International, producing a bi-weekly activist radio program. In fact, some of Moore's work on Radio for Peace International was later released in an internet-only album called Memory Hole 1.  In 2004, Moore scoured public domain films looking for one that exuded a certain mood, intending to write a pseudo-soundtrack to it. The film he chose was Age 13, an educational film from the 1950s, originally for use in schools. He took the existing film, slowed it to half speed, and let it dictate the moods, textures, and even running times of the songs he wrote to it. The resulting album is titled Graveyard Mountain Home, which included a DVD containing the movie set to Moore's music.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is a test of commonsense. Complete the next sentence: How to afford a trip to europe  Save your money.  The longer you plan on staying in europe, the more money you will need to save. Employ the following money-saving techniques :  Cut back on unnecessary spending.","output":"The first step in affording a trip to Europe is to set a realistic budget. This should include costs such as flights, accommodation, food and beverages, transportation, sightseeing, shopping, and any other miscellaneous expenses. Once you have a clear picture of how much your trip will cost, you can create a savings plan in order to meet your financial goals. 1. Cut back on unnecessary spending: Reevaluate your current spending habits and identify areas where you can cut back or eliminate costs. This may include reducing or cancelling subscriptions, dining out less often, or rethinking your entertainment choices. Additionally, evaluate your utilities and consider options like bundling services or changing providers to save on recurring monthly expenses. 2. Create a separate savings account: Set up a separate bank account specifically for your trip savings, and automate your savings by having a portion of your paycheck automatically deposited into this account. This will ensure that you consistently save money and avoid the temptation to spend it on other things. 3. Allocate windfalls and bonuses: Whenever you receive a tax refund, bonus, or any other windfall, allocate a portion or all of it towards your trip fund. By using these unexpected funds proactively, you can reach your savings goal more quickly. 4. Shop smarter: Be mindful of your spending on day-to-day items. Use coupons, compare prices, and buy generic brands when possible to save on groceries, clothing, and other everyday purchases. You can then allocate the money saved in these areas to your Europe fund. 5. Downsize or sell items: If you have unnecessary items around your home that you no longer need, consider selling them online or through a garage sale. This not only allows you to declutter but also contributes to the funds you're saving for your trip. 6. Cut transportation costs: Consider using public transportation, carpooling, biking, or walking instead of relying on your car for transportation. Reducing fuel costs, insurance, and car maintenance will free up more money for your Europe trip savings. 7. Take on a side job: Look for opportunities to earn extra income, such as freelancing, working a part-time job, or offering your skills for hire. The additional revenue generated can be allocated to your Europe trip fund, allowing you to reach your goal faster. 8. Set up a visual reminder: Visual cues can help motivate and remind you of your savings goal. Create a vision board, savings tracker, or even a simple jar with a label \\"Europe Trip Fund\\" and place it somewhere visible to encourage you to stay focused on your goal. 9. Use a budgeting app: Many budgeting apps are available that can help you manage your finances, track your spending, and identify areas where you can save more money. These apps can be a great tool for reaching your Europe trip savings goal. 10. Be strategic with your travel plans: Choose off-peak travel season, stay in budget accommodations, or consider visiting less expensive countries to help stretch your travel budget. Additionally, searching for flight deals, comparing prices, and booking accommodations well in advance can also result in significant savings. Implement these money-saving tips and strategies to help you reduce unnecessary expenses and allocate more funds towards your dream trip to Europe. Stay disciplined, focused, and motivated, and you will reach your savings goal before you know it."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Math Problem Solve 26*g - 20*g + 452 = -20*g - 458 for g.","output":"Alright, let's solve this math problem step by step like we're explaining to a five-year-old. We have the equation: 26*g - 20*g + 452 = -20*g - 458. First, we need to simplify the equation by combining like terms.  On the left side of the equation, we have 26*g and -20*g. Since they both have a 'g', we can add them together: (26*g) - (20*g) = 6*g Now, our equation looks like this: 6*g + 452 = -20*g - 458. Next, we want to move all the 'g' terms on one side, and the numbers on the other side. To do that, we'll add 20*g to both sides of the equation: (6*g) + (20*g) = 6*g + 20*g + 452 - 20*g. This simplifies to: 26*g + 452 = -458. Now, we want to move the number '452' to the other side. To do that, we'll subtract 452 from both sides: 26*g = -458 - 452. This simplifies to: 26*g = -910. Finally, we want to find the value of 'g'. To find that, we need to divide by '26'.  So, g = (-910) / 26. When we divide -910 by 26, we get: g = -35. So, the answer to the math problem is g = -35."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: One day a poor student walked in a town.

He and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet founded America's first school for the deaf. When Laurent Clerc was one year old, he fell into a fire. As a result, he lost both his hearing and his sense of smell. At the age of 12, Laurent entered the Royal Institution for the Deaf in Paris. After he graduated, the school asked him to stay on as an assistant teacher. Meanwhile, in America, Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet was studying to be a minister when he met a young deaf girl, Alice Cogswell. He was upset to learn that there were no schools for the deaf in America. Therefore, in 1815, Gallaudet sailed to London to seek ideas on how to teach deaf people. However, he was unable to get help. He met a French educator of the deaf who invited him to Paris to learn at the Royal Institution for the Deaf. Gallaudet went to the Royal Institution for the Deaf, where Clerc became his Sign Language teacher. The two worked and studied well together. When the time came for Gallaudet to return to America, he asked Clerc to come with him. The two men set sail on June 18, 1816. The voyage across the Atlantic Ocean took 52 days; however, Clerc and Gallaudet put the time to good use. They discussed the school for the deaf which they planned to open. On the long trip, they had many conversations about education and deafness. The year after they arrived, they founded a school for the deaf in Harford, Connecticut.

Story Continued Below      Returning to the first issue that helped him vanquish more than a dozen Republican rivals in the 2016 campaign, the president emphasized the need to build a border wall, lest his supporters forget about reports of another caravan of 4,000 Central American migrants traveling from Honduras with hopes of entering the U.S. Trump, flirting with conspiracy theories about the possibility that the migrants are being paid off, said money was being “passed through” those very people.      \\"Now we're starting to find out — and I won't say it 100 percent, I'll put it a little tiny question mark on the end, but we're not going to get it, but we have the fake news back there, fake news — a lot of money has been passing through people to try to get to the border by Election Day, because they think that is a negative for us,” the president told the crowd. “Number one, they are being stopped and number two, regardless, that's our issue.\\"      Morning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a frequent ally, posted on Twitter on Wednesday that supposedly depicted migrants in Honduras “giving cash” to migrants in the Central American country as they set of for the U.S. Going even further, Gaetz called for an investigation to examine whether “US-backed NGOs” or the financier George Soros, a frequent subject of conservative conspiracy theories, were behind the alleged payments. Trump himself tweeted out the video on Thursday.      Regardless of what was actually being passed out in the video, where men are shown handing something to women waiting in line, there was evidence that the video was actually shot in Guatemala, not Honduras.      In an apparent correction of the location, Gaetz tweeted on Thursday: “Because a Honduran government official sent me this video, I believed it came from Honduras.” It is not known when the video was shot.      At the rally, the president added that Democrats figured “everybody coming in” was going to vote for their candidates — though he did not mention that only legal citizens can participate in elections, and that attaining nationality and registering to vote is a process that can’t be completed before Nov. 6.      White House aides and allies said the president has been smarting over the uptick in border crossings and the group heading toward the U.S.-Mexican border. On Trump’s way to the Montana rally, scenes of the caravan played on a loop on Fox News, to which TVs aboard Air Force One were tuned. Presidential aides said that polling they’d reviewed internally showed the migrant issue rising in importance with midterm voters, and that they expected Trump to continue to focus on immigration policies.      Trump praised Mexico during the rally for its help with the caravan before it even gets to Mexico, but the country's ambassador said that Mexico does not have a deal with the U.S. to stop the migrants.      \\"We work very closely with the United States government in addressing our shared objectives regarding regional migration,\\" Mexican Ambassador to the United States Geronimo Gutierrez told CNN's Chris Cuomo on \\"Cuomo Prime Time.      According to a New York Times report , the group of migrants, estimated to be as large as 4,000 people, is making the journey to America for a number of reasons, including fleeing gang violence in their neighborhoods and others who simply want a more stable life for their children.      Immigration was just one of the themes Trump touched on during his roughly hour-long rally, which was billed as an event to boost the candidacy of Montana State Auditor Matt Rosendale, who is seeking to oust Sen. Jon Tester in what was originally expected to be one of the toughest seats for Democrats to defend.      In his usual loose and off-script style, the president mentioned everything from Hillary Clinton’s emails and the 2012 attack Benghazi, Libya, to the manufacturing of F35s, the treatment of Kavanaugh and just why Montana is called Big Sky country.      Amid one riff, Trump explicitly praised Republican Rep. Greg Gianforte’s body slamming of Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs during his special election campaign last year.      “Any guy who can do a body slam is my guy,” Trump said, while praising the Montana Republican. “I think it might help him, and it did,” he added of the effect the episode had on the race.      Republicans have said Senate Democrats’ treatment of Kavanaugh amid allegations of sexual assault jolted their base in the past couple of weeks and has forced candidates like Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) to go on the defensive. Trump has said the handling of his Supreme Court pick’s nomination made Democrats unworthy of holding on to power, but on Thursday he also brought up the treatment of former White House physician Ronny Jackson, saying the two episodes were virtually identical.      Jackson was nominated to be Veterans Affairs secretary, but withdrew from consideration and resigned from his job after reports alleged that he drank on the job, over-prescribed medicine to employees and created a hostile work environment. The allegations against Jackson were primarily publicized by Tester, a fact that Trump hasn’t forgotten.      “He never had a problem in his whole life — a little bit like Justice Kavanaugh. Really a fine, high-quality, handsome guy,” Trump said of Jackson. “He was going to be my choice, and he was attacked so viciously and so violently by Jon Tester.” ||||| President Donald Trump arrives as the sun sets to speak at a campaign rally at Minuteman Aviation Hangar, Thursday, Oct. 18, 2018, in Missoula, Mont. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) (Associated Press)      President Donald Trump arrives as the sun sets to speak at a campaign rally at Minuteman Aviation Hangar, Thursday, Oct. 18, 2018, in Missoula, Mont. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) (Associated Press)      MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) — President Donald Trump suggested without evidence Thursday that Democrats or their allies are supporting a \\"caravan\\" of Central American migrants who are traveling north aiming to enter the United States.      Addressing thousands of supporters at a campaign rally in Montana, Trump said immigration is now one of the leading issues in the 2018 midterms, and he accused Democrats of supporting the migrants because they \\"figure everybody coming in is going to vote Democrat.\\"      The comments mark the injection of one of Trump's signature 2016 campaign themes back into national conversation as he looks to boost Republican turnout to maintain their congressional majorities in 2018.      Trump was in Montana to boost GOP Senate candidate Matt Rosendale, who is running against Democratic Sen. Jon Tester — a lawmaker the president says has been a \\"disaster for Montana.\\"      The president blames Tester for the backlash against former White House doctor Adm. Ronny Jackson, whom the president had tapped to serve as Veterans Affairs secretary. Jackson was forced to withdraw after facing ethics allegations, including claims that he got drunk and wrecked a government vehicle at a Secret Service going-away party. Tester had released a list of allegations against Jackson that was compiled by the Democratic staff of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.      \\"He was attacked so viciously, so violently by Jon Tester,\\" Trump claimed Thursday. \\"That's really why I'm here.\\"      Trump also heaped praise on Republican Rep. Greg Gianforte, who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault after attacking a reporter in 2017. \\"Any guy that can do a body slam, he's my kind of guy,\\" Trump said. \\"He's a great guy, tough cookie.\\"      Gianforte is being challenged in November's election by former state legislator Kathleen Williams.      Trump brought up Tester's opposition to the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of decades-old sexual assault. Kavanaugh denied the allegations.      Trump accused Democrats of engaging in a \\"heartless\\" campaign to sink Kavanaugh's confirmation, saying voters will \\"remember\\" how he was treated at the polls.      \\"This will be an election of Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order, and common sense,\\" Trump said.      Throughout his 73-minute rally, Trump was cheered when he called for building a wall along the nation's southern border. The crowd booed when he spoke of his Democratic opposition to his policies.      Earlier in the day, Trump threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border if authorities there fail to stop about 3,000 Hondurans, who are in a migrant caravan passing through Guatemala trying to reach the United States. Mexico's government says migrants with proper documents can enter Mexico and those who don't either have to apply for refugee status or face deportation.      \\"A lot of money's been passing through people to come up and try to get to the border by Election Day because they think that's a negative for us,\\" Trump said. \\"No. 1, they're being stopped, and No. 2, regardless, that's our issue.\\"      He added: \\"They wanted that caravan and there are those that say that caravan didn't just happen. It didn't just happen.\\"      Trump appeared to be referring to an unfounded allegation promoted by ally Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida. The Republican lawmaker tweeted a video on Wednesday of men handing out money to people standing in line. He claimed the video showed people being paid in Honduras to join a caravan and \\"storm the border @ election time.\\" Trump on Thursday tweeted the same video, writing, \\"Can you believe this, and what Democrats are allowing to be done to our Country?\\"      After questions about the video's origin, Gaetz posted a correction later Thursday on Twitter, saying, \\"This video was provided to me by a Honduran government official. Thus, I believed it to be from Honduras.\\"      Neither Republican provided evidence of his claim that the people were being paid to join a caravan.      Montana marks Trump's first stop on a three-day trip out West that will take him to the border state of Arizona, where the politics of immigration are fraught, and to Nevada. Trump is boosting Republican Senate candidates as the GOP looks to maintain or expand their majority and to support vulnerable House candidates running on his ticket. |||||","output":"President Donald Trump talked about a group of Central American migrants trying to reach the U.S. at a rally in Montana.

It is mid-afternoon on a sunny day in July, and Mark and Jeffrey are deciding which car they want to take to go to the movies.  Which car, Mark's or Jeffrey's, will be hotter on the inside? A:","output":"On a sunny day in July, the interior of a car can heat up significantly due to solar radiation entering through the windows and being absorbed by the surfaces inside the car. The trapped heat increases the temperature in the car, making it hotter than the outside air. Between Mark's car with a dark interior and Jeffrey's car with a lighter colored interior, Mark's car will likely be hotter on the inside. Darker colors absorb more sunlight and convert it into heat, causing the temperature inside the car to rise more rapidly than lighter colored interiors, which reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat.

News article: The long, draining Republican primary season may finally have reached a turning point Tuesday, as Mitt Romney swept three contests in Wisconsin, Maryland and the District of Columbia, potentially dealing a decisive blow to his most dogged foe, Rick Santorum.      Wisconsin is the marquee prize, and the triumph most likely to push the GOP nomination fight toward conclusion. Romney and Santorum campaigned heavily there and the super PACs supporting them spent substantial sums on the air. With 13 percent of precincts reporting, Romney had 44 percent of the vote to Santorum’s 38 percent.      Text Size -      +      reset      Romney’s victories in Maryland and the nation’s capital were more imposing: Romney had 48 percent of the Maryland vote with 23 percent of precincts reporting and 69 percent of the D.C. vote with 28 percent of precincts in.      But it was in Wisconsin where Santorum once again tried to derail Romney by drawing conservative, blue-collar voters to his cause. And as in the Michigan, Ohio and Illinois primaries, Santorum’s effort fell short.      Romney’s trifecta will increase the pressure on Santorum, as well as on Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul, to clear the way for a Romney nomination and allow the GOP to focus on challenging President Barack Obama.      In remarks to his Wisconsin election-night party, Romney made yet another attempt to put the primary behind him and turn his focus to Obama, ridiculing the president as “a little bit out of touch” and denouncing what he called Obama’s vision of a “government-centered society.”      Ticking off the states set to vote three weeks from now on April 24, Romney cast Tuesday’s results as the almost-final word on the Republican presidential nomination.      “We have a sacred duty to restore the promise of America. And we will do it. We will do it because we believe in America. Join me in the next step toward that destination of Nov. 6, when across America we can give a sigh of relief,” Romney said. “Join me and take another step every day until Nov. 6.”      (Also on POLITICO: GOP delegate tracker)      That pivot toward the fall comes after a run of top GOP establishment endorsements for the former Massachusetts governor. Having struggled throughout the 2012 race to lure heavyweight national Republicans to his team, Romney recently won the backing of House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.      Of Romney’s opponents, Santorum is the one who continues to deliver the feistiest message against his party’s front-runner. The former Pennsylvania senator has vowed to stay in the race regardless of the Wisconsin results. He plans to take the fight to his home state of Pennsylvania, which votes April 24, and into a series of conservative-leaning states in May. ||||| Results From Wisconsin, Maryland and D.C.      Results, updates and analysis from the Republican contests in Wisconsin, Maryland and D.C. ||||| Story highlights NEW : Santorum says he'll continue fight in home state, Pennsylvania, on April 24      : Santorum says he'll continue fight in home state, Pennsylvania, on April 24 Romney: \\"We won a great victory tonight \\"      Romney more than halfway to 1,144 delegates he needs for nomination, CNN estimates      Mitt Romney won all three of Tuesday's Republican presidential primaries, putting more distance between himself and his closest contender, Rick Santorum, who indicated he plans to fight on to his home state of Pennsylvania and beyond.      Romney's wins in Wisconsin, Maryland and the District of Columbia put him past the halfway mark to the 1,144 delegates needed to clinch the nomination and add to a wide delegate lead that he holds over the other major GOP presidential candidates, according to CNN estimates.      Yet Santorum indicated Tuesday night he would compete in the April 24 primaries in five states, including Pennsylvania, where his campaign hopes a win would be a gateway to a run of May primaries in states where he can capitalize on higher percentages of conservative voters.      Romney, in a speech to supporters in Milwaukee, made no mention of his GOP rivals and instead mostly contrasted himself with President Barack Obama.      \\"This has really been quite a night. We won a great victory tonight in our campaign to restore the promise of America,\\" Romney said.      He continued his criticism of Obama's economic polices and what he repeatedly called Obama's plan for a \\"government centered society.\\"      \\"There is a basic choice that we're going to face: The president has pledged to transform America, and he spent the last four years laying the foundation for a new government-centered society. I will spend the next four years rebuilding the foundation of an opportunity society led by free people and free enterprises.\\"      The former Massachusetts governor is expected to take the majority of Wisconsin's 42 delegates and Maryland's 37 delegates, with some designated solely for the winner and the rest to be awarded proportionally. He will take all 16 delegates at stake in the District of Columbia.      JUST WATCHED Ehrlich: Romney is strong Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH Santorum looking ahead to PA primary 02:16      Counting partial allocations for Wisconsin and Maryland, and full allocations for D.C., Romney has collected 648 delegates since the primary and caucuses began in January, according to CNN estimates. That's more than twice the 264 delegates Santorum is estimated to hold. Gingrich and Paul trailed well back.      With 93% of the vote reported in Wisconsin, Romney had 42% and Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, had 38%. U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas had 12%, and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich had 6%.      In Maryland, with 75% of the vote reported, Romney had 49%. Santorum had 29%, Gingrich had 11% and Paul had 10%.      In the District of Columbia, with 99% of the vote reported, Romney had 70%. Paul had 12% and Gingrich had 11%. Santorum was not on the D.C. ballot.      Pre-primary polls appeared to show Wisconsin's contest was the only one Tuesday that Santorum had a chance to win. And analysts said Wisconsin might be Santorum's final chance to slow Romney's march toward the GOP nomination.      But Santorum told supporters in Mars, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday night that the race was essentially at halftime, with only roughly half the available delegates awarded.      \\"Pennsylvania and half the other people in this country have yet to be heard, and we're going to go out and campaign here and across this nation to make sure that their voices are heard in the next few months,\\" Santorum said.      Santorum, who has touted himself as a more conservative candidate than Romney, also warned supporters that the Republican Party often has fielded moderate Republicans against incumbent Democratic presidents, only to see the moderate Republican lose. He appeared to raise Ronald Reagan, a conservative who defeated Jimmy Carter in 1980, as an example for a way forward.      \\"If we're going to win this race, we can't have little differences between our nominee and President Obama. We have to have clear, contrasting colors,\\" Santorum said. \\"... Time and time again, the Republican establishment and aristocracy have shoved down the throats of the Republican Party and people across this country moderate Republicans because, of course, we have to win by getting people in the middle. There's one person who understood we don't win by moving to the middle. We win by getting people to the middle to move to us and move this country forward.\\"      President Barack Obama, meanwhile, clinched the Democratic presidential nomination Tuesday with primary wins in Maryland, the District of Columbia and Wisconsin, CNN projected. Unlike the Republicans, Obama faces no serious opposition in his race.      According to CNN's delegate estimate, the president had 2,735 of the 2,778 delegates needed to secure his party's nod before Tuesday's contest. He is expected to win most or all of the 119 delegates at stake in Maryland and D.C., as well as the 100 delegates at stake in Wisconsin.      On the Republican side, since Romney's double-digit victory in Illinois two weeks ago -- followed by a wave of some of the Republican Party's major names and elder statesmen endorsing him and urging a quick conclusion to the divisive nomination battle -- the conversation seems to have changed: the GOP front-runner increasingly being called the inevitable nominee.

About 60% of respondents said the Romney endorsements were a factor in their votes, and 33% called them an \\"important\\" factor. Most of those voters broke for Romney.      CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley reported that Romney's campaign was prepared to spend \\"a lot of money and a lot of candidate time in Pennsylvania,\\" where polls show Santorum's once-large lead has shrunk.      Santorum's campaign points toward May, which looks friendlier for him. He could be the favorite in primaries in North Carolina and West Virginia on May 8, Nebraska on May 15, Arkansas and Kentucky on May 22 and Texas a week later.      But it could be too little, too late by May. Sen. Hillary Clinton won most of the final contests against Sen. Barack Obama in the marathon 2008 Democratic presidential nomination battle. But in the end, it didn't matter.      And Ari Fleischer, a CNN contributor and former George W. Bush White House spokesman, said that while he believed that Santorum earned the right to fight through Pennsylvania, the race was all but over.      \\"I think the writing is on the wall. Does Rick Satorum want to read it is the question,\\" Fleischer said.      Romney and Obama on Tuesday seemed to be turning their attention to November's general election, with Romney blasting the president during a campaign stop in Wisconsin and Obama mentioning Romney in a speech for the first time this year.      Speaking at a restaurant in Waukesha, Wisconsin, Romney suggested Obama wants to duck responsibility \\"for what's happened in this country,\\" saying the president should get full credit or blame for \\"what's happened in this economy, and what's happened to gasoline prices under his watch.\\"      \\"It is time to have somebody who will take responsibility, and if I am president, I will not only get things right again, I will take full responsibility for my errors and make sure that people understand we have a president in the White House again where the buck will stop at his desk,\\" Romney said, while standing with House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, a prominent Wisconsinite who endorsed Romney.      Later Tuesday, Obama mentioned Romney while slamming a House-passed budget proposal that Ryan drew up and Romney embraced.      Obama, speaking at a media luncheon in Washington, said the plan, which would lower tax rates and cut spending while reforming the Medicare and Medicaid government-run health care programs, was \\"thinly veiled Social Darwinism\\" and \\"antithetical to our entire history as a land of opportunity and upward mobility for everyone who's willing to work for it.\\"      \\"One of my political opponents, Gov. Romney, has said that he hoped a similar version of this plan from last year would be introduced on day one of his presidency,\\" Obama said. \\"He said that he's very supportive of this new budget and he even called it marvelous, which is a word you don't often hear when it comes to describing a budget.\\"      While Romney is far ahead of Santorum, Gingrich and Paul in the hunt for delegates, exit polls have indicated Romney still has a problem locking in the conservative base of the party.      That continues to fuel Santorum's campaign, in which he continually depicts himself as the lone true conservative going up against the Republican establishment and liberal media bias.      As in previous contests, Wisconsin's early exit polls showed Romney doing better among higher-earners and Santorum better with lower-income voters. Among exit-poll takers making 100,000 to 200,000 annually, Romney led 55%-30%, with Santorum winning the under-30,000 voters, 44%-34%.      The Wisconsin exit polls showed Santorum is more popular in rural areas and Romney in urban areas in Wisconsin. According to the exit polls, Santorum was winning the rural vote, 37%-27%, and Romney was winning big-city voters, 43%-23%.      About 24% of the vote in Wisconsin came from urban areas and 22% from rural areas, according to the exit polls. The rest is suburban.      Wisconsin's primary was open to any registered voter in the state, regardless of party. Exit polls showed that 58% described themselves as Republicans, 30% said they were independent and 12% said they were Democrats.      Santorum was doing best among self-described Democrats with 32% of their vote, while Romney had 22% and Paul had 16%. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Mitt Romney achieved a significant milestone in the Republican primary season by winning three contests in Wisconsin, Maryland, and the District of Columbia, potentially dealing a decisive blow to his main challenger, Rick Santorum.

The association of the human eye with mirrors was so strong that stylized eyes were often used in Teotihuacan - art as a substitute for the face of a mirror . The association of the stylized eye with mirrors was so strong that in the Teotihuacan art , human eyes were often used as a substitute for the face of a mirror .","output":"Yes, these two sentences do have the same overall meaning. However, the way the subject is presented and the structure of the sentences is slightly different, and the focus shifts slightly. The first sentence emphasizes the \\"association of the human eye with mirrors.\\" This suggests that the common iconography or symbol of the human eye had such a strong correlation with mirrors that the artists of Teotihuacan would stylize eyes in their artwork to represent the mirror. The use of eyes, therefore, could be perceived as a symbol or metaphor for mirrors. The word ‘substitute’ indicates that in place of illustrating a mirror directly, artists would depict an eye. The same basic idea is communicated by the second sentence, but the stress is slightly different. This sentence emphasizes the \\"association of the stylized eye with mirrors.\\" Here, it is the stylized eye specifically (not necessarily the human eye in general) that is strongly associated with mirrors. In other words, it suggests that eyes sketched or depicted in a particular stylized form were associated with mirrors. Similar to the first sentence, the artists of Teotihuacan often used human eyes to symbolize the face of a mirror. Thus, both sentences are dealing with the same concept of symbology in Teotihuacan art and the use of the eye as a metaphor for the mirror. However, the first sentence seems to discuss a broader concept of the human eye symbolizing a mirror, while the second sentence appears to focus more on a specific stylization of the eye being associated with mirrors. The two sentences express very nuanced differences - where the primary difference is probably on emphasis - but both utterances allude to the symbolism of mirrors and eyes in Teotihuacan art, where eyes are used as a stand-in for mirrors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He says that \\"animals may compete for territory, water, food, or mates\\" and \\"pigs are very intelligent animals\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? Answer:","output":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"what may compete for territory, water, food, or mates?\\" would be 'animals', particularly focusing on the example of 'pigs' as intelligent animals.  Animals in the natural world face constant competition for resources such as territory, water, food, and mates. This is a fundamental aspect of life that drives the process of natural selection and evolution. Competition among animals ensures that only the fittest and most capable individuals pass on their genetic traits to future generations. Territoriality plays a significant role in animal life, and animals often compete for spacious and resource-rich territories to live and breed in. This competition is especially fierce among animals that employ resource-defense polygyny, where a male will defend a territory rich in resources that will attract potential mates. A prominent example is the red deer, in which males compete for territories with the best vegetation and access to breeding sites to attract females. Much like territory, competition for water is inevitable among animals, primarily in arid and drought-prone regions. Access to clean and abundant water supplies is crucial to an animal's survival and reproductive success. Thus, animals often engage in aggressive behavior and indicators of dominance, such as posturing or vocalizations, to warn off competitors and claim water resources for themselves and their kin. Food is a primary driving force for competition among animals. Predators compete for prey in what's referred to as intraguild predation, where species on similar trophic levels hunt the same preferred prey species. A classic example is the African savannah, where lions, hyenas, and African wild dogs all compete for the same prey, like zebra, wildebeest, and antelope. Lastly, competition for mates is a crucial element of an animal's reproductive success. Sexual selection is a significant evolutionary force that shapes animals' behavior, morphology, and physiology. In many species, the competition for mates is highly intense, particularly in species with a high operational sex ratio. A well-documented example of this competition is found in elephant seals, where an alpha male, also known as a 'beachmaster,' defends his territory and harem of females from competing males seeking to mate with them. In conclusion, animals, including highly intelligent species like pigs, compete for vital resources such as territory, water, food, or mates to ensure their survival and reproductive success. This competition is an essential driving force in the natural world, influencing the process of evolution and natural selection."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Dr. Melon had previously been ridiculed by his peers for theorizing that the real Crown Jewels of England were stolen during the Revolutionary War and were actually hidden inside the long-lost cannon.  They begin to search for the artifact near the construction site and eventually locate it inside an abandoned mine. They are ambushed by historical antiquity collector and Dr. Melon's colleague Dr. Glencliff whom they then lead on an action-packed chase through the countryside. Things become more complicated for them when British authorities hear about the incident and send a team of secret agents after them to retrieve the jewels.

Part of the Lesser Antilles, it is located north/northeast of the island of Saint Vincent, northwest of Barbados and south of Martinique. It covers a land area of 617 km (238.23 sq mi) and reported a population of 165,595 in the 2010 census. Its capital is Castries.  The French were the island's first European settlers. They signed a treaty with the native Carib Indians in 1660. England took control of the island from 1663 to 1667. In ensuing years, it was at war with France 14 times, and rule of the island changed frequently (it was seven times each ruled by the French and British). In 1814, the British took definitive control of the island. Because it switched so often between British and French control, Saint Lucia was also known as the \\"Helen of the West Indies\\".  Representative government came about in 1840 (with universal suffrage from 1953). From 1958 to 1962, the island was a member of the Federation of the West Indies. On 22 February 1979, Saint Lucia became an independent state of the Commonwealth of Nations associated with the United Kingdom. Saint Lucia is a mixed jurisdiction, meaning that it has a legal system based in part on both the civil law and English common law.

Imagine you have some candies and you need to decide how many you're going to give to your friend. So, right now we have this little equation that looks like a tricky puzzle: -9*h + 137 = 38. We're trying to find out how much h equals to, right?  To do that, let's first try to get anything that's added or subtracted with h alone. So, let's get rid of that 137 from the left side. The opposite of adding is subtracting, so we'll subtract 137 from both sides. That will leave us with:  -9*h = 38 - 137. Now, your job is to subtract 38 from 137. If you're having trouble with it, imagine you have 137 candies and you're giving away 38. How many would you have left? You're right, you'd have 99 left, but it's going to be -99 because in this puzzle when we did 38 minus 137, the answer is negative. So now we have: -9*h = -99. Now, we just have to figure out what h is and that's easy! Right now, h is being multiplied by -9 and we want to get h alone, so we'll do the opposite of multiplying, which is dividing. We're going to divide both sides of the equation by -9, like this: -9*h/-9 = -99/-9. If you have -99 candies and share them equally 9 friends, how many would each friend get?

A mechanic is believed to have murdered his wife and then killed himself when he was hit by a train. Nigel Maude, 58, died on the tracks near the rural village of Hoghton, Lancashire, on Sunday morning. British Transport Police went to his home nearby to inform his wife of 30 years Judith where they found her body in an upstairs bedroom. Tragedy: Police found the body of Judith Maude in the upstairs bedroom of their home in Hoghton, Lancashire. Investigation: Nigel Maude died after throwing himself in front of a train in the village on Sunday morning. Detectives with Lancashire Police have now started a murder investigation but say they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident. Today, neighbours spoke of their shock at the deaths of a 'happy and quiet' couple, who had two daughters and four grandchildren. Mr Maude worked as a mechanic and lived with his wife in a semi-detached home in Charles Crescent in Hoghton. They had lived there since inheriting the property from his parents. Next door neighbour, Celia Livesey: 'They were a devoted couple and all they lived for was their family. They were very quiet and very pleasant. I only really saw them to say hello over the fence. 'They loved their grandchildren, they had four grandchildren, one girl and three boys. 'The first time I knew anything was about 8.30pm and saw all the police and the ambulance. 'Judith didn’t work and Nigel worked at Leyland Motors, I don’t think he was retired. I’m just so shocked, I really can’t believe it.' Another neighbour, who asked to remain anonymous, said: 'I knew them both, if you were to say \\"who is a couple who never argued\\" you would say them. 'I had known him since primary school and known Judith since she was 15. I still can’t believe it has happened.' Shock: Neighbours described the Maudes as a 'happy and quiet' couple. 'He served as a mechanic before going to Leyland Motors. I don’t think he has been very well and I think he may have been in hospital but I don’t know why. 'They were together all the time. They liked walking. They have been married 30-odd years. 'You couldn’t ask for a nicer couple and couldn’t find a bad word to say about him. He was a Preston North End supporter. 'He couldn’t fall out with anyone if he tried. He was a real family man, he was devoted to his grandchildren.' Another neighbour said: 'We think the police came to the house to tell Judith and nobody came to the door. The door was open and they came in and found Judith upstairs. 'The way it’s looking is that he has killed her and then killed himself. The kept themselves to themselves, but they always had their grandchildren with them.'

A Lancashire Police spokesman said: 'A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found at an address in Hoghton on Sunday, August 11. 'Around 8.35pm police were called to an address on Charles Crescent where the body of a woman aged in her 50s was found in an upstairs bedroom. A post mortem examination will take place later today to establish the cause of her death. 'The house remains sealed off whilst an investigation takes place.

Write a summary based on this article: Facing slipping poll numbers, an angry Newt Gingrich lashed out at his Republican presidential rivals Monday, calling their criticism of him \\"reprehensible\\" and helpful only to President Obama 's reelection.Voters in Iowa have been swamped by nonstop television attack ads, robocalls and mailers from the campaigns and independent supporters of candidates Mitt Romney , Ron Paul and Rick Perry . Among the claims in the ads: that Gingrich is a serial hypocrite and flip-flopper on issues such as a health insurance mandate, and that he made 1.6 million working for Freddie Mac , the mortgage giant blamed by many Republicans for the economic collapse.\\"It's candidly very disappointing to see some of my friends who are running put out so much negative junk,\\" Gingrich told scores of voters gathered at a security firm in Davenport.Though he declined to criticize them by name and said he would continue to run a positive campaign, Gingrich's disdain for his rivals was palpable.\\"I really wish they would have the courage to be positive, and I wish they would have the courage to have a campaign which would match ideas [rather] than see whose consultants can be the nastier,\\" he said.Gingrich spoke as new polls showed him losing ground nationally and in Iowa, where the first nominating contests will take place Jan. 3, as Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, gains ground.Gingrich, a former House speaker who usurped Romney's position as front-runner several weeks ago, said he would hold telephone call-in town halls every day until the Iowa caucuses so voters can ask about the claims being leveled.He also said he would soon launch a 44-stop tour. \\"I will tell you what I stand for, what I'm trying to accomplish and, second, I will answer any question that comes up based on the false and inaccurate advertisements of some of my friends.\\"Gingrich's newly announced moves are meant to prevent him from following the trajectories of Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, Texas Gov. Perry and businessman Herman Cain , candidates who in succession rose abruptly and fell nearly as swiftly. Only Romney and Paul, a congressman from Texas, have had relatively stable, even increasing, support over the last few months.For Gingrich's campaign, the slump is his second in several months. He lost almost all of his aides over the summer when, shortly after he entered the race, he took a two-week Mediterranean cruise with his wife instead of campaigning. He was left in debt and running on fumes.But as many Republican voters lost faith in the other candidates as alternatives to Romney, Gingrich was the most recent beneficiary. Yet the new Iowa polling shows a tight race, with Romney and Paul as front-runners and Gingrich in third.\\"People are starting to remember why they didn't think Gingrich was a strong candidate to start with,\\" said Tim Hagle, a political science professor at the University of Iowa.The allegations against him are clearly on the minds of Iowa voters. During the town hall Monday, one voter asked about the Freddie Mac contract. Republican rivals have accused Gingrich of profiting from his former position as speaker and, in effect, lobbying members of Congress.Gingrich replied that he flubbed his initial response to questions about his work for the organization. \\"What we should have done … is stopped, pulled together everything, and I should have had a much more coherent answer,\\" he said.Gingrich said Freddie Mac hired his firm for six years and that he personally received about 35,000 a year. He said he opposed any federal bailout of the organization.Another person asked about Gingrich's past support of a mandate requiring people to purchase health insurance, a key part of Obama's healthcare law that is opposed by most Republican voters. Gingrich said he supported such a mandate in the early 1990s as an alternative to a healthcare proposal by Hillary Rodham Clinton when she was first lady, and that he later decided a mandate was unacceptable.As Gingrich tries to right himself in Iowa, his campaign also is under siege nationally because of organizational problems.Gingrich conceded that his campaign is struggling to gather enough signatures to get on the ballot in some states, with the next test occurring Thursday in Virginia. In the process, he took a veiled swipe at Romney.\\"We're scrambling. Look, there's no question some candidates have been running for five or six years and have raised millions and millions of dollars and they're better organized than I am,\\" he told reporters after the event. \\"On the other hand ... I'm clearly one of the two front-runners, and we have a lot of popular support. The challenge for us is to get that popular support organized fast enough.\\" ||||| Two weeks before Iowans cast the first votes of the 2012 election cycle, Republicans nationally are sharply divided over whom their party’s presidential nominee should be, with Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich locked in a dead-even race, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.      Gingrich and Romney are each favored by 30 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. Running behind them is Rep. Ron Paul (Tex.), whose libertarian philosophy has attracted a strong following. He stands at 15 percent, about double his tally in an early November poll. All other active candidates are in the single digits.      The survey shows President Obama receiving his highest approval rating since March, with the exception of a brief rise after the killing of Osama bin Laden. Although most Americans continue to disapprove of the president’s performance on the economy, the number who disapprove of his overall performance has dipped below 50 percent for the first time this fall.      Romney has edged higher in the GOP contest, breaking out of the 20s for the first time since July. Gingrich has jumped greatly since early November, in part because of businessman Herman Cain’s decision to suspend his candidacy.      Gingrich peaked at an even higher level and started to fade in other national surveys conducted between the Post-ABC polls, suggesting that he may have lost some momentum recently. He was on the defensive in the final debates before the Jan. 3 Iowa caucuses and has come under sharp attack by Romney in a series of media interviews. He also is the target of hundreds of thousands of dollars in negative ads in Iowa from his major rivals and their allies, all of which could be taking a toll.      Romney has a 10-point advantage on the key question of who Republicans think is most likely to beat Obama. Romney also leads Gingrich when it comes to dealing with issue No. 1, the economy. Gingrich counters with a big advantage on experience: By about 2 to 1, more see him as having the best résumé for the White House and as being the most qualified to be commander in chief.      In other ways, the two are evenly matched. They are tied at 23 percent on which best reflects the core values of the Republican Party. They run about equal on which “is closer to you on issues.” Romney and Gingrich are also tied among those who are the strongest supporters of the tea party movement, and draw almost evenly among men and women and across age groups.      But there are differences. Gingrich has a wide advantage — 36 percent to 22 percent — over Romney among those who consider themselves “very conservative.” The former House speaker edges Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, among those without college degrees and among those with annual household incomes under 75,000. Romney has small advantages among those with more formal education and higher incomes.      Although a big majority of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents across the country say they support either Romney or Gingrich, only about a third of potential voters say they are firmly committed to any one contender. Many of those voters pick someone other than Romney or Gingrich when asked about the candidates’ attributes and their capacity to handle key issues.      This year — perhaps because of the heavy influence of more than a dozen televised candidate debates — national polls have tracked closely with state surveys. That could change soon as campaigning intensifies in Iowa and New Hampshire, where voters are encountering a much heavier volume of television attack ads, direct mail and face-to-face campaigning than voters elsewhere.      But the new national survey provides a variety of insight on how Republicans are evaluating their leading candidates.      Both Gingrich and Romney can point to their backgrounds as reasons Republicans should back them. More than six in 10 consider Gingrich’s political experience a major reason to support him, and more than seven in 10 say they approve of the work he did as House speaker in the 1990s.      But Gingrich’s experience as a private citizen since leaving Congress draws negative responses. His work as a consultant for Freddie Mac has come under blistering attack from his GOP rivals in recent debates and on Iowa airwaves.      By 44 percent to 33 percent, Republicans surveyed say they have an unfavorable view of the political work he has done since leaving office. About three in 10 of his supporters have negative views of his activity since leaving the speaker’s office, and among GOP-leaning independents, 53 percent say they view that work unfavorably.      Gingrich has responded by saying that he has never lobbied and that most of the money from Freddie Mac went toward overhead and other expenses, not to him directly. On Monday, his campaign began an advertising counteroffensive.      Although more Republicans think Gingrich has the best experience to be president, Romney’s work in the private sector and as governor of Massachusetts are viewed positively. More than six in 10 say his business experience is a big reason to support him; a majority have a favorable impression of the work he did buying, restructuring and selling companies while at Bain Capital; and more than two-thirds say they approve of the job he did as governor.      Not all about that record in Massachusetts is viewed positively, however. About 28 percent consider his policies on health care — he signed into law a coverage mandate for all Massachusetts residents — a major reason to support his candidacy. But 36 percent say it is a major reason to oppose him.      Gingrich’s critics have questioned whether he has the temperament to be president. Romney called him “extremely unreliable” in a Washington Post interview a week ago and “zany” in a New York Times interview the next day.      In the Post-ABC News poll, 61 percent say the former speaker has the right personality and temperament to be president — an 11-point increase since June and a shade under the 67 percent who say so about Romney.      The other candidates are struggling for national attention. Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Rep. Michele Bachmann (Minn.) are at 7 percent in the poll, while former senator Rick Santorum (Pa.) and former Utah governor Jon Huntsman Jr. are at 3 percent.      Most Republicans say Paul’s views on limited government are a major reason to support him, while many consider his opposition to U.S. military intervention a big reason to oppose his candidacy. Nearly two-thirds say they can rely on Paul to say what he really believes — more than say so about Gingrich or Romney — but a slim majority says he lacks the personality and temperament to be an effective president. Nearly half say that his policies as president probably would be unacceptable to most Americans.      Polling manager Peyton M. Craighill and polling analyst Scott Clement contributed to this report. ||||| By Gary Langer      Newt Gingrich has relinquished sole front-runner status almost as quickly as he gained it, landing at a dead heat with Mitt Romney in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll. And as the GOP hopefuls battle it out, ratings of Barack Obama’s prospects have warmed.      Americans now divide about evenly on whom they expect to win the 2012 presidential election: Forty-nine percent plump for the eventual Republican nominee, 46 percent for Obama. While still a weak showing given the usual advantages of incumbency, that’s a marked improvement for Obama from October, when 55 percent picked him to lose.      In general election match-ups, this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, finds that Obama holds significant leads over Gingrich and Ron Paul alike; matched against Romney, though, it’s a dead heat, 47-47 percent, among registered voters. If Paul’s added to the race as an independent (he’s not saying), Obama moves ahead of Romney.      Much can change, of course, with the election still more than 10 months away. But as reported separately, Obama’s advance to a 49 percent job approval rating may put him back in the game.      GOP – More immediate is the GOP race, whose tumult continues unabated. Gingrich, the latest non-Romney to rush ahead, has 30 percent support for the nomination among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. Romney has an identical 30 percent, matching his July high in ABC/Post polls this cycle. Ron Paul has 15 percent, with all others in the single digits.      Gingrich is up from 12 percent in an ABC/Post poll in early November, but he’d done better earlier this month, leading in some national polls as well as in an ABC/Post poll in Iowa, with its Jan. 3 caucuses. His rise followed earlier, unsustained moves for Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry and Herman Cain, as strongly conservative Republicans sought an alternative to Romney.      Indeed, Gingrich leads Romney by a 14-point margin, 36 percent to 22 percent, among ”veryconservatives.” It’s a serious challenge for Romney; while “very conservatives” make up just more than a quarter of all leaning Republicans nationally, they’re a motivated group who may constitute a greater share of the turnout at caucuses and primaries alike.      SATISFIED? – Romney takes strength from the perception he’s best able to beat Obama. Gingrich comes back on experience, and, perhaps surprisingly, with a broad advantage over Romney as better fit to command the armed forces. (Neither has military service.)      Gingrich, though, is not well-ranked on honesty and trustworthiness, and both Romney and Gingrich suffer from tepid ratings for saying what they really believe; just 51 and 52 percent, respectively, say this describes them. Bragging rights on that attribute belong to Paul – 65 percent believe they can rely on him to say what he really thinks.      Those soft ratings on forthrightness for the two leading candidates may be dampening overall satisfaction with the field. A less-than-ideal 59 percent of leaning Republicans say they’re satisfied with the GOP candidates, and a mere 11 percent are “very” satisfied. In late 2007, by contrast, 69 percent of leaning Republicans were satisfied with their choices – as were, on the other side, 81 percent of leaning Democrats, whose candidate ultimately won.      Notably, a broad 64 percent of potential Republican voters say there’s still a chance they could change their minds about which candidate to support – leaving vast room for further movement as the GOP race continues to unfold. And a Romney-Gingrich duel, if that’s how it develops, could be a long one. Asked which of these two comes closest to them on the issues, leaning Republicans divide almost exactly evenly, 46-45 percent.      That said, either Romney or Gingrich may suffice in the end: Each is the leading second choice among those who have a different first choice.      STRENGTHS and WEAKNESSES – Strong conservatives have an objection to Romney that’s policy-based, and as such may prove hard for him to move. Among all Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 36 percent view Romney’s record on health care when he was governor of Massachusetts as a major reason to oppose him for the nomination. That’s trouble enough – but among very conservatives, it jumps to 55 percent.      Gingrich has his own vulnerability: Republicans by an 11-point margin, 44-33 percent, have an unfavorable impression of his work as a political consultant after he left elective office, with nearly a quarter undecided. Romney, by contrast, gets a favorable rating for his experience as a corporate buyout specialist, a point on which Gingrich has criticized him.      Romney and Gingrich alike clear other hurdles. Neither Romney’s Mormon faith, nor Gingrich’s three marriages, appear to be significant negatives to most potential GOP voters. Majorities believe both candidates have the personality and temperament to serve effectively as president (67 and 61 percent, respectively) and think they’d pursue policies most Americans would find acceptable (71 percent for Romney, 66 percent for Gingrich).      Paul falters badly on both those scores – just 37 percent in his own party think he’s got the temperament and character to serve effectively, and just 42 percent think his policies would prove acceptable to most of the public. As in Iowa, Paul also loses support for his isolationist views; 45 percent see his opposition to U.S. military intervention as a major negative.      ISSUES and ATTRIBUTES – Ranking across all the candidates, 43 percent of leaning Republicans pick Gingrich as having the best experience to be president, his best-rated personal attribute, with a 20-point advantage over Romney. More generally, 73 percent favorably rate Gingrich’s work as House speaker from 1995 to 1999.      Gingrich, as noted, also scores as best suited to serve as commander-in-chief of the military, selected by 35 percent, compared with 17 percent for Romney. On the other hand, 38 percent see Romney as best able to beat Obama; 28 percent pick Gingrich on this attribute.      Ratings on other attributes are more evenly spaced among the candidates. Romney and Gingrich are even on who best represents core Republican values, and essentially so on understanding “the problems of people like you.” While 22 percent pick Romney as the most honest and trustworthy, that slides to 13 percent for Gingrich. Even among his own supporters, just 37 percent see Gingrich as the most honest and trustworthy of the Republican candidates.      Differentiation on handling specific issues is not substantial. Romney’s got a 6-point advantage over Gingrich in being seen as best able to handle the economy, the critical issue to most potential voters; that occurs entirely among independents who lean toward the Republican Party. The two run essentially evenly on the deficit, immigration and health care.      In one final issue, Romney leads Gingrich, 26 percent to 15 percent, in trust to handle “social issues such as abortion and gay marriage.” And on this, Romney outpoints Gingrich even among very conservatives, 23 percent versus 12 percent – suggesting that Gingrich’s home in the hearts of strongly conservative leaned Republicans is far from a settled deal.      METHODOLOGY – This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by telephone Dec. 15-18, 2011, among a random national sample of 1,005 adults, including landline and cell-phone-only respondents, and 395 leaned Republicans. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points for the full sample and 6 points for leaned Republicans. The survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates of New York, N.Y., with sampling, data collection and tabulation by Abt-SRBI of New York, N.Y. ||||| Summary:","output":"The Republican presidential race in 2011 saw Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney as frontrunners, with each gaining 30% support among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. Gingrich was popular among very conservative Republicans, while Romney was seen as a potential alternative candidate. However, both Gingrich and Romney struggled with being perceived as honest and forthright, dampening overall satisfaction with the GOP candidates. Ron Paul was viewed as more reliable when it came to saying what he really believed. Among other candidates, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Rep. Michele Bachmann had 7% support, and former senator Rick Santorum and former Utah governor Jon Huntsman Jr. had 3% each. Iowa voters were particularly concerned about the Freddie Mac contract and allegations against Gingrich, accused of profiting from his former position as Speaker and lobbying members of Congress. In response, Gingrich announced plans to hold telephone call-in town halls every day until the Iowa caucuses and launch a 44-stop tour to address these allegations and answer questions. The article goes on to discuss detailed polling results and the presidential race, highlighting both the strengths and weaknesses of Republican frontrunners."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Using three separate microphones, Caul and his associates follow the couple around a park. Later, he pieces together a conversation that clearly indicates the two are in a relationship and that they fear being found out by the Director.Caul is a secretive, almost paranoid individual. He alienates his assistant, Stan (John Cazale), because he won't teach him more about audio surveillance, and his girlfriend, Amy (Teri Garr), because he won't share with her details about his career or personal life. He also refuses to hand over the tapes of Ann and Marc to the Director's assistant, Martin (Harrison Ford). The Director had specified that the tapes were to be turned over only to him. Martin protests but Caul keeps the tapes.Caul becomes increasingly concerned that, were he to turn the tapes over to the Director, that some harm would come to Ann and Marc. On the tapes, Marc can be heard to say \\"He'd kill us if he had the chance.\\" When he worked on the East Coast, Caul had participated in a surveillance that led to the deaths of two persons. He worries that this might happen again, and goes to church to confess his sins.After Amy breaks off their relationship, Caul attends a surveillance convention. Martin also attends, and Caul confronts him and orders Martin to stop following him.

Specify the size according to the project you're working on, whether it's a small card or a poster.  Set the colors you're going to be using on your document or paper.  Click on the foreground color picker on your tools panel. Select from: A). The palette containing the various colors that will be used in your graph will be provided. Clicking on these colors is the last step here. B). A window will appear with a list of colors to use on the blank canvas that you'll be using. Make sure you don't click on the daylight fades color picker because it will not take you black. C). A box will appear or your color picker set then the cmyk settings as indicated on the illustration. Next create a new layer and fill it with newly set color. D). Choose how far back from the bottom of the settings on your screen you want to set the colors. Click either on the button labeled \\" 50s \\" or \\" 70s \\". Answer:","output":"C). A box will appear or your color picker set then the cmyk settings as indicated on the illustration. Next create a new layer and fill it with newly set color. After you have selected your desired color, now it's time to create a new layer that will hold the aged paper effect. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this: 1. Click on the \\"New Layer\\" icon at the bottom of the Layers panel or use the keyboard shortcut \\"Shift + Ctrl + N\\" (or \\"Shift + Command + N\\" on a Mac). This will create a new empty layer on top of your background. 2. Fill this new layer with the color you have just selected. To do this, first make sure that your new layer is selected in the Layers panel, then go to Edit > Fill or use the keyboard shortcut \\"Shift + F5\\". In the Fill dialog box that appears, choose \\"Foreground Color\\" from the Contents dropdown menu, then click OK. Your layer will now be filled with your chosen color. 3. Now you need to find a suitable texture to give your paper an aged appearance. You can either use a pre-existing texture or create your own. A great resource for finding free paper textures is TextureKing (https://www.textureking.com) or Lost and Taken (http://lostandtaken.com). Download a texture that appeals to you and open it in Photoshop. 4. Copy the texture by going to Edit > Copy or using the keyboard shortcut \\"Ctrl + C\\" (or \\"Command + C\\" on a Mac). 5. Return to your project file and paste the texture by going to Edit > Paste or using the keyboard shortcut \\"Ctrl + V\\" (or \\"Command + V\\" on a Mac). This will create a new layer with the texture just above the colored layer. 6. Adjust the size of the texture layer, so it covers the entirety of your document. To do this, go to Edit > Free Transform or use the keyboard shortcut \\"Ctrl + T\\" (or \\"Command + T\\" on a Mac), then drag the corners of the texture to fit it onto your document. When you're done, press Enter to confirm the change. 7. Now we need to blend the texture layer with the colored layer to create the aged paper effect. Select the texture layer in the Layers panel, then set the blending mode to \\"Multiply\\" from the dropdown menu at the top of the panel. This will immediately make your texture layer appear as if it is blended with the colored layer beneath it. 8. You can further adjust the intensity of the effect by altering the opacity of the texture layer. To do this, simply click and drag the \\"Opacity\\" slider in the Layers panel until you achieve the desired look. 9. Next, consider adding some subtle stains and marks to your aged paper using brushes. A great resource for downloading free Photoshop brushes is Brusheezy (https://www.brusheezy.com). Create a new layer above the texture layer, set its blending mode to \\"Multiply\\", and paint random stains and marks using an appropriate brush and a dark brown color. Lower the opacity of this layer to make the imperfections subtle. 10. Finally, save your project file and export the finished aged paper image as a JPEG, PNG, or any other desired format. Now you have successfully aged your paper in Photoshop using a combination of color fills, textures, and brushes. You can use this technique on any project where you want to add a vintage or old-world feel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

But really, War and Peace (1869), which tells the stories of five upper-class families in Russia at the time of the 1812 French invasion, is not to be missed. Reading this novel is one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences, like climbing the Great Wall: You will regret it if you do not try. Earlier this month, USA Today reported that a six-episode   War and Peace miniseries   produced by the BBC would air next year. With a complex plot and so many characters, readers unfamiliar with the work might be most interested in the characters from the financially-troubled Rostov family of Moscow. Count Rostov has four teenage children. Natasha is in love with Boris Drubetskoy, who is about to become an army officer. Nikolai Ilyich loves the poor Sonya, a ward   of the family, but his family is not happy with their relationship. The proud Vera is about to start a happy marriage with a German-Russian officer. The youngest Rostov is the 9-year-old Petya, who, like his brother Nikolai, has his heart set on fighting for his country. The lives of all are about to be changed by the upcoming great war that involves many other major characters of War and Peace, such as Prince Andrei, who goes into a military career partly in order to get away from his unhappy marriage to the socialite   Lise.

The answer to this question is:","output":"To answer this question, let's follow step-by-step reasoning. Step 1: Understand the concept of gravitational force Gravitational force is a force of attraction between two objects due to their mass. This force is governed by the law of universal gravitation, which states that the force is proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Step 2: Analyze the given situation Mona is holding two pieces of fruit. When she moves them farther away from each other, the distance between them increases. Step 3: Apply the concept of gravitational force to the situation As the distance between the two fruits increases, the gravitational force between them will follow the inverse square law. This means that when the distance between them doubles, the gravitational force will reduce to a quarter of its original value; if the distance triples, the gravitational force will be reduced to a ninth of its original value, and so on. Step 4: Determine the answer to the question Based on the inverse square law, when Mona moves the two pieces of fruit farther away from each other, the gravitational force between them decreases.

Article: The Fujiwara rulers failed to maintain adequate police forces, which left robbers free to prey on travelers. This is implicitly illustrated in novels by the terror that night travel inspired in the main characters. The shōen system enabled the accumulation of wealth by an aristocratic elite; the economic surplus can be linked to the cultural developments of the Heian period and the \\"pursuit of arts\\". The major Buddhist temples in Heian-kyō and Nara also made use of the shōen. The establishment of branches rurally and integration of some Shinto shrines within these temple networks reflects a greater \\"organizational dynamism\\". Question: Why were travelers often robbed under Fujiwara rule?","output":"Travelers were often robbed under the Fujiwara rule due to several interconnected factors that collectively weakened the governance, security, and overall stability of the Heian period in Japan. Some of these factors were the Fujiwara rulers' failure to maintain adequate police forces, the shōen system that enabled the accumulation of wealth by an aristocratic elite, and the influence of Buddhist temples and their affiliated networks. 1. Insufficient police forces: The Fujiwara rulers did not provide enough investment or resources in maintaining a strong and effective police force. Their focus on consolidating and maintaining power in the regency system led to a lack of prioritization when it came to public safety and order. This, in turn, resulted in a weakened and underfunded police system that struggled to protect travelers from robbers. 2. The shōen system: A prominent social and economic structure of the Heian period was the shōen system, in which land holdings were organized, governed, and often exempted from taxes. The system enabled the aristocracy to accumulate vast wealth and resources, further entrenching social inequality and alienating the impoverished population. Consequently, many individuals resorted to robbery and crime, particularly targeting travelers, as a means of survival. 3. Cultural developments and the focus on arts: As the aristocratic elite accumulated wealth, there was more focus on ostentatious displays of culture, arts, and refined living within the Heian court. This pursuit of cultural development led to a lack of attention on strengthening the rule of law, social stability, and public security, which indirectly contributed to the increase in crime and robberies targeting travelers during this period. 4. Influence of major Buddhist temples: Some major Buddhist temples in Heian-kyō and Nara, which were integral cultural and religious institutions, also utilized the shōen system to accumulate wealth and resources. They established branches in rural areas and integrated certain Shinto shrines within their networks, creating an \\"organizational dynamism\\" that fueled the expansion of religious influence. While this expansion had its cultural benefits, it also contributed to the decentralization of power and the decline of state authority, which further weakened the security for travelers who were vulnerable to robberies. In conclusion, travelers were often robbed under Fujiwara rule due to a combination of factors, such as the lack of adequate police forces, the wealth disparity created by the shōen system, the focus on cultural developments and arts, and the diminishing central authority fueled by the growing influence of Buddhist temples. All these factors contributed to an environment where crime could thrive, and travelers, unfortunately, bore the brunt of this insecurity."},{"instruction":"The following article contains an answer for the question: What site of battles taking place was suggested by Evans to not have been developed independently among the local population? , can you please find it?   In a 1946 paper, the folklorist John H. Evans recorded the existence of a local folk belief that a battle was fought at the site of the Coldrum Stones, and that a \\"Black Prince\\" was buried within its chamber. He suggested that the tales of battles taking place at this site and at other Medway Megaliths had not developed independently among the local population but had \\"percolated down from the theories of antiquaries\\" who believed that the fifth-century Battle of Aylesford, which was recorded in the ninth-century Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, took place in the area. Evans also recorded a local folk belief applied to all of the Medway Megaliths and which had been widespread \\"up to the last generation\\"; this was that it was impossible for anyone to successfully count the number of stones in the monuments. This \\"countless stones\\" motif is not unique to the Medway region, and can be found at various other megalithic monuments in Britain. The earliest textual evidence for it is found in an early 16th-century document, where it applies to the stone circle of Stonehenge in Wiltshire, although in an early 17th-century document it was applied to The Hurlers, a set of three stone circles in Cornwall. Later records reveal that it had gained widespread distribution in England, as well as a single occurrence each in Wales and Ireland. The folklorist S. P. Menefee suggested that it could be attributed to an animistic understanding that these megaliths had lives of their own.Several modern Pagan religions are practiced at the Medway Megaliths, with Pagan activity having taken place at the Coldrum Stones from at least the late 1980s. These Pagans commonly associated the sites both with a concept of ancestry and of them being a source of \\"earth energy\\". The scholar of religion Ethan Doyle White argued that these sites in particular were interpreted as having connections to the ancestors both because they were created by Neolithic peoples whom modern Pagans view as their \\"own spiritual ancestors\\" and because the sites were once...

The butterfly life cycle primarily depends on factors such as environmental conditions, availability of food, and the specific species of the butterfly. These factors collectively influence the number of eggs being laid and the subsequent hatching of caterpillars. In detail, the butterfly's life cycle involves four distinct stages, starting with the egg stage. Female butterflies lay their eggs on host plants that caterpillars can feed on after hatching. The choice of host plant is critical since caterpillars have highly specific diets. The availability of suitable host plants is thus an essential factor for egg-laying and caterpillar survival. The second stage involves hatching of eggs and the emergence of caterpillars (larvae). Environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and the presence of predators can affect the egg's survival and the caterpillar's hatching rate. Moreover, given their tiny and delicate nature, butterfly eggs are also vulnerable to parasitism by other insects like wasps. Once hatched, caterpillars undergo the larval stage, during which they grow and feed. As the caterpillars grow, they molt (lose their skin) several times to accommodate their increasing size. In this stage, the caterpillar's diet, environmental factors, and predation play a vital role in their development. Next is the pupal stage or the chrysalis when the caterpillar initiates metamorphosis - a remarkable transformation into a butterfly. Hormonal changes cause the caterpillar's body to break down and reorganize, giving rise to the adult butterfly. This stage is also vulnerable to external factors such as temperature and predators like birds or insects. Finally, the adult butterfly emerges out of the chrysalis and flies away.

Unfortunately, my expectations weren't met due to a few shortcomings in the app. Firstly, the app crashed multiple times during use, which was quite frustrating considering I had no prior issues with other similar astronomy apps. Moreover, the interface, while visually appealing, was rather unintuitive and it took me longer than expected to navigate through the app's features. The star maps and celestial object descriptions were pretty accurate, but the augmented reality feature was disappointingly inconsistent. Sometimes, the star alignments would be near perfect, while other times they would be completely off the mark. Additionally, the app didn't provide any in-depth information about the celestial objects and felt limited in scope compared to other apps within the same category. Ultimately, it's disappointing that an app from such a well-known company isn't as polished as one would expect. In conclusion, com.google.android.stardroid has potential, but it's plagued by issues that prevent it from being the go-to tool for avid astronomy enthusiasts.

Mysterio refused to take off his LWO colors and was attacked by the nWo as a result. This led to a match at SuperBrawl IX where Mysterio and tag partner Konnan lost a \\"Hair vs. Mask match\\" against Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, forcing Mysterio to remove his mask. After the match, he phoned his uncle to tell him the news. Mysterio has publicly expressed his disappointment over being unmasked:  Mysterio later became a \\"giant killer\\" by defeating large opponents such as Kevin Nash, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Scott Norton. He faced Nash at Uncensored in a match where Lex Luger interfered and helped Nash in winning the match. Although he participated in several notable matches with some of the heavyweight top card wrestlers, it was made very clear to him that he would never receive a push to become a main eventer. This was due to Eric Bischoff utilizing cruiserweights as alternative, mid-card entertainment as opposed to the more conventional style that led WCW programming.  The next night on the March 15 Nitro, he defeated Billy Kidman to win his fifth Cruiserweight Championship. On the March 22 Spring Breakout episode of Nitro, Mysterio got his first shot at the WCW World Heavyweight Championship against champion Ric Flair when the names of (allegedly) nearly everyone in the company were put into a hat and a lottery was held. El Dandy was the lottery winner, but he was injured, and Mysterio took the shot instead. The match ended with a disqualification win for Flair, even though Arn Anderson's interference on Flair's behalf should have theoretically disqualified Flair. The following week, Mysterio and Kidman teamed with each other and defeated Flair's Four Horsemen stablemates Chris Benoit and Dean Malenko to win the WCW World Tag Team Championship, making Mysterio a double champion. Mysterio successfully defended his Cruiserweight Championship against his tag team partner Kidman at Spring Stampede before losing the title on the April 19 episode of Nitro to Psicosis in a Fatal Four-Way match that also involved Juventud Guerrera and Blitzkrieg.

Product review: If you consider its date, it seems Malicious can be taken as a kind of farewell to the common themes of 60s and 70s Italian cinema: wearing them out by taking them to sardonic extremes. In that sense, this film succeeds. I recommend it. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"The review in question can be said to depict the product, the film Malicious, in a predominantly flattering light. The reviewer approaches the film from a perspective that acknowledges and appreciates its place within the context of 60s and 70s Italian cinema. By recognizing the film as a farewell to the common themes of that era, the reviewer suggests that Malicious effectively represents a turning point in Italian cinema, marking an end to a previously established style and opening the door to new forms and themes. Moreover, the reviewer praises the film for \\"wearing out\\" these common themes by taking them to \\"sardonic extremes.\\" This observation demonstrates the reviewer's appreciation for both the film's critical approach to the conventional themes of Italian cinema and its creative, if not provocative, execution. The use of the term \\"sardonic\\" suggests that the film employs irony and wit in its treatment of these themes, further highlighting the reviewer's favorable view of the film's tone and direction. In addition to this contextual appreciation, the reviewer directly recommends the film to potential viewers. This recommendation makes it clear that the reviewer believes Malicious to be an enjoyable or valuable viewing experience, further emphasizing the positive light in which the product is depicted. It is important to note, however, that the review is not entirely void of criticism. By stating that Malicious can be seen as a \\"farewell\\" to the common themes of 60s and 70s Italian cinema, the reviewer implies that the film may not be wholly original or groundbreaking. That being said, their emphasis on the film's function as a marker of change and their ultimate recommendation suggests that any critique is mild and overshadowed by the flattering aspects of the review. In conclusion, this review of Malicious primarily depicts the film in a flattering light. By positioning the film as a turning point in Italian cinema and praising its sardonic approach to the common themes of 60s and 70s Italian cinema, the reviewer demonstrates a nuanced appreciation for the product. This appreciation, coupled with the direct recommendation to potential viewers, creates an overall positive image of the film. While the review does contain a hint of criticism, it is ultimately outweighed by the positive aspects, and the product is portrayed to be both valuable and enjoyable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I haven't seen an official statement from anyone at the White House -- and we probably won't. Keep in mind, anti-discrimination language was supposed to be included in the health insurance reform bill, but the LGBT provisions got stripped out:      Baldwin had sought and secured four pro-gay provisions in the original House version of health care reform, including a prohibition on discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in health care.            But neither the Senate bill nor President Obama’s proposal late last month included those provisions. Baldwin had held out hope, as late as Thursday morning, that at least two of the provisions might be added back under whatever legislative package the House and Senate would eventually vote on. But by Thursday afternoon, when the text of that final package was posted on the Internet, that hope was quashed.      Richard Socarides, who advised President Bill Clinton on gay rights issues, said that while the memorandum on its own did not grant any new rights, it did “draw attention to the very real and tragic situations many gays and lesbians face when a partner is hospitalized.”            Ordering the Department of Health and Human Services to find a better way to handle such situations, Mr. Socarides said, is “the kind of thing the gay community was hoping Obama would do right after he was inaugurated.”      So, this is finally a good move by the President and partially makes up for what was lost in the health care bill. Because Obama actually took some pro-LGBT action, there's been a lot of hyperventilating about it from the usual suspects. As always, Richard Socarides provides some perspective We did hope that Obama would have taken some action after the inauguration on the low-hanging fruit. And, let's be honest, this wasn't a heavy lift. The President didn't expend any political capital on it. But, there are some issues coming up, including ENDA and DADT, that will require his direct engagement. He promised.It just makes me realize how far we have to go to achieve equality when something as basic as hospital visits is treated as an earth-shattering development.The two-page memo is here: ||||| Good move by President Obama:            Respecting the Rights of Hospital Patients to Receive Visitors and to Designate Surrogate Decision Makers for Medical Emergencies      There are few moments in our lives that call for greater compassion and companionship than when a loved one is admitted to the hospital. In these hours of need and moments of pain and anxiety, all of us would hope to have a hand to hold, a shoulder on which to lean — a loved one to be there for us, as we would be there for them.      Yet every day, all across America, patients are denied the kindnesses and caring of a loved one at their sides — whether in a sudden medical emergency or a rolonged hospital stay. Often, a widow or widower with no children is denied the support and comfort of a good friend. Members of religious orders are sometimes unable to choose someone other than an immediate family member to visit them and make medical decisions on their behalf. Also uniquely affected are gay and lesbian Americans who are often barred from the bedsides of the partners with whom they may have spent decades of their lives — unable to be there for the person they love, and unable to act as a legal surrogate if their partner is incapacitated.      ***      Many States have taken steps to try to put an end to these problems. North Carolina recently amended its Patients’ Bill of Rights to give each patient “the right to designate visitors who shall receive the same visitation privileges as the patient’s immediate family members, regardless of whether the visitors are legally related to the patient” — a right that applies in every hospital in the State. Delaware, Nebraska, and Minnesota have adopted similar laws.      My Administration can expand on these important steps to ensure that patients can receive compassionate care and equal treatment during their hospital stays. By this memorandum, I request that you take the following steps… ||||| OVERDUE PROGRESS ON HOSPITAL VISITATION RIGHTS.... The Obama administration has taken some important steps over the last year on gay rights, but arguably none is more important than the change announced last night.      President Obama on Thursday ordered his health secretary to issue new rules aimed at granting hospital visiting rights to same-sex partners. The White House announced the rule changes, which will also make it easier for gay men and lesbians to make medical decisions on behalf of their partners, in a memorandum released Thursday night. In it, the president said the new rules would affect any hospital that participates in Medicare or Medicaid, the government programs to cover the elderly and the poor. \\"Every day, all across America, patients are denied the kindness and caring of a loved one at their sides,\\" Mr. Obama said in the memorandum, adding that the rules could also help widows and widowers who rely on friends and members of religious orders who care for one another. But he says gay men and lesbians are \\"uniquely affected\\" because they are often barred from visiting partners with whom they have spent decades.      Because nearly every American hospital receives at least some federal funding, the policy change is expected to have a significant national impact. It will not be immediate -- HHS will begin a rule-making process -- but the shift is expected to take effect later this year.      The change was reportedly inspired, at least in part, by the ordeal a Florida family endured in 2007. Lisa Pond was stricken with a fatal brain aneurysm, and partner of 18 years, Janice Langbehn, and their four adopted children, were prohibited from seeing her. Langbehn had power of attorney for Pond, but officials still refused. Pond died before her loved ones were even allowed into her hospital room.      Last night, President Obama called Langbehn to tell her about his administration's new policy. \\"I was so humbled that he would know Lisa's name and know our story,\\" Langbehn told the NYT. \\"He apologized for how we were treated. For the last three years, that's what I've been asking the hospital to do. Even now, three years later, they still refuse to apologize to the children and I for the fact that Lisa died alone.\\"      A spokesperson for the Family Research Council, a leading anti-gay religious right group, characterized the policy shift as \\"pandering,\\" and whined, \\"The memorandum undermines the definition of marriage.\\" This is the same Family Research Council that recently labeled Obama \\"our first gay president.\\"      Whatever. The far-right can pout and send ugly fundraising letters about this, but decent people will still be able to consider this development for what it is: another breakthrough for decency, compassion, and common sense. ||||| There are few moments in our lives that call for greater compassion and companionship than when a loved one is admitted to the hospital.

North Carolina recently amended its Patients’ Bill of Rights to give each patient “the right to designate visitors who shall receive the same visitation privileges as the patient’s immediate family members, regardless of whether the visitors are legally related to the patient” — a right that applies in every hospital in the State. Delaware, Nebraska, and Minnesota have adopted similar laws.      My Administration can expand on these important steps to ensure that patients can receive compassionate care and equal treatment during their hospital stays. |||||","output":"President Obama has issued new hospital rules to grant visitation rights and medical decision-making power to same-sex partners. This change aims to ensure that patients can receive compassionate care and equal treatment during their hospital stays. The rules will affect any hospital participating in Medicare or Medicaid, and since nearly every American hospital receives at least some federal funding, this policy change is expected to have a significant national impact. The shift was sparked by the unfortunate experiences faced by same-sex couples in hospitals and the lack of anti-discrimination provisions in the health insurance reform bill. This move is considered a breakthrough for decency, compassion, and common sense, despite criticisms from conservative groups."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Kenneth went to the store to buy a cage for William's new pet rabbit.","output":"Kenneth woke up one Sunday morning with the exciting task ahead of him: to buy a cage for William’s new pet rabbit. It was a sunny day, with a gentle breeze whispering through the leaves of the trees lining their neighborhood. William had always wanted a pet rabbit, and he was finally getting one after his excellent progress report card. Kenneth, as the doting older brother, volunteered to go to the pet store and select a cage that would provide the perfect home for the new furry friend. The pet store was located in the shopping district downtown, where all the specialty stores were arranged alongside each other. Kenneth put on a comfortable pair of sneakers and his blue cap, grabbed his wallet, and walked out the door. He sauntered down the sidewalk, occasionally pausing to marvel at the vibrant-colored flowers and green foliage that decorated the landscape. It was a perfect day to be outdoors. As Kenneth approached the shopping district, he overheard the hustle and bustle of people walking there; the weekend was always a busy time for these stores. After crossing a few blocks, he arrived at \\"Happy Tails Pet Supplies,\\" a popular store with a reputation for quality products and excellent customer service. Kenneth took a deep breath and entered the store, excited to make a well-informed decision. Upon entering the store, Kenneth was met with a melodic playlist of pet-themed songs that evoked the happy nature of owning a furry companion. Various pet supplies, including toys, food, and grooming products, covered the shelves, and just beyond was an impressive display of cages and enclosures for different types of small animals. He wandered through the aisles, taking a moment to glance at the colorful fish swimming gracefully in their tanks, and smiled while observing the playful antics of the puppies waiting for their forever homes. Finally, he arrived at the rabbit cage section. The store had a wide variety of cages, ranging in sizes and designs, with various accessories to enhance the rabbit's quality of life. Kenneth ran his fingers through the metallic bars, mentally assessing each option. Were they sturdy enough to keep the rabbit secure? Was there plenty of ventilation? What about ease of cleaning? Before he could finalize his decision, Kenneth decided to consult with a store associate. He found Ms. Kathy, who was deftly restocking the birdseed section with a meticulous attention to detail. With a genuine smile, she listened to Kenneth's requirements, offering her expertise and suggestions. They discussed different types of bedding, the importance of providing a hideout, and the necessity of having ample space for the rabbit to stretch and exercise. With Ms. Kathy's help, Kenneth finally decided on a spacious cage with a removable base for easy cleaning. It had a cute little hideout and enough room for a food bowl, water bottle, and a litter pan. He also picked up some bedding made from recycled paper, as it was eco-friendly and had excellent odor control. Kenneth happily paid for the cage and supplies at the register, thanking Ms. Kathy for her assistance and advice. He left the store, carrying the rabbit’s new home with pride, eager to show William and set up the new pet rabbit’s living space. Their family had made a careful decision together, and they all knew this rabbit would be a beloved addition to their home. As Kenneth walked back, he couldn’t help but reflect on the day's events. He had spent a lovely day outdoors, fueled by the spirit of brotherhood, learned about caring for rabbits, and met some wonderful people at the pet store. Feeling a warmth in his heart, he knew he had played an important role in bringing a new source of joy and love to their family. Overall, he couldn't have asked for a better day."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. There's a lot riding on the Nokia Lumia 900. While Windows Phones until now have generally been capable if not outstanding devices, the Lumia 900 brings Microsoft's mobile platform to a new level. Not only does it add a super-fast LTE connection from AT&T, but it'll also serve as a flagship device for Nokia and Microsoft, at least until Windows Phone 8 devices come later in the year. I've been using the Lumia 900 for the past week, and it's a great smartphone. It's also an excellent example of just how far the Windows Phone platform has come since its debut a year and a half ago. Good Windows Phone apps used to be in extremely short supply, but I was pleasantly surprised to see many of the same apps that I use regularly on iOS in the Windows Phone Marketplace. Foursquare? Check. eBay? Check. Spotify? It's there. Readability? Yep. Kindle? Got it. Pulse? Totally. There's even Foodspotting, yo. Still, there's no Instagram, Pinterest, Flipboard or Hulu Plus. So the Marketplace -- recently clocked at 65,000 apps to the iPhone's 600,000 -- certainly has some catching up to do. But if you're not already locked into another platform, it's reassuring to know Windows Phone has the essentials covered. Metro stretches out. Most of those apps look gorgeous on the Lumia 900â€²s 4.3-inch OLED screen. Indeed, the increasing sizes on today's smartphones are perfect for Windows Phone's Metro interface. Its design favors big fonts and splash layouts that stretch to the screen's edges and beyond. Windows Phone works best when it's got lots of real estate to work with. For example, Foursquare makes the multiple menus in the app feel like one giant poster. My friends, activity and checkins are all partitioned into pretty columns. The iOS and Android versions look claustrophobic by comparison (see below). The seamless Metro-inspired design isn't automatic, however, and your mileage will vary from app to app. Most apps from indie developers are pretty blah. The design occasionally trips itself up. Metro presents its iconography as if it were as familiar as street signs, showing symbols with no labels. It's pretty easy to pick the wrong function, especially if it's your first time launching the app. When navigating, you should proceed with caution, especially in social apps. Shares and check-ins can happen before you know what you're doing. Begging to be touched. Pretty design is one thing, but usability is another. Windows Phone begs to be touched, swiped and pinched, even more than iOS or Android. The big layouts practically beg you to see what's on the next screen. Here's where the Lumia 900â€²s 1.4GHz Qualcomm processor shines. It's only a single-core design (Microsoft doesn't yet allow multi-core chips on Windows Phones), but it was more than enough to keep up as I pushed and pulled menus with my fingers. The whole interface feels alive as you touch it. Besides the great UI, Nokia offers up some special apps to Lumia owners. Probably most useful is Nokia Drive, a free turn-by-turn navigation service that works with Nokia Maps (not Bing Maps, which are also pretty). Nokia has also created dynamic Metro apps for CNN and ESPN that look fantastic, especially when it comes to video.The CNN app highlights one of Windows Phone's differentiators: live tiles. The photo from the most recent top story in the app is highlighted on the app's icon on your home screen. That's great, but there's no headline or even a slug to help guide the user. What, for example, is this picture of Barack Obama supposed to signify? Nuts & bolts. Back to the hardware. This is a really well-made phone; even though the screen is 0.8 inches larger than an iPhone's, it doesn't feel large in your hand. That's partly thanks to the polycarbonate casing, which is smooth but provides an excellent grip. Nokia offers bumpers that can better protect it, but it's pretty durable. I don't know why you'd want to cover it up. The camera is 8 megapixels, and to my eye the quality is on par with the iPhone 4S, though it records at \\"only\\" 720p resolution. The Lumia 900â€²s screen shows off AMOLED's strengths -- bright colors and true blacks that make icons and artwork pop. The screen also uses anti-reflection optics to reduce its reflectance. The upshot: a screen that's much easier to see in bright sunlight. You can see just how much in the gallery below. Finally, there's that LTE connection. I managed to get download speeds up to 28.4 megabits per second here in the Flatiron district of New York City. That's pretty amazing, especially when you consider our office Wi-Fi typically got about 9 Mbps. Puttering along at AT&T's \\"4G\\" HSPA+ speeds, my iPhone 4S maxed out at 1.9 Mbps. Lumia rises. The Nokia Lumia 900, which will be in stores April 8 for the tidy sum of 99.99 (with contract), is by far the best Windows Phone ever made. Not only does it have a great screen for Metro apps, it has the hardware to really deliver on the experience they promise. This is the device that Microsoft needs to show off how good Windows Phone can be. Sure, you don't get Instagram (yet), but the world of possibility it opens is unlike anything else out there.

What is the best way to: Clean an egg shell","output":"The best way to clean an eggshell is through a careful and thorough process that removes any dirt, debris, bacteria, or potential contaminants without compromising the shell's integrity or its aesthetic appeal. Here is a detailed, step-by-step guide to cleaning an eggshell effectively: 1. Gather your materials: Before you begin, gather the necessary supplies, such as a soft toothbrush or sponge, a mild dish soap, a small container or bowl, white vinegar, baking soda, water, and some paper towels or a clean cloth. 2. Prepare the eggshell: If the egg is still intact, use a sharp knife or needle to carefully poke holes in each end of the shell. Gently blow the contents out into a separate container, keeping the shell intact. Dispose of the egg contents or save them for another use. Rinse the inside of the eggshell with warm water to remove any remaining yolk or egg whites. 3. Prepare the cleaning solution: Fill your small container or bowl with warm water and add a few drops of mild dish soap. Mix the solution gently until the soap is fully dissolved. Alternatively, you can create a cleaning solution using equal parts water and white vinegar for a more natural approach. 4. Apply the cleaning solution: Dip your soft toothbrush or sponge into the soapy water, and gently scrub the outside of the eggshell. Be sure to work in circular motions using a light touch to avoid damaging or cracking the shell. Continually rinse the eggshell under running water while you clean, so that you can see the progress you are making. Don't forget to lightly clean the inside of the eggshell as well. 5. Remove stains and spots: If the eggshell has stubborn stains or spots, create a paste by mixing a small amount of baking soda with water. Apply the paste to the affected areas with the toothbrush or sponge, then gently scrub to remove the stains. Rinse the eggshell thoroughly to ensure all the baking soda residue is gone. 6. Sanitize the eggshell: To kill any remaining bacteria, you can sanitize the eggshell by soaking it in a solution of equal parts water and white vinegar for 15-20 minutes. Alternatively, you can place the eggshell on a microwave-safe plate and heat it in the microwave for about 20-30 seconds (monitor constantly to avoid any damage to the eggshell). 7. Rinse and dry: Once the eggshell is clean and sanitized, rinse it thoroughly under running water to remove any remaining soap, vinegar, or baking soda. Gently shake off any excess water, and then pat the eggshell dry using a clean cloth or paper towel. Be sure to carefully hold the eggshell so as not to damage it. 8. Allow the eggshell to air dry: Place the cleaned and dried eggshell on a drying rack or prop it up on a paper towel, allowing air to circulate around it. Allow the eggshell to air dry completely before handling or using it in any craft projects or other applications. By following these steps, you can effectively clean and sanitize eggshells while preserving their natural beauty and integrity."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Justification: The liver and lungs have separate but interconnected roles in the body. The liver's primary function is to filter blood, detoxify chemicals, and metabolize drugs, while the lungs are mainly responsible for oxygen exchange. The scenario described suggests that the liver is not able to filter properly, which could lead to a buildup of toxins in the body. While this does not directly impact the lung's ability to expand and take in oxygen, it can indirectly affect lung efficiency. For example, if the circulation of the blood is compromised due to the liver not properly filtering, it could affect how efficiently the lungs are receiving blood for oxygen exchange. The reduced efficiency can put more pressure on the lungs to continue expanding and working harder to meet the body's oxygen needs. Thus, the liver's failure to filter can be regarded as indirectly impacting a step of the lung's process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They are frequently ranked as one of the greatest metal bands of all time. Despite an innovative and pioneering body of work in the latter half of the 1970s, the band struggled with indifferent record production, repeated changes of drummer, and lack of major commercial success or attention until 1980, when they adopted a more simplified sound on the album British Steel, which helped shoot them to rock superstar status. Judas Priest were formed in 1969 in industrial West Bromwich, in the Black Country, by vocalist Al Atkins and bassist Brian \\"Bruno\\" Stapenhill, with John Perry on guitar and John \\"Fezza\\" Partridge on drums. Perry soon died in a road accident, and amongst the replacements the band auditioned were future Judas Priest guitarist Kenny \\"K. K.\\" Downing; at the time, they turned him down in favour of 17-year-old multi-instrumentalist Ernest Chataway, who had played with Birmingham band Black Sabbath when they were still called Earth. Stapenhill came up with the name Judas Priest from Bob Dylan's song \\"The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest\\" on the album John Wesley Harding. No member of that early lineup lasted long enough to play on the band's recordings, though several songs co-written by Atkins appeared on their first two albums.  The band gained a three-album recording contract with the label Immediate in late 1969 after a gig in Walsall, but the label went out of business before an album could be recorded, and the band split in 1970. Late in the year, Atkins found a heavy rock band rehearsing without a singer called Freight, made up of K. K. Downing on guitar, his childhood friend Ian \\"Skull\\" Hill on bass, and drummer John Ellis. He joined them, and they took on Atkins' defunct band's name. Their first gig was on 6 March 1971. Ellis quit later that year and was replaced with Alan Moore. Early shows included Hendrix and Quatermass covers, and in 1972 the set list included the originals \\"Never Satisfied\\", \\"Winter\\", and the show-closer \\"Caviar and Meths\\".  Moore left and was replaced with Christopher Louis \\"Congo\\" Campbell, and the band joined Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi's management agency Iommi Management Agency. Atkins continued to write material for the band--including \\"Whiskey Woman\\", which became the base for the Judas Priest staple \\"Victim of Changes\\"--but as finances were tight and he had a family to support, he played his last gigs with the band in December 1972. Campbell left soon afterwards, and the band enlisted two members of the band Hiroshima: drummer John Hinch and vocalist Rob Halford, the brother of Hill's girlfriend. Judas Priest made their first tour of continental Europe in early 1974 and returned to England that April to sign a recording deal with the label Gull. Gull suggested adding a fifth member to fill out the band's sound; they took on as a second lead guitarist Glenn Tipton, whose group The Flying Hat Band were also managed by Iommi's agency. Where was the band formed?","output":"Judas Priest was formed in West Bromwich, an industrial town in the Black Country, England, in 1969.

Answer:","output":"It seems that you are going through a difficult time dealing with humiliation and feeling the need to prove yourself by becoming skinnier than someone else. While it's natural to feel hurt and seek validation, it's important to recognize that true validation comes from within. To focus on your school and exercise, you may want to consider the following steps: 1. Set specific, achievable goals: Begin by setting clear and realistic goals for both your academics and your exercise routine. For example, you can aim for a certain grade in each subject or commit to exercising for a specific amount of time each day. Be mindful not to set highly stringent expectations that might lead to burnout or an unhealthy obsession. 2. Prioritize self-care: Finding balance in life is key to success in any area. Prioritize self-care by nurturing your physical, emotional, and mental health. This includes getting enough sleep, maintaining a balanced diet, and engaging in relaxing activities to de-stress. 3. Develop a daily routine: Creating a structured daily routine can help you stay focused and organized. Allot specific time slots for studying, exercise, meals, and relaxation. Stick to this routine as closely as possible, but remember to be flexible when unexpected obstacles arise. 4. Limit distractions: In order to fully concentrate on your school and exercise goals, try to minimize distractions. This may involve muting your phone, using website blockers while studying, and choosing an exercise environment free of disruptive elements. 5. Find a support system: While you mentioned not wanting to talk to your friends or family about your struggles, having a support system is essential to help you stay motivated and navigate challenging situations. Consider reaching out to a trusted friend or a professional counselor to discuss your feelings and receive constructive advice. 6. Break tasks into smaller steps: Instead of being overwhelmed by large tasks, break them into smaller, manageable steps. This can make your goals seem more achievable and help prevent procrastination. 7. Reward yourself: Celebrate your progress along the way. Reward yourself when you meet specific milestones or overcome obstacles, whether it's finishing a difficult assignment or completing a challenging workout session. 8. Track your progress: Keep track of your accomplishments and improvements, both academically and physically. This can serve as a motivator and a reminder of the progress you've made towards your goals. 9. Reflect and adjust: Remember that achieving your goals may require some trial and error. Reflect on your experiences, identify areas where you might need to make changes, and adjust your strategies accordingly. 10. Develop a growth mindset: Embrace a growth mindset, believing that you can improve and learn through effort and persistence. View challenges as opportunities for growth and remember that every experience, whether positive or negative, contributes to your personal development. By implementing these strategies, you can focus on your school and exercise goals while building resilience against life's challenges. Remember, seeking validation through external factors can be temporary and it's vital to cultivate self-love and self-acceptance for true, long-lasting satisfaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These so-called green schools use less energy, cost less to run and are good for students. The newly renovated   Sidwell Friends Middle School in the District has been awarded the highest rating by the U.S. Green Building Council for having a positive impact on the environment-a rare honor. Soon the school will treat and re-use its wastewater, saving hundreds of thousands of gallons of water per year. The recycled water from sinks and toilets, which can't be used for drinking, will be color1ed blue, \\"so we know it's recycled, just in case it gets into the water fountains  -not that it would,\\" joked Emily Bernstein, 14, a Sidwell student and building tour guide. Water fountains will still use fresh city water. Sidwell students are studying the building itself in science classes to help them learn first-hand the positive impact of green buildings. It's affecting how they view the world around them. \\"If you see a [building] being torn down, you think, 'They're going to fill up a whole landfill   with that,'\\" said Matthew Malone, 13. In Prince George's County, Suitland Elementary has been so successful that another green school is being planned, in Laurel, for the 2008-09 school year. At Suitland, a garden courtyard collects and uses rainwater; the roof is angled away from the sun to keep it cool; and skylights and tall windows let in lots of natural light. \\"You don't have to switch on the light switch all the time,\\" said Rupert McCave, the county official guiding these projects.

I sat down to watch it with my buddy and 6 minutes in we were glued to our seats. Not because of any intensity in those 6 minutes, but because it was a real film. No Hollywood BS, no explosions, no corny one liners; film. It drew you in slowly, reeling you toward a tragically human fate. Some people think they enjoy film but they are sadly mistaken. They like movies; mindless entertainment for entertainment's sake alone. Michael Bay's Transformers and the like were produced for just this audience. No need to think people, just watch and allow ever stereotype we can muster to slowly dissolve your brain. We'll even place advertisements throughout the movie, to keep you buying our products. And don't forget the explosions, we all love explosions. Here we make the distinction, art can be entertaining, but it's also thought provoking and moves you in hidden ways. Entertainment is rarely artful and even then only arbitrarily. Movie are entertainment. Descent is a film. Film is art. If you still house a soul within your walking meat-sack apparatus, this rape scene is every bit as powerful as \\"Irreversable\\". The distinction here is that \\"Irreversable\\" was a violent rape scene involving two people whose paths have unfortunately crossed at the wrong time and hell ensued. \\"Descent\\" is about date rape. No less disgusting. No less depraved. Just different. This is about trust violation, soul desecration and the scars that run deep. Had the character \\"Maya\\" been consenting it would have been a hot sex scene. But seeing as she was desperate to escape, the scene is sickening. \\"Jared\\" is a sick and manipulative serial rapist, and it's wholly unsettling because it so closely resembles a passionate love affair. How could \\"Maya\\" ever be close to anyone again when even in the midst of raping her \\"Jared's\\" slick lover boy facade only ever hints at slipping? She is ruined. The film as a whole is beautiful. The camera work and lighting at times removes the surroundings and focuses everything on \\"Maya\\" and the silent inner workings of her mind. All this accomplished by Rosario with facial expression and gesture. The soundtrack was excellent, a blend of everything. My particularly favorite scene being a synchronism of all these film aspects working together; \\"Maya\\" dancing in a sea of writhing bodies, something inside her awakening, becoming aware, all set to a beautifully sad Jeff Buckley tune. I don't think I've really spoiled anything here but I'm stopping before I do. Bottom line, I think this was the best film of 2007, hands down. Unfortunately it seems that everyone is so jaded these days that if you don't hack and slash, gang rape, or nuke anything then people just can't be bothered.

NBA star LeBron James breaches royal etiquette by putting his arm around the Duchess of Cambridge      In good spirits: The Duchess promptly burst into a fit of giggles, before brushing her hair back from her face as she attempted to regain her posture      Sweaty: Mr James appears to be in need of another visit to the shower room - but the royals don't seem to mind as they joke about their respective shoe sizes      Royalty meets pop: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and Beyoncé and Jay-Z, came face-to-face at a Brooklyn Nets game last night      Etiquette expert William Hanson told MailOnline that although the Duchess is unlikely to give Mr James the cold shoulder, he still should have kept his arm away from her.      He said: 'Although I am sure the Duchess of Cambridge won’t have worried about it, Mr James should not have put his arm around her.      'Americans are much more tactile than we Brits and this is another example of an American being too touchy feely with British royalty. You’d have thought they’d have learned by now.'      The 6ft 8in basketball star also appeared alongside the royals in a sweaty top, which some may regard as bad form.      Mr Hanson added: 'A shower would have been preferable but he had just finished a game – so even more reason for him not have opened his pits by lifting his arm and placing it around Her Royal Highness!'      However, because LeBron put his arm around Kate for only a second as they posed for a photograph, no offense was intended, none taken and that it was a very relaxed occasion.      Americans took to Twitter to voice their opinions about the faux pas, with some coming to Mr James' defence, saying that he was just being friendly.      Felica Devers wrote: 'Americans hug, love it or leave it.' Jorden Curren quipped that the basketball player was 'showing some alpha male presence' in front of the prince.      And Jeff Todd from Denver disputed whether royal etiquette transfers to a basketball game. He tweeted: 'If you invite me to Buckingham [Palace], I'll follow your rules of etiquette. If you are at a basketball game, I'll use mine.'      New Yorker Crystal Hoff, meanwhile, wasn't quite so forgiving. She tweeted: 'Who does LeBron James think he is putting his arm around Kate Middleton?'      HOW TO GREET A MEMBER OF THE ROYAL FAMILY The Buckingham Palace website says: 'There are no obligatory codes of behaviour when meeting The Queen or a member of the Royal Family, but many people wish to observe the traditional forms. 'For men this is a neck bow (from the head only) whilst women do a small curtsy. Other people prefer simply to shake hands in the usual way. 'On presentation to The Queen, the correct formal address is \\"Your Majesty\\" and subsequently \\"Ma'am\\". 'For male members of the Royal Family the same rules apply, with the title used in the first instance being \\"Your Royal Highness\\" and subsequently \\"Sir\\". 'For other female members of the Royal Family the first address is conventionally \\"Your Royal Highness\\" followed by \\"Ma'am\\" in later conversation.' Mr Hanson explained that as an American citizen LeBron James, when greeting the Duke or Duchess of Cambridge would not have to bow 'as he is not one of their subjects'. But he added: 'Many Americans, and other non-Brits, do like to still bow or curtsy out of respect for the institution or the people, but it is personal choice.' 'The ideal royal bow is from the neck, not the waist. Ideal curtsy is just one foot behind the other to perform a small bob, dipping the head at the same time, hands by the side - no need to pull out the skirt!'      Eyebrows were also raised in 2009 when centuries-long protocol was broken by Michelle Obama putting her arm around the Queen at a Buckingham Palace G20 reception.      Finding herself next to Mrs Obama, the Queen remarked on their height difference. As she did so, her hand edged towards the small of Mrs Obama's back. Mrs Obama responded - and even rubbed the Queen's shoulder - before both women moved gently apart after about ten seconds.      The sight of the Queen publicly hugging another woman astonished other guests. An onlooker said: 'It was a pretty simultaneous gesture. We couldn't believe what we were seeing.'      'A mutual and spontaneous display of affection and appreciation,' was how a Buckingham Palace spokesman hastened to describe it.      But the protocol concerning the sovereign has been set in stone for generations. 'Whatever you do,' courtiers are apt to warn, 'don't touch the Queen.'      There was furore in 1992 when the then Australian prime minister, Paul Keating, put his arm round the Queen's waist at Canberra's Parliament House, and found himself lampooned as 'the Lizard of Oz' for his faux-pas.      And everyone remembers the expression of frozen distaste on the Queen's face at the opening of the Millennium Dome when Tony Blair seized hold of the royal hand and shook it up and down during the singing of Auld Lang Syne.      A royal source, however, denied that royal protocol exists.      He said: 'When members of the royal family meet people they want them to feel as comfortable as possible. There's no such thing as royal protocol.'      But despite this the Buckingham Palace website offers instructions for greeting members of the royal family.      It says: 'There are no obligatory codes of behaviour when meeting The Queen or a member of the Royal Family, but many people wish to observe the traditional forms.      'For men this is a neck bow (from the head only) whilst women do a small curtsy. Other people prefer simply to shake hands in the usual way.'      During his backstage meeting with the royal couple, James presented them with cup cakes from his hometown, Akron, Ohio.      Hen then asked William what size shoes he wore, to which the Prince replied, 'Half the size of yours,' while pointing at the star's huge feet.      The Duchess promptly burst into a fit of giggles, before brushing her hair back from her face as she attempted to regain her posture.      Earlier on Monday, the athlete had told ESPN it was an honor to play for royalty. 'It's a huge honor,' he said. 'The stuff that you read about, people like them are only in books growing up.'      'To hear that they're coming to town to see me play and they want to see me do what I do best, it's a huge honor,' the athlete continued.      LeBron James may not carry an official title, but he's certainly sporting royalty in America.      James has over 16million Twitter followers and the star, who earns over 70million a year, was named by Forbes magazine as the 'Most Valuable Athlete Brand', voted the most popular athlete in America in a recent poll and has appeared on the cover of Vogue.      He is married to his high school sweetheart, Savannah Brinson, with whom he has two sons and a daughter.      Mr James warmed up for the game wearing an 'I Can't Breathe' message in protest of a grand jury ruling not to indict an officer for the chokehold that killed black father-of-six Eric Garner, a New Yorker.      Prince William and Kate posed with the star Cleveland Cavaliers player in New York yesterday      LeBron James towers over Wills and Kate as he hands them their basketball tops      Not the done thing: An etiquette expert said that the basketball player was being too touchy feely      British royalty meets basketball royalty: James asked William what size shoes he wore, to which the Prince replied, 'Half the size of yours,' while pointing at the star's huge feet (pictured)      Earlier that day, Prince William joked with Barack Obama during his first visit to the White House's Oval Office, where he held talks with the president before giving a speech at a World Bank anti-corruption conference.      He then flew back to New York to be reunited with his pregnant wife, and together the couple attended a reception at the British Consul General's residence to recognize the work of The Tusk Trust and other partners of William's charity United for Wildlife.      During the event, Kate spoke with US Secretary of State – and potential presidential candidate - Hillary Clinton about the benefits of singing to babies and her visit earlier in the day to a children's center in Harlem.

If ever there was a woman conspicuously not attuned to the touchy-feely nature of political correctness, it is surely Elizabeth II, who has inherited the essentially shy and aloof character of her grandmother, the imposing, ramrod-straight and awe-inspiring Queen Mary, who died in 1953, the year of this Queen's coronation.

As the crowd cheered and took photos, Prince William and Kate - who looked chic in a grey coat by U.S. designer Tory Burch, skinny J Crew jeans and black heels - were seen greeting Beyoncé and Jay-Z during the second half of the game against the Cleveland Cavaliers.      They beamed as they exchanged words with the couple, before returning to their courtside seats next to basketball legend, Dikembe Mutombo, where they were handed a box of popcorn and bottles of water. Beyoncé and Jay-Z, meanwhile, sat down in their own seats directly opposite them.      Kensington Place courtiers had previously arranged with NBA officials that the two couples would meet during the third and fourth quarters of the game at the Barclays Center.      Later the royal couple paid their respects to the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks by visiting the New York memorial dedicated to their memory.

Meanwhile, although it remains largely unknown what was said between the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Beyonce and Jay-Z during their courtside encounter, an eyewitness told People magazine that Jay-Z 'wished Will and Kate \\"Merry Christmas\\"'.      Before the royal couple's basketball appearance, William and Kate - who is nearly five months' pregnant - met with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and Senior Vice President of Community & Player Programs, Kathleen Behrens, for a photo call.      Earlier on Monday, 32-year-old Kate, who is five months' pregnant, made a huge impression on a class of children in Harlem - who thought she was a princess from the Disney film Frozen.      The Duchess's audience of three- and four-year-olds mistook her or fictional royalty from the blockbuster film, according to an official at the Northside Center for Child Development, where she had the first official engagement of her three-day trip to New York.      Outside the building on Fifth Avenue, the future Queen crouched down on the sidewalk and accepted a bouquet of the bright red flowers from a crowd of waiting children, before she went inside and chatted to them while helping out with an art project.      The youngsters, who receive support from a Harlem-based mental health center, welcomed Kate to their institution with the cry �?Princess’, promoting their royal visitor to smile with delight.

Above, the Duchess smiles as she accepts a bouquet of flowers from a child ||||| To an American eye, there was nothing strange about a sweaty LeBron James putting his arm around Kate to pose for a photograph after his Cleveland Cavaliers played the Brooklyn Nets on Monday evening. To the British, though, merely touching the Duchess of Cambridge represents a serious breach in etiquette. Someone get some smelling salts!      While U.S. headlines cooed over the adorable mini-jersey James presented to Prince William and Kate, who were in New York as part of their three-day visit, British tabloids led with the fact that star basketball player inadvertently violated royal protocol. While the website of the Monarchy stipulates that “there are no obligatory codes of behavior” for meeting a member of the royal family, the more understood protocol is, well, don’t touch or speak to a royal unless you’re touched or spoken to first.      First Lady Michelle Obama broke this unofficial rule in 2009 when she put her arm around Queen Elizabeth II. The media went wild, but the Queen was cool with it, though, because Obama’s arms are amazing.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: James Daniel May was born in Bristol, one of four children; he has two sisters and a brother. May attended Caerleon Endowed Junior School in Newport. He spent his teenage years in South Yorkshire where he attended Oakwood Comprehensive School in Rotherham and was a choirboy at Whiston Parish Church. He was also at school with Life on Mars and Ashes to Ashes actor Dean Andrews. Beginning in October 2009, May presented a 6-part TV series showing favourite toys of the past era and whether they can be applied in the modern day. The toys featured were Airfix, Plasticine, Meccano, Scalextric, Lego and Hornby. In each show, May attempts to take each toy to its limits, also fulfilling several of his boyhood dreams in the process. In August 2009, May built a full-sized house out of Lego at Denbies Wine Estate in Surrey. Plans for Legoland to move it to their theme park fell through in September 2009 because costs to deconstruct, move and then rebuild were too high and despite a final Facebook appeal for someone to take it, it was demolished on 22 September, with the plastic bricks planned to be donated to charity.  Also for the series, he recreated the banked track at Brooklands using Scalextric track, and an attempt at the world's longest working model railway along the Tarka Trail between Barnstaple and Bideford in North Devon, although the attempt was foiled due to parts of the track being stolen and vandals placing coins on the track, causing a short circuit.  In December 2012 aired a special Christmas Episode called Flight Club, where James and his team built a huge toy glider that flew 22 miles (35 km) from Devon to the island of Lundy.  In 2013, May created a life size, fully functional motorcycle and sidecar made entirely out of the construction toy Meccano. Joined by Oz Clark, he then completed a full lap of the Isle of Man TT Course, a full  37 3/4 mile long circuit. Did he actually drive the motorcycle ?","output":"Yes, James May actually drove the motorcycle made out of Meccano, a construction toy.

On the death of his father in 1523 he completed his father's term as Sheriff of Cornwall, a post he also held in 1526-7, 1544-5.  In between he was Sheriff of Devon in 1532-3.  He was Justice of the Peace for Cornwall from 1524 till his death and also in Devon, at Exeter from 1535 to 1547. Further afield he was Marshal of Calais, a post that required his residence there, from October 1535 to October 1540.  In 1544 Grenville accompanied the King to France as a commander in the English army. He was active in his Christian faith and openly favoured ‘God's word'. In the Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549 Grenville was called upon against the western rebels, and with a company of friends and followers he defended Trematon Castle. When they were unsuccessful in defending the castle, he and his wife were held in custody in Launceston prison. Grenville contracted the illness probably while in gaol and died from it on 18 March 1550.  He was buried at Kilkhampton five days later. Question: How many years were between were between when Richard Grenville's father died and when Richard himslef fied? Answer:","output":"Richard Grenville's father died in 1523 and Richard himself died on March 18, 1550. To calculate the number of years between the two events, subtract the earlier year (1523) from the later year (1550). The difference is 27 years.

During their visit, Barbara sees a man sobbing and mummering \\"I'm sorry,\\" when out of nowhere, Barbara is attacked by a zombie. Her brother comes to defend her, but is killed. Barbara runs for help and finds a seemingly abandoned farmhouse. Then, Ben (Tony Todd) shows up to the house with a crow bar, saying there are these creatures everywhere. The two proceed to clear the house of zombies and begin barricading the doors and windows.However, they discover that they aren't alone in the house. Married couple Harry and Helen Cooper (Tom Towles and McKee Anderson), their daughter Sarah (Heather Mazur) , and teenage couple Tom Landry and Judy Rose Larson (William Butler and Katie Finneran) are all survivors who had been hiding in the cellar. What follows are the attempts by the survivors to defend the house under siege from the undead. The group is left divided over what their next course of action should be. Harry believes everyone should retreat to the cellar and barricade the door to wait for the authorities. Ben thinks the cellar is a \\"death trap\\" and that they would be better served fortifying the house, which at least has alternate escape routes, and Barbara suggests that they should all leave the house on foot while they still can after she notices that the zombies are very slow and that they can just \\"walk right past them\\". An argument between Ben and Harry leaves the Coopers in the basement tending to their daughter, who was bitten by a zombie and is near death, and the remaining members of the group upstairs to continue their work reinforcing the doors and windows.

Answer the question...a solid homogeneous mixture of 2 or more metals??","output":"A solid homogeneous mixture of two or more metals is called an alloy. Alloys are materials that possess the characteristic metallic properties of the metals they are composed of, but they generally exhibit improved physical and mechanical properties compared to their individual constituent metals. Alloys are created by heating the metals to their melting points and then combining them in specific proportions, resulting in a uniform mixture at the atomic level. This process ensures that the elements are evenly distributed throughout the solid and that the composition is consistent throughout the material. The proportion of elements in an alloy can be manipulated to achieve specific desired behaviors, such as increased strength, improved corrosion resistance, or enhanced electrical conductivity. Some common examples of alloys include: 1. Steel: Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon, with small amounts of other elements such as manganese, silicon, and sulfur. It is one of the most widely used materials globally due to its high strength, durability, and affordability. Different types of steel may be created by adjusting the carbon content and incorporating additional elements to achieve desired properties. 2. Brass: This is an alloy made primarily of copper and zinc, having a distinct yellow-gold color. Brass has excellent corrosion resistance, and its mechanical properties make it suitable for various applications, such as in musical instruments, decorative items, and gears. 3. Bronze: Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin, sometimes containing other elements like aluminum, silicon, or phosphorus. With a history dating back to the Bronze Age, this material has been used for thousands of years for applications such as weaponry, sculpture, and architectural elements due to its toughness, corrosion resistance, and ease of casting. 4. Aluminum alloys: These are lightweight alloys containing aluminum as the principal element, with other elements like copper, magnesium, manganese, or zinc. Their high strength-to-weight ratio and good corrosion resistance make them popular in automotive, aerospace, and general engineering applications. 5. Solder: This alloy is composed mostly of tin, with lead, silver, or other elements. Solder is designed to have a low melting point, making it ideal for connecting electrical components by creating a low-resistance metallic bond between them. 6. Stainless steel: As an alloy of iron and chromium, stainless steel exhibits high corrosion resistance, and it can be further reinforced by incorporating other elements such as nickel, molybdenum, and carbon. This material is widely used in the food industry, sanitary applications, and medical instruments due to its non-corrosive properties. The development of alloys has opened up an extensive range of possibilities in materials science, enabling the creation of materials with tailored mechanical, electrical, and chemical properties. By understanding and manipulating the atomic interactions between different metallic elements, researchers and engineers can continuously develop new alloys with improved performance and novel applications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Few Contingency Plans if Court Rejects Individual Mandate If the court invalidates the insurance requirement, the White House and a divided Congress would be left to pick up the pieces. Their first steps toward finding alternatives to reduce the number of uninsured in the country — nearly 50 million, or one in six Americans — would depend heavily on how far the Supreme Court goes, and on the balance of power in Washington after the November elections. Lower courts that have ruled against the insurance mandate have adopted a spectrum of positions. Judge Roger Vinson of Federal District Court in Pensacola, Fla., who first ruled in the case now before the Supreme Court, invalidated the entirety of the Affordable Care Act, writing that the insurance mandate could not be legally separated from the rest of the expansive law. He stayed that judgment until the law could be reviewed by higher courts. The Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta upheld Judge Vinson’s invalidation of the insurance mandate. But it significantly scaled back the impact by concluding that only the mandate itself would die. The Obama administration will argue on Wednesday for a middle ground that is driven by economic assumptions as well as legal analysis. If the mandate falls, the Justice Department has said, two politically popular provisions must die naturally with it — those that prohibit insurers from declining coverage or charging higher premiums because of pre-existing medical conditions. The economic argument is that it would be unreasonable to expect health insurers to cover the sickest Americans if the healthiest ones are not required to pay for coverage and broaden the actuarial pool. “If you are told that you can buy insurance anytime, you would wait until you got sick and buy it en route to the hospital,” said Neal K. Katyal, the former acting solicitor general, who argued the health care case before the 11th Circuit. But there also is a clear political component to linking the insurance mandate to the insurance regulations. A poll taken this month by The New York Times and CBS News found that while more Americans disapprove than approve of the law’s insurance requirement, the abolition of pre-existing condition exclusions is wildly popular, with 85 percent saying they supported it. The health care law began requiring that insurers cover children regardless of their health in September 2010, but the ban would not apply to adults until 2014. In court on Wednesday, the challengers to the law will argue that the entire act must fall along with the mandate. The court has appointed an outside lawyer, H. Bartow Farr III, to argue the 11th Circuit’s position, that the mandate could fall alone. White House officials said that they remain confident that the Supreme Court will uphold the law, and that they have done no planning for the possibility of its full or partial demise. Congressional leaders in both parties also said there had been no significant contingency planning. “I think the law is going to be found constitutional, and if not we’ll have to deal with it then,” said Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat. Representative Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, said his party would continue to press for repeal of the law and substantial changes to government insurance programs. So long as the court does not invalidate the entire law, many other components — and the taxes to pay for them — could remain in place even if the mandate and related insurance regulations are struck down. They include a vast expansion of Medicaid eligibility and the establishment of health insurance exchanges, offering subsidized coverage to those with low incomes, both scheduled to start in 2014. Other provisions that might survive include increased prescription drug benefits for Medicare recipients, requirements that insurers cover preventive services like cancer screening, incentives for doctors to adopt electronic records, and grant programs aimed at disease prevention and restructuring the medical payment system. Some health care experts have suggested that there might be ways to replace the insurance mandate by using market incentives to encourage the uninsured to gain coverage. The government could, for instance, give consumers limited enrollment periods to buy insurance so they could not wait until they were ill. Or it could tell them that if they did not buy a policy during a defined period they also would not be eligible for benefits, like subsidized coverage. But supporters of the health care law contend that such measures would insure only a fraction of the 30 million estimated to gain coverage with the mandate in place. “There are alternatives to the mandate, but none of them are considered as effective,” said Neera Tanden, a former Obama aide who now heads the Center for American Progress. Drew Altman, the president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care research group, said that without the mandate the number of uninsured and the premiums paid for coverage would almost certainly rise. He said that the partisan divide in Washington, where Republicans have vowed to repeal the health care act, makes it difficult to imagine Congress seeking any kind of repair. “States may be forced to stitch together a variety of imperfect state-specific approaches if the mandate falls,” Dr. Altman said. “It is useful to remember that we have averaged 19 years between national health reform debates, and only passed national health reform legislation once.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"If the court rejects the individual mandate, Congress and the White House would need to find alternative ways to reduce the number of uninsured people in the U.S. Potential options include limited enrollment periods, market incentives, and exclusion from government benefits for those who don't purchase insurance within specified time frames, though experts argue these alternatives may not be as effective in insuring as many people as the mandate."},{"instruction":"Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Though hooded and cloaked, Nicolette trembled. The chill of the January afternoon pierced her through, but it was fear, more than the cold, that made her limbs shake. Having just crossed over to the Left Bank, she glanced back over her shoulder and saw the towers and spires of the royal palace across the Seine. She felt as if hidden eyes there were watching her. Could anyone on the palace wall have seen her walk over the Petit-Pont? Not Amalric. He was still in the south, the King having just appointed him seneschal for Beziers and the surrounding country. But he had so many agents in Paris and allies at court. Except for Agnes, all the servants in the Gobignon town house were loyal to him. His aunt, Queen Blanche, was forever praising him to all who would listen. If Nicolette were involved in scandal, the White Queen would be furious, and would see to it that word reached Amalric. And if indeed he found out about her meeting the troubadour? Just a message, a song, let alone a meeting like this one, could mean death for her and Orlando. I should turn around right now, cross this bridge, and run back to the palace. The streets of the Latin Quarter were crawling with ruffians and criminals - it was insane for her to be walking here alone after sunset. The sight of the small knife she carried under her cloak might deter an attacker, but then she would be discovered. If I screamed for help, the whole palace would find out. Blanche would demand to know why I was here. No, she thought, her blood turning to ice, she would know why. But those eyes of his? to look into them again, was that not worth any risk? She stood, vacillating, in the shadows by a wooden house that overhung the Rue Saint-Jacques. I must see Orlando, she thought. Over a year now, and I have not been able to forget him.

What happens next in this paragraph? How to find the surface area of cylinders  Visualize the top and bottom of a cylinder.  A can of soup is the shape of a cylinder. If you think about it, the can has a top and a bottom that are the same.","output":"In this paragraph, we are learning about finding the surface area of a cylinder with the given context. Having visualized the top and bottom of a cylinder and understanding that a can of soup is an example of a cylindrical shape, the next steps would detail the process of finding the surface area of a cylinder. Here is how the paragraph would continue. To find the surface area of a cylinder, we need to consider three parts: the top, the bottom, and the lateral surface (the side). The top and bottom of the cylinder, being identical, are circles with the same radius. The lateral surface, on the other hand, is the curved part connecting the top and bottom and can be \\"unrolled\\" to form a rectangle. 1. Calculate the area of the top and bottom circles: For the two identical circles, you can find the area of each using the formula A = πr², where A is the area, and r is the radius of the circle. Since there are two circles, you will multiply the resulting area by 2. 2. Calculate the area of the lateral surface: To find the area of the lateral surface, you need to determine the length and width of the rectangle obtained by unrolling it. The width of the rectangle is equal to the height (h) of the cylinder, and the length is equivalent to the circumference of the circular base, which can be calculated using the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius. Now that we have the length and width of the rectangle, we can find the area using the formula A = length × width, which in this case becomes A = h × 2πr. 3. Combine the areas: Finally, to find the total surface area of the cylinder, simply add the areas of the top and bottom circles and the lateral surface together. Surface area = 2(πr²) + h × 2πr. In conclusion, the formula to find the surface area of a cylinder is Surface area = 2(πr²) + 2πrh. With this formula, you can calculate the surface area of any cylindrical object, such as the can of soup mentioned earlier. Always ensure to have accurate measurements of the radius and height to obtain an accurate result."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Goal: To scrub a pan, Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? Available choices:  (A). put hot water and dish soap in it and use a metal scratcher to scratch off food, then rinse.;  (B). put hot water and dish soap in it and use a paper towel to scratch off food, then rinse.;...I think the answer is","output":"(A).  The task of scrubbing a pan is typically done to remove leftover food particles and restore the surface to its clean and usable condition. Depending on the type of pan and the material it's made from, different techniques and tools may be used to achieve the best results. In this case, we have two options to consider, and we'll elaborate on both to show why option (A) is a more reasonable method to accomplish this goal. Option (A) involves using hot water and dish soap in conjunction with a metal scratcher. Hot water is effective in loosening and removing greasy buildup and food particles which are stuck to the pan. Adding dish soap to it maximizes its cleaning power, allowing the solution to dissolve leftover oils and help lift and remove food residues.  Using a metal scratcher offers a solid and robust scrubbing surface that exerts more pressure than a paper towel would, therefore, effectively removing stubborn particles from the pan. Metal scratchers are designed to withstand intensive use without disintegrating, and they won’t scratch most pots and pans if used properly, especially those made from hard materials such as cast iron or stainless steel. Lastly, rinsing helps to wash away all the dislodged particles and soap to leave the pan clean, clear, and ready for another use. On the other hand, option (B) uses a paper towel instead of a metal scratcher. While paper towels can be useful for cleaning up spills or wiping away loose debris, their effectiveness for dislodging stuck food particles is limited. Paper towels typically do not provide enough abrasive action for serious scrubbing and they tend to disintegrate when wet, making them less effective in removing stubborn residues. So, based on the comparison, option (A) seems more reasonable to accomplish this goal because it uses appropriate tools and methods for a deep and thorough cleaning of the pan. Nonetheless, remember that not all pans should be scrubbed with metal scratchers as it may ruin the surface of non-stick, ceramic, or Teflon-coated pans.  In those cases, a non-abrasive sponge or a soft brush would be a more suitable choice to prevent damage to the special coating that allows the pan to have its non-stick properties. And as with all cleaning actions, do refer to the manufacturer's instructions for proper cleaning of specific types of pans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q: What does the \\"fullwidth forms\\" section of code points encompass?","output":"The \\"fullwidth forms\\" section of code points in Unicode includes characters that have a specific width, so they can match the width of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) characters. It has a separate Latin alphabet, which means it has letters like A, B, C, and so on, but they are designed to be the same width as CJK characters. This is helpful when using different languages together, so the text looks more balanced and well-spaced."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A Korean wave is sweeping across China, with many Chinese women worshipping South Korean actors Kim Soo Hyun and Lee Min Ho as demigods  . Chinese netizens have always been divided over South Korean TV dramas, but there is no doubt that programs from the neighboring country are now enjoying a new round of popularity in China. And a big part of the credit for that goes to You Who Came From The Star, the South Korean TV series which is on the air now. Top South Korean actors Jun Ji-hyun and Kim Soo Hyun recently earned a popularity rating of 24.8 percent in their country, considered strong by Nielsen Korea. You Who Came From The Star and The Heirs have been subjects of hot online discussions throughout Asia. Besides, the book, The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane, read by the hero in You Who Came From The Star was a hard-to-get item on Amazon for a while. The two TV programs have several common elements: a tall, handsome, and rich hero who loves the heroine blindly and always protects her, and an equally handsome man madly in love with the same woman. Both programs portray the purity of love, which is expressed through a kiss or a warm hug. Perhaps that's the secret of their success; perhaps people are still fascinated by Cinderella-type stories. The growing wealth gap is a matter of social concern both in South Korea and China, and the challenges that young people face in their search for a better life might have prompted   many ordinary girls to dream of marrying rich, caring men. This is precisely what the popular South Korean TV dramas portray. In fact, South Korean TV dramas are tailored to meet the market's demands. In contrast, Chinese TV screens are flooded by knock-off   or poorly made soap operas. There are too many Chinese TV dramas that are either of the stereotyped   war theme or just blindly copy foreign programs. The lack of good stories has resulted in loads of TV series on time travel or fights in the harems   of Qing Dynastyemperors. These, in short, are the pain of Chinese TV... Question: Which of the following best explains people's favor for The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane? Options: A: The celebrity effect is powerful. B: Drama stars are the best advertisements. C: Rich and handsome heroes in dramas usually love reading. D: A successful drama generally originates from a good novel.

Studying economics was far easier for Megan than Monica, as  Choose from: - Megan struggled with numbers and math.; - Monica struggled with numbers and math.;","output":"Studying economics was far easier for Megan than Monica, as Monica struggled with numbers and math. Unlike Megan, who had a natural affinity for numerical concepts and mathematical problem-solving, Monica often found herself lagging behind in grasping the quantitative aspects of economics. This difference in their skills and inclinations significantly influenced their experiences while studying the subject. Being good with numbers and math, Megan enjoyed decoding complex economic models and theories, which allowed her to develop a deep understanding of the subject matter. Her proficiency with mathematics helped her to quickly and accurately analyze equations, trends, and data related to economic systems and markets. Moreover, her ability to process and interpret statistics enabled her to make connections between different elements of the field and gain a more holistic understanding of economic principles and their real-world implications. On the other hand, Monica found the subject matter challenging, particularly when it came to understanding the numerical and mathematical aspects. Her inability to easily grasp these concepts made it hard for her to see the larger picture of how individual elements of economics fit together, which hindered her learning process. As a result, she often felt overwhelmed and struggled to progress at the same pace as her peers like Megan. Her difficulties with numerical concepts also made it harder for her to apply economic principles in practical situations, reducing her overall effectiveness and success in her studies and future career. To overcome her struggles with numbers and math, Monica had to invest additional time and effort into understanding and mastering these aspects of economics. She sought help from various resources, such as attending extra tutoring sessions, collaborating with peers, and utilizing online tools and apps. Over time, she managed to improve her mathematical skills, but the inherent challenge she faced due to her struggle with numbers remained a key factor differentiating her experience from Megan's. In conclusion, studying economics was far easier for Megan than Monica, as Monica struggled with numbers and math. Megan's proficiency in these areas gave her a significant advantage in understanding and applying economic concepts, while Monica's predisposition towards difficulty with mathematics presented a roadblock that she had to work hard to overcome. This stark contrast between their experiences highlights the importance of numerical and mathematical competence in successfully studying and engaging with economics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Exercise can help relieve menstrual symptoms in general, include cramping. Exercise releases endorphins, which are natural pain relievers. Endorphins also help counteract the prostaglandins in your body that cause contractions and pain. Because of this, physical activity may help relieve cramps. Try different kinds of aerobic exercise, such as walking, running, cycling, swimming, kayaking, hiking, or a class at the gym. Stretching helps relax your muscles and alleviate cramps. Sit on the floor with your legs stretched far apart. Stretch forward to catch your toes or ankle. Breathe in while keeping your back straight. After a few breaths, lean forward towards the floor. You can try other simple stretches as well to stretch out your back or abdomen, depending on which areas hurt the most. Some women experience relief from menstrual cramping with orgasm. The reason behind this is not well understood, but may have something to do with endorphins released during sexual arousal. Much like with exercise, the endorphins released during orgasm can help relieve the menstrual cramps and inflammation. Similar to aerobic exercise and stretching, yoga helps relax the body and reduce aches and pains in the lower back, legs, and abdomen. When you begin to feel menstrual cramps, you can try various yoga poses to help you with your pain. Before you start, get in some comfortable clothes and put on soothing music.  You can do the head-to-knee forward bend. Sit on the floor and extend your legs in front of you. Pull one of your legs in and bend it 90 degrees so that the sole of your foot rests against the inside of your thigh. Inhale and grab your shin, ankle, or foot. Stretch the torso over your leg towards the foot. Exhale and bend down from the groin. Lengthen and stretch your back instead of rounding it. Breathe as you hold the pose, extending through the heel and pressing your sitting bones towards the floor. Hold for 1-3 minutes, then switch sides. You can also try the noose pose. Get into a full squat with your feet together. Lower down until your buttocks are towards your heels. Inhale, then move your knees to the left as you turn your torso to the right. As you exhale, wrap the left arm back behind you and around your knees and legs. Inhale and reach the right arm around to clasp your hands. Exhale as you gaze over the right shoulder. Hold for 30-60 seconds as you breathe. Switch sides. You can also attempt camel pose. Get on your knees, hip-width apart. Make sure your shins and feet are pressed firmly into the floor. Rest your palms on the top of your buttocks with the fingers pointing down. Inhale. Lift your chest and move your shoulders down towards the ribs. Exhale, then push your hips forward as you arch back. To stabilize yourself, rest your hands on your heels. Lift the chest. Breathe steadily for 30-60 seconds.

Question: Who plays the girlfriend Jolene? Title: Electra Glide in Blue Movie plot: John Wintergreen (Robert Blake) is a motorcycle cop who patrols the rural Arizona highways with his partner Zipper (Billy \\"Green\\" Bush). Wintergreen is an experienced patrolman looking to be transferred to homicide. When he is informed by Crazy Willie (Elisha Cook, Jr.) of an apparent suicide via shotgun, Wintergreen believes the case is actually a murder. Detective Harve Poole (Mitchell Ryan) agrees it is a homicide, after a .22 bullet is found in the man's skull during the autopsy, as well hearing about a possible missing 5,000 from the man's home, and arranges for Wintergreen to be transferred to homicide to help with the case. Wintergreen gets his wish, but his joy is short-lived. He begins increasingly to identify with the hippies whom the other officers, including Detective Poole, are endlessly harassing. The final straw comes when Poole discovers that Wintergreen has been sleeping with his girlfriend Jolene (Jeannine Riley). The hostile workplace politics cause him to be quickly demoted back to traffic enforcement. Despite being demoted, Wintergreen is able to solve the murder. The killer turns out to be Willie, who confesses while Wintergreen goads him into talking about it. Wintergreen surmises Willie did it because he was jealous of the old man he killed, who frequently had young people over to his house to buy drugs. Shortly after, it is discovered that Zipper stole the 5,000, which he used to buy a fully dressed Electra Glide motorcycle. Wintergreen is forced to shoot Zipper after he becomes distressed and belligerent, and shoots an innocent bystander while brandishing a gun. As the film ends, Wintergreen is alone and back on his old beat, when he runs into a hippie that Zipper was needlessly harassing near the beginning of the film. Wintergreen lets him off with a warning but the hippie forgets his driver's license, and Wintergreen drives up behind his van to return it to him. The hippie's passenger points a shotgun out the back window and shoots Wintergreen, killing him.

I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no “hard feelings.” Question: Why didn't the patient get proper treatment?

When they were reissued by EMI on LP in the 1970s, they caused surprise to many by their fast tempi, in contrast to the slower speeds adopted by many conductors in the years since Elgar's death. The recordings were reissued on CD in the 1990s.In November 1931, Elgar was filmed by Pathé for a newsreel depicting a recording session of Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 at the opening of EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London.

Originally thought to be a traitor who informed the Germans about Miller and Mallory during the Navarone mission, Nicolai is now known to be a dedicated German spy, and is believed to be disguised among the Yugoslav Partisans as a Captain Lescovar (Franco Nero). Mallory and Miller's new mission is to get to Yogoslavia, find Nicolai, and kill him.To get to Yugoslavia the two men pair with \\"Force 10\\", an American sabotage unit led by Lt. Col.

Usage: [{'first': -37, 'second': 16}, {'first': -6, 'second': 35}, {'first': 23, 'second': 22}, {'first': 94, 'second': 1}] Explanation: We sort the given list of dictionaries based on the values of the 'first' key, in ascending order. Negative numbers come before positive numbers. Part #3: Sorting the list of dictionaries by the 'second' key when the 'first' keys are equal. Usage: [{'first': 5, 'second': 2}, {'first': 5, 'second': 4}] -> [{'first': 5, 'second': 2}, {'first': 5, 'second': 4}] Explanation: If two dictionaries have the same 'first' value, we sort them by their 'second' key.

Mary's (Elle Fanning) seemingly dull Christmas is suddenly filled with excitement and adventure following the arrival of her Uncle Albert, who gives her a Nutcracker as a gift. Later that night, Mary dreams that the Nutcracker – called N.C. – comes to life and takes her on a wondrous journey. They discover that the Nazi-like Rat King has usurped the Nutcracker's kingdom. When Mary and N.C. go to the top of the Christmas tree, they meet a fairy and, as she begins to sing, N.C. looks at his hand, as it begins to turn human. Worried about this he runs into the sleigh, but leaves his human hand revealed, and Mary sees this. Mary, seeing this, goes to N.C. and rubs his hand as we see that he is in fact a human crying with tears of joy that he is human again. The snow fairy begins to sing and toys appear and begin to ice skate around the tree. N.C. takes Mary to the top to show her his city. The two come up with a plan to shut down the smoke factory. Suddenly N.C. is starting to turn back in to a doll. Then the tree is shaking and Mary falls off, only to awake to being in her room.

A:","output":"The best answer for the question \\"How can Earth's crust shatter glass windows for miles?\\" would be \\"rock faulting.\\"  During the process of rock faulting, tectonic plates that make up Earth's crust shift, resulting in the release of energy. This energy often takes the form of seismic waves, which travel through the Earth and cause the ground to shake. These movements, which we know as earthquakes, can vary in intensity and duration, but the strongest ones can cause significant damage to structures, including shattering glass windows miles away from the epicenter. The other options provided are not appropriate answers for the following reasons: - It can't: This statement is incorrect, as seismic waves from earthquakes can indeed cause glass to shatter at considerable distances. - It gets heated up: While heat can cause glass breakage, it is not relevant to the specific phenomenon of glass windows shattering due to Earth's crust movements. - Erosion: Erosion is a geologic process that affects landforms and topography, but it is not responsible for earthquake-related glass breakage. - Melting: Melting is a process involving the transition of a solid substance to a liquid state. This process also does not have a direct connection to glass windows shattering as a result of Earth's crust movement. - Bottom of feet: This phrase is nonsensical in the context of the question.  - Heat energy: Although heat energy refers to the energy possessed by an object or substance due to its temperature, it does not specifically explain how Earth's crust can cause glass windows to shatter miles away. - Having no movement: This option contradicts the nature of earthquakes and seismic waves, which are triggered by the movement of tectonic plates.

FOXBORO -- Agent Terry Watson has come out in support of Brandon Spikes with regard to sex tapes that have surfaced on the Internet involving the Patriots [team stats] rookie linebacker.      Watson, who represents the team’s second-round draft pick, said he was aware of the situation, and had spoken to his client last night. ||||| Brandon Spikes, the Patriots linebacker and former Florida Gators star, is said to be naked in a video of a recorded Chatroulette interaction. An emailer offered the video to Deadspin for 1,500, but the web site balked. The footage surfaced on WorldStarHipHop hours later.      In the video, a naked man is seen with a scantily clad woman in what is said to be a hotel room. The two proceed to engage in oral sex. According to Deadspin's emailer, the man does more than showcase himself to his Chatroulette partner -- he also communicates via the written word. \\"let's play don't be shy\\" and \\"you make me wanna like your p---y,\\" he allegedly writes.      While it is unclear whether the man is Brandon Spikes, the two look quite similar. Scroll down for a tattoo comparison.      Spikes was drafted in the second round of the 2010 NFL Draft. He was a standout defensive star for the Florida Gators during his time with the college football powerhouse, although his tenure was marred by an eye-gouging incident in 2009. (The altercation's victim was arrested over the weekend.) Spikes was a finalist for the prestigious Butkus Award last year, and he could start for the Patriots during the upcoming NFL season.

(AP) — An Arkansas judge resigned Monday after new allegations surfaced that he used his authority for the last 30 years to sexually prey on young men charged with crimes who needed financial help or who were afraid of losing their children or jobs.      Part-time Cross County District Judge Joe Boeckmann resigned after a state judicial commission presented him with new allegations, including one case when a man said he was taken to a courtroom, told to strip naked and photographed in handcuffs. Allegations were made public last year that Boeckmann had engaged in inappropriate sexual relationships including photographing and paddling defendants in exchange for lighter sentences.      Documents detailing the new allegations were provided to The Associated Press by the commission under an open records request.      \\"He's a criminal predator who used his judicial power to feed his corrupt desires. Every minute he served as a judge was an insult to the Arkansas Judiciary,\\" said David Sachar, executive director of the Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission, which had been investigating to determine if the judge should be sanctioned or kicked off the bench.      The former judge has not been charged with a crime.      Sachar said Monday that he turned parts of the information over to the Arkansas State Police, a special state prosecutor and federal authorities. He said since part of the allegations stretched to when Boeckmann was a private attorney and a deputy prosecutor, the commission will contact the Arkansas Judiciary's Committee on Professional Conduct to investigate— including allegations from at least one witness that Boeckmann tried to pay him not to speak with investigators.      Boeckmann had previously denied the allegations against him. But in his resignation letter dated Monday, he agreed never to work in public service again.      \\"I further promise to never seek employment as a local, county or state employee or public servant in the State of Arkansas.\\" he wrote.      Jeff Rosenzweig, Boeckmann's attorney, said he will not make any further comments.      The documents show that investigators found thousands of photos on Boeckmann's home computers of naked and semi-naked men, many of whom were identified by the commission as former defendants whose cases had gone before Boeckmann both as a judge and as a deputy prosecutor. Sachar wrote in a May 3 letter that Boeckmann still had the opportunity to resign before those allegations were added to the complaint.      Sachar also wrote that the commission planned to file a subpoena asking Boeckmann to turn over a paddle used to spank several of the young men and seen in many of the photographs.      Sachar said investigators also found hundreds of checks written from the judge's personal and professional accounts paying defense attorneys and court fines for defendants. He said the commission is considering whether to turn those records over to the Internal Revenue Service or the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration.      The panel alleges Boeckmann showed preferential treatment to white men and allowed sentencing not recorded on court dockets, including performing the task of picking up trash at his home. He's accused of coercing some of the men into sexual acts ranging from spanking to masturbating on camera in return for paying their attorney fees or forgiving their fines.      One man, whose name was withheld, said Boeckmann handled his case involving a child custody allegation.      The man told the commission that Boeckmann drove him to the Cross County Courthouse, took him into a courtroom and told him to strip naked. The judge then handcuffed him and took pictures of him naked in various positions, the man said.      The commission launched a more than yearlong investigation after an Arkansas Department of Human Services investigator lodged a complaint that the judge had not recused himself from a case involving a woman who is related to a man with whom Boeckmann allegedly had a long-term intimate relationship.      The commission previously admonished Boeckmann for not recusing himself from hearing cases involving people he had a personal relationship with.      The Arkansas Supreme Court appointed a special judge in November to hear Boeckmann's cases in the Wynne division of Cross County, about 100 miles northeast of Arkansas, during the investigation. ||||| A Cross County judge accused by a state panel of abuse of authority and engaging in sexual relationships with male defendants has resigned from his post, effective immediately.      In a statement Monday, the state Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission announced the resignation of part-time District Judge Joseph Boeckmann Jr. of Wynne, marking the end of the panel's investigation.      “I further promise to never seek employment as a local, county or state employee or public servant in the State of Arkansas,” his resignation letter read.      Boeckmann sent the letter to the commission’s executive director, David Sachar, about 10:57 a.m. Monday morning. That letter, which did not include a detailed explanation behind his departure, was also copied to Gov. Asa Hutchinson.      Had Boeckmann not resigned Monday, Sachar said, the commission would have filed an amended complaint to include more specific conduct and additional alleged victims.      Among the additional evidence the commission said it had recently obtained were images of young men, many naked, “in various poses inside the judge’s home and outside in his yard.”      About 1,050 photos had been taken from the judge's computer, and the panel anticipated \\"receiving in excess of 3,400 more photographs very soon,\\" Sachar wrote in a letter dated Friday to the judge’s attorney, Jeff Rosenzweig.      “We identified many of the young men as those that your client [Boeckmann] had in front of him as defendants in Cross County District Court,\\" Sachar said.      Sachar called the discovery \\"a turning point\\" in the investigation. Friday's letter to Rosenzweig included an opportunity for Boeckmann to resign after the latest accusations, providing a response deadline of noon Monday.      “The lengthy, detailed analysis of some of the evidence that came out last week made a difference,\\" he said. \\"I also think there’s certain witnesses out there that came forward that were key.”      The commission's executive director said his office received a call Friday from Rosenzweig indicating that a letter dated Monday would be sent.      In November, the commission filed its initial complaint, which included allegations that the judge had broken 14 judicial ethics rules by offering young white men lenient rulings in court if they agreed to perform sexual favors. Boeckmann, represented by Rosenzweig, denied the allegations in December.      The commission added allegations in January that included the judge asking a teenager about being “paddled” and offering a defendant 300 if he posed nude, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette previously reported.      At least 12 alleged victims had been named, Sachar said, estimating that there were \\"several dozen more, if not 100 or more.\\" As part of its case, the state panel also filed a motion for evidence of past conduct, with the commission concluding that there was a pattern of alleged misconduct dating back to the 1970s.      No criminal charges have been filed against Boeckmann, and Sachar declined to comment on the possibility of such charges at a later date. He added that the commission's findings have been turned over to prosecutors for review.      An attempt to reach Rosenzweig for comment on behalf of the judge was not successful Monday afternoon.      Read Tuesday's Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for full details. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Former Arkansas district Judge Joe Boeckmann has resigned after allegations that he used his judicial authority for the past three decades to sexually exploit young men.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: Animals and some bacteria and fungi carry out lactic acid fermentation. Lactic acid is a waste product of this process. Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt. The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy.  Now, I have a new situation: A group of students in biology class studied fermentation. Team A studied alcoholic fermentation, while team B learned more about lactic fermentation. They later organised a trivia contest between teams.  Answer this question please: Which team studied less about bacteria?","output":"Team A studied less about bacteria since they focused on alcoholic fermentation. Alcoholic fermentation, also known as ethanol fermentation, is a process carried out primarily by yeasts and some other microorganisms, mostly involving the conversion of sugars to ethanol, carbon dioxide, and a small energy output. This type of fermentation is commonly used in the production of alcoholic beverages like beer, wine, and spirits; and also in the production of bread, which uses the carbon dioxide released in the process to make the dough rise. On the other hand, team B studied lactic acid fermentation, which is more closely associated with bacteria. Lactic acid fermentation is a process in which bacteria, and sometimes fungi or animal cells, convert glucose or other sugar molecules into lactic acid. In the case of bacteria, this process is used by various species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) like Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, etc., which have diverse applications in food production (such as cheese, yogurt, pickles, and sauerkraut) as well as in the human body, where some LAB species are part of our gut microbiome. Since team B's study topic of lactic acid fermentation involves a more in-depth exploration of bacteria and their roles in various processes, it is safe to say that team A, which focused on alcoholic fermentation, studied less about bacteria in comparison."},{"instruction":"A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the title of the song that peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100?, using the article: In July, two singles were issued on the Brother imprint: \\"Heroes and Villains\\" and \\"Gettin' Hungry\\". The former peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. The latter was not credited to the Beach Boys, but instead to Brian Wilson and Mike Love.  On September 18, 1967, Smiley Smile  was released in the US. The LP peaked at number 41 on the Billboard charts, making it their worst-selling album to that date. It spent most of its 21-week chart time bubbling under 100 and 197. When released in the UK in November, it performed better, reaching number 9 of the UK Albums Chart.Critics and fans were generally underwhelmed by the album and controversy involving whether the band was to be taken as a serious rock group ensued. A review in Hit Parader praised the album for \\"probably [having] more a cappella harmony than on any album since the fall of the singing-group era in the late 1950s\\", but that they \\"still like Pet Sounds better\\". NME wrote of the album: \\"By the standards which this group has set itself, it's more than a grade disappointing.\\" Hi Fidelity said: \\"... they are making the psychedelic route ... perhaps in the unforgettable city of Fresno. Until they reach the San Francisco Bay Bridge or return to the shores of Malibu ... their work can only receive partial approval.\\" Rolling Stone referred to it as a \\"disaster\\" and an \\"abortive attempt to match the talents of Lennon and McCartney.\\" On December 14, 1967, the magazine's editor and co-founder Jann Wenner printed an influential article that denounced Wilson's \\"genius\\" label, which he called a \\"promotional shuck\\", and the Beach Boys themselves, which he called \\"one prominent example of a group that has gotten hung up on trying to catch The Beatles\\". He wrote that \\"for some reason, [Smiley Smile] just doesn't make it ... [the songs] just don't move you. Other than displaying Brian Wilson's virtuosity for production, they are pointless.\\"The Milwaukee Sentinel praised the LP as \\"probably the most valuable contribution to rock since the Beatles Revolver\\" and..., what would be the answer ?

Please tell me if those questions are the same. Available options: i. no ii. yes","output":"Although both questions focus on the possibility of dinosaurs still existing today, they approach the topic from different angles and are thus not identical (i. no). To provide you with a better understanding, I will elaborate on both questions separately. 1. Are dinosaurs still alive in the African jungle today? Dinosaurs were a group of reptiles that dominated the Earth during the Mesozoic Era, around 66 million years ago. The majority of the dinosaur species went extinct due to various factors, such as volcanic eruptions, climate change, and an asteroid impact near the Yucatan Peninsula. While Africa is home to dense jungles, these environments cannot support the existence of prehistoric creatures such as dinosaurs. The flora and fauna of Africa have evolved over millions of years, and any remaining organisms from the time of the dinosaurs have adapted accordingly. None of the known species of dinosaurs exist in Africa today. In addition, archeological evidence, along with comprehensive study and research by scientists and paleontologists, has been unable to uncover any dinosaur populations still alive in Africa. Instead, they have discovered fossilized remains and signs of these ancient creatures' past existence. 2. Is it possible that dinosaurs are still alive, but humans don't know? The possibility of dinosaurs still existing somewhere on Earth while remaining undiscovered by humans is highly unlikely. Over the past centuries, scientists, researchers, and explorers have extensively studied the Earth's ecosystems, topography, and natural history. They've cataloged thousands of flora and fauna species, along with the remains of dinosaurs in various continents like Asia, North America, and Africa. It is important to note that the Earth has undergone significant ecological and geological changes since the time dinosaurs roamed the planet. These shifts would have disrupted the habitats and environmental resources necessary for dinosaurs to survive. Although some far-reaching corners of the Earth remain unexplored, the chances of finding undiscovered, live dinosaur populations seem extremely improbable considering the considerable advancements in scientific research and knowledge that humanity has achieved. However, it is important to point out that some ancient species, such as crocodiles and horseshoe crabs, have survived through the millennia and are considered \\"living fossils.\\" In this sense, although not dinosaurs themselves, these creatures may provide a glimpse into Earth's deep past. In conclusion, while the questions are related in exploring the hypothetical existence of dinosaurs in modern times, they are not the same. The first question is specific to the African jungle, whereas the second question refers to the potential existence of dinosaurs anywhere in the world, unknown to humans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Did you notice that the train has no wheels? How can a train have no wheels? It doesn't need wheels. It actually floats, or levitates, just above the track. Magnets enable the train to do this. This is not a normal train. This is a maglev train. The word maglev stands for magnetic levitation. Because it has no wheels, there is no friction. Some magnets hold the train up. Other magnets are used to move the train forward. This train can go very fast. It can reach speeds up to 480 kilometers (300 miles) per hour! Magnets are pretty cool. What exactly is a magnet? How is it able to exert such force?  Question: \\"How does the train work without wheels?\\" Answer: \\"It has wings\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"No, the answer \\"It has wings\\" is incorrect based on the provided paragraph.

Step 1: Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) related to e-commerce companies. These KPIs provide insight into the success of various aspects of the business, such as sales performance, customer engagement, and user experience. Some of the most important metrics for e-commerce companies include: a. Conversion rate: The percentage of visitors who complete a purchase. This metric helps assess the effectiveness of the user journey and sales funnel. b. Average order value (AOV): The average amount spent on each order. This metric helps determine pricing strategies and product offerings. c. Customer lifetime value (CLV): The estimated revenue a customer will generate during their lifetime as a customer. This metric helps guide customer acquisition and retention strategies. d. Shopping cart abandonment rate: The percentage of visitors who add items to their cart but do not complete the purchase. This metric helps identify areas for improvement in the checkout process. e. Bounce rate: The percentage of visitors who leave the website after viewing just one page. This metric helps assess the quality of website content and user experience. f. Traffic source: The various channels through which customers find and visit the website (e.g., organic search, social media, email marketing). This metric helps determine the effectiveness of marketing and advertising campaigns. 2. What are the most important features an E-commerce platform should have? Step 1: Identify key components and features that contribute to the effectiveness and functionality of an e-commerce platform. Some of the most important features that an e-commerce platform should have include: a. User-friendly design: An easy-to-navigate interface that simplifies the shopping experience for customers. b. Mobile responsiveness: The ability to adapt to different screen sizes and devices for a seamless browsing and shopping experience. c. Secure payment processing: A reliable and secure payment processing system that protects customer data and transactions. d. Inventory management: A robust system that tracks inventory levels, sales, and order fulfilment. e. Shipping and order tracking: Integrated shipping options and tracking capabilities to streamline order fulfilment and improve customer satisfaction. f. Marketing tools: Built-in features to support promotional campaigns, such as email marketing, retargeting, and search engine optimization (SEO). 3. Do those questions have the same meaning? Step 1: Analyze the differences in context and information provided by each question. The first question is asking about the most important metrics that e-commerce companies should track in order to measure their success and performance. These metrics pertain to the performance of the business as a whole. The second question is asking about specific features that an e-commerce platform should have in order to provide the optimal user experience and support the overall business operations. These features pertain to the technical aspects of the platform. Conclusion: While these questions are both related to e-commerce, they do not have the same meaning. The first question focuses on the performance metrics that can help companies assess their success, while the second question focuses on the desirable features in an e-commerce platform that would support business operations and customer experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It has been an integral part of Scottish culture since then, particularly in the Scottish Lowlands.  The sport's origins are attributed to the 16th century when it was played on frozen ponds and lochs during winter. Early games of curling, also known as \\"the roaring game\\" because of the sound the stone makes while sliding across the ice, involved stones with flattened bottoms and crude, natural handles. These stones varied greatly in size, with some of them even weighing up to 40 kilograms. The sport was typically played when farmers and villagers had more free time during the cold winter months. The first written evidence of curling dates back to 1541, where a Scottish notary recorded a challenge between a monk at Paisley Abbey and a relative of the abbott, based on an old legal document. When Scottish immigrants settled in other countries, they took the sport with them. That's why countries that have been heavily influenced by Scottish immigration such as Canada, the United States, New Zealand, and Australia have curling clubs and take an active part in the sport today.  In Scotland, the first curling clubs began to form in the early 18th century, which led to the standardisation of the stone's size and weight, eventually leading to the formation of the Grand Caledonian Curling Club, now known as the Royal Caledonian Curling Club, which remains the governing body for curling in Scotland. They first penned the official rules for the sport in 1838. The game continued to evolve and become more sophisticated. The introduction of refrigerated ice rinks meant the game no longer had to be reliant on cold winters, and this led to a boom in the sport's popularity.  Interestingly, curling was part of the inaugural Winter Olympic Games in Chamonix, France, in 1924. However, it was dropped from the main program after that and only showcased as a demonstration sport for several decades. Curling regained full medal status at the 1998 Winter Olympics held in Nagano, Japan, and has been a popular mainstay at the Winter Olympics ever since.  Today, the biggest force in curling is Canada, where the sport is immensely popular. Curling competitions, particularly the \\"Brier\\" and the women's \\"Tournament of Hearts\\", are some of Canada's most-watched sporting events. However, its Scottish origins will forever be etched in the history of the sport."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In fact, they move much more quickly than they should according to their size and the laws of physics. Scientists do not completely understand why the speed of these stars is so high. But many believe the reason is that much of the universe is made of something called \\"dark matter\\". Groups of stars called galaxies, such as the Milky Way, might even be made up of 90 percent dark matter. How much something weighs depends on where it is. The same object weighs only half as much on Mars as it does on Earth and almost three times as much on Jupiter. So scientists prefer to talk about the mass   of something rather than how much it weighs, because mass does not change. They can work out the mass of galaxies by measuring the distance between them and the speed they move at. Recently, Jorge Penarrubia, a senior academic at Edinburgh University, UK, and his team discovered something interesting: The mass of the Milky Way is only half as much as the mass of another nearby galaxy, Andromeda. This seems strange, and dark matter may explain why. Finding out more about dark matter could help us understand how the universe began, but this is not easy. Lots of scientists with different types of expert knowledge are working on the problem. We can't see dark matter, it's very difficult to measure and we can't find out its mass. Unlike stars, dark matter doesn't produce or reflect light. But we can make a good guess that it is there because of the way things move and the way light bends.

Becca is quickly befriended by many students at her new high school, including Jennifer (Anneliese van der Pol) but she is intrigued by the mysterious and aloof Edward Sullen (Matt Lanter), who perplexes her during their time in the biology class, despite thinking she smells of tuna.Later, Becca is nearly struck by a van in the school parking lot. Edward inexplicably moves from several feet away and stops the vehicle by thrusting another student in its path without any harm to himself or Becca (the other student is very badly injured). He later refuses to explain this act to Becca and warns her against befriending him. After much research, she tells Edward that she knows what he is, but reaches the wrong conclusion that he is a Jonas Brother. Edward corrects her, saying he is a vampire but that he only consumes animal blood, and shows her the shiny bling he wears under his clothes. The pair fall in love, and he introduces Becca to his vampire family on her birthday. While unwrapping a gift, Becca gets a paper cut, causing Edward's family to go into a blood frenzy and try to kill her before Edward fights them off. Realizing the danger that he and his family pose to Becca, Edward ends their relationship while saving her from the one of the three nomadic vampires who have been killing humans, Jack (Charlie Weber), by knocking his head off with a baseball bat. Jack's head flies through Sheriff Frank's car window, and he blames the Kardashians.Edward's departure leaves Becca heartbroken for months (and screaming for hours), and she discovers that thrill-seeking activities and attempted suicides evoke Edward's preserved image. She is also comforted by her deepening friendship with Jacob White (Christopher N. Riggi), the cheerful childhood friend who...

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Almost nothing we do in this world is done in isolation*. At work or at play, you'll find yourself in groups, working with other people: your team at work, a meeting with fellow workers, your family, a holiday with friends, a group of students working together, a group of neighbors wanting to make changes. It is now realized that being able to work successfully with other people is one of the main keys to success, partly because we need to do it so often. In almost every situation where you're in a group, you will need a skilled leader. All groups need leaders and all successful groups have good leaders. Groups without leaders or with weak leaders almost always break down. Members of a leaderless group often begin to feel disappointed and helpless. Time is wasted and the tasks are not achieved. There are often arguments and nervousness between people as there is nobody to keep the goals clear. Some people are natural leaders. The well-known cook, Antonio Carlucci says, \\"True leaders are born and you see them in kitchens.\\" They're people who are strong, fair, and humorous. Although a lot of people agree that there are some natural-born leaders, most people now know that leadership can also be taught. Experienced teachers can train almost anyone how to be a successful leader. Good leaders don't make people do things in a controlling way. You can learn how to join others, encouraging the whole group to work towards a common goal. Successful leaders also need to be calm and wise. They need to be able to work out good solutions and make perfect judgments* under pressure. Lastly, and probably most importantly, good leaders need to be sensitive*, confident and be able to get on well with different kinds of people. Question: Which of the following can be the best title for this passage? Options: A: How to be successful leaders B: Successful leaders C: Be natural leaders D: Be sensitive and confident Answer:","output":"A: How to be successful leaders Step-by-step justification: The passage discusses the importance of leadership in various group settings, highlighting the characteristics of natural-born leaders, the ability to teach leadership, and the qualities of successful leaders. The passage focuses on how one can work on becoming a successful leader by learning and embodying the necessary qualities.  Option A captures the essence of the passage as it emphasizes the process of becoming successful leaders, which is in line with the content discussed. On the other hand, options B, C, and D do not fully encompass the scope of the passage as they either focus solely on the traits of leaders (natural, sensitive, or confident) or just mention that they are successful without suggesting any development process or learning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Around Christmas last year, we were heading to Grandma's house. The drive was an hour long, so we had plenty of time to chat. We were waiting to get onto the freeway when my daughter Hayley noticed a homeless man, no sign in hand. \\"Mom, is that man homeless?\\" I told her I believed he was. We got onto the freeway and drove away. But the chatting had stopped. Hayley was quiet all the way there. We spent a few hours at Grandma's then packed up to head home. As we drove back, Hayley rustled  around in her seat, trying to reach something on the floor of the car. I asked her to sit still, worried her seatbelt would slip from the booster seat. She mumbled something and sat back. \\"Mom, will the homeless man still be outside tonight?\\" I told her I was not sure, maybe. It was a freezing night, and I started to think of the man now too, and how cold he must be. All of a sudden, as we got onto the freeway exit, Haley shrieked  : \\"There he is! There he is!\\" and started rolling down her window. \\"Mom, I found these gloves and scarf back here. Can I give them to him? Can I?\\" she asked. I pulled over to the edge of the road, and beckoned  the man to come over. Haley smiled at him and handed him her gift. I looked in the front passenger seat, loaded with leftovers from Grandma's house, and handed those out to him as well. The man thanked us, he clutched   my hand in his and I could feel the bitter cold of them. We wished him a safe night and continued on our journey to our warm home. \\"Haley, that was very sweet of you!\\" I told her. \\"Well, they were your gloves and scarf, Mom, but his hands looked colder, and he has to keep looking for his house!\\" We had talked about homelessness before , and I could hear myself telling her: \\"Someone who has lost their home.\\" She had taken my words literally and thought the man's home was like a lost puppy. On the ride home, and as I carried my sleeping angel into the house that night, my heart filled with gratitude. Question: The mother felt thankful because  _  .

How does the sentence end? See options at the end Patricia lived in Arizona and Victoria lived in Canada, so  Select from:  (1). Patricia never saw snow at Christmas..  (2). Victoria never saw snow at Christmas..","output":"Patricia lived in Arizona and Victoria lived in Canada, so Patricia never saw snow at Christmas. This difference in their Christmas experiences can be attributed to the distinct climates and geographical locations of Arizona and Canada.  Arizona, a state located in the southwestern region of the United States, is known for its desert climate. Most parts of the state experience mild temperatures and very little precipitation during the winter months. Due to its low elevation, Arizona rarely sees snowfall, which results in a warmer and drier Christmas season. While some areas of Arizona, such as Flagstaff or the White Mountains, do experience snowfall during the winter, the majority of the state remains snow-free, including metropolitan regions such as Phoenix and Tucson. Consequently, Patricia, who lives in Arizona, would not experience a white Christmas with snowfall, unlike her friend Victoria, who lives in Canada. Canada, situated in North America, is the second-largest country in the world in terms of land area. It boasts a diverse range of climates due to its sheer size and geographical position, from temperate rainforests on the west coast to subarctic and arctic tundras in the north. However, a significant portion of Canada experiences heavy snowfall during the winter months, as most of the country lies in the northern latitudes and has a continental climate. This results in cold winters with ample snowfall, often lasting from November to March, or even longer in some regions. Consequently, Christmas in Canada is often associated with picturesque snow-covered landscapes and winter sports such as skiing, snowboarding, and ice skating. In conclusion, Patricia, living in Arizona, never saw snow at Christmas due to the state's desert climate and infrequent snowfall. On the other hand, Victoria, living in Canada, was more likely to experience snowy Christmases due to the country's cold, continental climate and high probability of snowfall during the winter months. This highlights the variations in weather patterns and climate experienced by individuals living in different locations across the globe, which impacts their lifestyle, cultural practices, and holiday traditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The real-life scandals behind ‘Hail, Caesar!’ Christmas arrives on Friday for fans of classic Hollywood with Joel and Ethan Coen’s “Hail, Caesar!” which is loaded with (sometimes amusingly scrambled) references to Golden Age actors and their scandals. For those who don’t watch much Turner Classic Movies — shame on you! — here’s a road map (with some spoilers) to these insider references. One of several films within the film, “Hail, Caesar! A Tale of the Christ” is referred to as a remake. Since the action takes place at an MGM-like studio in the early 1950s, that would make it “Quo Vadis” (1951), to which “Hail, Caesar” bears plot similarities. But the film’s subtitle belongs to the silent version of “Ben-Hur” (1925), which was remade by MGM in 1959, with yet another version due this summer — and there’s a line of dialogue referring to the films’ famous chariot race. Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), The fatuous star of “Hail, Caesar!” who’s kidnapped by Communists and converted to their cause, appears to be the Coens’ joke at the expense of the right-leaning stars of both “Quo Vadis” and the 1959 “Ben-Hur.” The former starred Robert Taylor, who testified on Hollywood’s alleged infiltration by Communists before the House Un-American Activities Committee. And liberal-turned-conservative Charlton Heston won a Best Actor Oscar for “Ben-Hur.’’ Baird is also linked to Clark Gable by way of gossip about a gay affair early in his career cited as an explanation for why Gable supposedly had George Cukor, who was gay, fired as director of “Gone With the Wind.” Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum), the singing and dancing star of a homoerotic musical number spoofing the campy naval subtext of both “On the Town’’ (1949) and “Anchors Aweigh’’ (1945) is clearly based on Gene Kelly, who in real life was straight. That Burt is eventually revealed as a Communist agent is another inside joke: Along with other liberal Hollywood stars, including Danny Kaye, Kelly went to Washington as a member of the Committee for the First Amendment to protest the Hollywood blacklist. Despite an FBI file that linked him to organizations identified as Communist fronts, Kelly was never blacklisted. But his then-wife, Betsy Blair, was, until Kelly used his clout with MGM to get her cast in “Marty” (1955). DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) is not only based on MGM’s synchronized swimming superstar Esther Williams, but “Hail, Caesar!” contains a scaled-down re-creation of one of Williams’ most famous numbers, which Busby Berkeley directed for “Million Dollar Mermaid” (1952) and which included a 115-foot dive that broke Williams’ neck. But DeeAnna’s scandal — a plot to secretly adopt the child she had while unmarried — belongs to Loretta Young. Her adopted daughter, Judy Lewis, revealed in a memoir she was conceived as the result of an affair between her mother and Clark Gable, but members of her family recently said that Young claimed before her death that it was actually date rape. Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich): The singing cowboy who’s thrust into a drawing-room comedy and set up by the studio on a date with a Carmen Miranda-like singer-comedienne seems to be an amalgam of MGM’s Howard Keel, Warners’ Dick Foran and RKO’s James Ellison and Tim Holt. Ellison, a sidekick in the early episodes of the Hopalong Cassidy western series, sang briefly during the finale of Berkeley’s “The Gang’s All Here,” which starred Miranda. Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes): Hobie’s flamboyant, exasperated director seems partially a nod to MGM mainstay Vincente Minnelli, father of Liza, who directed his then-wife Judy Garland in “Meet Me in St. Louis” (1944). But the ’30s-style black-and-white comedy Laurentz is directing (whose leading lady resembles Deborah Kerr) seems much more like a mashup of Minnelli and Cukor, who directed Kelly’s last MGM musical, “Les Girls’’ (1957). Though, the director’s gay gossip about Clooney’s character points straight to Cukor, film historians believe he was actually replaced on “Gone With the Wind’’ because producer David O. Selznick was unhappy with his focus on the female stars, and because the film was far behind schedule. Cukor also has an unusual link to one to one of the other models for Clooney’s character — a building on the former MGM lot that was named for Robert Taylor was renamed for Cukor by current owner Sony because of Taylor’s support for the blacklist. Cukor directed Taylor and Greta Garbo in “Camille’’ (1936), which was edited by longtime MGM editor Margaret Booth — the inspiration for Frances McDormand’s briefly-seen character in “Hail, Caesar!” What was this article about?","output":"This article is about the movie \\"Hail, Caesar!\\", which contains many references to the Golden Age of Hollywood and to some scandals of that time.

Putting forward a realistic proposal requires making some uncomfortable, possibly politically damaging choices that opponents can try to exploit. It's not surprising, then, that only four of the 15 current candidates have advanced anything more than a basic outline of how they'd reform the tax code. And even those four plans leave a lot to the imagination. Here's a closer look at what the candidates are selling. His plan One of the former Florida governor's favourite lines on the campaign trail is that he'll be the president whose tax reform boosts annual US economic growth to 4%, from its current sub-2% levels. (We're still waiting for a savvy competitor do him one better and tout a 5% plan.) Mr Bush wants to reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three, with a top rate dropping from 39.6% to 28%. He'd eliminate the estate tax and double the standard deduction (used by those who don't itemise their tax deductions), which would effectively increase the number of Americans in lower incomes paying no federal income taxes whatsoever. Several popular deductions, for home mortgage interest and medical expenses, would be capped, and filers would no longer be able to deduct state and local taxes. The \\"carried interest\\" deduction, much loved by billionaire hedge-fund managers, would be eliminated. The alternate minimum tax, which applies to wealthier earners who take sizeable deductions, would be out. Older workers who reach full retirement age would not be required to pay Social Security payroll taxes. US corporations would also get in on the fun, with their tax rate dropping from 35% to 20%. Overseas earnings wouldn't be taxed, but Mr Bush would exact a one-time levy of up to 8.75% on existing deferred foreign income. What's the catch? Getting rid of the state and local tax write-off will hurt residents of high-tax places like New York and California, but Mr Bush seems to have little sympathy for the plight of those in big-government states. His plan Despite a lot of talk about unveiling a groundbreaking new tax plan, the unconventional candidate's proposal is quite traditional by Republican standards. The New York billionaire would reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to four, with a top rate of 25%. Individual filers earning under 25,000 [Â£16,000] would pay no income taxes - although, in a bit of Trumpian dramatic flair, they'd have to file a piece of paper that tells the IRS, \\"I win\\". The corporate tax rate would drop from 35% to 15%, and capital gains would move from 23.8% to 20% (or lower based on income levels). Some loopholes would be closed, including the \\"carried interest\\" break. The end result, however, is that the extremely wealthy would likely end up paying less. The 2.1 trillion [Â£1.39 trillion] in overseas cash reserves of US companies would be subject a one-time 10% tax, at which point they could bring the money back into the US. Foreign earnings would continue to be taxed, and Mr Trump would end the ability to defer those tax payments. Trump also would do away with the estate tax and the alternate minimum tax. If all of this looks a bit familiar, that's because it's basically a more aggressive version of Mr Bush's tax plan. \\"It almost looks as if Trump simply looked at Bush's plan, then slashed all the rates a little further - or, you know, classed it up a bit,\\" quips Slate's Jordan Weissmann. What's the catch? Increasing the number of Americans who pay no income taxes - \\"takers\\" not \\"makers\\", as former Republican vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan once said - may rub some conservatives the wrong way. His plan If Mr Trump's tax plan is well within the bounds of Republican orthodoxy, the Florida senator's proposal - which he devised in 2014 along with Utah Senator Mike Lee - actually is a bit of an outlier. Mr Rubio's top tax rate drops only to 35% for individual income over 75,000 - which could actually increase the marginal tax rate for some middle-class filers. Income below that would be taxed at 15%. The per-child tax credit would be raised from 1,000 to 2,500, with the existing phase-out for high earners ended. Taxpayers would no longer choose between taking a standard deduction or itemising their taxes - they'd receive a 2,000 personal credit, and every filer would be allowed to take deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable contributions. All other itemised deductions would be eliminated, as would the alternate minimum tax. The Florida senator would cut the corporate tax rate to 25% and, like Mr Bush, he'd end the tax on overseas earnings after exacting a 6% repatriation tax. He'd also cut the tax on capital gains to zero - which neither Mr Trump nor Mr Bush suggests. What's the catch? If Mr Rubio keeps rising in the polls, those attack adverts targeting his 35% top rate will practically write themselves. His plan \\"Hey, I'm Rand Paul, and I'm trying to kill the tax code.\\" Thus begins the memorable YouTube video in which the Kentucky senator sets about destroying 70,000 pages of tax rules, regulations and related legal opinions with fire, a woodchipper and finally a chainsaw - all set to Jimmy Hendrix's electric guitar rendition of the US national anthem. Mr Paul was trying to draw attention to his plan to replace the existing tax structure with a 14.5% flat tax on all personal income and 14.5% value-added tax. He'd do away with other corporate, personal, payroll, excise and estate taxes entirely and exempt the first 50,000 of all earned income. The senator would keep a few of those prized loopholes for middle-class Americans, however, such as deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable donations, earned-income and child credits, and tax-exemption for work-provided health plan premium payments. \\"I'm telling you, this is erotic, it is so good,\\" said conservative gadfly Glenn Beck. According to the conservative Tax Foundation policy organisation, roughly 3 trillion in taxes would be cut over 10 years, which Mr Paul says he will balance out through spending cuts and increased revenue from the economic growth his plan would generate. What's the catch? Critics will argue that a flat tax with plenty of choice loopholes isn't much of a flat tax at all. What about the other eleventy-billion candidates running for the Republican nomination, you ask. Don't they have plans, too? Sure. Kind of. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie spelled out his tax plan in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece. He'd cut the corporate tax rate to 25%, set a top personal rate of 28%, reduce the number of brackets to three and do away with all itemised deductions except mortgage interest and charitable donations. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson has repeatedly asserted that a progressive income tax structure - which, by the way, the US has used for over 100 years - is socialism. He recommends a 10% flat tax he says is drawn from the biblical concept of tithing. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee has endorsed the FairTax plan, which replaces all income and corporate taxes with a 23% federal sales tax. Every taxpayer would receive a monthly \\"prebate\\" cheque covering the taxes assessed on basic necessities. Senator Ted Cruz wants to \\"abolish the IRS\\" by implementing what he calls a simple flat tax, although the details of such a plan still solely reside in the Texan's head. What's the catch? Plans that are unrealistic, unworkable or totally off-the-wall can often look good when they're reduced to one or two-sentence soundbites. Candidates in (and out of) the Republican presidential field","output":"Tax reform is a complex and contentious issue in American politics, and only a few of the current Republican presidential candidates have put forward concrete proposals for reforming the tax code.

Jeb Bush's plan aims to reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three, decrease the top rate from 39.6% to 28%, eliminate the estate tax, and double the standard deduction. He also proposes capping several popular deductions, eliminating the \\"carried interest\\" deduction, and abolishing the alternate minimum tax. For corporations, the tax rate would drop from 35% to 20%. Donald Trump's proposal largely mirrors Bush's, but with slightly more aggressive rate cuts. He would reduce the number of tax brackets to four, with a top rate of 25%, lower the corporate tax rate to 15%, and cut capital gains rates from 23.8% to 20%. Trump would also eliminate the estate tax, alternate minimum tax, and close some loopholes, including the \\"carried interest\\" break. Marco Rubio has devised a plan to drop the top tax rate to 35% for individual income over 75,000, while income below that would be taxed at 15%. Additionally, he wants to raise the per-child tax credit from 1,000 to 2,500 and effectively simplify deductions. Rubio also proposes cutting the corporate tax rate to 25% and eliminating the tax on overseas earnings. Lastly, Rand Paul proposes a 14.5% flat tax on all personal income, paired with a 14.5% value-added tax. He plans to do away with other corporate, personal, payroll, excise, and estate taxes entirely while keeping certain deductions. According to the conservative Tax Foundation, these changes would cut roughly 3 trillion in taxes over 10 years. Each of these candidates' plans presents potential economic and political challenges. Critics argue that these proposals may disproportionately benefit the wealthy, create unforeseen budget shortfalls, or lead to further complications in the tax code. The success of these tax reform proposals will likely depend on the candidates' ability to navigate these challenges and build consensus among political opponents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: The most important step in sobering up after drinking is to stop drinking. The moment you feel like you've had enough, or too much, stop drinking anything with alcohol in it. This will allow your body to process what you've already consumed and start the process of sobering up.  Don't try to taper off your drinking or switch to less alcoholic drinks. Stop entirely if you are too drunk. Don't let anyone pressure you into drinking more than you are comfortable with. If you feel like you need to vomit, don't fight the urge. Throwing up is your body's natural response to alcohol poisoning. Vomiting can also help remove whatever alcohol is left unprocessed in your stomach and can help you to recover more quickly. If you feel the urge to vomit, allow yourself to do so. If you are able to do so, eating something after heavy drinking can help you to sober up. Eating while drinking is always a good idea and can help your body process the alcohol at a slower pace. Having a meal or something to eat will help keep your head a bit more clear than if you had gone without eating.  It's unclear which foods are best. Try eating whatever you are in the mood for. Eating anything at all will help you to sober up faster. Drinking water after drinking alcohol can help lessen the inebriating effects of alcohol and help you to sober up. Drinking more water will have an effect on how much alcohol is present in your bloodstream and may help you to process alcohol faster by increasing the amount you urinate. Never neglect drinking water when you are trying to sober up.  It's a good idea to try and drink a glass of water for every alcoholic drink you consume. Alcohol has a dehydrating effect on the body. Drinking water will help you stay hydrated. Moving can help give you something to focus on and help you process the alcohol slightly faster than normal. By getting in some physical activity, you will increase the amount you are perspiring, which can remove some alcohol from your system. Try to do some simple exercise or activity that keeps you moving in order to stay focused and sober up.  You might try dancing to help you sober up. Going for a brisk walk can help you stay focused while you sober up. There isn't a surefire way to sober up faster than your body is able to process the alcohol you've consumed. The only proven way to sober up is to wait for your body to fully remove the alcohol from your bloodstream. Although you can take steps to help the process, you will still need to wait around one hour for every drink you've had before you reach sobriety again.  Don't attempt to drive before you are fully sober again. Each drink takes about one hour to be processed. Summary:","output":"If you drink too much, the best way to sober up is to stop drinking. When you stop, your body can work to get rid of the alcohol. If you feel sick, it's okay to throw up because it can help you feel better. Eating and drinking water can also help you sober up. Moving around, like dancing or walking, can help too. But remember, it takes time for your body to clear out the alcohol, about one hour for each drink. So don't try to drive before you're fully sober."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

On Snapchat, someone blocked me, but still shows up in my added me section, but Snapchat still won't allow me to add them. What’s going on?","output":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning, as they address different situations and concerns on Snapchat. Let’s discuss each question in detail. Question 1: On Snapchat, if I remove someone as a friend, can they still see the last message I sent them? This question focuses on understanding the visibility of sent messages after unfriending someone on Snapchat. The answer depends on the specific circumstances. If you sent the message while you were friends with the recipient and they have already opened it, then they can still see the message even if you remove them as a friend. This is because, once a message is opened in a chat, it remains visible for a short while (unless saved in chat) before disappearing automatically. However, if you send a message to someone, then remove them as a friend before they open the message, the message will disappear from their chat. In this situation, the recipient will not be able to view the last message you sent after you remove them from your friends list. Question 2: On Snapchat, someone blocked me, but still shows up in my added me section, but Snapchat still won't allow me to add them. What’s going on? This question is about a user being blocked on Snapchat and tries to understand the reason behind the situation where the blocker still appears in the \\"added me\\" section but cannot be added back. When someone blocks you on Snapchat, you typically lose the ability to communicate with them, view their snaps, and access their stories. However, due to some technical glitches or delays in updating Snapchat servers, the blocker's profile may still be visible in your \\"added me\\" section temporarily until it eventually gets removed or updated. Alternatively, if the user has not completely blocked you but rather removed you as a friend, their profile may still be visible in the \\"added me\\" section. In this case, you may be unable to add them back as they might have changed their privacy settings. Their profile may only allow friends to add them or they could have enabled the \\"Quick Add\\" feature, which enables mutual friends to discover and add them. In summary, the two questions are addressing different situations. The first question is related to the visibility of messages after unfriending someone, whereas the second question is about understanding the situation when a user is blocked or removed on Snapchat but still appears in the \\"added me\\" section."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: I used to think of myself as a person learned in books, but my bookshelves told a different story. Apart from a few Indian novels and an Australian book, my literature collection only consisted of British and American titles. Worse still, I couldn't ever found anything in translation. My reading was limited to stories by English-speaking authors. So, at the start of 2012, I set myself the challenge of trying to read a book from every country in a year to find out what I was missing. With no idea where to get those books, I was unlikely to find publications from nearly 200 nations on the shelves of my local bookshop, so I decided to ask the readers all over the world for help. I created a blog called A Year of Reading the World and put out an appeal for suggestions of titles that I could read in English. The response was amazing. People all over the world were getting in touch with me, offering ideas and book lists. Some posted me books from their home countries. In addition, several writers, like Turkmenistan's Ak Welsapar and Panama's Juan David Morgan, sent me unpublished translations of their novels, giving me a rare opportunity to read works unavailable in Britain. Even with such an extraordinary team of bibliophiles  behind me, however, sourcing books was no easy task. With translations making up only around 4.5 per cent of literary works published in the UK, getting English versions of stories was tricky. One by one, the books from the countries on the list filled my heart with laughter, love, anger, hope and fear. Lands that had once seemed exotic and remote became close and familiar to me. At its best, I learned, reading makes the world real.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What society did the man who had poor command of the Czech language become chorus master of after returning from Sweden? , can you please find it?   In 1861, it was announced that a Provisional Theatre would be built in Prague, as a home for Czech opera. Smetana saw this as an opportunity to write and stage opera that would reflect Czech national character, similar to the portrayals of Russian life in Mikhail Glinka's operas. He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre's conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Maýr, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a \\"dangerous modernist\\", in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner. Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by Count Jan von Harrach, which offered prizes of 600 gulden each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture. With no useful model on which to base his work—Czech opera as a genre scarcely existed—Smetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist, and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by Otto of Brandenburg. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of The Brandenburgers in Bohemia. At this stage in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech language was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point of writing and speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper... Answer:","output":"The man with initially poor command of the Czech language who became the chorus master of the Hlahol Choral Society after returning from Sweden was Smetana.  The process of finding the answer was primarily about identifying key words and phrases in the question and then locating these in the article. The main clues were \\"poor command of the Czech language\\", \\"chorus master\\", and \\"after returning from Sweden\\". Once these were found in the text, it was a matter of reading the context to identify the person, Smetana. This inference is made based on the following: 1. Smetana's initial struggles with the Czech language: \\"At this stage in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech language was poor.\\" 2. His appointment as chorus master: \\"He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden...\\" Thus, from aligning the details from the text with the question, Smetana is identified as the person being referred to who fulfilled the given conditions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the name of the record company that reissued the album?, using the article: Ride the Lightning is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on July 27, 1984, by the independent record label Megaforce Records. The album was recorded in three weeks with producer Flemming Rasmussen at the Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an electric chair being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand. Although rooted in the thrash metal genre, the album showcased the band's musical growth and lyrical sophistication. This was partly because bassist Cliff Burton introduced the basics of music theory to the rest of the band and had more input in the songwriting. Instead of relying strictly on fast tempos as on its debut Kill 'Em All, Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label Music for Nations because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It was the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, and the first to feature contributions from his replacement, Kirk Hammett. Ride the Lightning received positive response from music critics, who saw it as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor. Metallica promoted the album on the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour in late 1984, and on its North American leg in the first half of 1985. The band performed at major music festivals such as Monsters of Rock and Day on the Green later that year. Two months after its release, Elektra Records signed Metallica to a multi-year deal and reissued the album. Ride the Lightning peaked at number 100 on the Billboard 200 with no radio exposure. Although 75,000 copies were initially pressed for the American market, the album sold half a million by November 1987.

Answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: Some might say that if you want to do something that results in changing society then you need to start from within, to do this what would you be doing? Possible A: riots, vote, change yourself, social activism, change clothes  Why is \\"change yourself\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Change yourself\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons, reflecting the understanding that meaningful and lasting societal change often starts with personal transformation and growth. When individuals commit to making changes in their own lives, it can create a ripple effect that inspires others to follow suit, ultimately influencing society as a whole. The concept of starting from within emphasizes the importance of taking responsibility for one's actions and understanding the role each person plays in shaping their community. Below are some of the reasons why \\"change yourself\\" represents a common-sense approach to effecting societal change: 1. Personal responsibility: Acknowledging that each person has a role to play in creating and sustaining societal norms means taking responsibility for one's actions and beliefs. Changing oneself involves recognizing and confronting personal biases, prejudices, and negative habits that may contribute to societal problems. By committing to self-improvement, individuals can become more empathetic and compassionate, fostering an environment that encourages and supports positive change. 2. Leading by example: When people witness others taking steps to improve themselves or engage in actions aimed at bettering society, they are more likely to be inspired to do the same. This \\"leading by example\\" approach promotes the idea that individual changes can contribute to collective transformations. Moreover, it also encourages building empathic connections and fostering an environment where growth and self-improvement are valued and supported. 3. Empowerment: Changing oneself allows individuals to feel more empowered and in control of their lives. This sense of self-efficacy promotes confidence and resilience, making people more likely to pursue further personal growth and participate in collective efforts towards societal change. People who feel that they have the power to effect change are more likely to be proactive, work together, and seek long-term solutions to problems. 4. Sustainable change: While other methods, such as riots and social activism, can bring about immediate change, focusing on personal transformation helps create a foundation for more sustainable and long-lasting progress. By changing their attitudes, beliefs, and habits, individuals can reshape their actions and influence the world around them continuously. This ongoing process of personal development helps build a society that is better equipped to navigate challenges and adapt to new circumstances. 5. Change starts with self-awareness: Personal change begins with self-awareness, which involves recognizing one's strengths, weaknesses, values, and beliefs. By being honest with oneself and working to understand the impact of one's behavior and choices, individuals can identify areas that need improvement and take steps to address them. In this way, the process of changing oneself supports the development of emotional intelligence and critical thinking skills that are essential to navigating complex societal issues and fostering meaningful change. In conclusion, \\"change yourself\\" represents a common-sense approach to creating societal change because it emphasizes the importance of personal responsibility, leading by example, empowerment, sustainable progress, and self-awareness. By recognizing the role each person plays in shaping society and taking steps to address personal biases, habits, and beliefs, individuals can inspire others to join them in making positive changes that ultimately benefit everyone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I know enough now to throw this back in Peter Jackson/New Line's face.I can't believe their marketing department is this stupid!Waiting for the extended release. Is this product review negative? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the product review is indeed negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment and frustration towards the marketing strategies used by Peter Jackson/New Line, comparing their experience with being \\"burned\\" by George Lucas in the past. They also use strong language like \\"shame on me\\" and \\"I can't believe their marketing department is this stupid!\\" to emphasize their dissatisfaction with the situation. Furthermore, the reviewer has decided to \\"throw this back in Peter Jackson/New Line's face\\" and wait for the extended release instead, which demonstrates a lack of trust and support for the current product version. This reaction suggests that the reviewer feels manipulated or taken advantage of and, as a result, is unwilling to engage with or endorse this product. In conclusion, the review is negative because it conveys the disappointment and distrust of the reviewer towards the company and its marketing techniques. The reviewer's choice to wait for an extended release also implies dissatisfaction with the current product offering."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He was the third of twelve children of Leva Mae (nee Stewart) and Charles \\"Bud\\" Penniman. His father was a church deacon who sold bootlegged moonshine on the side and owned a nightclub, the Tip In Inn. Little Richard stated that as a child, he only played with girls and felt feminine, which was the source of jokes and homophobic ridicule at his expense. Caught wearing his mother's makeup and wardrobe at times, he was brutally punished by his father. He began having sexual encounters with boys by his teen years and also occasionally had sex with older women. Because of his effeminate mannerisms, his father kicked him out of their family home at 15. As Richard later explained in 2010, \\"my daddy put me out of the house. He said he wanted seven boys, and I had spoiled it, because I was gay.\\" He first became involved in voyeurism in his early twenties, when a female friend would drive him around and pick up men who would allow him to watch them have sex in the backseat of cars. He was once arrested after a gas station attendant in Macon reported sexual activity in a car occupied by Little Richard and a couple. Cited on a sexual misconduct charge, he spent three days in jail and was temporarily banned from performing in Macon, Georgia.  During the early 1950s, Little Richard had appeared as a drag performer in various burlesque shows. By the time he entered the Chitlin' Circuit, he began using makeup regularly, influenced by Billy Wright, who recommended his brand of makeup to him, Pancake 31. Later, as he began experiencing success in the mid-1950s, he made members of his band use makeup as a means to gain entry into white clubs during performances. He later told a columnist, \\"I wore the make-up so that white men wouldn't think I was after the white girls. It made things easier for me, plus it was colorful too.\\" In 2000, Richard told Jet magazine, \\"I figure if being called a sissy would make me famous, let them say what they want to.\\" Though he was gay, Little Richard recalled female fans sending him naked photos and their phone numbers.  While attending Oakwood College, Richard recalled a male student exposed himself to him. After the incident was reported to the student's father, Little Richard withdrew from the college. In 1962, he was again arrested after he was caught spying on men urinating at men's toilets at a Trailways bus station in Long Beach, California. Richard returned to participating in sexual orgies after his return to secular music in the 1960s. In 1984, while he claimed homosexuality was \\"unnatural\\" and \\"contagious\\", he would tell Charles White that he was \\"omnisexual\\" after he was asked about his sex life. In 1995, Little Richard told Penthouse that he always knew he was gay, saying \\"I've been gay all my life\\". In 2007, Mojo Magazine referred to Little Richard as \\"bisexual\\". Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did he dress feminine as a child?","output":"Yes, Little Richard dressed feminine as a child.

OPTIONS: A). no. B). yes. The answer is:","output":"A). no. The two questions, although similar in nature, are different as they are asking for distinct information. The first question, \\"What is your favourite dish?\\" is a broad inquiry about one's preferred meal without specifying the origin or type of dish.

For instance, if their favourite dish is sushi, they would mention that without considering whether it is an English dish or not. The second question, \\"What are your favourite English dishes?\\" specifically asks for a list of favourite dishes that originate from English cuisine. The focus here is on choices from English culinary traditions, and it requires the person to think about multiple dishes from that category. Examples of English dishes could be fish and chips, bangers and mash, or shepherd's pie, and the person would select their favourites among these and other English options.

Process: - Dead organic material accumulates on the bottom of oceans, riverbeds or swamps, mixing with mud and sand - Over time, more sediment piles on top - The resulting heat and pressure transforms the organic layer into a dark and waxy substance known as kerogen - Left alone, the kerogen molecules eventually crack - The molecules break up into shorter and lighter molecules composed almost solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms - It will turn into either petroleum or natural gas -   Question: suppose less coal is crushed happens, how will it affect more kerogen occurs.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"If less coal is crushed, it means there is less external intervention in the coal formation process. However, the formation of kerogen is mainly affected by the accumulation of dead organic material and the subsequent application of heat and pressure due to sediment buildup. The crushing of coal does not play a direct role in the formation of kerogen. Therefore, if less coal is crushed, it will likely have no effect on the occurrence of more kerogen. Similarly, the perturbation does not influence the second effect mentioned (the transformation of the organic layer into kerogen) as it is not directly related to the kerogen formation process."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Process:  - Wind passes the turbines and moves the blades - The shaft of the turbine spins - Shaft is connected to a generator - The generator uses the spins of the shaft to rotate a rotor - The rotor spins inside the core, which has magnets inside surrounded by wire loops inside - The spinning of the rotor in the core generates electricity -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more structure obstructions happens, how will it affect MORE electricity being generated.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The proposed perturbation of more structure obstructions would generally negatively impact the wind turbine's ability to generate electricity. Here's why: The primary source of energy for a wind turbine is the wind itself. Obstructions can alter wind flow, either by decreasing its speed, its steadiness, or its directionality. These alterations can have the following effects: 1. Decreased Wind Speed: The lower the wind speed, the less energy it has to transfer to the turbine blades. This would correspond to a drop in electricity generation. 2. Reduced Steadiness: Variable wind speeds can lead to mechanical stress on the turbine components. This can cause more frequent periods of downtime for maintenance, thus reducing the total amount of time the turbine is operational and generating power. 3. Altered Direction: Consistent wind direction is important for maximum efficiency in traditional wind turbines. If obstructions cause the wind direction to change frequently, the turbine might not be able to adjust quickly enough to ensure optimal alignment. This could also result in reduced power output. Thus, the introduction of more obstructions in the wind's path would likely hinder the process rather than aid in generating more electricity from a wind turbine. However, it's important to note that certain innovations like vertical wind turbines can somewhat mitigate these problems, but even they see reduced power generation with inconsistent or obstructed wind."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We live in a society that is producing and using electronics  all the time. It is often cheaper to buy new products than to repair old ones. Also, through clever advertising, companies always encourage people to change their old TVs, mobile phones and computers for the latest models. E-waste is created when we throw away old ones. In the EU alone, about 8,700,000 tons of e-waste is produced each year. Sadly, just over 1,000,000 tons is recycled. Burying  e-waste or burning it cause serious problems for the environment. Electronics have dangerous things in them. These things can then get into the ground or pollute the air when they are burnt. In recent years,  _ . However, their plans are not always managed properly. Sometimes electronics are just sent to poor countries such as Ghana. Here they are often burnt in public areas, which is very bad for people's health. Setting up recycling centers is a good way to solve this problem. E-cycling centers could recycle the parts that can be reused and deal with the rest properly. Another way is to make producers responsible  for their used products. This means that producers must take back old products which are no longer wanted. They should then make sure _ are properly recycled or reused. As for us, we should try to cut down on e-waste. Change electronics only when we have to. And don't buy a product just to have the latest model. E-waste is a serious problem in the modern world.

Movie title: Transformers Context: Several thousand years ago, the planet Cybertron was consumed by a civil war by the two Transformer factions, the Autobots led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons led by Megatron. Optimus jettisoned the AllSpark, a mystical artifact that brings life to the planet, into space, but Megatron pursued it. Megatron crashed in the Arctic Circle and froze, and was discovered in 1895 by explorer Archibald Witwicky. Witwicky activated Megatronâs navigational system, which scanned the AllSparkâs coordinates into his glasses. The glasses end up in the possession of his great-great-grandson Sam Witwicky. In the present, Sam buys his first car, a rusting Chevrolet Camaro, but discovers it has a life of its own. In modern Qatar, Blackout attacks and destroys a United States military base in a failed attempt to hack the military network to find information on Megatron and the AllSpark. A team of soldiers led by Captain William Lennox escape across the desert, pursued by Blackoutâs drone Scorponok. They fight Scorponok off, aided by aerial reinforcements and travel home with Scorponokâs stinger, discovering sabot rounds damaged the armor. At the Pentagon, Secretary of Defense John Keller leads the investigation into the attack. Sound analyst Maggie Madsen catches another Decepticon, Frenzy, hacking into the network while onboard Air Force One.

Just like when you have new friends at school, you promise to play together and take care of each other, the people near the English Channel were ready to lend a hand whenever bad things happened to people in the water. In the end, we don't know what will happen to the passengers of the private airplane, but we know many people tried their best to help. It just goes to show that sometimes, even planes can have accidents too. But, when we see someone in need of help, we should always try to lend a hand, just like the helpful people who went out to search for the passengers in the English Channel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt. The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy.  Please answer this question : Which team studied more about bacteria? A:","output":"Team B studied more about bacteria, as they focused on lactic fermentation. Lactic acid fermentation is primarily carried out by certain bacteria, as well as some fungi and animals. In various food production processes like cheese and yogurt manufacturing, lactic acid-producing bacteria are employed. The lactic acid generated during fermentation causes milk proteins to thicken, creating the desired texture in these products.

Answer:","output":"The answer to the question \\"Separationists were noted to have express what kind of traits?\\" can be found in J. Brent Walker's response to Hamburger's claims. According to Walker, the separation of church and state has been supported by some who exhibited an anti-Catholic animus or a secularist bent. However, he emphasizes that champions of religious liberty have argued for the separation of church and state for reasons not related to anti-Catholicism or the desire for a secular culture. He also notes that separationists have opposed the Catholic Church when it has sought public funding for its parochial schools or on-campus released time in public schools, but this principled debate does not support a charge of religious bigotry.  In summary, the traits expressed by separationists, as noted by Walker, include: 1. Anti-Catholic animus: Some separationists have been known to express a dislike or opposition towards the Catholic Church, which may have influenced their support for the separation of church and state. However, Walker argues that this does not necessarily impugn the validity of the principle. 2. Secularist bent: Some separationists have supported the separation of church and state due to a desire for a secular culture, where religion and religious institutions have no influence on the government and its policies. 3. Champions of religious liberty: Many separationists have argued for the separation of church and state based on a belief in religious freedom and the need to protect the rights of individuals and religious groups from government interference or favoritism. 4. Principled debate on church-state issues: Separationists have been engaged in ongoing debates with religious institutions, such as the Catholic Church, on issues related to public funding and religious practices in public schools. Walker argues that these debates do not necessarily suggest bigotry or prejudice, but rather represent a legitimate and principled disagreement on the proper role of religion in public life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: Nadezhda Popova, a Soviet aviator who became one of the most celebrated of the so-called “Night Witches,” female military pilots who terrorized the Nazi enemy with their nocturnal air raids during World War II, died July 8. She was 91.      Her death was reported by the London Daily Telegraph. The place and cause could not immediately be confirmed. In a statement, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych called Ms. Popova’s life “an example of selfless service to Motherland.” Her “feats in the course of the Great Patriotic War,” he said, “will never be forgotten.”      Ms. Popova was among the first female pilots to volunteer for service in the Soviet military during World War II and became a squadron commander in her swashbuckling all-female regiment. She flew 852 combat missions — including 18 during one night — and was honored as a Hero of the Soviet Union, one of the nation’s highest decorations.      Like American women in the age of Amelia Earhart, many Soviet women had become enchanted with aviation in the 1930s. They were initially rejected for combat service during World War II, but Soviet leader Joseph Stalin thought better of the decision in 1941, when Germany broke the Soviet-German nonaggression pact and invaded.      Led by Marina Raskova, a renowned aviator who would later die in a plane crash, three women’s regiments were born of necessity. While other nations employed female pilots largely in support roles, the Soviets dispatched their female aviators on delivery and reconnaissance missions, as well as daring raids to take out enemy targets. Treated in many respects like their male colleagues, the women did, however, receive larger soap rations.      Nadezhda Popova (Courtesy of Albert Axell)      Ms. Popova served with the night bombers, perhaps the most feared of the three women’s regiments. Their planes, rickety two-seaters made of plywood and canvas, were jerry-rigged as bombers.      The pilots achieved a degree of surprise by shutting down their engines in the last stages of their bomb runs; the Germans heard only the hiss of the air flowing across their wings and, likening the sound to that of a broomstick in flight, referred to the women as Night Witches.      “The Germans spread stories that we were given special injections and pills which gave us a feline’s perfect vision at night,” Ms. Popova told Albert Axell, a historian, in an interview for his book “Greatest Russian War Stories, 1941-1945.” “This was nonsense, of course,” she continued. “What we did have were clever, educated, very talented girls.”      They women generally ranged in age from 17 to 26. Ms. Popova was 19 when she joined the pilots and became “one of the best, and one of the luckiest,” according to the Moscow Times.      “When the wind was strong it would toss the plane. In winter when you’d look out to see your target better, you got frostbite, our feet froze in our boots, but we carried on flying,” she said. “If you give up nothing is done and you are not a hero. Those who gave in were gunned down and they were burned alive in their craft as they had no parachutes.”      Once, she watched four planes crash, carrying eight women to their deaths. “What a nightmare,” she said decades later, “poor girls, my friends, only yesterday we had slept in the bunks together.”      Ms. Popova remarked that perhaps she was born lucky. One time, she counted 42 bullet holes in her plane. “Katya, my dear,” she said to her navigator, “we will live long.”      1 of 109 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Notable deaths of 2013 View Photos A look at those who have died this year.

She planned to become a teacher or a doctor, until one day a plane landed near her home and she met the pilot.      “I had thought only gods could fly,” she said in an account published in the book “A Dance With Death: Soviet Airwomen in World War II,” by Anne Noggle. “It was amazing to me that a simple man could get in a plane and fly away.”      Ms. Popova joined a flying club and later graduated from an aviation school. When the war started, she was working as an instructor. She said that she decided to join the military after losing her brother in the war and after watching Germans abuse her townspeople.      “I saw the German aircraft flying along our roads filled with people who were leaving their homes, firing at them with their machine guns,” she said. “Seeing this gave me feelings inside that made me want to fight them.”      Over the course of the war, Ms. Popova said, she fought in Belorussia, Poland and Germany. In 1942, she was shot down in the North Caucasus. Retreating with the infantry, she met her future husband, Semyon Kharlamov, also a decorated pilot. They were married for many years until his death; together they had a son, who grew up to be a general in the Belarusian air force. A complete list of survivors could not be determined.      Minerva, an academic publication on women and the military, cited Soviet records indicating that the women’s regiments flew more than 30,000 combat sorties. Their ranks produced at least 30 Heroes of the Soviet Union — about a third of all women so honored — and at least three fighter aces.      Decades after the war, Ms. Popova, who often was called Nadya, reflected on the perils she had endured. “At night sometimes, I look up into the dark sky, close my eyes and picture myself as a girl at the controls of my bomber,” she said, “and I think, ‘Nadya, how on earth did you do it?’ ” ||||| Russia is mourning the loss of one its World War II heroes.      Nadezhda (Nadia) Popova passed away in Moscow on July 8, aged 91.      Popova was awarded numerous medals, including the prestigious “Hero of the Soviet Union.”      She was a combat aviator, a bomber pilot who flew over 850 missions.

Marco Werman: Russia is mourning the loss of one its World War II heroes. Nadezhda Popova passed away in Moscow last week, aged 91. Popova was awarded numerous medals, including the prestigious Hero of the Soviet Union. She was a combat aviator. Here she is in a BBC documentary from 2009 talking about her work as a close support bomber pilot.      Nadezhda Popova [speaking Russian, with English voiceover]: We flew in sequence, one after another, and during the night we never let them rest, so they called us “Night Witches.” And the Germans made up stories. They spread the rumor that we had been injected with some unknown chemicals that enabled us to see so clearly at night.      Werman: The Night Witches made for great propaganda, but the risks these women faced were all too real.      Popova [speaking Russian, with English voiceover]: We were flying without parachutes. We were not able to bail out. The whole crew which was shot during the night flight was burning alive, and it was awful. It was an absolutely unbearable sight. This was the most tragic part.      Werman: Popova herself flew more than 850 missions. By contrast, most US bomber pilots were rotated out of combat if they survived 25 missions. Amy Goodpaster Strebe met and profiled Popova for her 2009 book, “Flying for Her Country.” Amy, tell us, first of all, how you met Nadezhda Popova.      Amy Goodpaster Strebe: I was actually in Moscow in, it actually was 2007. I was there with several other American pilots at invitation by the Russian pilots as part of Aviatrissa, which is an international women pilot organization based in Moscow.      Werman: I mean, she seems larger than life, just listening to those two clips of her a moment ago. What was she like?      Strebe: For me it was like meeting a rock star, because she was such an amazing, not only was she an amazing pilot, but such a courageous warrior in World War II. And she’s very famous and it was just very exciting to meet somebody who had been through as much as she had. She’s just inspired so many women pilots even today.      Werman: So the Night Witches, fantastic name, all women. How did the program start and what was the stable of Russian female pilots that they were able to draw from?      Strebe: The 1930s were considered the Golden Age of aviation, not only in Russian, but in the United States as well, and all over the world. When World War II began, the Russians, Russia obviously being invaded by Germany, they had to draw upon all their resources, and there were several Russian women pilots who were flying during that time that Stalin could draw upon. Marina Roskova, of course, is the most famous Russian woman pilot during that time, famous for her transatlantic flight in the 1930s. So she was chosen by Stalin to organize three regiments, one of them being the 588th Night Bomber Regiment, which Nadia was a part of. That was an all-female regiment. This was unique because there had never been this women air regiment, so Nadia was a real pioneer in her own right for being able to fly for her country in this capacity.      Werman: What kind of planes did Nadia fly?      Strebe: Nadia was part of, like I said, the 588th Night Bomber Regiment which later, in 1943, became known as the 46th Guards Night Bomber Regiment, and they flew Po-2s, which were for the most part outdated biplanes from World War I. They were made out of wood and canvas, and if you can imagine flying against the Luftwaffe in something like that, it sounds pretty terrifying.      Werman: No, it’s got to be a tough competition.      Strebe: Yes, it was pretty tough going, but there was also advantages, too. The planes are very maneuverable, and they could fly very low, and that’s really where a lot of their success came from.      Werman: So for Nadia, she’d been flying since she was 15 years old. Why did she fight, though?      Strebe: Her village was invaded by the Nazis, and her brother also died in the war. The Russians saw incredible atrocities that were happening in their country. They were young, and they were idealistic, and they were in the right place at the right time in terms of being to do what they loved to do, which was flying, but also to protect and defend their country.      Werman: Did these women who were part of the Night Witches, did they ever talk about the fear of getting captured?      Strebe: Definitely. One of the things that I remember reading about was that the women always carried a handgun with them in the cockpit with one bullet, and that was basically if they were shot down and captured, it was just kind of agreed upon that they would shoot themselves. Now Nadia was shot down several times. She was never captured, but she did have some crashes but fortunately was never seriously injured. But that was definitely a consideration being women flying in treacherous times.      Werman: You know, it’s interesting, America’s only just recently allowed women in combat roles, some 50-plus years after this. Makes for a stark contrast.      Strebe: It is, it is, and in fact it’s kind of interesting, I spoke to some of the Soviet air women and I asked them the question about would you fight again. And several of them told me they didn’t want, they didn’t quite understand why women would want to be put in that situation, be in a war situation, if they didn’t have to be.      Werman: Amy Goodpaster Strebe is author of “Flying for Her Country: The American and Soviet Women Military Pilots of World War II.” Strebe had the privilege of meeting Soviet combat aviator Nadezhda Popova, who passed away last week.

Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.  - Alexandros Othonaios ( Greek :   , Gytheio , 1879 - Athens , 20 September 1970 ) was a distinguished Greek general , who became briefly Prime Minister of Greece , heading an emergency government during an abortive coup in 1933 .  - Recorded history or written history is a historical narrative based on a written record or other documented communication. Recorded history can be contrasted with other narratives of the past, such as mythological, oral or archeological traditions.  - Aristotle (\\"Aristotéls\\"; 384322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects  including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government  and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC.  - The Prime Minister of the Hellenic Republic (\\"Prothypourgós tis Ellinikís Dimokratías\\"), colloquially referred to as the Prime Minister of Greece (\\"Prothypourgós tis Elládas\\"), is the head of government of the Hellenic Republic and the leader of the Greek cabinet. The incumbent prime minister is Alexis Tsipras, who took office on 21 September 2015.  - Alexis Tsipras (; born 28 July 1974) is the 185th and current Prime Minister of Greece, having been sworn in on 21 September 2015. He previously served as the 183rd Prime Minister of Greece from 26 January 2015 to 27 August 2015. Tsipras has been leader of the left-wing Greek political party Syriza since 4 October 2009.  - Sparta (Doric Greek: ; Attic Greek: ) was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece. In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon, while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece.  - East Mani (- \\"Anatolikí Máni\\") is a municipality in Laconia, Peloponnese, Greece. Its seat of administration is the town Gytheio (before 2011 the small town Kotronas). The municipality is located in the eastern part of the Mani Peninsula. It is a mountainous and rocky area. Its economy relies on fishing, olive oil and tourism.  - Plato (Greek: \\"Plátn\\", in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423  348/347 BCE) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire \\"œuvre\\" is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years.  - The city of Athens during the classical period of Ancient Greece (508322 BC) was the major urban center of the notable polis (city-state) of the same name, located in Attica, Greece, leading the Delian League in the Peloponnesian War against Sparta and the Peloponnesian League. Athenian democracy was established in 508 BC under Cleisthenes following the tyranny of Isagoras. This system remained remarkably stable, and with a few brief interruptions remained in place for 180 years, until 322 BC (aftermath of Lamian War). The peak of Athenian hegemony was achieved in the 440s to 430s BC, known as the Age of Pericles.  - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country.  - A metropolis is a large city or conurbation which is a significant economic, political, and cultural center for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections, commerce, and communications. The term is Greek and means the \\"mother city\\" of a colony (in the ancient sense), that is, the city which sent out settlers. This was later generalized to a city regarded as a center of a specified activity, or any large, important city in a nation.  - Piraeus (\\"Pireás\\" , , \\"Peiraieús\\") is a port city in the region of Attica, Greece. Piraeus is located within the Athens urban area, southwest from its city center (municipality of Athens), and lies along the east coast of the Saronic Gulf.  - Gytheio, the ancient Gythium or Gytheion, is a town and a former municipality in Laconia, Peloponnese, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality East Mani, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 197.313 km.

The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)?

Expansion quickly peaked however, and the European powers who had carved up the New World set about testing each other in dynastic conflicts and colonial rivalry. The English were the main rivals of the Dutch on the high seas, and there were several wars between the two in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1665–1667 the Dutch sailed up the River Medway and sank the British fleet moored there. The 18th century saw Amsterdam grow into the foremost financial center in the world, but the seeds of decline had already been planted. When the English colonies in New England rose up in revolt against the British, they found ready Ailies in the Dutch. From their colonies in the Caribbean they sent caches of arms and ammunition. The British were furious and went to war in 1780, destroying the Dutch navy and signaling a sudden decline in power and influence from which the Netherlands never recovered. Trade suffered to such an extent that in 1791 the VOC went into liquidation. In the latter part of the century there were anti-Orange demonstrations by pro-French factions in the country, and in 1795 Napoleon Bonaparte took the Netherlands in his epic march across Europe. Under the yoke of another foreign power, and with trade at an all time low, the Golden Age was truly dead. The Return of the House of Orange Napoleon installed his brother Louis as King of Holland and he chose to take the fine Town Hall on Dam Square as his palace — now the Koninklijk Palace. But only four years later he fled the city after civil disturbances broke out when he raised taxes. When Napoleon's bubble burst and French power began to wane, William of Orange emerged from exile and was proclaimed king in 1813. Amsterdam had to work its way out of economic decline, but throughout the 19th century the city grew steadily. Industrialization changed the city. With the building of the Central Station at the end of the century, Amsterdam turned its back on its seafaring past and looked towards the mechanical age for its future. The station was built over the old harbor wall and some of the oldest canals in the city center were filled in to allow better access to motorized vehicles. Dam Square was landlocked for the first time in its history.

Beforehand, Andoheb explains the legend of Kharis to Bey. Meanwhile, in Mapleton, Massachusetts, Professor Matthew Norman, who had examined one of Kharis' missing bandage pieces during the Mummy's last spree through Mapleton, also explains the legends of the Priests of Arkam and Kharis to his History class who are less than believing. After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey, meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori, a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. However, a strange, clouded feeling in her mind occurs when ever the subject of Egypt is mentioned. Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousefâs mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt. Yousef Bey pledges his devotion before Andoheb explains that during each full moon, Yousef Bey is to brew the fluid from nine tana leaves. Kharis will sense this and find the leaves wherever they are. The moon is full in Mapleton as Professor Norman studies the hieroglyphics on a case of tana leaves. He has deciphered the message about brewing nine tana leaves during the full moon and decides to do just that. The battered, ragged form of Kharis the Mummy, however, senses the leaves brewing and heads toward them. On the way, he passes the home of Amina and she follows him in a trance-like state. Kharis soon arrives at the home of Professor Norman, strangles him, and drinks the fluid of the tana leaves. Amina sees Kharis, which snaps her out of her trance but also causes her to faint.

Movie title: Freeheld Movie plot: The film opens at a meeting of the Board of Chosen Freeholders of Ocean County, New Jersey in 2005. Ocean County resident and New Jersey police officer Lieutenant Laurel Hester, a 23-year veteran of the police force, has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and expected to live only one year, she wishes to pass on her pension to her domestic partner of five years, Stacie Andree. Although New Jersey counties have the option to extend pension benefits to domestic partners, Ocean County Freeholders will not do this. In protest, the state's LGBT civil rights organization, Garden State Equality, organizes hundreds of people to speak out at each of the Freeholders' meetings. The crowds Garden State Equality organizes get bigger and more vociferous at each meeting.Among those speaking out are Laurel's police colleagues and Ocean County residents, describing Laurel's 25 years of exemplary work for the police department, and petitioning the Freeholders to allow her to pass on her pension to Stacie. Laurel's first police partner, Dane Wells, speaks about her and compares the situation to separate drinking fountains and seats at the back of the bus. Freeholder Joseph Vicari says that although they are \\"anguished\\" by Laurel's case, they are unable to change things because of state legislature and moves for an adjournment.

The traditions of the local peoples are unanimous in affirming that the oldest inhabitants of Casamance are the Bainuk people and that the left bank of the mouth of the river was first populated by the Jola. Portuguese sailors reached the west African coast in the 15th century, and in the 16th century, Portuguese traders became active in the Casamance region, mostly in search of wax, ivory, and slaves. They did not linger on \\"Mosquito Island\\", instead founding their first trading post at Ziguinchor in 1645.In the late 1820s, a mulatto trader from Gorée, Pierre Baudin, moved to Itou and began planting rice and producing lime by crushing the shells of mangrove oysters and cooking them in lime kilns. The French administration treated Baudin as their representative on the island and did not send others because few of the French wanted to live on the island. Being wet and marshy, Carabane had a reputation for its poor sanitation. The local economy was based mainly on weedy rice, which was sold in Ziguinchor or to the British in The Gambia. The Baudin family used slaves to produce the rice and, despite the declaration of its official abolition in the French colonial empire in 1848, slavery continued on the island until the early 20th century.The colonial administration wanted to expand its influence around the river, particularly because the inhabitants of Gorée were threatened with losing part of their resources with the imminent demise of the slave trade, and also because of their competition with Saint-Louis. On January 9, 1836, Lieutenant Malavois, who was in charge of Gorée, left for Casamance in search of a site for a trading post. The tip of Diogue, on the north shore, was first considered, but at the refusal of the Jola, it was the opposite bank which was eventually accepted.

The death of the young individual has visibly shaken the community and authorities are working diligently to investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident, in hopes of providing answers to the heartbroken family and the appalled public. Hebron, located in the southern West Bank, is a city with a long history of conflicts and tensions, which makes such incidents all the more painful and sorrowful. Often times, the Palestinian and Israeli communities have experienced clashes, protests, and fatalities that have left an indelible mark on the region. The Palestinian teenager whose life was tragically cut short, was only seventeen-years-old. He had his entire life ahead of him and, like any other teenager, was filled with hopes, dreams, and aspirations. Losing such a young soul in such a violent manner not only leaves his family in distress but also the entire community mourning the loss of a promising future. According to official reports, the teenager succumbed to his critical injuries at the hospital after being admitted for emergency treatment. Medical professionals worked tirelessly to stabilize his condition, but the severity of his injuries proved to be overwhelming, leading to his untimely demise. His grieving family was there to support him through it all, holding onto hope with every ounce of strength they could muster. Their courage in the face of such adversity is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, and serves as a reminder of the vital need for peace and resolution in conflict-ridden regions of the world. The complex situation in Hebron has led to increased tensions between the Palestinian and Israeli communities, intensifying with each passing moment. Addressing the root causes of such conflicts is critical for ensuring the safety and wellbeing of all Hebron residents, as well as preventing further heartbreak and destruction. Local authorities in Hebron have pledged their full support and resources in bringing to justice those responsible for this senseless act. They are collaborating with community leaders and members to piece together the events that transpired, while ensuring that no other family endures such a devastating loss. In the face of such tragedy, it is vital that we not only honor the memory of the innocent lives that have been taken but also work to create a brighter future for all. This entails engaging in open dialogue, practicing understanding, and advocating for peaceful resolution between varying religious, political, and cultural groups. In doing so, we can turn the course away from the destructive path that has befallen the region and help pave the way for a new chapter of understanding and cooperation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Paragraph: In remarks during a ribbon-cutting ceremony here on Wednesday, Gov. George E. Pataki said he expected the facility to generate thousands more jobs in the Hudson Valley area for contractors and suppliers catering to the factory. He praised IBM for being \\"a critical partner in our economic development efforts\\" in New York state. In a brief speech, Samuel J. Palmisano, IBM's chief executive, emphasized that it was important to make long-term investments despite the current slump in the technology business. \\"To play to win in technology, you innovate and you lead,\\" he said. But manufacturing technology products is a costly and cyclical business. In June, IBM announced that it was taking a charge of more than 2 billion against earnings. The largest single reasons for the charge were the cost of getting out of the business of manufacturing hard disks for storage, which it sold to Hitachi, and closing down some of its older semiconductor operations. But Kelly said the demand for advanced chips, like those produced at IBM's facility in Burlington, Vt., is strong. \\"I need more capacity in that end of the market,\\" he said, \\"and this is factory is critical to meeting that growing demand.\\" If IBM has miscalculated the demand, it will suffer badly as both the high operating costs and depreciation on the huge capital investment for the East Fishkill factory drag down earnings. But industry analysts said the plant should be insulated from a falloff in one or a few segments of the semiconductor market.  Question: \\"What company did George Pataki praise for being a critical partner in economic development in New York?\\" Answer: \\"Hitachi\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"No, the answer is not correct.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: Information:  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The electron is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with a negative elementary electric charge. Electrons belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family, and are generally thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure. The electron has a mass that is approximately 1/1836 that of the proton. Quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of a half-integer value, expressed in units of the reduced Planck constant, \\"\\". As it is a fermion, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle. Like all matter, electrons have properties of both particles and waves: they can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like light. The wave properties of electrons are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a larger De Broglie wavelength for a given energy.  - Calcium is a chemical element with symbol Ca and atomic number 20. Calcium is a soft gray Group 2 alkaline earth metal, fifth-most-abundant element by mass in the Earth's crust. The ion Ca is also the fifth-most-abundant dissolved ion in seawater by both molarity and mass, after sodium, chloride, magnesium, and sulfate. Free calcium metal is too reactive to occur in nature. Calcium is produced in supernova nucleosynthesis.  - Northern Ireland (; Ulster Scots: \\"\\") is a top-level constituent unit of the United Kingdom in the northeast of Ireland. It is variously described as a country, province, region, or \\"part\\" of the United Kingdom, amongst other terms. Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland. In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the UK's population. Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in some areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to \\"put forward views and proposals\\" with \\"determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments\\".  - A chemical element or element is a species of atoms having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei (i.e. the same atomic number, \\"Z\\"). There are 118 elements that have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the Earth's crust.  - Sodium is a chemical element with symbol Na (from Latin \\"natrium\\") and atomic number 11. It is a soft, silvery-white, highly reactive metal. Sodium is an alkali metal, being in group 1 of the periodic table, because it has a single electron in its outer shell that it readily donates, creating a positively charged atomthe Na cation. Its only stable isotope is Na. The free metal does not occur in nature, but must be prepared from compounds. Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars, sodalite and rock salt (NaCl). Many salts of sodium are highly water-soluble: sodium ions have been leached by the action of water from the Earth's minerals over eons, and thus sodium and chlorine are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the oceans.  - The alkaline earth metals are six chemical elements in column (group) 2 of the Periodic table. They are beryllium (Be), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), and radium (Ra). They have very similar properties: they are all shiny, silvery-white, somewhat reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure.  - The Kingdom of Great Britain, officially Great Britain , was a sovereign state in western Europe from 1 May 1707 to 31 December 1800. The state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands. It did not include Ireland, which remained a separate realm. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster. The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I, bringing about a \\"Union of the Crowns\\". Also after the accession of George I to the throne of Great Britain in 1714, the kingdom was in a personal union with the Electorate of Hanover.  - The chloride ion is the anion (negatively charged ion) Cl. It is formed when the element chlorine (a halogen) gains an electron or when a compound such as hydrogen chloride is dissolved in water or other polar solvents. Chloride salts such as sodium chloride are often very soluble in water. It is an essential electrolyte located in all body fluids responsible for maintaining acid/base balance, transmitting nerve impulses and regulating fluid in and out of cells. Less frequently, the word \\"chloride\\" may also form part of the \\"common\\" name of chemical compounds in which one or more chlorine atoms are covalently bonded. For example, methyl chloride, with the standard name chloromethane (see IUPAC books) is an organic compound with a covalent CCl bond in which the chlorine is not an anion.  - Magnesium is a chemical element with symbol Mg and atomic number 12. It is a shiny gray solid which bears a close physical resemblance to the other five elements in the second column (Group 2, or alkaline earth metals) of the periodic table: all Group 2 elements have the same electron configuration in the outer electron shell and a similar crystal structure.  - Ireland, also described as the Republic of Ireland ('), is a sovereign state in north-western Europe occupying about five-sixths of the island of Ireland. The capital and largest city is Dublin, which is located on the eastern part of the island, and whose metropolitan area is home to around a third of the country's 4.75 million inhabitants. The state shares its only land border with Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom. It is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the Celtic Sea to the south, Saint George's Channel to the south-east, and the Irish Sea to the east. It is a unitary, parliamentary republic. The legislature, the ', consists of a lower house, ', an upper house, ', and an elected President (') who serves as the largely ceremonial head of state, but with some important powers and duties. The head of government is the ' (Prime Minister, literally 'Chief', a title not used in English), who is elected by the Dáil and appointed by the President, and appoints other government ministers.  - Hijiki (  ,  or  hijiki ) ( Sargassum fusiforme , syn . Hizikia fusiformis ) is a brown sea vegetable growing wild on rocky coastlines around Japan , Korea , and China . Hijiki has been a part of the Japanese diet for centuries . Hijiki is rich in dietary fibre and essential minerals such as calcium , iron , and magnesium . According to Japanese folklore , hijiki aids health and beauty , and thick , black , lustrous hair is connected to regular consumption of small amounts of hijiki . Hijiki has been sold in United Kingdom natural products stores for 30 years and hijiki 's culinary uses have been adopted in North America . Recent studies have shown that hijiki contains potentially toxic quantities of inorganic arsenic , and the food safety agencies of several countries ( excluding Japan ) , including Canada , the United Kingdom , and the United States , have advised against its consumption .

Question: Big continent used more air polluting substances, while Small continent was very protective towards the environment. Big continent got a hole in its ozone layer as a consequence of their actions.  Which continent killed less plankton?  Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Small continent killed less plankton. This conclusion can be drawn from the fact that Small continent was very protective towards the environment and presumably released fewer air polluting substances that cause the depletion of the ozone layer. Since the ozone layer depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation which kills plankton and disrupts ocean food webs, the Small continent with better environmental practices and less ozone depletion would have less plankton loss compared to Big continent, which experienced a hole in its ozone layer due to excessive use of air polluting substances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step-by-step justification: 1. You inhale: Inhaling is the process of drawing air into the lungs. 2. The air enters the mouth and nose: As we breathe, the air travels through the mouth and nose. 3. The diaphragm contracts: The diaphragm is a muscle that contracts and flattens when we inhale, helping to expand the chest cavity and create space for the lungs to expand. 4. Air fills all the sacks in the lungs: These tiny air sacs are called alveoli. When we inhale, air fills these sacs. 5. Oxygen passes through the sacks into capillaries: Alveoli are surrounded by capillaries, and oxygen in the inhaled air passes through the thin walls of alveoli into the capillaries, where it attaches to red blood cells. 6. The blood is passed to the blood in the capillaries: Oxygen in the air attaches to hemoglobin in red blood cells, forming oxyhemoglobin. 7.

The hijackers attacked at 9:28. While traveling 35,000 feet above eastern Ohio, United 93 suddenly dropped 700 feet. Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft. During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring \\"Mayday\\" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit. The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing. The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:\\" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here.\\" On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers. This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001. But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation. The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams. They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff. On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers. The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August. Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight. FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel. We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight. All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them. We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers.  After reading the above, is \\"The number of hijackers\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Which two factors were different between the three other hijacked planes and United 93?\\"? Available choices: [i] no; [ii] yes;","output":"Imagine there were four groups of bad people that took over four different airplanes on the same day.

Now, someone is asking if the number of bad people is one thing that makes United 93 different from the other three planes. The choices are: [i] no, or [ii] yes.

While Nashiri was in Afghanistan, Nibras and Khamri saw their chance. They piloted the explosives-laden boat alongside the USS Cole, made friendly gestures to crew members, and detonated the bomb. Quso did not arrive at the apartment in time to film the attack. Back in Afghanistan,  Bin Laden anticipated U.S. military retaliation. He ordered the evacuation of al Qaeda's Kandahar airport compound and fled- first to the desert area near Kabul, then to Khowst and Jalalabad, and eventually back to Kandahar. In Kandahar, he rotated between five to six residences, spending one night at each residence. In addition, he sent his senior advisor, Mohammed Atef, to a different part of Kandahar and his deputy, Ayman al Zawahiri, to Kabul so that all three could not be killed in one attack. There was no American strike. In February 2001, a source reported that an individual whom he identified as the big instructor (probably a reference to  Bin Laden) complained frequently that the United States had not yet attacked. According to the source,  Bin Laden wanted the United States to attack, and if it did not he would launch something bigger. The attack on the USS Cole galvanized al Qaeda's recruitment efforts. Following the attack,  Bin Laden instructed the media committee, then headed by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, to produce a propaganda video that included a reenactment of the attack along with images of the al Qaeda training camps and training methods; it also highlighted Muslim suffering in Palestine, Kashmir, Indonesia, and Chechnya. Al Qaeda's image was very important to  Bin Laden, and the video was widely disseminated. Portions were aired on Al Jazeera, CNN, and other television outlets. It was also disseminated among many young men in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and caused many extremists to travel to Afghanistan for training and jihad.

Eventually, he was able to categorize them in three different groups, group A, group B, and group C. He placed the animals that can only hear ifrasound in group A. Then he placed the animals that are only able to hear the same frequency of sound waves as humans do in group B. The last group of animals were able to hear only ultrasound.

Human beings can normally hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Sounds with frequencies below 20 hertz are called infrasound . Sounds with frequencies above 20,000 hertz are called ultrasound . Some other animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range. For example, dogs can hear sounds with frequencies as high as 50,000 Hz.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Multi-choice problem: Choose from the options at the end, and answer how do you do this: dish towel OPTIONS: (1). can wipe water . (2). can wipe the street .","output":"Option 1, \\"can wipe water,\\" is the more appropriate use for a dish towel. Dish towels are generally designed to help clean and dry dishes, countertops, and kitchen utensils. Using a dish towel to wipe water is a common practice in many households and commercial kitchens. Dish towels are typically made from highly absorbent materials such as cotton, microfiber, or linen. They are often designed to be both soft and durable. This enables them to effectively soak up moisture, dry delicate surfaces like glassware without causing scratches, and remain usable for long periods of time. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use a dish towel to wipe water: 1. Choose the appropriate dish towel: Select a clean, dry dish towel made from absorbent material like cotton, microfiber, or linen. It should be large enough to fold for additional absorbency and grip. 2. Fold the dish towel: Fold the dish towel once or twice to increase the thickness and absorbent surface area. This also provides better grip and control when wiping surfaces. 3. Wipe the water: Hold the folded dish towel in one hand and press it gently onto the wet surface. Move the towel across the surface using a back and forth motion, lifting it briefly to allow the absorbed water to be released. For heavily wet areas, apply slightly more pressure to help soak up the water more efficiently. 4. Rinse and wring, if necessary: If the dish towel becomes too saturated with water, rinse it under running water, and wring out the excess moisture. This allows the towel to continue absorbing more water from the surface effectively. 5. Continue wiping until the surface is completely dry: Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the entire surface is dry. Make sure to check for any remaining moisture, as this can lead to the growth of mold and mildew. 6. Clean and sanitize the dish towel: After using, ensure that the dish towel is washed and thoroughly dried before the next use. This prevents the spread of bacteria and maintains the cleanliness of the kitchen. In contrast, Option 2, \\"can wipe the street,\\" is not a practical or appropriate use for a dish towel. Cleaning the streets typically requires larger and more robust cleaning tools, like brooms or outdoor scrubbers, which are designed for this purpose. Using a dish towel on streets would likely damage the towel, expose it to contaminants, and yield poor cleaning results."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Read and understand the phrase: \\"matrix ' - style massacres erupt throughout ... but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with kafka-inspired philosophy.\\" 2. Break down the components:     a. \\"matrix ' - style massacres erupt throughout\\" — This part seems to describe intense and violent scenes in the movie, which can be seen as negative.     b. \\"but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence\\" — This part suggests that the movie struggles to find a balance between its violent content and its other aspects, which can also be considered negative.     c. \\"with kafka-inspired philosophy\\" — This part refers to the philosophical aspect of the movie inspired by Kafka, which could be seen as a positive, as it implies some depth in the storyline or the discussion of meaningful concepts. 3. Weigh the components:      a. Negative component: \\"matrix ' - style massacres erupt throughout\\" and \\"the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence\\" both convey a negative tone.     b. Positive component: \\"kafka-inspired philosophy\\" could be considered positive, as it suggests a level of depth to the movie. 4.

The intense violence and massacres are mentioned first, setting the initial tone as negative.       b. The movie's struggle to balance the violence with philosophy adds more negativity to the tone.       c. The positive aspect (Kafka-inspired philosophy) is overshadowed by the negative aspects mentioned above. 5.

Pasta dishes for 8, including side salad and garlic bread. Pizza starting at 7.50 for a 12\\" cheese.   House salad was crisp. The wings hit the spot, without covering it. They were flabby skinned--cooked through, but not fried to give it a crust. I wasn't expecting it to be battered or anything, but I like a quick fry to hold the skin to the meat. The wing sauce was good enough--a bit of heat, a bit of tang, and down it went. We ordered Mama's Special: Pepperoni, sausage, green pepper, olives, mushrooms & onions. No love for the pizza crust. It was baked just right, with some nice spotty oven char on the bottom, and the crust looked like it would be great, laced with big air bubbles, but there was no chew. I wasn't expecting a big bubble gum bite, but I like a bit of chew, and with that chew, some of the flavor that tells me the dough was allowed to rest for awhile to develop. This dough yielded instantly with a bite, then quickly disintegrated in my mouth as if it were Wonder Bread. In a backwards way, it was left to be carried by the toppings, but alas, those were subpar--the lightly spread sauce (just right in quantity, bland in quality), mozzarella, sausage, black olives, mushrooms--it was all off the supermarket shelves. The Sicilian meatball sandwich had the same crust, and it was more obvious here, in plain sight, but still a wallflower. Again, more rise time, and a sprinkle of salt in the dough, and maybe we could've been friends. I liked the innards, even though it wasn't the big globes of meatballs sweating into marinara that I was expecting. The meatball meat--just nicely seasoned lean ground beef--was scooped in, filling every inch of the sandwich's cavern (no annoying air bubble cubby holes of emptiness), and sprinkled with mozzarella. Again, not great, but adequate, and everything I wish a Hot Pocket could be, if not the calzone I'd expected. The lasagna I especially wanted to love, especially with its menu tag: \\"the best you've ever tasted.\\" Here, I loved the composition--not too much noodle, not too much cheese, not too much sauce inside, though the thing was really swimming in sauce when I received it. I easily sopped that up with the very tasty and perfectly crisp garlic bread, though. I liked whatever herbs they seasoned their ricotta with, and that they seasoned the ricotta at all, since it's too often neglected in lasagna dishes. I just felt like the sauce was missing something, and it fell just flat. Maybe a few glugs of wine or some minced garlic would've given it the light bite I was looking for. The desserts were also fine. The cannoli in its fried shell wasn't traditional, filled with a slightly starchy vanilla pastry cream instead of sweetened ricotta, but it was crispy and creamy and sweet. The tiramisu was tasty, but I couldn't taste any Marsala in the zabaglione, so I declared it decidedly kid-friendly.   One of the best things about DiVito's food is that it kinda tasted better the next day, reheated. *shrugs* Maybe it's one of those things that needs a night to allow the flavors to meld? With decent prices and decent food, especially when a craving hits, I won't mind going back to further test this theory. I wish I could give them 2.25 stars: \\"Meh, it's ok.\\"...Pick from: - negative; - positive; I think the answer is","output":"negative.

Article: New research says 35 percent of the deaths of children worldwide are caused by hunger. The research is from poor to middle-income countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.  Robert Black from the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University in prefix = st1 /Marylandwas the leading writer of the research. He says more than 3.5 million mothers and children under five die in poor countries each year because of hunger.  He says more than two million children die from underdevelopment, either before or after birth. Millions of others who survive face a lifetime of disabilities or early death. And the effects are not just physical. Poor brain development can limit economic success as children become adults. Then the cycle of poverty and hunger often repeats for their children.  Doctor Black says hungry children are also more likely to have conditions like high blood pressure and heart disease as adults. He says the studies show that food programs need to place the greatest importance on the first two years of life. Hungry children can suffer the whole life damage from age two.  So it is high time to improve their diets. Diets should include foods rich in vitamin A and other useful things. The researchers say early help like these could reduce child deaths by 25%.  The research has faced some criticism . A medical aid group says the researchers underestimate the number of child deaths from hunger. The researchers say there are findings that support this treatment but more studies are needed to compare it to hospital care. Question: What can we learn from this passage? Options: A: If a child is hungry at childhood, he will be disabled in the future. B: Criticism is the best medicine for hunger. C: The results from the research is not satisfactory. D: Generally speaking, hungry children have less chance of catching heart disease when they grow up.

Summarize this article: With so much national attention focused on the keen criminology insights of Arizona's Clarence the Talking Sheriff, a stunning new Gallup Poll on Congress almost flew right by.      The new national survey finds that within only five days of Republicans taking majority control of the House of Representatives on Jan. 4, Americans' approval of the bicameral body's job shot up more than 50%, from its record low of 13% to 20%.      The spurt in support came despite the candidly ominous opening speech by the new Speaker John Boehner, \\"Our debt will soon eclipse the size of our entire economy.\\"      The job approval of Congress has been trending downward for much of the past two years under the large Democratic majorities in both houses and the leaderships of now ex-Speaker Nancy Pelosi and barely surviving Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who lost six of his 10-seat margin in the Nov. 2 midterms.      In December, when so much of the media coverage portrayed the lame-duck Democratic Congress and President Obama as being incredibly productive, popular job approval of that institution plummeted to an historic low 13%.      Gallup noted that decline in approval was particularly apparent among Democrats, many of whom were, according to their party's political protocol, hoping for higher taxes on all Americans.      Using harsh political rhetoric, Obama called hard-bargaining Republican congressional leaders \\"hostage-takers\\" for striking a tough legislative deal with him that avoided January.... ||||| President Obama’s approval ratings has climbed to its highest point in nearly a year and opinions of Congress are up too, a new poll Wednesday found.      Fifty-three percent of Americans surveyed for an Associated Press-GfK poll released Wednesday said they approve of how Obama is doing his job.      Text Size -      +      reset POLITICO 44      In November, just after the election day in which the president said Democrats got a “shellacking,” his approval rating in the same poll stood at 47 percent. Obama’s approval was last at 53 percent in this poll in early March 2010, before his health care reform bill was passed in its final form.      Americans’ views of how Obama is handling the economy also improved, with 47 percent approving, up 6 points from November.      A majority of voters are confident that Republicans can bring about an economic turnaround, with 56 percent saying they think the GOP can improve the economy.      Congressional Republicans’ overall approval ratings are also up, from 29 percent three months ago to 36 percent in this poll. Democrats in Congress are also doing better in the eyes of the American people than they were this fall, with 39 percent of those surveyed saying they approve of them, up from 36 percent in October.      The poll surveyed 1,001 adults Jan. 5-10. The error margin is plus or minus 4.2 percentage points. ||||| Summary:","output":"This article talks about a new poll that shows people in America are happier with the job Congress is doing. The poll says that more people approve of Congress now that Republicans have more control in the House of Representatives. People also feel good about how President Obama is doing his job. The poll found that 53% of Americans think he is doing a good job, which is better than a few months ago.

Yellow balloons and American flags line the sidewalks of Hailey, population 8,000. Residents planted one tree for each of the five years Bergdahl was held captive in Afghanistan. Now, uncertainty has given way to elation as the Army sergeant has been released from his captors -- in exchange for freeing five Taliban members held at Guantanamo Bay. \\"There were times where we wondered, but (parents) Jani and Bob Bergdahl never once gave up faith that their son was coming home to them,\\" family friend Stefanie O'Neill said. \\"The recovery and reintegration of Bowe Bergdahl is a work in progress,\\" OPTIONS: - Afghanistan told reporters Sunday, one day after his son was freed. - American told reporters Sunday, one day after his son was freed. - Army told reporters Sunday, one day after his son was freed. - Bergdahl told reporters Sunday, one day after his son was freed. - Bob Bergdahl told reporters Sunday, one day after his son was freed. - Bowe Bergdahl told reporters Sunday, one day after his son was freed. - CNN told reporters Sunday, one day after his son was freed. - Germany told reporters Sunday, one day after his son was freed. - Guantanamo Bay told reporters Sunday, one day after his son was freed. - Hailey told reporters Sunday, one day after his son was freed. - Idaho told reporters Sunday, one day after his son was freed. - Jani told reporters Sunday, one day after his son was freed. - Stefanie O'Neill told reporters Sunday, one day after his son was freed. - Taliban told reporters Sunday, one day after his son was freed. - Texas told reporters Sunday, one day after his son was freed. - U.S. told reporters Sunday, one day after his son was freed. - White House told reporters Sunday, one day after his son was freed.","output":"\\"The recovery and reintegration of Bowe Bergdahl is a work in progress,\\" Bob Bergdahl told reporters Sunday, one day after his son was freed. As it has been a long and arduous journey for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, it is only natural that his father would speak on behalf of his son's current situation and the recovery process that lies ahead. Overwhelmed with emotions, Bob Bergdahl expresses that the road to recovery and reintegration for his son would take time, patience, and support from all of those who relentlessly hoped for his return. Bowe Bergdahl, who had been held captive in Afghanistan for five years, was now back in the hands of the U.S. military after a prisoner exchange deal was orchestrated between the U.S. and the Taliban. Bergdahl's release sparked a mix of emotions within the community and around the nation, from joy and relief to concern and even anger, due to the complex circumstances surrounding his capture, the cost of his release—freeing five Taliban members—and the challenges that lay ahead. However, for the people of Hailey, Idaho, the focus remained on the fact that their fellow resident was freed and on the return of a son to his parents. The trees that were planted and the displays of support in the form of yellow balloons and American flags showed the collective determination of the community to keep hope alive, a hope that finally, albeit tenuously, saw the light of fruition. Throughout this ordeal and the upcoming days, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's family, friends, and the residents of Hailey will continue to work together to make sure that the young soldier receives the care, support, and understanding that he needs to face the next leg of what has been a trying and difficult journey. As quoted earlier by family friend Stefanie O'Neill, \\"Jani and Bob Bergdahl never once gave up faith that their son was coming home to them,\\" and now, with a sense of cautious joy, they will do everything in their power to help their son find his way back to normalcy and emotional stability in the days to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The more you understand her, the easier it will be to realize that it is not about you.   Avoid jumping to conclusions. You don’t know why she doesn’t like you. Be careful not to assume that it is because of something particular about you. Make some space between you and your immediate reaction. Try to suppress any initial panicked emotions. Realize that your feelings will subside and wait for them to do so before you speak or do anything. Liking yourself is more important than other people liking you. When you truly like yourself, it has an awesome effect- other people want to be around you more.  Speak to yourself as a friend. You should offer yourself the same compassion, love and support you would to a friend who is going through a hard time. Imagine yourself confident and free. In your mind visualize what you would look like if you were perfectly confident and happy. What would you look like? Strive for being that person.

Legal assistance for battered women is hard to come by. But it just got a little easier to find in Tarrant County. This month, the federal Violence Against Women Office awarded a two-year, 350,000 grant to the Women's Haven of Tarrant County. The money will allow the shelter to add a second full-time attorney to its staff and contract with the law school clinic at Texas Wesleyan University for pro bono and student services. Most important, the funds will help fill a frustrating gap. The Women's Haven, which provides shelter and outreach to domestic-violence victims, already has a full-time attorney. But that person is prohibited (by funding parameters) from representing women in matters of divorce or child custody. That's not a problem for most of the shelter's indigent residents, who can access free legal aid locally from West Texas Legal Services. But many of the clients served by the Women's Haven outreach programs are the working poor, who don't qualify for free legal services. Divorces and custody battles are simply out of their financial reach. \\"They can't begin to save up enough money for a divorce, so they're stuck,\\" says Sonyia Hartwell, the Women's Haven's associate director. \\"They're completely shut out of the civil-law system.\\" In Texas, unlike in some other states, women who aren't divorced can't gain full control over their portion of assets. And they can't obtain child support. The grant will also provide law students with valuable experience working these types of cases. \\"They can't go to court, but they can interview clients and do all the initial intake work that needs to be done\\" as well as investigative work, says Hartwell. And there's no shortage of abuse victims who need this kind of help. \\"Within 60 days of hanging out her or his shingle,\\" says Hartwell of the yet unhired new attorney, \\"we'll have an active caseload of 20 or more.\\"  Question: \\"Who is \\"completely shut out of the civil-law system\\"?\\" Answer: \\"The working poor\\" Is this answer correct? Available choices: A. no B. yes...I think the answer is","output":"B. yes So, imagine there is a place where some women are hurt by others, and they need help from special people called lawyers. But, sometimes they don't have enough money to pay those lawyers for help. This money, called a \\"grant,\\" will help them get the lawyers they need and help them with their problems. The people who couldn't get the help they needed are called \\"working poor,\\" and that's who you asked about.

When Kristen, believing Freddy is coming back, summons Joey and Kincaid into her dreams, she angers them and they warn her that dreaming of Freddy might actually cause his return. The next day, Kristen picks up her boyfriend, martial arts enthusiast Rick Johnson, and his sister and Kristen's best friend, Alice. Going to school she meets with her other friends: Sheila, a genius and asthmatic; and Debbie, a tough girl who doesn't like bugs. Alice daydreams that her crush Dan Jordan recognizes her, but she snaps out of it when Rick teasingly offers to introduce them. That night, Kristen stays awake to keep from dreaming, but Kincaid falls asleep and awakens in a junkyard where his dog Jason innocently resurrects Freddy from his grave. Trapped, Kincaid tries to fight off Freddy with his strength, but Freddy rebounds and kills him. He tricks Joey into thinking a model is swimming in his waterbed, but Freddy attacks him, drowning out his dream power and stabbing him for his mother to find the next morning. At school, Kristen panics when she notices Joey and Kincaid are missing and is knocked out. She is nearly attacked by Freddy when the school nurse wakes her up.

Question: Question: \\"What is an example of where the Quran asks for proof?\\"  Context: \\"The astrophysicist Nidhal Guessoum while being highly critical of pseudo-scientific claims made about the Quran, has highlighted the encouragement for sciences that the Quran provides by developing \\"the concept of knowledge.\\". He writes: \\"The Qur'an draws attention to the danger of conjecturing without evidence (And follow not that of which you have not the (certain) knowledge of... 17:36) and in several different verses asks Muslims to require proofs (Say: Bring your proof if you are truthful 2:111), both in matters of theological belief and in natural science.\\" Guessoum cites Ghaleb Hasan on the definition of \\"proof\\" according the Quran being \\"clear and strong... convincing evidence or argument.\\" Also, such a proof cannot rely on an argument from authority, citing verse 5:104. Lastly, both assertions and rejections require a proof, according to verse 4:174. Ismail al-Faruqi and Taha Jabir Alalwani are of the view that any reawakening of the Muslim civilization must start with the Quran; however, the biggest obstacle on this route is the \\"centuries old heritage of tafseer (exegesis) and other classical disciplines\\" which inhibit a \\"universal, epidemiological and systematic conception\\" of the Quran's message. The philosopher Muhammad Iqbal, considered the Quran's methodology and epistemology to be empirical and rational.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The Quran frequently encourages inquiry and the pursuit of knowledge by asking for proofs or evidence. As noted in the context provided by the astrophysicist Nidhal Guessoum, there are several verses where this is exemplified.  One example is in verse 17:36, where Quran cautions against conjecturing without evidence: \\"And follow not that of which you have not the (certain) knowledge of...\\". This verse draws attention to the importance of acquiring certain knowledge that is evidence-based, before adhering to or propagating it. Another instance is in verse 2:111, where the Quran instructs Muslims to require proofs: \\"Say: Bring your proof if you are truthful\\". This connotes the necessity of backing theological beliefs as well as natural science theories with compelling evidence or proof. In verse 5:104, there is rejection of authority without evidence. Meanwhile, chapter 4, verse 174 insists that both assertions and rejections should have proofs.  The verses highlighted sum up the Quranic emphasis on seeking proof or evidence for all claims or disclaimers. Such evidential enquiry, the Quran suggests, is vital in all domains, including theological belief and natural science.  In all these, the Quran promotes a clear and strong definition of proof, as well as discourages reliance on an argument from authority without clear evidence. This resistance to authority, unless supported by proof or evidence, is indicative of the Quran's empirical and rational methodology and epistemology as stated by the philosopher Muhammad Iqbal."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

A:","output":"When a baby drinks a lot of milk from their mother, their mother makes more milk. This is because the process of breastfeeding and the baby suckling stimulates the release of the hormone prolactin. Prolactin plays a crucial role in milk production by the mammary glands.

A new survey suggests these clubs are the only way many students can get a meal before lessons. About 54% of the 552 school staff questioned by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers(ATL)said their school provides a breakfast club for pupils. The biggest reason for them to attend these clubs is that their parents or carer goes to work early, cited by 76.8% of those questioned. About 22.6% said children attended due to lack of money at home because parents or carers are unemployed and 15.2% said lack of money at home due to changes or cuts to benefits. About 17.6% said pupils mainly attend breakfast clubs to socialize. The survey found that teachers believe that offering breakfast to pupils often helps improve their concentration and ability to learn. One primary school teacher said: \\"Although there is a charge for our breakfast club, we have accessed funding for those pupils on free school meals and the breakfast club had an effect on their attendance, concentration and being in school for the start of lessons. ATL general secretary Dr Roper said a nutritious meal at the start of the day has a huge impact on pupils' ability to learn. \\"Many schools do everything they can to ensure children eat well during school term-time. But there are many children living in poverty, who we fear won't be getting a decent meal a day in the holidays and this is something the government needs to address,\\" she said.

The album features remixes from artists including The Faint, Ladytron, Bill Laswell, Saul Williams, Olof Dreijer of The Knife, and Sam Fogarino of Interpol. Reznor himself strongly supports fan-made remixes of songs from the album, as evidenced by his decision to upload every song in multi-track form to the then-newly launched Nine Inch Nails remix website.  Instrumental versions of the songs on Year Zero are available at the site for download in multiple formats, including MP3, WAV, GarageBand, and Ableton Live formats. A planned film adaption of Year Zero became a television project in 2007. Reznor met with various writers and pitched the idea to television networks.

Context: Weight gain is a complex issue. But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. Question: After eating foods high in salt most of their lives, how are people most likely to be (statistically speaking): Options: - Fans of macaroni and cheese. - Overweight or obese. - not enough information - University researchers. Answer:","output":"After eating foods high in salt most of their lives, people are most likely to be (statistically speaking): Overweight or obese."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the new building that has helped to transform the surrounding area? from the following article ?  Construction of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway began in 1845. The line was opened in October 1849, with  services from Manchester London Road via Sale to Altrincham. In 1931 it became one of Great Britain's first electrified railway lines, with a 1,500 V DC overhead line. At the same time a new Altrincham station was opened on the same line, at Navigation Road, serving housing developments in the area. By 1937, 130 train services ran daily between Manchester and Altrincham. The line was renovated in the early 1990s to form part of the Manchester Metrolink light rail system. Broadheath railway station served the northern part of Altrincham between 1853 and 1962, on the line from Manchester, via Lymm to Warrington.Altrincham Interchange is one of the Metrolink's termini. The interchange was refurbished (2015–16), and now includes a brand new footbridge, with 3 lifts to cope with increased passenger demands, a larger scale ticket office, and modern bus interchange. The new Interchange is a modern design building that looks fantastic and is helping to regenerate Altrincham city centre as the new building has helped to transform the surrounding area. The Interchange connects the town to several locations in Greater Manchester, such as Sale and Bury. The service also includes Navigation Road station. Metrolink services leave around every six minutes, between 07:15 and 19:30 on weekdays, and less frequently at other times. National Rail services link the Altrincham and Navigation Road stations with Chester via Northwich, and with Manchester via Stockport. Altrincham Interchange, next to the railway station, is a hub for local bus routes. Manchester Airport, the largest in the UK outside London, is 5 miles (8 km) to the southeast of the town, and is connected via the Manchester Picadilly – Crewe line. There are plans in the future to create a new link between Manchester Airport and the Mid Cheshire Line, which Altrincham Interchange is a station on. Recently the Metrolink completed connections... Answer:","output":"The name of the new building that has helped to transform the surrounding area is the Altrincham Interchange. The Interchange was refurbished from 2015 to 2016 and now features a modern design, a brand-new footbridge with three lifts to accommodate increased passenger demands, a larger ticket office, and a contemporary bus interchange. This new building has played a crucial role in regenerating Altrincham city center and revitalizing the surrounding area.

Q:Process:  - Carbon dioxide passes through stomata in the leaves - Water is absorbed through roots - Chloroplast cells in leaves contain chlorophyll - Chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight - Energy splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen - Oxygen gets released into atmosphere - Hydrogen and carbon dioxide used to create glucose - Glucose is food for plants.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more oxygen than carbon dioxide present happens, how will it affect MORE sugar and oxygen being produced.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you presented supposes that there is more oxygen than carbon dioxide in the given environment. To understand the potential effects of this hypothesis on the process of photosynthesis and the production of sugar and oxygen, we must first examine each step of the process in detail. 1. Carbon dioxide passes through stomata in the leaves: The stomata are small pores found in the surface of plant leaves, and are responsible for carbon dioxide uptake and water vapor release. In light conditions, the stomata typically open to allow carbon dioxide to enter the leaves and take part in the photosynthesis process. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the environment directly affects the rate of carbon dioxide uptake, while the concentration of oxygen typically plays a lesser role in this process. 2. Water is absorbed through roots: This step is not directly affected by the oxygen or carbon dioxide concentration in the environment during photosynthesis. Water is absorbed by the roots and transported through the plant via specialized cells, which then distribute the water to various parts of the plant. 3. Chloroplast cells in leaves contain chlorophyll: Chlorophyll is a pigment that captures light energy and drives the photosynthesis process. The presence of more oxygen does not directly affect chlorophyll content in the cells. 4. Chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight: This step is independent of the composition of the gaseous environment surrounding the plant. The chlorophyll molecules in the plant absorb light energy regardless of the presence of oxygen or carbon dioxide. 5. Energy splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen: In the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, the absorbed energy is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The oxygen atoms then combine to form molecular oxygen (O2), which is released into the atmosphere. The hydrogen atoms are used to create chemical energy that helps power the subsequent steps of photosynthesis. 6. Oxygen gets released into the atmosphere: The production of oxygen is directly related to the rate of water molecule splitting in the previous step. An increase in oxygen concentration increases the rate of water molecule splitting and thus increases the oxygen production. 7. Hydrogen and carbon dioxide are used to create glucose: This is the part of the process wherein the Calvin cycle occurs. The cycle takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast, where hydrogen atoms from the light-dependent reactions combine with carbon dioxide to produce glucose. If there is more oxygen present than carbon dioxide, the plant's ability to produce glucose will be negatively impacted. This is because plants use an enzyme called Rubisco to fix carbon dioxide in the Calvin cycle. When oxygen concentration is high, Rubisco binds with oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, leading to a less efficient process called photorespiration, which does not yield glucose. 8. Glucose is food for plants: Glucose formed from the Calvin cycle is used by the plant for various functions, including growth and development. A reduced rate of glucose production due to the perturbation hypothesis can limit the available energy for the plant, affecting its overall health and growth. In summary, if there is more oxygen present than carbon dioxide, the process of photosynthesis will be indirectly impacted. The primary issue would be the reduced efficiency of the Calvin cycle due to the higher oxygen concentration. This would lead to decreased glucose production for the plant and may also impact the rate of oxygen production. Overall, the perturbation hypothesis would result in a less effective photosynthesis process and could negatively affect the health and growth of the plant."},{"instruction":"Aage Llievang tried explaining to his mother, but she shook her head. \\"Now, Aage.

If you aren't familiar with the country, Pakistan is a place far, far away from here, with lots of people that live there just like you and me. This big boom was very loud and scary, and it made everyone very sad because it hurt many of our friends who live there. At least 70 people, including some kids like you, got injured or were not able to go back home after that. This made all the people in Pakistan and around the world feel very bad for them. The big, scary boom was not an accident. It was caused by some mean and sneaky people called \\"militants.\\" These militants do not like other people to be happy and safe, so they do bad things to scare them and make them feel bad. So, after the big boom happened, the brave people in Pakistan decided that they needed to go on a hunt to find these mean militants. They wanted to make sure that they cannot hurt anyone anymore. The brave Pakistanis started searching high and low for the bad people. They looked in the cities and the countryside; they looked in the mountains and the valleys. They even asked other people if they had seen the bad guys. They put together a big team of strong and helpful friends, like police officers and soldiers, to help them find the mean militants. These helpers talked with each other and shared their ideas about where the bad people might be hiding. As they worked together, the brave Pakistanis got closer and closer to finding the mean militants behind the big, scary boom.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   In the study of chemical reactivity, we will find that the electrons in the outermost principal energy level are very important and so they are given a special name. Valence electrons are the electrons in the highest occupied principal energy level of an atom. In the second period elements listed above, the two electrons in the 1 s sublevel are called inner-shell electrons and are not involved directly in the element’s reactivity or in the formation of compounds. Lithium has a single electron in the second principal energy level and so we say that lithium has one valence electron. Beryllium has two valence electrons. How many valence electrons does boron have? You must recognize that the second principal energy level consists of both the 2 s and the 2 p sublevels and so the answer is three. In fact, the number of valence electrons goes up by one for each step across a period until the last element is reached. Neon, with its configuration ending in s 2 p 6 , has eight valence electrons.   Q: What is electrons in the highest occupied principal energy level of an atom called?

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person whose biographer was Michael Kennedy?  Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.

Suggested answer: Denominations such as Roman Catholics , Orthodox Christians , Lutheran Christians, and Reformed Christians believe in a rapture only in the sense of a general final resurrection, when Christ returns a single time. Should I validate this answer? A:","output":"In order to properly validate the provided answer, we should first expand upon the concept of the Rapture in a theological context. The term \\"Rapture\\" is derived from the Latin word \\"rapere\\", which means \\"to snatch away\\" or \\"to seize\\". In Christianity, the concept of the Rapture is an eschatological event wherein believers are instantly and miraculously transported to Heaven to meet Jesus Christ, ultimately escaping the tribulation or end-times events prophesied in the Bible. The concept of the Rapture is primarily derived from two main scriptural sources:  1) 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 - This passage describes the resurrection of the dead in Christ and the transformation of the living believers at the return of Jesus Christ. Many theologians interpret this event as the Rapture.    2) 1 Corinthians 15:51-52 - This passage outlines the instantaneous transformation of believers into glorified bodies at the sound of the \\"last trumpet\\".  It is crucial to recognize that various Christian denominations hold differing views regarding the Rapture. The answer provided above explains the stance of some denominations, such as Roman Catholics, Orthodox Christians, Lutheran Christians, and Reformed Christians, who believe in a general final resurrection when Christ returns a single time. This event, also known as the Second Coming of Christ, encompasses both the resurrection of the dead in Christ and the transformation of the living believers, rather than a separate event of the Rapture. However, other Christian denominations, particularly within the Protestant tradition, hold pre-tribulation, mid-tribulation, or post-tribulation views of the Rapture. These views center around the timing of the Rapture in relation to the period of tribulation foretold in the Book of Revelation. Some denominations, such as certain evangelical and fundamentalist groups, believe that the Rapture will occur before this period of tribulation, sparing believers from the hardships that will unfold. In summary, while the provided answer gives an accurate account of the belief in a general final resurrection held by Roman Catholics, Orthodox Christians, Lutheran Christians, and Reformed Christians, it does not encompass the full spectrum of Christian theological perspectives on the Rapture. Therefore, it is recommended to validate the answer with the added context of contrasting denominational stances and consider providing further information on pre-tribulation, mid-tribulation, or post-tribulation views to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the Rapture in a theological sense across Christianity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Context: In man, differences in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, related to ACE (I/D) genotype, are associated with renal prognosis. This raises the hypothesis that individual differences in renal ACE activity are involved in renal susceptibility to inflicted damage. Therefore, we studied the predictive effect of renal ACE activity for the severity of renal damage induced by a single injection of adriamycin in rats.', 'Renal ACE activity (Hip-His-Leu cleavage by cortical homogenates) was determined by renal biopsy in 27 adult male Wistar rats. After 1 week of recovery, proteinuria was induced by adriamycin [1.5 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.) n = 18; controls, saline i.v. n = 9]. Proteinuria was measured every 2 weeks. After 12 weeks, rats were sacrificed and their kidneys harvested.', 'As anticipated, adriamycin elicited nephrotic range proteinuria, renal interstitial damage and mild focal glomerulosclerosis. Baseline renal ACE positively correlated with the relative rise in proteinuria after adriamycin (r = 0.62, P<0.01), renal interstitial alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.49, P<0.05), interstitial macrophage influx (r = 0.56, P<0.05), interstitial collagen III (r = 0.53, P<0.05), glomerular alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.74, P<0.01) and glomerular desmin (r = 0.48, P<0.05). Baseline renal ACE did not correlate with focal glomerulosclerosis (r = 0.22, NS). In controls, no predictive values for renal parameters were observed.Question: Do individual differences in renal ACE activity in healthy rats predict susceptibility to adriamycin-induced renal damage? A:","output":"Yes, individual differences in renal ACE activity in healthy rats predict susceptibility to adriamycin-induced renal damage. Baseline renal ACE positively correlated with various indicators of renal damage, such as the relative rise in proteinuria, renal interstitial damage, and other related factors.

Hypothesis: A village in Romania was depopulated in 2002. This village is one of 5 in a commune.","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the hypothesis is indeed true. The paragraph indicates that Dorobanțu is a commune located in Tulcea County, Romania and is composed of five villages. One of these villages, Ardealu (historically known as \\"Asînlar\\"), was depopulated as of the year 2002, according to the text. A commune is the third-level administrative division in Romania, smaller than a city or a town. Communes are rural localities, and they can comprise one or more villages. In the case of Dorobanțu, it comprises five villages, Ardealu, Cârjelari, Dorobanţu, Fântâna Oilor, and Meșteru, as mentioned in the text. The fact mentioned about the village Ardealu, that it was depopulated as of 2002, fulfills the hypothesis that a village in Romania was depopulated in that year. Though it doesn't provide reasons for why this depopulation occurred, the statement confirms the depopulation point of the hypothesis. In addition, Ardealu being one of the five villages in the commune of Dorobanțu also validates the second part of the hypothesis, which states 'this village is one of 5 in a commune'. Therefore, given this evidence from the paragraph, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is indeed correct. The village of Ardealu, located in the commune of Dorobanțu, was depopulated in the year 2002.

Here's a detailed explanation of each part of the translation: 1. \\"Management\\" - The word \\"management\\" refers to the administration or directing of a company, organization, or business. In French, this can be translated as \\"la direction\\" (literally, \\"the direction\\"), which is commonly used to represent the managerial aspect. 2. \\"and employee\\" - The phrase \\"and employee\\" denotes that the satisfaction to be discussed pertains not only to the management but also to the employees. In French, \\"and\\" is translated as \\"et\\", and \\"employee\\" as \\"employé\\". Therefore, the combined translation for this phrase is \\"et des employés\\". 3. \\"satisfaction\\" - The term \\"satisfaction\\" is used to express the contentment or happiness felt by an individual or a group of individuals. In French, \\"satisfaction\\" maintains the same meaning, spelled as \\"satisfaction\\". 4. \\"output\\" - In this context, \\"output\\" represents the result or outcome of the management and employee satisfaction. The French word for \\"output\\" in this sense is \\"résultat\\", which implies a consequence or outcome. Putting all these translations together, we get \\"satisfaction de la direction et des employés (résultat)\\".

I want to blame it on the fact that I’m absolutely awful with names and can be quite socially awkward. But that has ever been thus. Then I thought that maybe it was a city thing, but that explanation goes but so far. I’m actually beginning to believe that it’s bigger than me, bigger than my block, bigger than this city. I increasingly believe that less neighborliness is becoming intrinsic to the modern American experience — a most unfortunate development. A report issued Wednesday by the Pew Research Center found that only 43 percent of Americans know all or most of their neighbors by name. Twenty-nine percent know only some, and 28 percent know none. (Oh, my God! When Roger dashes off to Paris this summer, I’ll become a “none.”) Yet I have thousands of “friends” and “followers” on the social-networking sites in which I vigorously participate. (In real life, I maintain a circle of friends so small that I could barely arrange a circle.) Something is wrong with this picture. I am by no means a woe-is-us, sky-is-falling, evil-is-the-Internet type. In fact, I think that a free flow of information has led to greater civic engagement. Yippee! However, I am very much aware that social networks are rewiring our relationships and that our keyboard communities are affecting the attachments in our actual ones. For instance, a Pew report issued in November 2009 and entitled “Social Isolation and New Technology” found that “users of social networking services are 26 percent less likely to use their neighbors as a source of companionship.” And a May study by researchers at the University of Michigan found that “college kids today are about 40 percent lower in empathy than their counterparts of 20 or 30 years ago.” The reason? One factor could be social networking. As one researcher put it, “The ease of having ‘friends’ online might make people more likely to just tune out when they don’t feel like responding to others’ problems, a behavior that could carry over offline.” Furthermore, an article in The New York Times on Thursday laid out new research that revealed that “feelings of hurt, jealousy and competition are widespread” among children of parents who obsess over cellphones, instant messaging and Twitter at the expense of familial engagement. There’s no need to pine for a return to the pre-Facebook, cardigan-swaddled idealism of Mister Rogers and his charming “neighbors” and “friends,” but it is important for us to remember that tangible, meaningful engagement with those around us builds better selves and stronger communities. I should post that on Twitter. Write a title for it.","output":"\\"Virtual Connections vs Real-life Neighborliness: The Decline of Community Engagement in Modern America\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sometimes traits can vary from parent to offspring. These changes are due to mutations. Mutations are a random change. Mutations are natural. Some mutations are harmful. In this case, the organism may not live to reproduce. The trait will not be passed onto offspring. Others variations in traits have no effect on survival. Can some mutations be good for a living thing? Other mutations can have great benefits. Imagine being the first moth that can blend into its background. It would have a better chance of survival. A living thing that survives is likely to have offspring. If it does, it may pass the new trait on to its offspring. Thats good news for the offspring. The offspring may be more likely to survive. Mutations are one way living things adapt to new conditions.  Question: \\"Are mutations harmful or natural?\\" Answer: \\"They can be both\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"Yes, the answer to the question \\"Are mutations harmful or natural?\\" is correct. Mutations can be both harmful and natural. They are a natural part of the genetic variation process, which can sometimes result in harmful effects on the organism, while other times leading to beneficial traits that can improve an organism's chances for survival and reproduction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Plot title: Black Robe Movie plot: The film is set in Quebec, New France, 1634. Captain Champlain(Jean Brousseau) approves a proposal by the Jesuits to travel up the St. Lawrence River and restablish contact with a Jesuit mission in the Huron nation. A young Jesuit is chosen to lead the expedition, Father Laforgue(Lothaire Bluteau). Daniel(Aden Young), a young Frenchman working in the outpost is also chosen after he expresses an interest in returning to France and entering the priesthood. Champlain uses pots, knives, hammers and beads to barter for the services of Chomina(August Schellenberg), an Algonquin, to take the men to the Huron mission. Chomina brings his wife(Tantoo Cardinal), young son, and daughter, Annuka(Sandrine Holt), as well as several other men and their families. The group departs and heads up river, but turmoil soon engulfs the expedition. Several of the men fear Laforgue and believe he might be a demon, they employ a sorcerer, who verifies their fears. The group contemplate killing Laforgue, but settle on abandoning him. Daniel, who has grown to love Annuka during the journey, also abandons Laforgue. Laforgue resigns himself to die in the wilderness if it is Gods will. Chomina has a change of heart and returns with his family and Daniel to continue the journey with Laforgue. However, Iroquois discover them and kill Chominas wife before capturing the others. They brutally torture the group, killing Chominas son out-of-hand. Annuka sacrifices her dignity to free the group. They head upriver, but Chomina is now dying, due to wounds received in the encounter with the Iroqouis. Chomina wants to die peacefully, but Laforgue begs him to convert. He sends them on their way, still unbaptised. Annuka and Daniel take Laforgue still further, before leaving him within walking distance of the Huron settlement. When Laforgue enters the settlement, he finds the Hurons are decimated by scarlet fever. One of the missionaries has been killed and the other is dying. The Hurons debate on whether or not to kill Laforgue, some believe the fever... My question: Members of what nation attack the group and kill Chomina's wife?

Jake Culshaw, 25, of no fixed address, and brothers John and Paul Martin, aged 20 and 25, of Walton, all deny murder. The prosecution claim they mistakenly targeted Lewis as they sought revenge following an earlier altercation. The accused men had been involved in violent clashes with another group before Lewis was killed, the jury was told. James Watson, who found Lewis on a canal towpath, told the court he was standing on a bridge over the canal when he saw something below. As he got close, he realised it was a person whose eyes were open and who had blood coming from the nose. He then went to get help from a nearby house. The man he alerted, Daniel Newby, said he had heard a \\"very very loud bang\\" which he thought must have been a gun. He also heard a low \\"moan sound - 'aah'\\" which he now believes was the noise Lewis made after he was shot. Another witness, Zoe Poole, described hearing a loud bang and seeing men run away from the scene quickly - one of them holding something long. Some of Lewis's relatives left the court in tears as the jury heard the details of how he came to be found. The prosecution claim the defendants believed Lewis to be a member of the rival group with which they had clashed earlier that day because he had similar-looking curly hair. The jury were shown CCTV footage of cars ramming and chasing each other in the early hours of the day on which Lewis was shot. Witnesses described how groups of men chased each other on foot and in cars in and around pubs in the Vauxhall Road area of Liverpool. One witness described one of the men as having hair as \\"sticking out wild from his baseball cap.

Pick from: [a]. keep a layer of plastic between the cake and candle.. [b]. only light them just before you want to serve it..","output":"To determine the more sound option in terms of naive physics reasoning, let's analyze each one step-by-step and justify the choice. [a]. Keep a layer of plastic between the cake and candle - A layer of plastic would act as a barrier to prevent the candle wax from dripping directly onto the ice cream cake. - However, this does not address the heat generated by the lit candles, which could still melt the ice cream cake in close proximity. - Additionally, the plastic may also melt due to the heat from the candles, leading to an undesirable situation. [b]. Only light them just before you want to serve it - Lighting the candles just before serving the ice cream cake minimizes the exposure time to heat produced by the candles. - This reduces the risk of the cake melting significantly, as the candles will be lit for a very short period. - Additionally, this option does not involve the use of plastic, which, as previously mentioned, has its own drawbacks. Based on the above reasoning, it can be concluded that option [b]. \\"only light them just before you want to serve it\\" is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning.

Focusing a lens: This pertains to the process of adjusting a lens to concentrate or redirect light, which is not what a mirror is primarily used for. III. Kinetic energy: This is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion, which does not have a direct relation to a mirror's function. IV. Sound waves: These waves refer to the mechanical vibrations generated through a medium, such as air or water. Mirrors do not reflect sound waves. V. Sun's heat: Although the sun emits heat, a mirror mainly reflects visible light. Some mirrors can reflect and focus heat, like those used in solar cookers, but typically the visible light is what's primarily reflected. VI. Heat energy: This is a form of energy related to an object's temperature. While mirrors can reflect some heat energy alongside visible light, their main purpose is to reflect visible light. VII. Body water: This refers to the water contained within the human body, which has no direct relevance to a mirror's function. VIII.
