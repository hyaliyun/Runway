It was acquired by AVCO American Airlines in 1930 .","output":"While both sentences convey the same central message that a company was taken over by American Airlines in 1930, there are slight contextual differences that impact the interpretation of each sentence. Let's break down the sentences to understand the nuances better. Sentence 1: \\"In 1930, it was purchased by American Airlines to become AVCO.\\" In this sentence, the focus is on the specific year (1930) when an unnamed company was purchased by American Airlines. The purpose of the acquisition is explicitly mentioned – \\"to become AVCO.\\" It implies that American Airlines bought the company with the primary intention of using it to form or establish a new entity named AVCO. It suggests that the acquisition was strategically planned to create AVCO. Sentence 2: \\"It was acquired by AVCO American Airlines in 1930.\\" This sentence also conveys that an unnamed company was taken over by American Airlines in 1930. However, in this sentence, the acquiring entity is referred to as \\"AVCO American Airlines.\\" It implies that at the time of acquisition, American Airlines was already known as AVCO American Airlines, or it could mean that American Airlines acquired the company on behalf of AVCO. There is no indication in this sentence about American Airlines' intention to create a new entity named AVCO or rebrand the acquired company as AVCO. In summary, both sentences imply that a certain company was acquired by American Airlines in 1930. However, the first sentence emphasizes the purpose of the acquisition - to create or establish AVCO, while the second sentence only states that the company was acquired by AVCO American Airlines, without providing any information about the purpose or strategy behind the acquisition. Ideally, more context is needed to fully understand the situation and the relationship between American Airlines, AVCO, and the acquired company."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In a touching story, a family was shocked to find that a stranger had secretly paid for more than half of their Christmas gifts. When Ayers went to make a payment toward the 283 balance for her family's Christmas gifts at Walmart, her money was refused. According to a Walmart employee, a woman had paid a part of Ayers' bill after seeing her shopping in the store. The unknown woman also left Ayers a touching note, which left the mother of two in tears. Ayers, whose sons are 11 and 3, says the stranger's great generosity came at the perfect time for her family. Before the anonymous payment was made, Ayers had worried she would not be able to get her kids' toys in time for Christmas. Ayers is still looking for the woman who helped pay for their Christmas gifts for her kids. She took a picture of her receipt with the headline: This stranger paid 4 gifts for us. I wish I could thank her for helping give our kids a Merry Christmas! For thousands of families like Ayers', feeling this financial pressure around Christmastime is nothing new. These families who still have a roof over their heads and food on their tables often slip through the cracks -- they can afford all the necessities, but the \\"extras\\" are harder to come by. Considering that Americans are estimated to spend 882 on Christmas gifts this year, it makes sense that a family with a few financial problems would have a hard time filling the stockings for their kids. Realizing how common this Christmas problem really is makes Ayers' story even more special. These random acts of kindness around the holidays, often from nameless strangers, can determine what a family's Christmas looks like. Christmas may not be all about the material stuff, but for families, and especially for kids, it's the little things that can make the biggest difference.

(CNN) -- Branden Grace duly completed his front running victory at the Dunhill Links Championships Sunday after coming under last round pressure from Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen at St Andrews.  Grace, winning for the fifth time in a superb 2012, four coming on the European Tour, ended two ahead of Olesen after carding a final round 70 for a record 22-under total in the tournament.  \\"It feels awesome,\\" the South African told the official European Tour website after a victory that has lifted him to third in the The Race to Dubai.  He has now targeted No.1 Rory McIlroy in the battle for the overall honors in Europe.  \\"It's definitely in my sights,\\" he said.  Grace, who is yet another graduate of the Ernie Els Foundation, led from the first round at Kingsbarns where he shot a stunning 12-under 60.  But when Olesen carded two straight birdies around the turn and Grace three-putted the short 11th for a bogey, they were level.  But Grace pulled away with a stunning hat-trick of birdies only interrupted by a bogey on the Road Hole 17th.  He still had a two-shot lead playing the last which they both birdied.  Alexander Noren of Sweden finished third, four shots back, with Joel Sjoholm of Sweden in fourth.  Scot Stephen Gallacher, a former Dunhill winner, was making superb last day progress until he accidentally played the ball of an amateur partner Steve Halsall on the 16th fairway.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Some Chinese new-rich like eating shark fin soup because they think it shows their class. However, for the Chinese NBA idol Yao Ming, doing so is unacceptable as the practice has led to the overfishing of sharks. When Yao and his wife Ye Li got married in 2007, they publicly announced that they would not allow shark fin soup to be served at their wedding banquet. Actually, Yao had been saying no to shark fins since 2006, when he was appointed as the Goodwill Ambassador for wild life protection. Now, the 226-cm big guy is resorting to his personal influence to encourage more to say no to eating the soup and to raise awareness of animal protection. \\"Sharks are friends of human beings. They are not our food,\\" Yao said. Other celebrity athletes like Olympic champions Li Ning and Kong Linghui are following on the heels of Yao, throwing themselves into serving the public as Goodwill Ambassadors for wild animal rescue. Recent reports about Yao's retirement have saddened tens of thousands of basketball fans both at home and abroad. Yet Yao's influence goes far beyond the basketball courts. Yao has engaged himself in charity and public welfare services for quite a while. When the devastating 8.0-magnitude earthquake hit Wenchuan in southwest China in 2008, Yao donated 2 million yuan . \\"When I was a little boy, my parents and teachers told me to help others and to be a good man,\\" Yao recalled.  \\"But I could not donate then because I had not much pocket money. After I moved to Houston, I got involved in quite a number of community service activities and I felt a strong sense of achievement when I got people together,\\" Yao said. Like Yao, newly crowned French Open champion Li Na has showed her willingness to donate. Li gave 480,000 yuan of her prize money from the open, plus 20,000 yuan from her own pocket, to a local nursing home in her hometown. Another Chinese sports icon, hurdler Liu Xiang, has also been actively involved in charity for years.

Place this saucepan on the stove over high heat, keeping it there until it reaches a rolling boil. Before boiling the water, make sure that you have enough water in your saucepan to melt the honey. Place the jar inside the saucepan and check the water level. The level of water should approximately match the level of honey inside the jar.    {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a3/Melt-Honey-Step-2Bullet1.jpg/v4-460px-Melt-Honey-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/a/a3/Melt-Honey-Step-2Bullet1.jpg/aid4671118-v4-728px-Melt-Honey-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use\\">Fair Use</a> (screenshot)<br>n</p></div>\\"} After the water reaches a steady boil, remove it from the stove and set it down on a heat-resistant surface. Alternatively, you can keep the water on the stove and reduce the heat to low. Before placing the jar of honey in the water, though, you need to make sure that all simmering stops. Hot temperatures will not make the honey inedible, but temperatures above 110 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) can destroy some of the beneficial health properties of the honey.    {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/ec/Melt-Honey-Step-3Bullet1.jpg/v4-460px-Melt-Honey-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/e/ec/Melt-Honey-Step-3Bullet1.jpg/aid4671118-v4-728px-Melt-Honey-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use\\">Fair Use</a> (screenshot)<br>n</p></div>\\"} Sit the jar of honey directly on the bottom of the pan so that it is now surrounded on all sides by hot water. If you are using a lid, make sure that the lid is on very loose. You want to prevent water from getting inside while allowing air to escape. If you tighten the lid too much, pressure could build up inside of the jar and cause the glass to crack.    {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/df/Melt-Honey-Step-4Bullet1.jpg/v4-460px-Melt-Honey-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/d/df/Melt-Honey-Step-4Bullet1.jpg/aid4671118-v4-728px-Melt-Honey-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use\\">Fair Use</a> (screenshot)<br>n</p></div>\\"} Periodically remove the lid and stir the honey while the jar is still sitting inside the hot water. This can help the honey melt more evenly and at a quicker pace.  Continue doing this until the honey melts. If you are trying to melt crystallized granules out, keep at it until you no longer see any crystals left. If you are trying to melt thick, raw honey, continue melting it in the hot water until it thins to the consistency of store-bought honey.    {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c5/Melt-Honey-Step-5Bullet1.jpg/v4-460px-Melt-Honey-Step-5Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/c/c5/Melt-Honey-Step-5Bullet1.jpg/aid4671118-v4-728px-Melt-Honey-Step-5Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use\\">Fair Use</a> (screenshot)<br>n</p></div>\\"}  This process can take a long time depending on how much honey you have.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I normally do not post certain types of things on my blog or on social media, like political messages, but today I feel compelled. I’ve been thinking for the last few days about the most recent school shooting in Parkland, and my overwhelming emotion right after grief is rage. I am so angry it makes me cry and for those of you out there who know me, angry-cry is the end-stage, top-of-the-gauge level of angry for me. I am angry that as a nation, we continue to wring our hands and bemoan each mass shooting but we don’t take any action to stop the next one. I am angry that our elected officials have failed us in the most spectacular way possible by being unable to work together or to set aside special interests to protect the lives and safety of Americans, including our most vulnerable citizens, our children. I am angry that time and time again, we the people and our elected officials weigh the value of human lives against countless other things (Second Amendment, special interests, party disagreements, inertia, whatever) and the value of human life comes up short in the calculations. I am angry at myself for believing at any point in the last several years that I could trust lawmakers to address this epidemic and I am angry at myself for feeling so helpless that I have not personally taken action. This stops now. I am angry that in 2012, 20 6-7 year old children and 6 adults were murdered in Sandy Hook and in the 5+ years since, we have done nothing meaningful to stop this. To me, this is tantamount to saying that we as a nation are OK with this. I don’t think we are, but that’s the message we’re sending if we don’t force our government to do something. According to the New York Times, there have been 239 school shootings nationwide since Sandy Hook with 438 people shot, 138 who died. Question: When did Sandy Hook happen?

Graham Sutter Answer:","output":"Title: The Shadow of Sutter Genre: Thriller/Action Plot: Act 1: Fading Consequences Martin Banks, a prominent investigative journalist, stumbles onto a lead that might expose a massive human trafficking ring. The mysterious mastermind behind the organization is believed to be the infamous Graham Sutter, a brilliant and psychopathic criminal that has evaded law enforcement for decades. One night, Martin decides to meet with an insider who has key information on Sutter and the trafficking network. However, the meeting turns into a trap set by Sutter's henchmen, and Martin is kidnapped. Act 2: A Desperate Search Samantha, Martin's wife, starts growing increasingly concerned when her husband does not return home. Upon discovering his research and recognizing the danger he was in, Samantha teams up with Michael Rodriguez, a disgraced ex-FBI agent who has been obsessed with capturing Sutter for many years and carries a grudge for a past encounter that left visible and invisible scars on him. Martin's research implies that Sutter's operations use a series of abandoned warehouses as a front for their clandestine activities. Ignoring the warnings of the local law enforcement, Samantha and Michael begin a desperate quest to locate Martin. As they explore abandoned warehouses and chase leads throughout the city, they discover shocking levels of corruption among high-ranking officials and police officers, all of whom are involved in the trafficking organization. Act 3: The Lair of the Beast Samantha and Michael finally locate Martin at an underground hideout, where the victims of Sutter's trafficking ring are held captive before being forced into slavery. Wracked with guilt for failing to bring down Sutter before, Michael takes it upon himself to lead the assault on Sutter's lair. As they make their way through the compound, they face a series of traps and deadly confrontations with Sutter's henchmen. However, they ultimately succeed in rescuing Martin and numerous other captives. Sutter, aware that his empire is crumbling, flees the scene before they can apprehend him. Act 4: Justice Pursued After the raid, Martin and Samantha struggle to adapt to normal life, knowing they are safe for now but that the elusive Graham Sutter is still out there. Despite their challenges, the couple grows closer than ever, drawing strength from each other.  Determined to bring down Sutter once and for all, Samantha and Michael team up again, armed with the information Martin had gathered, to track down Sutter's connections around the world. As they inch closer to Sutter, they unravel a web of global corruption that goes much deeper than they ever imagined. In the final act, they corner Sutter in an epic showdown, only to find out that he is just a pawn in a much more extensive criminal network. Graham Sutter is ultimately killed during the confrontation. However, this apparent closure leaves behind a trail of unanswered questions and a sense of foreboding that the greater threat still looms in the shadows. Michael, Samantha, and Martin decide to continue their pursuit of justice, using their unique skill sets to take down the criminal underworld and the faceless leaders of this sinister network. The film ends on a note of cautious optimism, as the trio emerges as a force to be reckoned with, resolved to make a difference, no matter the cost."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

McCain Looks for a Home-Court Advantage ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. - Republican John McCain stepped up his assault on Democratic rival Barack Obama as he campaigned energetically in the West, claiming Saturday a home-court edge in crucial battleground states in the region. \\"I'm a fellow Westerner, I understand the issues, I understand the challenges the great Western states face,\\" said McCain, an Arizona senator. \\"We know what our great Southwest is, we welcome it and I'm proud to be a senator from the West.\\" McCain continued to portray Obama -- a senator from Illinois -- as a tax-and-spend liberal certain to push for more government and higher spending, but he added a twist as he stumped through New Mexico and Texas. \\"Sen. Obama has never been south of the border,\\" said McCain, arguing that he has a feel for issues like water that resonate throughout the region. McCain also pointed to the likelihood that Democrats would continue controlling Congress after the election, meaning winning the White House would give the party total control of the government. He warned that a \\"Democratic congressional agenda\\" would become the nation's should Obama win. With polls showing him behind Obama nationally, McCain pledged a scrappy close to the campaign. \\"We're a few points down and the pundits, of course, as they have four or five times, have written us off,\\" he said. \\"We've got them just where we want them. We like being the underdog.\\"McCain swept through New Mexico, with a dip into Texas, looking to reverse polls showing him trailing in states in the Southwest. Later he was to head to Iowa in hopes of putting that state's seven electoral votes in play. Seeking to energize his backers, McCain said Obama was \\"more interested in controlling wealth than creating it.\\" \\"He believes in redistributing wealth,\\" McCain told about 1,500 at an outdoor rally in New Mexico. \\"We've seen that movie before in other countries. That's not America.\\" His challenge was daunting in the campaign's closing days. With a big financial advantage, Obama was far outspending McCain on television advertising, and even as McCain stumped through Colorado he was cutting back on his paid media in that state. He sounded undeterred. \\"Don't let Barack Obama buy New Mexico,\\" said the Arizona senator. It's unusual for presidential candidates to be defending neighboring states in the campaign's closing days. Obama was scheduled to sweep through New Mexico in the day Along the way, McCain was moving to put more distance between himself and the unpopular President Bush. \\"We cannot spend the next four years as we have much of the last eight, hoping for our luck to change at home and abroad,\\" McCain said. \\"We have to act, we need a new direction and we have to fight for it.\\" What was this article about?","output":"This article is about Republican John McCain's campaign efforts against Democratic rival Barack Obama during the 2008 Presidential election. McCain sought to emphasize his understanding of the Western states' issues and challenges, while portraying Obama as a tax-and-spend liberal who lacked experience in the region. He also warned about the possibility of total Democratic control of the government if Obama were to win. Despite polls showing him behind Obama nationally, McCain pledged a determined close to the campaign and sought to energize his supporters by criticizing Obama's wealth policies.

Please answer this question: ratio of indian flag in length and breath?","output":"The Indian flag, also known as the \\"Tiranga\\" or the tricolor, is the pride of the nation and represents the country's unity, integrity, and diversity. The flag's dimensions are carefully outlined in the Flag Code of India. The Indian national flag has a precise ratio of length to breadth, as specified in the Indian National Flag rules and regulation. The ratio is 3:2, which means the length of the national flag must be 1.5 times longer than its breadth. To elaborate, if the flag's breadth (height) is 2 units, then it must have a length or width equal to 3 units. The flag is divided into three horizontal bands of equal size, with the top band being saffron (or kesari), the middle band white, and the bottom band green. At the center of the white band lies a navy blue wheel with 24 spokes, known as the \\"Ashoka Chakra,\\" symbolizing the eternal cycle of time and progress. Every aspect of the Indian flag has been purposefully designed to represent various elements of India's rich historical and cultural background. The saffron color symbolizes strength and courage, the white stands for peace and truth, while the green represents growth and prosperity. The Ashoka Chakra, with its 24 spokes, signifies the hours in a day, representing continuance and the circle of life. The flag's ratio of 3:2 ensures that its design remains proportionate and visually balanced when displayed on occasions such as Republic Day and Independence Day. It's important to follow the exact specifications when creating, manufacturing, and hoisting the Indian national flag to maintain its sanctity and abide by the Flag Code of India."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

His public profile remained low throughout the 1970s, although his name appeared occasionally in the music press. By this time, his parents were receiving an increasing number of fans and admirers as visitors to the family home. Island Records, following a 1975 NME article written by Nick Kent, stated they had no plans of repackaging Drake's albums, but in 1979 Rob Partridge joined Island Records as press officer and commissioned the release of the Fruit Tree box set. The release compiled the three studio albums, the four tracks recorded with Wood in 1974, and an extensive biography written by the American journalist Arthur Lubow. Although sales were poor, Island Records never deleted the three albums from its catalogue.By the mid-1980s, Drake was being cited as an influence by musicians such as Peter Buck of R.E.M. and Robert Smith of the Cure; Smith credited the origin of his band's name to a lyric from Drake's song \\"Time Has Told Me\\" (\\"a troubled cure for a troubled mind\\"). Drake gained further exposure in 1985 with the release of the Dream Academy's hit single \\"Life in a Northern Town\\", which included a dedication to Drake on its sleeve. In 1986, a biography of Drake was published in Danish; it was translated, updated with new interviews, and published in English in February 2012. Drake's reputation continued to grow, and by the end of the 1980s, his name was appearing regularly in newspapers and music magazines in the United Kingdom; he had come to represent a \\"doomed romantic hero\\".On 20 June 1998, BBC Radio 2 broadcast a documentary, Fruit Tree: The Nick Drake Story, featuring interviews with Boyd, Wood, Gabrielle and Molly Drake, Paul Wheeler, Robert Kirby and Ashley Hutchings, and narrated by Danny Thompson. In early 1999, BBC2 aired a 40-minute documentary, A Stranger Among Us—In Search of Nick Drake. The following year, Dutch director Jeroen Berkvens released the documentary A Skin Too Few: The Days of Nick Drake, featuring interviews with Boyd, Gabrielle Drake, Wood and Kirby. Later that year, The Guardian placed Bryter Layter number one in its \\"Alternative Top 100 Albums Ever\\" list. In November 2014, Gabrielle published a biography of Drake.

Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Where did Napoleon NOT invade, the Americas or Spain? Context: The decolonization of the Americas was the process by which the countries in the Americas gained their independence from European rule. Decolonization began with a series of revolutions in the late 18th and early-to-mid-19th centuries. The Spanish American wars of independence were the numerous wars against Spanish rule in Spanish America that took place during the early 19th century, from 1808 until 1829, directly related to the Napoleonic French invasion of Spain. The conflict started with short-lived governing juntas established in Chuquisaca and Quito opposing the composition of the Supreme Central Junta of Seville. The answer is:","output":"To extract the answer to the question, we'll follow these steps: 1. Analyze the question: The question asks us where Napoleon did NOT invade - the Americas or Spain? 2.

Identify relevant information: The context states that the wars against Spanish rule in Spanish America were \\"directly related to the Napoleonic French invasion of Spain.\\" 4.

This means that Thomas Reiter was eventually able to take his position, and it did not need to be filled by Sergey Volkov due to the postponement.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. This House believes that God exists What argument could one make about this debate topic?","output":"One could make a detailed and robust argument in favor of the belief that God exists, drawing from various philosophical, moral, cosmological, and experiential perspectives. Here's an extensive exploration of five significant arguments that could be presented in this debate: 1. Cosmological Argument (First Cause): This argument posits that everything that exists must have a cause, and this line of causation must necessarily lead to a first, or uncaused, cause. Since the universe is a vast and complex system of existence, there must be an uncaused cause, or a \\"Prime Mover,\\" responsible for setting everything into motion. This uncaused cause is identified as God, who serves as the originating logic and power for all existence. 2. Teleological Argument (Design Argument): The teleological argument contends that the intricate order, structure, and complexity of the universe are compelling proof of intelligent design. Considering the natural world's interdependent systems, the precise tuning of the universe's physical constants, and the emergence of conscious life, it seems improbable that these phenomena were products of mere chance. Instead, an intelligent designer, i.e., God, is viewed as the most plausible explanation behind the universe's fine-tuned properties, which allow for the development and sustenance of life. 3. Moral Argument: The moral argument suggests that the existence of objective moral values and duties are best explained by the presence of a morally perfect and transcendent being. While moral relativism posits that concepts of right and wrong depend on social, cultural, or personal factors, the moral argument advocates for an absolute moral law that transcends individual perceptions. This ultimate moral authority can only come from an all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good creator who imbues human beings with intrinsic worth and moral guidance. 4. Ontological Argument: The ontological argument is a philosophical position that asserts that the very concept of God as the maximally perfect being necessitates God's existence. Based on the premise that existence is a greater quality than non-existence, it follows that, since God is defined as the greatest conceivable being, God must possess the property of existence. To deny the existence of such a perfect being would be logically contradictory, as it implies that there could be something greater than the greatest conceivable being. 5. Religious Experiences and Intuitions: This argument acknowledges the countless reports of personal religious experiences and intuitions from individuals of various cultures and religious backgrounds. From divine revelations to mystical experiences, these subjective encounters could be seen as evidence of a higher power at work in human lives. While critics might dismiss religious experiences as delusions or wishful thinking, the cumulative weight of these experiences throughout history consistently points to something transcendent and suggests that God's existence is manifest in people's lives. In conclusion, the belief in God's existence can be debated and substantiated using a combination of cosmological, teleological, moral, ontological, and experiential arguments. When examined collectively, these perspectives provide a multifaceted and compelling case for the reality of a transcendent, divine being underlying the very fabric of the universe and shaping human understanding of morality, purpose, and existence itself."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

What is the last name of the person whose refusal to modify his position in the postwar Cold War era led to a more prolonged semi-ostracism of his music?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Alan Dudley Bush (22 December 1900 – 31 October 1995) was a British composer, pianist, conductor, teacher and political activist. A committed communist, his uncompromising political beliefs were often reflected in his music. He composed prolifically across a range of genres, but struggled through his lifetime for recognition from the British musical establishment, which largely ignored his works. Bush, from a prosperous middle-class background, enjoyed considerable success as a student at the Royal Academy of Music (RAM) in the early 1920s, and spent much of that decade furthering his compositional and piano-playing skills under distinguished tutors. A two-year period in Berlin in 1929 to 1931, early in the Nazi Party's rise to power, cemented Bush's political convictions and moved him from the mainstream Labour Party to the Communist Party of Great Britain which he joined in 1935. He wrote several large-scale works in the 1930s, and was heavily involved with workers' choirs for whom he composed pageants, choruses and songs. His pro-Soviet stance led to a temporary ban on his music by the BBC in the early years of the Second World War, and his refusal to modify his position in the postwar Cold War era led to a more prolonged semi-ostracism of his music. As  a result, the four major operas he wrote between 1950 and 1970 were all premiered in East Germany. In his prewar works, Bush's style retained what commentators have described as an essential Englishness, but was also influenced by the avant-garde European idioms of the inter-war years. During and after the war he began to simplify this style, in line with his Marxism-inspired belief that music should be accessible to the mass of the people. Despite the difficulties he encountered in getting his works performed in the West he continued to compose until well into his eighties. He taught composition at the RAM for more than 50 years, published two books, was the founder and long-time president of the Workers' Music Association, and served as chairman and...

Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","output":"No, these two sentences do not mean the same thing. They contain different information in regards to the locations of the individual's death and burial.  In sentence (1), it is mentioned that the individual passed away at Fort Edward on August 18, 1861, and was later buried at the Union Cemetery in Sandy Hill. This implies that the person died in Fort Edward, which is presumably a distinct location from Sandy Hill, and then their body was transported and buried in Sandy Hill's Union Cemetery.

Question: What is the opinion of the author regarding regions of DNA that serve no obvious function? Context: Whereas the chromosomes of prokaryotes are relatively gene-dense, those of eukaryotes often contain regions of DNA that serve no obvious function. Simple single-celled eukaryotes have relatively small amounts of such DNA, whereas the genomes of complex multicellular organisms, including humans, contain an absolute majority of DNA without an identified function. This DNA has often been referred to as \\"junk DNA\\". However, more recent analyses suggest that, although protein-coding DNA makes up barely 2% of the human genome, about 80% of the bases in the genome may be expressed, so the term \\"junk DNA\\" may be a misnomer.

Possible answers:  a). Yes  b). No Answer:","output":"b). No Potassium is an essential mineral and electrolyte that plays a vital role in a wide range of biological processes for animals, but it does not involve duplicating itself. Some of the primary functions of potassium in an animal's body include: 1. Maintaining fluid balance: Potassium helps regulate the balance of fluids in the body, both within cells and outside of them. 2. Supporting proper muscle function: Potassium is necessary for the normal functioning of muscles, including both voluntary muscles (like the ones in your arms and legs) and involuntary muscles (like the ones in your digestive system and heart). 3. Managing nerve function: Potassium is crucial for the proper functioning of the nervous system. It helps generate nerve impulses and facilitates communication between nerve cells. 4. Regulating blood pressure: Potassium helps to balance the concentrations of other minerals like sodium in the body, which in turn aids in regulating blood pressure. 5. Supporting heart health: As potassium is essential for regulating muscle contractions, it is particularly important for the proper functioning of the heart. Adequate potassium levels help to maintain a regular heartbeat and reduce the risk of irregularities.

Movie title: Mission: Impossible III Movie plot: Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has retired from being an IMF team leader, instead opting for a quiet life with his fiancée Julia (Michelle Monaghan), a hospital nurse (who was the captive in the opening sequence). During their engagement party, Ethan is contacted by IMF Operations Director Musgrave (Billy Crudup) who provides him with a disposable camera. After viewing a video hidden in the camera, he finds out Musgrave wants him to rescue Agent Lindsey Farris (Keri Russell), Ethan's protégé, who has been captured in Berlin by Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a prominent dealer in the international black market (the captor from the opening). He reluctantly agrees to participate in the mission and meets the team which has been selected for him, consisting of Declan Gormley (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), Zhen (Maggie Q), and his old partner, Luther Stickel (Ving Rhames).The team assaults an enemy stronghold in Berlin and extracts Agent Farris successfully, but she dies during their escape when an explosive capsule placed inside her head detonates. After Lindsey's funeral, Ethan is notified of a \\"package\\" sent to him by Lindsey, and discovers that it is a microdot hidden under the stamp in a blank postcard. Ethan discusses its possible importance with Luther and both decide to keep its existence a secret.Using information recovered from a laptop in the Berlin mission, Ethan then decides to go after Davian himself, targeting him at a meeting in Vatican City, where a lucrative transaction involving a mysterious object, codenamed \\"The Rabbit's Foot\\", is apparently taking place. Neither of Ethan's superiors, directors Brassel (Laurence Fishburne) or Musgrave, has authorized the mission.

Answer:","output":"In Mission: Impossible III, Ethan Hunt uses a tracking device and his team's skills to find and rescue Julia, his fiancée. After their wedding ceremony at the hospital, Ethan and his team head to Rome, where they successfully abduct the villain Owen Davian. However, during their attempted flight back to the U.S., Davian's men manage to intercept and attack the plane, ultimately leading to Davian's escape. In retaliation, Davian captures Julia as leverage to force Ethan to retrieve the mysterious object known as \\"The Rabbit's Foot.\\" To find Julia, Ethan first needs to secure the Rabbit's Foot. He and his team infiltrate the Shanghai building where it is located, successfully acquiring the object in a daring heist. Next, Ethan negotiates with Davian to make an exchange: the Rabbit's Foot for Julia's location and her safe release. To determine Julia's precise location, Ethan plants a tracking device on the disposable cell phone he is given to communicate with Davian. When Davian calls with further instructions about the exchange site, the tracking device picks up the signal and allows Ethan's team to trace it back to its origin. This leads them to a warehouse where Julia is being held captive. In the end, it is a combination of a tracking device, tactical strategy, and the skills of his team members that enable Ethan to successfully find and rescue Julia from the clutches of Owen Davian. Considering whether to invest in this film proposal would depend on various factors such as the potential for commercial success, the appeal of the storyline, the presence of well-known actors, and the target demographic. Mission: Impossible III is packed with intense action, a captivating plot, and an established star-studded cast, making it an attractive investment opportunity for those with an interest in action-thriller films.

A: A:","output":"The structures of the cardiovascular system that help regulate body processes by either constricting or dilating are blood vessels, including arteries, arterioles, veins, and venules. These blood vessels play a crucial role in maintaining blood pressure, blood flow, and the distribution of blood throughout the body. Step 1: Blood vessels regulate blood flow Blood vessels can constrict or dilate to regulate blood flow. This is essential for maintaining proper blood pressure and ensuring that oxygen, nutrients, and waste products are adequately distributed throughout the body. Step 2: Arteries and arterioles Arteries and arterioles are responsible for carrying oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the rest of the body. They have muscular walls that can contract or relax, allowing them to regulate blood pressure and blood flow to different tissues. Step 3: Veins and venules Veins and venules return oxygen-poor blood to the heart. They also have the ability to constrict or dilate, which helps to regulate blood pressure and blood flow back to the heart. Step 4: Smooth muscle layers The walls of arteries, arterioles, veins, and venules are composed of layers of smooth muscle. The contraction and relaxation of these smooth muscle layers is influenced by neuronal input, hormones, and local factors, which in turn helps to regulate the constriction and dilation of blood vessels. Step 5: Endothelial cells Blood vessels are lined with endothelial cells, which produce substances such as nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and endothelin-1. These substances influence the contraction and relaxation of the surrounding smooth muscle layers, thereby regulating the constriction and dilation of blood vessels. Step 6: Autoregulation in tissues Some body tissues have the ability to autoregulate blood flow by altering the resistance of their arterioles in response to changes in tissue needs. This allows for adjustments in blood flow to ensure that the tissue receives an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients. In summary, the blood vessels in the cardiovascular system, comprised of arteries, arterioles, veins, and venules, along with their smooth muscle layers and endothelial cells, help regulate body processes by constricting or dilating to control blood flow and pressure."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: What term is used to describe major changes in the genetic material?   A: Answer:","output":"The term \\"Chromosomal Alterations\\" is used to describe major changes in the genetic material. These alterations are significant adjustments to the structure and organization of chromosomes, which contain the genetic information in the form of DNA sequences. Chromosomes play a vital role in the transmission of hereditary traits during cell division and reproduction.  Chromosomal alterations can result from several mechanisms such as deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations. These changes can have a wide range of effects on the organism, depending on the type and extent of the alteration. 1. Deletions: These occur when a portion of the chromosomal material is lost or removed. This can lead to a loss of essential genes or disruptions in the regulation of gene expression, causing various physiological and developmental disorders. 2. Duplications: This involves the addition of extra copies of genetic material, which may lead to an increase in gene expression or the emergence of new functions for these duplicated genes. Duplications can provide novel genetic resources for evolution and adaptation but may also lead to genetic disorders if the increase in gene dosage disturbs normal cellular functions. 3. Inversions: An inversion occurs when a chromosome segment breaks and then reattaches in the reverse orientation. This rearrangement can disrupt gene function by altering gene order or changing the regulation of gene expression. In some cases, inversions can lead to the formation of new genes with novel functions, contributing to evolution and adaptation. 4. Translocations: This type of chromosomal alteration involves the exchange of genetic material between non-homologous chromosomes. Translocations can result in the fusion of two different genes, creating a new hybrid gene with potentially altered functions. Translocations can have significant effects on the phenotype of an organism, contributing to genetic diversity and speciation, or causing genetic disorders depending on the specific genes involved. Chromosomal alterations play a critical role in shaping the genetic diversity and evolutionary adaptation of species. However, they can also have negative consequences if they disrupt essential genes or regulatory elements, leading to genetic disorders and other health conditions. Studying chromosomal alterations helps researchers gain a deeper understanding of the molecular basis of various genetic diseases and disorders, paving the way for potential therapeutic interventions and advancing our knowledge of the principles governing genetic inheritance and evolution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: If you’ve ever seen travel photos of Venice or been to Venice yourself, you’re probably familiar with the Rialto Bridge. The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.” The version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway. The Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge. Beginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge. Andrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte’s. After the end of this story, Rialto Bridge's is probably: - still new - In need of renovations - An historical landmark - not enough information Answer:","output":"An historical landmark"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Valley farm used only organic methods and non-GMO seeds.  and a hint : Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination...  Please answer this question : Which farm had fewer iron deficiencies in some crops?

Article: House Hunters and its many spinoffs are a pop culture phenomenon, but the iconic narrator has always been heard and not seen — until now.      To any HGTV fan, Andromeda Dunker has a voice that is instantly recognizable. Her gliding cadence and dulcet tone are as soothing as the comfort-food reality TV shows she narrates. Since 2009, Dunker has voiced literally thousands of episodes of the House Hunters franchise, becoming an integral part of the HGTV juggernaut, which drew almost 25 million primetime viewers each month last year. While the buyers and cities may change, the narrator does not. Episode after episode, Dunker introduces us to a new couple and a new location but with the same singsong intonation and honeyed tone. She is the show. Yet, she hasn’t been seen on camera on the network, not even once. On a channel brimming with handsome homebuilders and homespun husband-and-wife property stars, the woman who gives voice to some of the network’s most popular and obsessively watched shows stands apart; unlike the others, she is heard but not seen, HGTV’s most famous unfamous person. “I’ve remained in the shadows,” Dunker told BuzzFeed News. “The conventional wisdom for voiceover actors is you are kind of heard and not seen. It’s just kind of the way it’s always been.” And she’s never given an extensive interview before — until now. “The network has preferred to keep me in a little bit of mystery because that’s just worked out, but now it’s kinda different,” she said. From just 26 episodes in the 1999 first season, the House Hunters franchise has exploded into a cult pop culture phenomenon, airing an astonishing 447 episodes in 2015 across a seemingly endless list of spinoffs: House Hunters International, Tiny House Hunters, House Hunters Renovation, House Hunters Off the Grid, House Hunters: Where Are They Now?, to name but a few. “My first year [in 2009], we did not know there would be so many shows and spinoffs,” Dunker said. “There was only just House Hunters and House Hunters International at that time, and not every day like how it is now. There have been like 10 spinoffs now. So I had no idea it was going to explode into this much work.”      All the shows are unashamedly formulaic — but hey, the formula works: One property-hunting (hopefully slightly annoying) couple with completely opposing views of what they’re each after; a local real-estate agent who must show abundant patience; three house tours, including a “budget-buster” and a fixer-upper for good measure (“This house is too tiny!” someone on Tiny House Hunters will inevitably proclaim); and a walk-on-the-beach finale where a choice is eventually made. Watching on the couch with friends and wine invariably involves guessing amongst one another which house will be chosen, and then screaming at the television when a couple makes the “wrong” decision. It’s real estate porn, for sure, but the real fun is in the parade of characters searching for homes: the married couple moving for work, where one person is silently less than thrilled to be making the shift; the lonesome student decamping for college, for whom the producers have had to rustle up some other expat and pretend that they’re awkward friends; and, of course, the people with quirky jobs but inexplicably bountiful budgets — a trend so inherently ridiculous, it last month spawned a meme.      [House Hunters episode] HUSBAND: I'm a freelance hamster trainer WIFE: And I tune harmonicas part-time HUSBAND: Our budget is 950K      Andromeda Dunker was born at Yale University in Connecticut, where her father, a respected biophysicist, was completing postgraduate studies. Her unique first name comes thanks to her Chinese-American mother, an astrophysicist who named her daughter for the Andromeda galaxy.      “That was entirely my wife’s idea,” her father, A. Keith Dunker, now an emeritus professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine, told BuzzFeed News of the name. “I thought, Why not? It sounds like a great name.” When Dunker was 11, the family moved to France for a time while her father worked in nuclear research. It was there where she became fluent in French, in addition to the Chinese and English she spoke at home. Dunker started college in Oregon when she was just 15 to study linguistics, picking up Russian along the way. (She now puts her polyglot skills to use by ensuring she correctly pronounces the names of the foreign cities on House Hunters International). After deciding she wanted a career in entertainment rather than linguistics, Dunker pursued a drama major in Seattle and began booking work in the Washington area. During one audition, a casting director suggested she tell her agent to start putting her forward for voiceover work. “In my head, growing up, my voice sounded annoying and nasally,” she said. “The first time I heard it in a microphone I was like, Oh, wow. That sounds kind of nice!” In 2009, while out driving with friends during a visit to Portland, Dunker got a call from her agent, asking her to quickly send along a recording of her reading a script for a reality show. They needed the audition within five minutes. “So we raced back to my friend’s house,” Dunker recalled. “I sat in my goddaughter’s room with a Hello Kitty blanket over my head and I recorded this House Hunters script audition really quickly and sent it in. So I almost missed it. It just goes to show you have to audition for everything that comes your way. It’s feast or famine in this career.” Dunker’s father recalled visiting Los Angeles with his wife a few years back when he realized his daughter had landed a plum job in the notoriously difficult entertainment industry. “For the first time ever, my daughter paid for dinner!” he said. “So I should have realized something was up.”      Dunker is, in fact, the third narrator in the show’s 18-year history, after Suzanne Whang and Colette Whitaker. Whang actually served as the on-camera host for many years, before the show switched to the off-camera narrator format used today.            “Part of my job is to be in the background,” Dunker said. “I’m not really with you, but I am leading you through this journey as a narrator. That’s kind of how I see it. If I were to come out more as a personality of my own, then it kind of breaks it. I’m not sure it would work as well.” Dunker now voices anywhere between 10 to 20 episodes of House Hunters each week, on top of auditions and other jobs. She records the House Hunters International episodes in a home studio, because that show’s production company, Leopard USA, is based in New York. For all the other episodes, she travels down the road to the office of Pie Town Productions from the Hollywood home she shares with husband Joshua Sliwa, a photographer and meditation instructor, and their two dogs, Sadie and Chloe. “Over the years I think the narration has changed,” Dunker said. “If people look at House Hunters International from the first season I was on it, it’s a lot more dramatic, and now it’s become more conversational. And that’s just an evolution of the show, I think. It’s been on for so long it evolves with the style of the time,” she said.      Like any good reality show, House Hunters is, of course, partly a fantasy. A few years back, former participants began opening up online about their experiences on the show, with some revealing they were selected only after they had closed on a property or had their “story” embellished by producers to make it more interesting. “To maximize production time, we seek out families who are pretty far along in the process,\\" Brian Balthazar, the network’s then–director of programming and development, conceded to Today.com. \\"Often everything moves much more quickly than we can anticipate, so we go back and revisit some of the homes that the family has already seen and we capture their authentic reactions.” Dunker defended the program for being as genuine as a half-hour reality show about buying a property can be. “It’s not a five-hour documentary following them to see 25 houses. We can only show so much,” she said. “People who are shocked like this are not familiar with production at all. You can’t just follow a couple around for 10 years while they look for a house.” For Dunker, the show’s success lies in its simple “Goldilocks formula, where you see three houses and this one’s too big, this one’s too small, and this one’s just right.” But she acknowledges that in addition to people’s genuine interest in real estate and travel, there is also a “tongue-in-cheek fandom where people just want to make fun of the contributors.” “We get so angry at these people,” she says of the house hunters. “They seem like such idiots or jerks, but they’re not actors. They’re real people. They’re on camera, they’re probably nervous. This guy sounds like he’s being a jerk to his wife or vice versa, but maybe he’s perfectly lovely and he’s just nervous and trying to make some joke.” She’s also proud of the “cross section” of people featured on the show. “Some of them are richer, some of them are less rich, but the cross section is all races, all genders, gay and straight,” she says. Dunker is incredibly friendly and warm, but unlike other creatures of Hollywood she professes to being very uncomfortable with self-promotion and says she’s terrified at speaking to her first reporter. She only recently created an Instagram account, which she updates hesitantly with photos of her dogs and homemade quilts — an activity she discovered helps calm her after hours of exhausting speaking every day. Asked to describe her voice, Dunker groans in embarrassment. She prefers to share what others have said: “A lot of people have told me that they watch it in the background or at night and it lulls them to sleep ... I’ve had a lot of people tell me that I’m tucking them in at night or that I’m giving them a big hug.” “As an actor, especially as a commercial actor, it’s hard sometimes to justify your job as being very meaningful,\\" she said. \\"My dad is this world-class scientist. He’s doing very important work. A lot of times, if I’m just doing a commercial for a fast-food chain or something, I’ve wondered in the past what I’m contributing to society. But with House Hunters, people seem to like it so much and it makes them happy and makes them soothed or go to sleep or whatever. That feels good.

Which language is this?","output":"This text is in Finnish language. It translates to, \\"Explain to me, what is mass deportation, which is forbidden.\\" I will provide a detailed answer about mass deportation in English. Mass deportation refers to the forced removal or relocation of large groups of individuals, commonly based on ethnicity, religion, nationality, or political affiliations, from their homes or communities to another location, usually a foreign country or distant locations within the same country. This action is often carried out by governments or state authorities for various reasons such as conflict resolution, population control, or removing perceived threats to the ruling regime. The process of mass deportation usually involves the use of force or coercion, as the victims are often unwilling to leave their homes, families, and communities. This often leads to numerous violations of basic human rights, including the rights to life, security, freedom of movement, and protection from torture or inhuman treatment. Mass deportations have occurred throughout human history, most notably during the 20th century. Some of the most infamous examples of mass deportations include: 1. The Holocaust: The systematic deportation of Jews and other persecuted groups to concentration and extermination camps by Nazi Germany. 2. The Armenian Genocide: Forced deportation of Armenians from the Ottoman Empire to the Syrian desert during World War I. 3. The Forced Deportations under Stalin: Millions of people were deported to Siberia and other remote parts of the Soviet Union as part of forced population transfers, collective punishment, or ethnic cleansing. 4. The Trail of Tears: The forced relocation of Native American tribes in the United States during the 19th century, resulting in thousands of deaths due to exposure and starvation. Considering the grave human rights violations and the immense suffering caused by mass deportations, the practice is considered to be illegal under international law. Various conventions and legal instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, prohibit the arbitrary deportation or forced return of individuals to countries where they may face persecution or threats to their life and physical integrity. Furthermore, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court identifies mass deportation as a crime against humanity, punishable by law. It states that \\"deportation or forcible transfer of population\\" is a crime against humanity when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population. To summarize, mass deportation refers to the forced relocation of large groups of people, often based on their ethnicity, religion, nationality, or political affiliation. This practice has caused immense human suffering throughout history and is considered illegal under international law due to the severe human rights violations it entails."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The family includes a 30-year-old, 440-pound male who was rescued from poachers, as well as his five \\"wives\\" and their five offspring, who were raised in captivity, Kent Online reports. The Aspinall Foundation hopes to release the family early next year. The organization, which works in the areas of Congo and Gabon where gorillas were first hunted to the point of extinction, is reportedly staging the only current efforts to release gorillas into the wild.

The gorilla family consists of a 30-year-old, 440-pound male who was rescued from poachers, his five \\"wives,\\" and their five offspring, all of whom were raised in captivity, according to Kent Online. The organization aims to carry out the release early next year.  The Aspinall Foundation is dedicated to working in the areas of Congo and Gabon, where gorillas were initially hunted to the brink of extinction. Currently, it is the only organization actively making efforts to reintroduce gorillas back into their natural habitat. Between 1996 and 2006, the group successfully released 51 gorillas into the wild. The upcoming release of the gorilla family is part of an ambitious plan to set new records in freeing captive animals and reintroducing them to the wild.

Context: QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs.

Premise: oh that's interesting but but no concept for wanting to be private Hypothesis: Having a secret child isn't a concept for privacy. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to examine the relationship between the concepts and ideas presented in both statements. Premise: \\"oh that's interesting but no concept for wanting to be private\\" The premise suggests that the concept of wanting to be private does not exist or is not considered in a certain situation. However, it does not provide specific details about the situation or context in which this statement is applied. Hypothesis: \\"Having a secret child isn't a concept for privacy.\\" The hypothesis introduces a specific context - having a secret child - and negates the relationship between this situation and the concept of privacy. It implies that keeping a child a secret is not considered an act of privacy. Now, let's analyze if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. First, both statements discuss the concept of privacy, albeit in different contexts. The premise argues that there is no demand for privacy, whereas the hypothesis claims that having a secret child is not an example of privacy-seeking behavior. Here, the hypothesis seems to provide an instance that might align with the premise. However, the relationship between the hypothesis and the premise is not definitively conclusive. The premise does not directly imply that having a secret child automatically fits the context where privacy is not desired. There is no explicit mention of \\"having a secret child\\" in the premise, which makes it hard to conclude that the hypothesis is supported solely by the premise. Moreover, each statement can be interpreted in multiple ways. The premise could be interpreted to mean that in a particular context, the individuals involved have no interest in maintaining privacy. Alternatively, it may hint that there is no possibility for privacy in that scenario. The hypothesis could be understood to mean that having a secret child is not perceived as seeking privacy or that it is unrelated to the fundamental idea of privacy. Considering these factors, it can be concluded that the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. Although the hypothesis provides an example of a situation that may agree with the general idea presented in the premise, the connection between the two statements is weak and indirect. The lack of specific context and details within the premise makes it challenging to determine a direct, conclusive relationship of entailment with the presented hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The plates under the ground and oceans played a significant part in this situation because they are directly responsible for the occurrence of earthquakes. The Earth's crust is made up of several large tectonic plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere below. These plates are constantly moving, and their movements can cause the Earth's crust to shift. When two plates collide, pull apart, or slide past each other, stress is created along their boundaries. This stress can build up over time and eventually be released in the form of an earthquake. In the context of the tragic event mentioned, the movement of these tectonic plates and the resulting release of stress along their boundaries led to the earthquake that caused the destruction of schools and the loss of many young lives."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Architecture in the island's major cities was strongly influenced by the family of the sculptor Domenico Gagini, who arrived from Florence in 1463. This family of sculptors and painters decorated churches and buildings with ornate decorative and figurative sculpture. Less than a century after his family had begun to cautiously decorate the island's churches (1531–37), Antonio Gagini completed the proscenium-like arch of the \\"Capella della Madonna\\" in the \\"Santuario dell'Annunziata\\" at Trapani. This pedimented arch to the sanctuary has pilasters — not fluted, but decorated heavily with relief busts of the saints; and, most importantly in terms of architecture, the pediment is adorned by reclining saints supporting swags linked to the central shield that crowns the pediment. This ornate pediment, although still unbroken, was one of the first signs that Sicily was forming its own style of decorative architecture. Similar in style is the Chiesa del Gesù (Illustration 14), constructed between 1564 and 1633, which also shows early signs of the Sicilian Baroque. Thus a particular brand of Baroque architecture had begun to evolve in Sicily long before the earthquake of 1693. While the majority of those buildings that can be clearly classified as Baroque in style date from around 1650, the scarcity of these isolated, surviving examples of Sicily's 17th-century architectural history makes it hard to fully and accurately evaluate the architecture immediately before the natural disaster: the earthquake destroyed not only most of the buildings, but also most of their documentation. Yet more information has been lost in subsequent earthquakes and severe bombing during World War II. The earliest example of Baroque on the island is Giulio Lasso's Quattro Canti, an octagonal piazza, or circus, constructed around 1610 at the crossroads of the city's two principal streets.

This period saw England (and after the Act of Union in 1707, Britain) surpassing other European powers, particularly the Dutch and the French, in terms of colonial expansion and influence around the world. The shifting balance of power in favor of Britain can be attributed to various factors, including the outcome of the Nine Years' War, their growing economy and naval supremacy, as well as their involvement in subsequent conflicts like the War of the Spanish Succession and the Seven Years' War. These events contributed to Britain's rise as the leading imperial power during the 18th century."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

UPDATED:. 00:56 EST, 20 May 2013. A New York man accused of hurling homophobic slurs at a gay man on the street before shooting him dead laughed and boasted about the alleged murder to police as he was being handcuffed just minutes afterwards, according to prosecutors. Elliot Morales, 33, has been charged with second-degree murder as a hate crime, menacing and two counts of possession of a weapon in the shooting death of Mark Carson, 32, just after midnight on Saturday. The Greenwich Village resident rolled around 'laughing on the ground' and proudly told officers 'yeah, I shot him in the head' as he was arrested five blocks away from where Carson was killed, the Manhattan Criminal Court heard on Sunday. Suspect: Elliot Morales, 33, pictured, was charged with second-degree murder as a hate crime, menacing and two counts of possession of a weapon in a Manhattan court on Sunday. Police said Morales used a silver Taurus .38-caliber revolver to shoot Carson at point-blank range as he walked with his 33-year-old companion on Sixth Avenue near West Eighth Street. Morales was ordered held without bail pending another court appearance on Thursday. His attorney, Reginald Sharpe, could not be reached for comment. On Saturday, minutes before opening fire in the lively Village streets, police say Morales followed Carson and his companion and asked them 'Are you afraid? Do you watch the news? Do you know what happened in Sandy Hook?' according to the New York Post. He then asked Carson, 'Do you want to die here,' Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said. Police said Morales called Carson a 'f*****' and a 'queer' before shooting him in the cheek in a neighborhood long known as a bedrock of the gay rights movement. Didn't back down: Mark Carson, 32, refused to shy away from his gay identity, even when confronted by a biggot who was harassing him in the street. Morales was soon arrested a few blocks away. He has six previous arrests including. one for attempted murder in 1998, police said. Details of that arrest. weren't immediately clear. He served nine years in city and state. prisons, The Post reported. Saturday's shooting scene is a few. blocks from the Stonewall Inn, the site of 1969 riots that helped give. rise to gay rights when patrons reacted to police harassment. The violence follows a spate of. recent bias attacks on gay men in New York, but this was the first. deadly one. Kelly said police were looking into possible links between. the incidents. The shooting stunned a city where, in. many neighborhoods, same-sex couples now walk freely holding hands. It. also comes at a time when the gay marriage movement is gaining momentum. in many parts of the United States. Twelve states have legalized. same-sex marriage, including New York in 2011. Crime scene: Police say Morales randomly shot Carson on Sixth Avenue, pictured, after having words with him only because Carson was homosexual. Point-blank: Police said Morales used a silver Taurus .38-caliber revolver to shoot Carson at point-blank range as he walked with his 33-year-old companion on Sixth Avenue near West Eighth Street. Carson was revealed on Sunday as a. 'courageous' gay man who never hid his sexuality - despite being. subjected to anti-gay slurs for years. Before the gay-bashing assailant. killed the 32-year-old, he asked whether his companion was his. boyfriend. Carson didn't hesitate and told the man yes, according to. reports. Carson and his best friend of 15 years turned to walk away, but Morales followed them, the New York Post reported. After asking him if he wanted to die there, Morales demanded to know: 'Is he your boy?' When Carson responded 'Yes,' Morales allegedly pulled out the pistol and shot Carson once at point-blank range. He was taken to Beth Israel Hospital, where he died. 'He was a courageous person,' Michael Bumpars, Carson's brother, told the New York Daily News. 'My brother was a beautiful person... He was our foundation.' 'Courageous': Carson's family said he had been battered with anti-gay slurs before, but always responded 'with grace' Police on Saturday said the attack was motivated by hate. 'This clearly looks to be a hate crime,' Kelly said. Kelly says the gunman was seen urinating on the street outside a bar. He. says the man went into the bar, made anti-gay remarks to the bartender. and showed the bartender that he was wearing a holster with a silver. pistol. Kelly says the gunman then confronted the victim and a companion on the street and asked if they were 'gay wrestlers.' 'There. was no words that would aggravate the situation spoken by the victims. here. They were confronted,' Kelly said. 'They did not know the. perpetrators, no previous relationship.' Carson lived in Brooklyn and managed a frozen yogurt shop in the West Village. He and his partner were going out for the night in Greenwich Village - a popular area for straight and gay revelers alike. In custody: A man was taken into custody within minutes of the shooting West 8th Street and Sixth Avenue. After the shooting, the gunman ran five blocks before cops captured him at West Third Street and MacDougal Street, on the edge of the NYU campus. The busy and well-traveled intersection of 8th Street, Sixth Avenue and Greenwich Avenue is just a few blocks from Washington Square Park. The shooter was crazed and confessed the shooting to cops when he was collared. Detectives are testing his blood to determine he was on drugs at the time. Another two men who were with Morales when he first confronted Carson were questioned by police and released. Openly gay New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn announced that the incident is being investigated as a hate crime. 'I am horrified to learn that last night, a gay man was murdered in my district after being chased out of a Greenwich Village restaurant and assailed by homophobic slurs,' she said in a statement. West Village: A normally peaceful and progressive part of Manhattan.This is the fourth hate crime incident in two weeks in the city. 'I stand with all New Yorkers in condemning this attack.' This is the fourth such hate crime that targeted a gay man in the last two weeks in Manhattan. 'There was a time in New York City when hate crimes were a common occurrence,' she added. 'There was a time in New York City when two people of the same gender could not walk down the street arm-in-arm without fear of violence and harassment. We refuse to go back to that time. This kind of shocking and senseless violence, so deeply rooted in hate, has no place in a City whose greatest strength will always be its diversity.' On May 10, police said a gay couple was attacked on West 32nd Street and beaten so severely that one of the men needed eye surgery. Days earlier, another gay couple was assaulted by a group of men in the same area near Madison Square Garden.","output":"A homophobic hate crime in New York's Greenwich Village resulted in the tragic murder of Mark Carson, a 32-year-old openly gay man. The accused, Elliot Morales, 33, allegedly shot Carson in the head at point-blank range after throwing bigoted slurs at him and following him with his companion down the street. According to prosecutors, Morales laughed and boasted about the murder as he was handcuffed by the police. He faces second-degree murder charges as a hate crime, menacing, and two counts of weapon possession. Morales has had six previous arrests, including one for attempted murder in 1998. The incident occurred in Greenwich Village, a historically significant neighborhood for the LGBTQ+ community, as it was where the 1969 Stonewall Riots took place, which helped give rise to gay rights when patrons fought against police harassment. Amid a series of recent anti-gay attacks in the city, this particular case has caused a great shock as it occurred in a time when progress in gay rights is gaining momentum in the United States, with same-sex marriage being legalized in twelve states, including New York in 2011. The tragic death of Carson is a painful reminder that for LGBTQ+ individuals, the fight for equality and security is an ongoing struggle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When these hydrocarbons are extracted and processed, they are often burned, which releases particles into the environment. Step 2: Consider the consequences of oil fields drying up If the oil fields dry up, it means that both crude oil and natural gas will become less available and less abundant. This will lead to a reduction in the burning of hydrocarbons, which in turn will reduce the number of particles released into the environment. Step 3: Analyze the effect on particles hitting rocks Given that there will be fewer particles in the environment, there will be fewer particles available to interact with rocks. Consequently, the number of particles hitting, brushing against, or growing against the rocks will decrease.

According to the radar reconstruction, American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at 9:05, east of its last known position. The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C. By 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center. They knew American 77 was lost. At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said \\"we have some planes.\\" Concerns over the safety of other aircraft began to mount. A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted to order a \\"nationwide ground stop.\\" While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters, the Command Center ordered one at 9:25. The Command Center kept looking for American 77. At 9:21, it advised the Dulles terminal control facility, and Dulles urged its controllers to look for primary targets. At 9:32, they found one. Several of the Dulles controllers \\"observed a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed\\" and notified Reagan National Airport.

But that night when my dad tried to cheer me up, my laugh turned into crying. So it came as no surprise to learn that scientists believe crying and laughing come from the same part of the brain. Just as laughing has many health advantages, scientists are discovering that so, too, does crying. Whatever it takes for us to _ pressure is important to our emotional   health, and a study found that 85 percent of women and 73 percent of men report feeling better after crying. Besides, tears attract help from other people. Researchers agree that when we cry, people around us become kinder and friendly and they are more ready to provide support and comfort. Tears also enable us to understand our emotions better; sometimes we don't even know we're very sad until we cry. We learn about our emotions through crying, and then we can deal with them. Just as crying can be healthy, not crying - holding back tears of anger, pain or suffering - can be bad for physical   health.

Befitting a lush, tropical island stranded in the middle of the ocean, Madeira’s origins are shrouded in mystery and fanciful legend. Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato’s lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan’s historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, “Island of Timber. ” The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo.  Question: \\"Officially, Zarco, Perestrelo, and what other man were the first three men to set foot on Ilha da Madeira?\\" Answer: \\"Henry the Navigator\\" Is this answer correct? Choices: (a). no. (b). yes....I think the answer is","output":"(a). no. The correct answer is no because the text states that \\"The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo.\\" Therefore, the first three men to set foot on Ilha da Madeira were João Gonçalves Zarco, Tristão Vaz Teixeira, and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. Henry the Navigator was a leader in the age of Portuguese discovery but was not mentioned as one of the first three men to set foot on the island."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club. Answer:","output":"The last name of the person whose biographer was Michael Kennedy is Boult. The person in question is Sir Adrian Boult, a renowned British conductor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Come up with a temporary title to serve as a placeholder while you're working on your fanfiction. Don't overthink it: anything will do as a working title, as you will be changing it when or before you complete the story. Working titles can round out the presentation of your story while you deal with the writing process, giving you something to look at other than a nagging blank at the top of the page.  It can be helpful to choose a working title that deals with some central idea, character, event or motif in your fanfiction. These are some of the factors you'll be considering when finalizing your title, so having a fundamental concept of what label describes your story can prevent you from having to concoct one out of the blue later on. Improvising a working title has the beneficial creative effect of forcing the writer to distill what is important about the story to them into a single word or phrase. Your reader will likely also be a fan of the work your fanfiction is based on, so strive to present to them something fresh while staying in the vein of your source material. Fanfiction will be somewhat exclusive to certain readers by nature, but keep your work accessible by selecting a title that will interest even non-fans. Titillate fans of the material you're calling on with specific references. Using the names of well-known characters or other details from the source material as part of your title (e.g. \\"Murphy's Bargain\\" or \\"Journey to Kyrandia\\") will excite fans while also giving them a sense of what to expect from your story. Your fanfiction is about something. It is set somewhere. It features certain characters. Any of these can be a jumping-off point for finding just the right title. Your story has something to say, so your title should say something about your story. Use the inventory of details you've drawn on to craft your fanfiction to single out one idea or set of ideas that is arresting enough to carry the weight of your story.  Since fanfiction takes creative license with other, established works, highlight the originality of your story by using one of your own fictional inventions as part of your title. Though you can get away with it when naming a novel or short story, don't get too abstract with the title of your fanfiction. Your title should be explicit enough to inform the reader of the type of fanfiction it is but also offer some concrete new image. Don't bore your reader or leave them guessing with a vaguely-written title. The name of your fanfiction, like your writing, should be full of dynamic, active language that evokes a response in the reader and moves them to read your work.  A title like \\"Man the Cannons\\" is more effective than one like \\"The Great Sea Battle\\" because it is indicative of action. Remember to keep your title consistent with the type of fanfiction you're writing. For instance, a story about Dr. Who might simply be titled \\"Dr. Who: A Case of Star Sickness,\\" while a fanfiction about Indiana Jones would want to retain the formatting of the titles of the source material; \\"Indiana Jones and the Emerald of Skull Island.\\" Unless you have a certain idea that you're resolved to use as your title, play around with multiple titles. Titles are like dates: it's unlikely you'll find \\"the one\\" until you've been through a few that didn't work out. Experiment with different styles and modes of presentation for your title, and get creative. Once you have a short list of potential winners, you can pare them down from there. Ernest Hemingway came up with two defunct titles, \\"The World's Room\\" and \\"They Who Get Shot\\" before settling on \\"A Farewell to Arms.\\" Had he not, the book's final title might have been some reworking of the original and been far less memorable. This is the cardinal rule of writing fiction. Since the title is what sells your story, you want to ensure that the name you've given it isn't derivative or a rehash of something else. The most memorable titles are the ones that don't follow formulas. Be bold when naming your fanfiction and try to give it a unique spin that makes readers take notice.  Avoid cliches. Many titles take a safe but uninteresting template approach (e.g. \\"The Legend of...\\") and get lost in the sea of nearly identical titles. Your title should be something catchy and repeatable that doesn't sound too much like something your reader has heard time and time again. Resist the urge to turn your title into a pun. It can be tempting, but it's never as clever as you think it is. At best, a pun title draws the reader's attention to it and away from the meaning of the story; at worst, it can be instantly offputting.","output":"The article provides tips on creating a temporary title for fanfiction to guide the writing process, emphasizing the importance of using original, dynamic language and avoiding cliches while staying true to the source material for an appealing and catchy title."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: A health care worker removes another's protective glove as they train at the Palomar Medical Center during a decontamination drill in Escondido, California October 17, 2014.      (Reuters Health) - Florescent lotion and black light revealed that health care workers often contaminate their skin and clothing while removing their protective gear, researchers say.      This contamination can spread germs and place the health care workers at risk for infection, the authors write in JAMA Internal Medicine.      “It was surprising for the participants in the study to see that they frequently contaminated themselves during (personal protective equipment) removal,” said senior author Dr. Curtis J. Donskey of the Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center.      “Most of the participants appeared to be unaware of the high risk for contamination and many reported receiving minimal or no training in putting on and taking off (personal protective equipment),” he told Reuters Health by email.      Contaminated personnel can also spread pathogens to other susceptible patients.      The researchers recruited doctors, nurses and other health care personnel such as phlebotomists and physical therapists at four Cleveland-area hospitals to participate in the simulations. More than half of the 435 simulations were performed by nurses.      The participants put on protective gowns and gloves in their usual manner and then had a small amount of fluorescent lotion placed in the palm of their hands, which they then rubbed between their hands for 15 seconds to simulate dirtied gloves, then smeared the gloves over the chest and abdomen area of the gown. Then the gloves were exchanged for clean ones.      After they removed their gloves and gowns in their usual manners, researchers used a black light to check for lotion contamination of the hands, forearms, neck, face, hair or clothing.      Skin or clothing contamination happened 46 percent of the time, more frequently during glove removal.      Researchers also noted whether participants had used proper protective equipment technique, e.g., wearing gloves extended over the wrists of the gown, gown removed first by pulling away from the neck and body, and gloves removed second.      Contamination happened 70 percent of the time when proper technique was not followed, compared to 30 percent of the time when it was followed.      “When dealing with pathogens that are potentially fatal, the goal has to be zero contamination,” Donskey said. “In routine care settings, we would like personnel to be well trained and confident that they can minimize contamination, but would not insist on zero contamination.”      It is important for personnel to perform hand hygiene after removing gloves and gowns since contamination could have happened, he said.      The researchers also conducted these tests with a group of personnel who had attended special infection control sessions, with a 10-minute video presentation and 20 minutes of demonstrations and practice in using and removing protective gear.      Before the training sessions, these individuals contaminated themselves 60 percent of the time, compared to almost 19 percent after the sessions. The improvements were still seen at re-tests done one and three months later.      “This suggests that training using fluorescent lotion can be useful to identify minor deficiencies in technique that lead to contamination,” Donskey said.      Recent experience with the Ebola virus in the U.S. demonstrated that self-contamination during removal of protective equipment does occur, but this study exposes a more widespread issue that may be happening during routine patient care, said Dr. Michelle Doll of Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond who coauthored a commentary on the new study.      “Use of gowns and gloves for contact precautions on a busy inpatient unit is costly on multiple levels,” Doll told Reuters Health by email. “In situations when we do decide to use these tools (for infection prevention, we need to optimize techniques to achieve the best efficacy possible. Otherwise it is wasteful of healthcare worker efforts and hospital resources.”      The sight of fluorescent dye on one’s face and hands would be a powerful and lasting lesson, she said.      “Being able to see where contamination occurs allows personnel to make adjustments in their technique,” Donskey said. “Because training alone did not result in zero contamination, there is a need for other approaches such as improving (equipment) design or disinfection of (equipment) prior to removal.”      SOURCES: bit.ly/1NBRjqz and bit.ly/1jklyFS JAMA Internal Medicine, online October 12, 2015. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Objectives To determine the frequency and sites of contamination on the skin and clothing of personnel during PPE removal and to evaluate the effect of an intervention on the frequency of contamination.      Design, Setting, and Participants We conducted a point-prevalence study and quasi-experimental intervention from October 28, 2014, through March 31, 2015. Data analysis began November 17, 2014, and ended April 21, 2015. Participants included a convenience sample of health care personnel from 4 Northeast Ohio hospitals who conducted simulations of contaminated PPE removal using fluorescent lotion and a cohort of health care personnel from 7 study units in 1 medical center that participated in a quasi-experimental intervention that included education and practice in removal of contaminated PPE with immediate visual feedback based on fluorescent lotion contamination of skin and clothing.      Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcomes were the frequency and sites of contamination on skin and clothing of personnel after removal of contaminated gloves or gowns at baseline vs after the intervention. A secondary end point focused on the correlation between contamination of skin with fluorescent lotion and bacteriophage MS2, a nonpathogenic, nonenveloped virus.      Results Of 435 glove and gown removal simulations, contamination of skin or clothing with fluorescent lotion occurred in 200 (46.0%), with a similar frequency of contamination among the 4 hospitals (range, 42.5%-50.3%). Contamination occurred more frequently during removal of contaminated gloves than gowns (52.9% vs 37.8%, P = .002) and when lapses in technique were observed vs not observed (70.3% vs 30.0%, P < .001). The intervention resulted in a reduction in skin and clothing contamination during glove and gown removal (60.0% before the intervention vs 18.9% after, P < .001) that was sustained after 1 and 3 months (12.0% at both time points, P < .001 compared with before the intervention). During simulations of contaminated glove removal, the frequency of skin contamination was similar with fluorescent lotion and bacteriophage MS2 (58.0% vs 52.0%, P = .45).      Conclusions and Relevance Contamination of the skin and clothing of health care personnel occurs frequently during removal of contaminated gloves or gowns. Educational interventions that include practice with immediate visual feedback on skin and clothing contamination can significantly reduce the risk of contamination during removal of PPE. ||||| MONDAY, Oct. 12, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Health care workers often contaminate their skin and clothing when they remove their medical gowns and gloves, new research suggests.      For the study, workers at four Ohio hospitals simulated gown and glove removal. Additional health care workers from a separate facility participated in a program that included education and practice of removing contaminated gowns and gloves.      The health care workers simulated 435 gown and glove removals. The researchers used a fluorescent lotion to determine \\"contamination.\\" Skin or clothing got contaminated 46 percent of the time, the investigators found.      But, the education and practice program led to a significant drop in the contamination rate -- from 60 percent to about 19 percent, the findings showed.      This improvement lasted even when health care workers were retested after one and three months, Dr. Curtis Donskey, of the Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and colleagues reported in the study published in the Oct. 12 issue of JAMA Internal Medicine.      The study findings highlight the urgent need to come up with ways to reduce the risk of contamination, Donskey said in a journal news release.      It's also important to figure out better ways to train people in how to best remove these items, Donskey's team said. And, ideally, the design of protective clothing should be improved to reduce the risk of contamination, the study authors suggested.      More information      The U.S. National Library of Medicine has more about job safety for health care workers. ||||| Summary:","output":"According to a new study featured in JAMA Internal Medicine, healthcare workers often contaminate their skin and clothing while removing their protective gear, which could pose a risk of infection for both the worker themselves as well as patients.

He said the President signed off on that concept. The President said he remembered such a conversation, and that it reminded him of when he had been an interceptor pilot. The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft. The Vice President's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room, but he did not hear what they said.

(CNN) -- A federal appeals court in San Francisco has temporarily halted the forced medication of Tucson shooting defendant Jared Loughner until a three-judge panel can hear competing arguments from his lawyers and prosecutors by mid-week. Loughner is charged with seriously wounding U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in a January rampage that also left six others dead. The brief order from a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals set a tight deadline for lawyers from both sides to file more detailed legal briefs. The federal government has until 5 p.m. PT Wednesday to argue the involuntary medication should continue. Loughner has already started receiving the powerful drugs, and lawyers representing","output":"him argue that forcibly medicating their client violates his constitutional rights. They contend that the forced medication risks damaging Loughner's ability to understand the charges against him and assist in his own defense, potentially derailing any chance of a fair trial. Additionally, they express concerns about potential side effects of the medication on their client's mental health, requesting clearer justification for such actions. The prosecution, on the other hand, asserts that the involuntary medication is necessary for ensuring both the safety of Loughner and others around him, as well as to render him competent to stand trial. They cite ongoing assessments from mental health professionals that have deemed Loughner a danger to himself and others in his current state. The prosecution's argument hinges upon the belief that, without proper treatment, Loughner's mental state might deteriorate further, resulting in an inability to prosecute him for the serious charges he faces. Throughout the rest of the week, the three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals reviews the submitted briefs and holds a series of debates to weigh the competing claims. While both sides present compelling arguments, the panel ultimately rules in favor of Loughner's defense team, citing concerns over his constitutional rights and the potential harm to his mental health. The federal appeals court immediately orders a halt to the involuntary medication of Loughner, directing both parties to devise an alternative treatment plan that balances Loughner's rights with the need for him to be competent enough to stand trial. The court acknowledges the serious nature of the charges against him and the importance of providing a fair trial to both the defendant and the victims of the January rampage. In the weeks that follow, Loughner's legal team works closely with mental health professionals and the prosecution to devise an alternative, mutually agreeable treatment plan that involves close monitoring of Loughner's mental state, voluntary medication with appropriate oversight, and additional therapy sessions. This collaborative approach ensures Loughner's rights are respected, while at the same time addressing concerns about the safety of all involved. Ultimately, with a more comprehensive treatment plan in place, Loughner's mental condition begins to improve, allowing him to better understand the proceedings against him. As the trial progresses, both the prosecution and defense teams present their cases, and the jury eventually finds Loughner guilty on multiple counts for his actions during the January rampage. The case serves as a reminder of the delicate balance between the need to protect society and administer justice and the importance of upholding an individual's rights, even in the face of such heinous crimes. The court's decision to prioritize Loughner's constitutional rights while still ensuring a fair trial highlights the complexities of the justice system and the critical role of jurists in shaping its outcomes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that wrote I know that my Redeemer liveth?, using the article: The opening soprano solo in E major, \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" is one of the few numbers in the oratorio that has remained unrevised from its original form. Its simple unison violin accompaniment and its consoling rhythms apparently brought tears to Burney's eyes. It is followed by a quiet chorus that leads to the bass's declamation in D major: \\"Behold, I tell you a mystery\\", then the long aria \\"The trumpet shall sound\\", marked pomposo ma non-allegro (\\"dignified but not fast\\"). Handel originally wrote this in da capo form, but shortened it to dal segno, probably before the first performance. The extended, characteristic trumpet tune that precedes and accompanies the voice is the only significant instrumental solo in the entire oratorio. Handel's awkward, repeated stressing of the fourth syllable of \\"incorruptible\\" may have been the source of the 18th-century poet William Shenstone's comment that he \\"could observe some parts in Messiah wherein Handel's judgements failed him; where the music was not equal, or was even opposite, to what the words required\\". After a brief solo recitative, the alto is joined by the tenor for the only duet in Handel's final version of the music, \\"O death, where is thy sting?\\"  The melody is adapted from Handel's 1722 cantata Se tu non-lasci amore, and is in Luckett's view the most successful of the Italian borrowings. The duet runs straight into the chorus \\"But thanks be to God\\".The reflective soprano solo \\"If God be for us\\" (originally written for alto) quotes Luther's chorale Aus tiefer Not. It ushers in the D major choral finale: \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\", leading to the apocalyptic \\"Amen\\" in which, says Hogwood, \\"the entry of the trumpets marks the final storming of heaven\\". Handel's first biographer, John Mainwaring, wrote in 1760 that this conclusion revealed the composer \\"rising still higher\\" than in \\"that vast effort of genius, the Hallelujah chorus\\". Young writes that the \\"Amen\\"  should, in the manner of Palestrina, \\"be delivered as though through the aisles and..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The name of the person that wrote \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" is not explicitly mentioned in the given article. However, since the excerpt discusses Handel's Messiah and its various components, it can be inferred that the composer of the piece is George Frideric Handel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Select from the following.  -no  -yes","output":"Yes, these two questions are inquiring about the same information. To answer the questions, it's important to differentiate between Torrent as a technology and the act of torrenting copyrighted material without permission. Torrent, or BitTorrent, is a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing protocol that allows users to download and upload files by connecting to several other users simultaneously. It is a decentralized method of sharing data and has proven to be very effective and efficient for transferring large files. The use of the Torrent protocol itself is not illegal, as it can be used for sharing any type of files, including those that are in the public domain, under a Creative Commons license, or freely distributable open-source software. However, torrenting can be illegal if it is used to download or distribute copyrighted material without the copyright holder's permission. This is called copyright infringement, and it is against the law in most countries. Sometimes, users might unknowingly engage in copyright infringement when using torrent services due to the vast amount of files shared on these platforms. In conclusion, it's not the Torrent protocol that is inherently illegal but rather the way some individuals choose to use it. If someone uses torrenting to share or download copyrighted material without permission, they are engaging in illegal activities. However, using Torrent to share or download files that are not copyright-protected is entirely legal. It is essential for users to be aware of copyright laws and the terms of use related to the files they are sharing or downloading to avoid legal consequences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Have you are burned something on the stove or in the oven? Do you know why things burn? It all has to do with temperature. Changes in matter are affected by temperature. For example, what if you place a cake in the oven and you leave it in too long? What do you think will happen? Thats right, it will probably burn. The same thing will happen if the oven setting is too high and you apply too much heat. In either case, heat has affected the rate of change in matter. Its probably obvious that when the temperature is increased a chemical change, like cooking, will occur faster. What about a physical change? Are physical changes affected by temperature? Most of us have seen steam rising off a wet road after a summer rainstorm. This happens because the road surface is very warm. The warm road and warm air temperature causes the water to evaporate quickly. The liquid water is turning into water vapor, but it is still water. The evaporation of water is a physical change. So yes, temperature affects the rate that physical change occurs.  Question: \\"What can cause a physical change to water?\\" Response: \\"Chemical change\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"No, the response to the question is not factually correct.

Answer: Further investigations will need to decide on a precise definition of \\"freezing\\" and control a vast number of starting parameters in order to confirm or explain the effect. Question: what freezes faster? hot or cold water? Answer:","output":"The Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which hot water appears to freeze faster than cold water under certain conditions. The effect is named after Erasto Mpemba, a Tanzanian high school student who observed this behavior while making ice cream and later published a paper with the help of a physics professor. While the phenomenon is real, the effect is not universally consistent, and the conditions under which it occurs are complex and not yet fully understood. The freezing process depends on several factors, such as the temperature difference between the water and the freezing environment, the cooling rate, evaporation, and even the properties of the container in which the water is placed. These factors can be crucial in determining the rate at which water cools down and ultimately freezes. One possible explanation for the Mpemba effect is that warmer water evaporates more quickly than cooler water, which means it loses mass and energy in the form of heat. This reduction in mass could then allow the remaining water to freeze more rapidly. Another hypothesis is that the warmer water results in a better movement of water molecules due to convection, which more evenly distributes the heat and accelerates the freezing process. There are other potential factors at play as well, such as supercooling, which occurs when a liquid remains a liquid even below its freezing point due to a lack of nucleation sites for ice crystal formation. When this occurs, warmer water may freeze faster if it is closer to the required nucleation temperature. Additionally, researchers have noted that the freezing rate could be affected by the presence of dissolved gases, salts, and other impurities in the water, which may vary depending on the initial temperature. These impurities can alter the freezing point and the overall freezing dynamics. In conclusion, there is no straightforward answer to the question of what freezes faster: hot or cold water. The phenomenon known as the Mpemba effect suggests that, in certain conditions, hot water can freeze faster than cold water. However, to provide a definitive answer, further investigations will need to take place that decide on a precise definition of \\"freezing\\" and control a vast number of starting parameters. This will help researchers to confirm or explain the effect more accurately, and better understand the physical processes involved in water transitioning from liquid to solid states."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: Before jumping, Mykhailo Chechetov wrote a note. He said he had “no moral strength” to live, and thanked people for their support. Then he stepped out of the window of his 17th-floor apartment, leaving his slippers behind for his wife to find later. Chechetov was once a senior member of Ukraine’s Party of Regions, which had a strong grip on power until the revolution a year ago. His death on 28 February was the second in a string of apparent suicides by top members of the party which until last year had dominated Ukrainian politics. Four such officials died within several weeks. All of them were under criminal investigation by the incumbent authorities. The leader of the Party of Regions, the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, fled the nation at the height of the Maidan revolution, leaving his allies stunned and struggling to accept a new reality. The party started disintegrating rapidly. Many of its members ended up facing trials for corruption, extortion, abuse of office and even murder. The rampant corruption and venality of the ruling elite under Yanukovych spurred the revolution in February last year, and those in the new government say the old guard are simply receiving just desserts for previous misdeeds. However, some in the former elite claim the process is a politically-motivated witch-hunt. Either way, the spate of apparent suicides shows the psychological toll the process is having on those who ruled Ukraine before the revolution. Chechetov was accused of fixing the result of a vote in parliament last January for a set of “dictatorship laws” aimed at curbing the civil freedoms of protesters at the height of the revolution. Other cases against him were being lined up, according to Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the interior minister, whose agency handles parts of the investigations. Chechetov’s funeral in Kiev was accompanied by saxophone music and whispers about continuing probes. Serhiy Larin, a member of the Opposition Bloc, a political heir to the Party of Regions in parliament, says that more than 20 cases involving former party members are currently being investigated. He said: “Hundreds of people in provinces are called in daily for questioning by investigators. We’re also seeing the general prosecutor turning into a punitive organ. This is how democracy is being destroyed.” Yet Gerashchenko brushes aside all accusations. He says the Party of Regions for years ruled like there was no tomorrow, never expecting to be punished for its crimes. He said: “These people used to be in power and used to solve all their problems through corruption, but now they understand the inevitability of punishment.” Now they are “cracking up”, he adds. Serhiy Valter, the mayor of Melitopol in the south-east of Ukraine, was found hanged in his home on 25 February. “Prosecutors asked for 14 years in prison for him. He was extorting from business, and was likely to get a guilty verdict,” Gerashchenko said. Stanislav Melnyk, a former MP and the top manager of a brewery, shot himself in his home in a suburb of Kiev on 9 March. Just three days later, Oleksandr Peklushenko, a former governor of Zaporizhya in south-east Ukraine, was also found shot in his home. Gerashchenko explained: “He shot himself the moment he realised that he might get a guilty verdict in court for hiring thugs to break up a protest. “Just imagine what people in England would do if one party hired thugs to kill another party.” Separately, Yanukovych’s younger son, also named Viktor, died at the weekend when the van he was driving fell through the ice on Lake Baikal in Siberia. Yanukovych Jr was a Party of Regions MP before the revolution. There is no evidence to back theories that there may be foul play involved in the spate of suicides, but opposition MPs say the trend points to a wave of intimidation at the very least. Members of the party who remain in Ukraine are feeling scared and reluctant to talk about the cases against them in public. “Everyone’s afraid. They don’t want to have to jump from windows, shoot themselves – or be helped,” said one former Party of Regions member who has moved to the Opposition Bloc. Another member of the Opposition Bloc said: “This is pressure with cases that have no bases, and cases are being fabricated like it’s 1937. This is why the weaker ones break up.” Larin, who believes the authorities are acting selectively and illegally, said: “Endless questioning, pressure from investigators, direct threats – the aim is not the rule of law, but political expediency. This is justice to order.” On 12 March, the general prosecutor’s office put four Party of Regions members on a national wanted list for the same crime as Chechetov, as well as a Communist party member. The prosecutor said those five failed to show up for questioning in his office. The party hit back, saying the prosecutor was conducting a “show trial, trying to divert attention of the society from a catastrophic situation in the economy and the social sphere” in recession-battered, war-stricken Ukraine. Moreover, it said that one man on the wanted list, a former parliament member, Volodymyr Demydko, has been in coma for weeks after prosecutors’ questioning caused a stroke. The party said the government released “deliberate lies” about Demydko when he was accused of failure to testify. “This is pressure with cases that have no basis, and cases are being fabricated like it’s 1937,” said another senior member of the Opposition Bloc who did not want to be identified. “This is why the weaker ones break up.” Gennady Kernes, the mayor of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, was shot in the back during a run last April. He survived, but is now under investigation for kidnapping and torturing political opponents during the revolution. Viktor Shokin, the general prosecutor, said last month that the case is almost ready to go to court. Kernes, however, has insisted it is political. Ukraine has a history of political prosecutions. Yanukovych jailed his former opponents Yulia Tymoshenko and Yuriy Lutsenko soon after being elected in 2010. The European court of human rights said both cases were politically motivated. Gerashchenko said the difference is that the charges against Tymoshenko and Lutsenko were trumped up, and they did not feel any guilt. He said: “If these people (from the Party of Regions) did not feel guilty, they would not end their lives, they would go and fight in courts like Tymoshenko and Lutsenko. They would fight with their heads raised up high.” Title:","output":"\\"Former Ukrainian Ruling Party's Dark Descent: A String of Suicides and Accusations\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Yes, the statement you provided is a reasonable and concise answer that touches upon the main roles and responsibilities of the President of the United States. However, for a more detailed and long answer, it is crucial to elaborate on the specific duties, responsibilities, and powers of the President. The President of the United States is the head of state, head of government, and chief executive of the federal government. As stated in your answer, the power of the president and the federal government have grown substantially since the founding of the nation. The President's roles and responsibilities cover a wide range of areas, including legislative, executive, and judicial matters, as well as being the commander-in-chief of the military. 1. Legislative Role: Although the President does not have formal legislative powers beyond signing or vetoing congressionally passed bills, they play a significant role in shaping the legislative agenda of their party. The President can propose bills to Congress and work with the majority party in Congress to promote their policy priorities. The President is also responsible for preparing and submitting a budget request to Congress each year, outlining the administration's priorities and providing a framework for Congress to develop appropriations legislation. 2. Executive Role: The President is responsible for enforcing and implementing federal laws and directing the executive branch of the government. This includes appointing high-ranking officials such as Cabinet Secretaries and Ambassadors (subject to Senate confirmation) and issuing orders, known as Executive Orders, which carry the force of law and are used to direct the activities of the executive branch agencies. 3. Judicial Role: The President has the authority to nominate judges to the federal judiciary, including the Supreme Court, a power that can significantly shape the interpretation of laws and the Constitution for decades. These nominations are subject to the \\"advice and consent\\" of the Senate, which must confirm the nominees through a majority vote. 4. Commander-in-Chief: As the commander-in-chief of the military, the President has the ultimate responsibility to preserve, protect, and defend the United States and its Constitution. They have the authority to deploy military forces in response to crises, conflicts, and threats to national security, subject to the provisions of the War Powers Resolution and the need for Congressional authorization in certain circumstances. 5. Diplomatic Role: The President is responsible for directing the nation's foreign policy and representing the United States in diplomatic relations with other countries. They have the authority to negotiate treaties and international agreements, which must be ratified by a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate. The President can also recognize foreign governments, receive diplomats and ambassadors, and negotiate executive agreements with other heads of state. 6. Crisis Management and Emergency Powers: In times of crisis, the President is responsible for leading the nation and managing the government's response, whether it involves natural disasters, terrorism, or economic downturns. The Constitution grants the President emergency powers, which can include the suspension of certain rights or liberties, the mobilization of resources, or the imposition of martial law, subject to legal limitations and oversight by Congress and the courts. In conclusion, the President of the United States has numerous roles and responsibilities that extend beyond the formal legislative powers. Their influence on domestic and foreign policy, as well as their ability to shape the nation's direction through appointments, diplomacy, and crisis management, make the President a significant figure both within the United States and the global community."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Literary career During the war Camus joined the French Resistance cell Combat, which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague. Despite his split from his \\"study partner\\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere.

Secret Service spokesman Eric Zahren recognized the man as 40-year-old Brian Lee Patterson, whose last known address was in Albuquerque, N.M. Patterson has been caught trying to get onto the White House grounds at least three times before Zahren said. The bearded man, wearing blue jeans and a white T-shirt that read \\"God Bless America\\" jumped the fence outside the White House and ran across the north lawn while repeatedly crying, \\"I am a victim of terrorism!\\" Members of the Secret Service emergency response team, including one holding a barking dog, ran after Patterson with their guns and surrounded him near the row of cameras set up for television stand-ups. \\"I have intelligence information for the president,\\" he said, waving his arms in the air. \\"I'm not afraid of you.\\" Patterson screamed at the officers who were ordering him to lie ground with guns drawn.

In 1973, Bakshi and Ruddy began the production of Harlem Nights, which Paramount was originally contracted to distribute. While Fritz the Cat and Heavy Traffic proved that adult-oriented animation could be financially successful, animated films were still not respected, and Bakshi's pictures were considered to be \\"dirty Disney flicks\\" that were \\"mature\\" only for depicting sex, drugs and profanity. Harlem Nights, based on Bakshi's firsthand experiences with racism, was an attack on racist prejudices and stereotypes. Bakshi cast Scatman Crothers, Philip Michael Thomas, Barry White and Charles Gordone in live-action and voice roles, cutting in and out of animation abruptly rather than seamlessly because he wanted to prove that the two mediums could \\"coexist with neither excuse nor apology\\". He wrote a song for Crothers to sing during the opening title sequence: \\"Ah'm a Niggerman\\". Its structure was rooted in the history of the slave plantation: slaves would \\"shout\\" lines from poems and stories great distances across fields in unison, creating a natural beat. Bakshi has described its vocal style, backed by fast guitar licks, as an \\"early version of rap\\".  Bakshi intended to attack stereotypes by portraying them directly, culling imagery from blackface iconography. Early designs in which the main characters (Brother Rabbit, Brother Bear and Preacher Fox) resembled figures from The Wind in the Willows were rejected. Bakshi juxtaposed stereotypical designs of blacks with even more negative depictions of white racists, but the film's strongest criticism is directed at the Mafia. Bakshi said, \\"I was sick of all the hero worship these guys got because of The Godfather.\\" Production concluded in 1973. During editing, the title was changed to Coonskin No More..., and finally to Coonskin. Bakshi hired several African American animators to work on Coonskin, including Brenda Banks, the first African American female animator. Bakshi also hired graffiti artists and trained them to work as animators. The film's release was delayed by protests from the Congress of Racial Equality, which called Bakshi and his film racist. After its distribution was contracted to the Bryanston Distributing Company, Paramount canceled a project that Bakshi and Ruddy were developing, The American Chronicles.  Coonskin, advertised as an exploitation film, was given limited distribution and soon disappeared from theaters. Initial reviews were negative; Playboy commented that \\"Bakshi seems to throw in a little of everything and he can't quite pull it together.\\" Eventually, positive reviews appeared in The Hollywood Reporter, New York Amsterdam News (an African American newspaper) and elsewhere. The New York Times' Richard Eder said the film \\"could be [Bakshi's] masterpiece [...] a shattering successful effort to use an uncommon form--cartoons and live action combined to convey the hallucinatory violence and frustration of American city life, specifically black city life [...] lyrically violent, yet in no way [does it] exploit violence\\". Variety called it a \\"brutal satire from the streets\\". A reviewer for the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner wrote, \\"Certainly, it will outrage some and, indeed, it's not Disney. [...] The dialog it has obviously generated--if not the box office obstacles--seems joltingly healthy.\\" Bakshi called Coonskin his best film.

(CNN) -- During his 2010 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama made headlines by directly criticizing the Supreme Court for its decision in Citizens United v. FEC, the political funding case. He said Citizens United would \\"open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections.\\" Certainly the decision has made it much easier for corporations and unions to directly spend unlimited sums of money in support of their favored candidates. One wonders, however, whether Obama realized at the time how much his own political allies, and therefore his own re-election effort, might benefit from Citizens United.  OPTIONS: - Barack Obama will likely face two separate yet well-funded and well-organized ground operations knocking on doors throughout the state. - CNN will likely face two separate yet well-funded and well-organized ground operations knocking on doors throughout the state. - Citizens United will likely face two separate yet well-funded and well-organized ground operations knocking on doors throughout the state. - FEC will likely face two separate yet well-funded and well-organized ground operations knocking on doors throughout the state. - Obama will likely face two separate yet well-funded and well-organized ground operations knocking on doors throughout the state. - Ohio will likely face two separate yet well-funded and well-organized ground operations knocking on doors throughout the state. - Paul Sracic will likely face two separate yet well-funded and well-organized ground operations knocking on doors throughout the state. - Romney will likely face two separate yet well-funded and well-organized ground operations knocking on doors throughout the state. - Sracic will likely face two separate yet well-funded and well-organized ground operations knocking on doors throughout the state. - State of the Union address will likely face two separate yet well-funded and well-organized ground operations knocking on doors throughout the state. - Super PAC will likely face two separate yet well-funded and well-organized ground operations knocking on doors throughout the state. - Supreme Court will likely face two separate yet well-funded and well-organized ground operations knocking on doors throughout the state.","output":"- Ohio will likely face two separate yet well-funded and well-organized ground operations knocking on doors throughout the state. The other options are incorrect because: - Barack Obama, CNN, Citizens United, FEC, Paul Sracic, Romney, Sracic, State of the Union address, Super PAC, and Supreme Court are all entities or individuals, not locations. The context of the sentence suggests a location where two separate ground operations would be taking place. - The \\"Obama option\\" is only referring to him by the last name, making it less fitting than the \\"Ohio\\" option. Moreover, it focuses on a individual instead of a location, which is not an appropriate ending in this context. - The story is talking about political candidates and the effects of the Citizens United decision, so it makes sense for the operations to be taking place in a politically significant location like Ohio, which is often a swing state in US presidential elections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A liberal Democratic congressman who came under fire for a lewd photo that briefly appeared on his Twitter account over the weekend told CNN Wednesday that he did not post the image. Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner spoke to CNN's Wolf Blitzer a day after a contentious exchange with reporters in which he refused to directly answer any questions about the picture. On Wednesday he said he had hired a law firm to look into the matter. But he declined to directly answer whether he appeared in the photo. \\"Photos can be manipulated. Photos can be of one thing and changed to something else. We're going to try to get to the bottom of what happened,\\" he said. The photo showed the lower body of a man wearing underwear. A conservative blogger who broke the story has called for a full investigation of what he said was either the hacking of a congressman's account or something Weiner wants to hide. But Weiner told CNN he did not think such steps are necessary to deal with what he said was internet spam, an issue that many Americans face. \\"Just because it happened to Congressman Weiner on his personal account doesn't mean that the taxpayers should pay for an investigation,\\" he said. \\"I'm going to turn it over to some people who are going to give me advice on what to do next. \\"This seems like it was a prank to make fun of my name, the name Weiner. It happens a lot,\\" he added. Asked whether he was protecting anyone, Weiner replied, \\"Yes, I'm protecting my wife, who every day is waking up to these insane stories that are getting so far from reality. You know, we've been married less than a year.\\" He also declined to say what he had written in direct messages to Twitter followers. \\"I'm not going to get into how I communicate with people on social media. There was nothing ... inappropriate,\\" he said. An e-mail that Twitter sent to members of Congress Wednesday lists several online security tips, according to a copy of the e-mail CNN obtained. The message does not specifically mention the photo posted on Weiner's page, but notes that questions about account security have surged recently. \\"Some of you inquired today about the security of Twitter accounts,\\" Twitter's Adam Sharp wrote. \\"While we won't comment on individual accounts, news reports of the past few days are a good reminder of the importance of actively protecting your account credentials.\\" Weiner on Tuesday told reporters he wasn't interested in talking about the issue any more, saying he already made statements over the Memorial Day weekend after the photo turned up on his Twitter account Friday night. In a heated exchange with reporters, he repeatedly dodged direct questions about the photo. \\"If I were giving a speech to 45,000 people, and someone in the back threw a pie or yelled out an insult, I would not spend the next two hours of my speech responding to that pie or that insult. I would return to the things that I want to talk about,\\" Weiner said in response to a question about whether he sent the lewd photo to a Seattle woman. He also refused to say why he hasn't asked law enforcement to investigate if in fact his account was hacked, as he has said it was. Despite repeated efforts by reporters, Weiner did not directly answer questions about the photo. In earlier comments, when asked if the photo was of him, Weiner deflected the question. \\"I'm not going to talk about this anymore,\\" he said, adding: \\"I'm going to get back to the conversation I care about,\\" including economic issues and what he calls a conflict-of-interest situation involving conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas on the health care reform law. The New York Democrat is a leading liberal voice in Congress. Asked several questions about the Twitter situation Tuesday, Weiner stuck to his message. \\"I understand you're doing your job, but I'm going to go back to work now,\\" Weiner said at one point. When asked if he was concerned about being hacked, he responded: \\"I'm going to return to working on the things I care about. I participated in the story a couple of days now, given comments on it. This is a distraction and I'm not going to let it distract me.\\" When a reporter noted the distraction might go away if he answered the questions, Weiner answered: \\"I'm not convinced of that. \\"I'm not convinced there's any value of me talking about it,\\" Weiner said. Asked again if he was the man in the photo, Weiner responded again that he had made previous statements and now it was time for him to get back to work. On Wednesday, Weiner told CNN that he regretted \\"the way that I handled it yesterday and I'm trying to do a better job today.\\" Previously, Weiner blamed the photo on a hacker who got control of his social-networking accounts and played a prank. Weiner's spokesman, Dave Arnold, said Monday the congressman has retained an attorney to look into the situation. No formal criminal investigation has been launched, which rankles Andrew Breitbart, whose conservative website biggovernment.com first reported the photo on Weiner's Twitter account in connection with a tweet to a Seattle woman. Breitbart, who has been involved in questionable tactics against Democrats and liberals in the past, told CNN on Tuesday that the case warrants further investigation. \\"There's something fundamentally different between a prank and a hack -- a prank is innocuous, a hack is criminal,\\" Breitbart said, later adding he wanted a full investigation by the FBI and Capitol Police. However, CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said Tuesday he believed the situation was a harmless prank unworthy of further investigation. \\"Twitter is not a very secure environment,\\" Toobin said, noting that information on the site can be unreliable \\"and doesn't even come from the people it appears to come from.\\" He added: \\"There's a famous expression -- don't make a federal case out of it.\\" CNN's Kate Bolduan, Dana Bash and Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this story.

Translate to English English:","output":"The first issue was related to providing information on the remuneration and bonuses of the management personnel in annual reports. In more detail, this issue is associated with the necessity of disclosing the salary, compensation, and bonus structures of the company's management, specifically the top-ranking executives and board members, in the annual financial reports. Such disclosure is important for various reasons, including transparency, accountability, and fostering trust among the shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders. Transparency in management remuneration is crucial as it ensures the shareholders and other potential investors are aware of how the company's top management is being compensated for their work. This helps assess the alignment of the management's interests with the long-term success and growth of the company. It can also serve as an indicator of the company's financial stability and market competitiveness, as investors generally prefer companies with a balanced and well-thought-out remuneration structure. Accountability is another key factor as disclosing executive compensation signifies that the company's top management is responsible for their actions and decisions. By publicly sharing this information, it puts the management under greater scrutiny from the shareholders and the broader public. This can help prevent excessive risk-taking, mismanagement, or unethical practices, which can lead to potential financial and reputational damage to the company. Fostering trust among stakeholders is another essential aspect. Providing information on the remuneration and bonuses of the management personnel in annual reports demonstrates the company's commitment to openness, fairness, and ethical practices. This can help build confidence and trust among employees, customers, investors, and other stakeholders, which is essential for maintaining a positive corporate reputation and fostering long-term business growth. In conclusion, disclosing the remuneration and bonuses of management personnel in annual reports can have significant positive impacts on the company, such as promoting transparency, accountability, and trust. It is an important aspect of corporate governance, and companies must ensure that they diligently and openly share this information in their annual financial reports, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions and evaluate the management's commitment to acting in the best interests of the company."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

(CNN) -- Guatemala's government has declared a state of siege and sent hundreds of troops to a northern province where officials say a Mexican drug gang is overtaking towns and threatening residents. President Alvaro Colom announced the 30-day emergency rule in Alta Verapaz on Sunday. The rule allows the military to order anyone suspected of conspiring against the government to be arrested and imprisoned without a warrant, the state-run AGN news agency said. \\"Starting today, combined forces will retake the streets of Alta Verapaz,\\" a government statement released Sunday morning said. Government data shows cells of the drug gang known as Los Zetas are in the area to protect drug trafficking paths between Honduras and Mexico, \\"intimidating the population with their heavy weapons and threatening farmers to give up their land for criminal activities,\\" AGN reported. The state of siege also allows the government to place greater restrictions on public gatherings, travel visas and gun licenses, among other things, according to AGN. \\"The population should be calm. What we are doing is not intended to persecute honest, working people,\\" Interior Minister Carlos Menocal told reporters. Menocal said operations in the coming days would aim to boost regional security, regain control of territory, identify criminal gangs and capture their members. In an interview with CNN en Espanol last month, Menocal said his country needed more help from the United States to combat cartels, which were increasingly carving out new drug transport paths. \\"In the end, the large majority of drugs travel through Central America, and the assignment of resources or the financial support of the United States government is not the same as Colombia and Mexico receive,\\" he said.

The track-owning BRDC ultimately gambled on making a loss next year by succumbing to Ecclestone #39;s proposed race fee. The only sticking point now is the duration of a new contract -- Bernie wants to renegotiate","output":"This statement is about a negotiation scenario related to a Formula 1 race event to be hosted at Silverstone Circuit, managed by the British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC). Specifically, it highlights a deal being discussed between the BRDC and Bernie Ecclestone, the former chief executive of the Formula One Group, who managed the commercial aspects of Formula One racing. The primary concerns in the negotiation revolve around the race fee and contract duration. To provide some context, the British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC) is a renowned organization that owns and manages the Silverstone Circuit, the world-famous venue for the Formula 1 British Grand Prix. Formula 1 is a highly popular international motorsport series that generates significant revenue through various channels, such as ticket sales, sponsorships, and broadcasting rights. Bernie Ecclestone had been the chief executive of the organization primarily responsible for the commercial aspects of Formula 1 racing for four decades before being removed from his position in 2017. He played a pivotal role in shaping and expanding the sport, both commercially and globally. Ecclestone often negotiated with track owners and promoters to secure the best deals for Formula 1 races. In this particular scenario, the track-owning BRDC is in the midst of deciding whether to accept Ecclestone's proposed race fee. To do so would likely result in a financial loss for the upcoming year, but the BRDC and the stakeholders may view this short-term setback as an acceptable compromise if it ensures the British Grand Prix remains at Silverstone. The event is not only a significant revenue generator for the local economy, but it also holds historical and cultural importance as the inaugural Formula 1 World Championship race was hosted at Silverstone in 1950. However, the discussion between the BRDC and Ecclestone hits a sticking point when it comes to the duration of the new contract. Ecclestone wants to renegotiate the terms after a certain period, whereas the BRDC would likely prefer a more extended contract so that it has some financial security and stability over the medium to long term. Ecclestone's preference to renegotiate allows for more frequent adjustments of the race fees, potentially leading to better outcomes for the Formula One Group in the future, but it also introduces uncertainty for the BRDC. In conclusion, this statement refers to a negotiation between the British Racing Drivers' Club and Bernie Ecclestone regarding the race fee and contract duration for hosting Formula 1 races at Silverstone. The BRDC is considering accepting a short-term loss to secure the prestigious event, while the main point of contention lies in the new contract's duration. This negotiation highlights the intricate balancing act between financial concerns, historical importance, and the need for flexibility and stability in the world of professional motorsport."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"James Chadwick, an English physicist, is credited with the identification and discovery of the neutron in 1932. The neutron is a subatomic particle found in the nucleus of an atom, carrying no electrical charge and having a mass slightly greater than that of a proton. His groundbreaking discovery significantly expanded the understanding of atomic structure and provided essential insights into nuclear reactions and the development of atomic energy. Before Chadwick's discovery, atomic structure was primarily understood through the Rutherford-Bohr model, which described atoms as having a nucleus composed of positively charged protons surrounded by negatively charged electrons in orbit. The model, however, could not explain essential aspects of atomic behavior, such as the stability of certain elements or the contribution of atomic mass. Chadwick's investigation began when he reviewed the work of German physicists Walther Bothe and Herbert Becker, who observed that bombarding light elements like beryllium and boron with alpha particles resulted in the emission of a highly penetrating radiation. At first, this radiation was incorrectly thought to be gamma rays. However, the French physicist Frédéric Joliot-Curie and his wife Irène Joliot-Curie found that these \\"gamma rays\\" could eject protons from paraffin wax, suggesting that the radiation actually consisted of particles with substantial mass. Taking these findings into account, Chadwick designed a series of experiments to further examine the mysterious radiation. By placing a beryllium target in a sealed chamber filled with a specific gas and bombarding it with alpha particles, he observed that the emerging radiation could eject protons from the gas. He then measured the energies of the incident alpha particles, emitted radiation, and protons, and utilized the conservation laws of energy and momentum to determine the characteristics of the radiation's particles. Through these meticulous experiments, Chadwick ultimately deduced that the radiation was not a form of electromagnetic waves but rather a stream of uncharged particles similar in mass to protons. Chadwick named these particles \\"neutrons\\" and published his findings in a groundbreaking paper in 1932. His discovery earned him the 1935 Nobel Prize in Physics and laid the foundation for the development of nuclear energy, atomic weapons, and a more accurate understanding of atomic structure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of having smaller pores in the filter does have a direct effect on the water purification process, and it could potentially help the water purifier to work even better. Here's a detailed explanation of how this perturbation might impact the process: 1. Improved filtration: With smaller pores in the filter, it is likely that more pollutants, including smaller particles or contaminants, will be captured and removed from the water. This means that a greater percentage of impurities will be filtered out, resulting in cleaner and safer water for consumption on the other side of the filter. 2. Increased removal of harmful chemicals and metals: By having smaller pores, the filter will have a higher efficiency in capturing not only physical particulates but also chemicals and metals like chlorine, lead, and mercury. This enhances the water purifier's overall performance in delivering safe and clean water.  3. Slower flow rate: While smaller pores can lead to better filtration, they can also decrease the flow rate at which the water passes through the filter. This slower flow rate allows the filter more time to trap and remove contaminants, which could further improve the water quality. However, this may also mean that it takes longer to fill a glass or container with purified water. 4. Reduced filter lifespan: The downside of smaller pores is that they can become clogged more quickly, reducing the filter's overall lifespan. This means that the filter may need to be replaced more frequently to maintain optimal performance. Nonetheless, this could be seen as an acceptable trade-off for improved water quality. 5. Additional treatment processes: If the water contains particularly harmful contaminants that become problematic due to the smaller pores, additional treatment processes or pre-filters may be required (e.g., activated carbon, reverse osmosis) to ensure the water is appropriately purified. This could improve the overall effectiveness of the water purifier but may also increase costs and complexity. In summary, having smaller pores in a water filter can indeed help a water purifier to work better by removing a higher percentage of contaminants and impurities, providing cleaner and safer water. However, this perturbation also introduces some potential drawbacks, including a slower flow rate and shorter filter lifespan, which users should consider when evaluating overall performance improvements."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The reaction from some Christian groups was angry, and today the private university in Durham, N.C., reversed course.      \\"Duke remains committed to fostering an inclusive, tolerant and welcoming campus for all of its students,\\" Michael Schoenfeld, vice president for public affairs and government relations, said in a statement. \\"However, it was clear that what was conceived as an effort to unify was not having the intended effect.\\"      The call to traditional Muslim Friday prayers, which are currently held in the Duke Chapel's basement, will now take place in the quadrangle outside the chapel, the statement said. The location is used for interfaith programs and activities. The basement will continue to host the Friday prayer services afterward.      More than 700 of the university 15,000 undergraduate and graduate students identify as Muslim.      The Associated Press reports that though the chapel is identified by the school as a Christian church, it previously has hosted Hindu services and Buddhist meditations.      In an opinion piece this week in the News & Observer in Raleigh, Christy Lohr Sapp, associate dean for religious life at Duke University Chapel, called the decision to allow the call to prayer from the Duke Chapel \\"a larger commitment to religious pluralism that is at the heart of Duke's mission.\\"      But the university's decision was excoriated by Christian groups, and figures such as evangelist Franklin Graham, the son of the Rev. Bill Graham, criticized it on Facebook.      Graham appeared placated today by Duke's about-face.

The university had previously said a moderately amplified call to prayer would be read by members of the Muslim Students Association from the tower for about three minutes each Friday.      Michael Schoenfeld, Duke's vice president for public affairs and government relations, said it would be up to the students if they want to use some sort of amplification.      The original plan drew the ire of evangelist Franklin Graham, who urged Duke alumni to withhold support because of violence against Christians that he attributed to Muslims. Schoenfeld said emails and calls came from alumni and others in the community.      \\"There was considerable traffic and conversation and even a little bit of confusion, both within the campus and certainly outside, about what Duke was doing,\\" Schoenfeld said. \\"The purposes and goals and even the facts had been so mischaracterized as to turn it into a divisive situation, not a unifying situation.\\"      He also said there were concerns about safety and security, but he declined to elaborate on whether any specific threats had been received.      Graham, the son of the Rev. Billy Graham, wrote later in the day that the university made the right decision to cancel the plan to use the tower. However, Schoenfeld said the reversal was not due to Graham's opposition.      Shalini Subbarao, 19, a sophomore from St. Louis, said she was disappointed with the school's reversal as she walked past the chapel.      \\"I thought it was really progressive. It showed our openness to other religions,\\" she said of the original plan.      The campus was mostly business as usual on Thursday afternoon, with students leaving classes, waiting for a cross-campus bus or heading to evening meetings. Several said they were not familiar with the issue, while others' reactions were mixed.      Ios Kotaogiannis, a 39-year-old doctoral candidate in computer science who is from Greece, said he was glad officials reversed their decision.      \\"I'm a secular person. I'm not against religion. I think religion is good. But it has its place — inside the chapel,\\" he said.      The chapel is identified by the school as a Christian church but also hosts Hindu services and has been used for Buddhist meditations.      The chapel's associate dean for religious life, Christy Lohr Sapp, said before the plans were canceled that the move showed the school's commitment to religious pluralism. In a column written for The News & Observer of Raleigh, Lohr Sapp acknowledged the headlines generated by violence by extremists in ISIS, Boko Haram and al-Qaida, contrasting it to what's happening on campus.      \\"Yet, at Duke University, the Muslim community represents a strikingly different face of Islam than is seen on the nightly news: one that is peaceful and prayerful,\\" she wrote.      The private university in Durham, northwest of Raleigh, was founded by Methodists and Quakers, and its divinity school has historically been connected to the United Methodist Church. Duke has nearly 15,000 students, including about 6,500 undergraduates. The school's insignia features the Christian cross and a Latin motto translated as \\"learning and faith.\\"      The university says more than 700 of its students identify themselves as Muslim. Schoenfeld said Duke was one of the first universities in the country to hire a full-time Muslim imam when the first was named in 2008. Muslim students have been holding prayer services in the basement of the chapel for the past two years.      ___      Associated Press writers Michael Biesecker and Emery P. Dalesio in Raleigh contributed to this report. |||||","output":"Duke University, a private university in Durham, North Carolina, initially announced that it would allow the traditional Muslim call to prayer from the Duke Chapel bell tower. However, due to an angry response from some Christian groups, the university reversed its decision. Despite the change of plans, the university stated that it remains committed to fostering an inclusive, tolerant, and welcoming campus for all students. The traditional Muslim Friday prayers, initially planned to take place in the Duke Chapel's basement, will now be held in the quadrangle outside the chapel. This location is commonly utilized for interfaith programs and activities. The Friday prayer services will continue to be hosted in the basement after the call to prayer. Duke University has over 700 Muslim students out of its 15,000 undergraduate and graduate students. The chapel is identified by the school as a Christian church but has hosted Hindu services and Buddhist meditations in the past. The initial decision to allow the call to prayer was seen as a larger commitment to religious pluralism, which is at the heart of Duke's mission. However, Christian groups and figures like evangelist Franklin Graham criticized the decision. After the reversal, comments on Duke's Facebook page were mixed, with some expressing sadness and others supporting the removal of the call to prayer from the chapel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The incident took place when Qikang was caught on camera looking at a woman's shorts. As the situation escalated, the footage continued to capture him stroking her upper thigh. Realizing the woman had turned around, Qikang quickly pretended to look at his phone in an attempt to disguise his actions. Wang Qikang's case serves as a high-profile example of inappropriate behavior and demonstrates the swift response by his employer and the party to address such substandard conduct.  Shanghai Jinjiang, established in 1985, has become one of China's well-known travel agencies and stands as a prominent example of the state-run businesses that form a cornerstone of the country's economy. The company has a strong position within the industry and receives significant support from the government. The decision to exile Qikang from the Communist Party makes it apparent that both the company and the government hold their employees to a high code of conduct and ethical standards. This incident provides a window into the often-unseen challenges that women face in the workplace. Incidents of this nature are jarring and invasive, serving as a stark reminder of the work that remains to be done in combating inappropriate behavior and creating a safe and equal environment for all employees. As a result of the incident, Wang Qikang will no longer be allowed to participate in the Communist Party, a prestigious membership that implies strong allegiance to the party's ideals and policies. It remains to be seen what additional consequences might arise from his actions, but the swift response from Shanghai Jinjiang and the party affirms their commitment to maintaining a respectful and safe workplace for all employees."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Article: \\" To seek  happiness is to look for it\\" was once said by the famous French author Jules Renard. Look for it? Sure...but don't spend a lifetime trying, especially if it's well within your reach but you're just too blind to see it. Discover the three keys to happiness that you have already understood, but that you are just too afraid to find it. 1. Accepting Yourself The idea of happiness is difficult to understand if you are not at peace with yourself. Learn to accept yourself as you are. Your next step will be to improve your attitude for tomorrow, for the next day, for the day after that, and so forth. By beginning to accept reality, you will come to the final point of true happiness. Only when you are at peace with yourself, will you finally be able to admit  that you are, in fact, a happy person. 2. Forgiving Others Forgiving others is a true show of humanity  which also allows us to feel more at ease. When you learn to forgive, you also learn to keep a firm hold on your life. To forgive is to open the doors of personal satisfaction. Yet you simply open your mind to answer, \\" Do I really want to allow my anger to grow and eat me from inside out?\\" 3. Helping Your Neighbors When a friend seems to be suffering from a state of depression  , it's quite easy to help him or her out of the trouble. The best attitude to have in this situation is to make him or her understand that he or she is not alone. If you come to save a friend in need, you'll feel a lot more at peace with yourself. You will feel high--spirited by knowing that someone is looking at life on the brighter side thanks to your kind words. ,. Question: Who most probably feels happy?

D: Mrs. Lee, refusing his best friend's apology. A:","output":"Based on the article, the one who most probably feels happy is B: Mrs. Black, loving his teaching job deeply. This option aligns with the first key to happiness mentioned in the article, which is accepting yourself and being at peace with your current state. Mrs. Black seems to have accepted and found joy in his current job, which, according to the article, is a vital step toward happiness. The other options suggest dissatisfaction or conflict with the current reality, such as dreaming for a better job, unwillingness to face failure, or refusal to forgive, which are contrary to the paths toward happiness indicated in the article."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In this case, Sentence A (Sentence 1) is \\"Knowth has two passage graves\\" and Sentence B (Sentence 2) is \\"Knowth has two graves.\\" Step 1: Understand the two sentences. Sentence 1 specifies that Knowth has two specific types of graves - \\"passage graves.\\" Sentence 2 suggests that Knowth has two graves but does not specify the type. Step 2: Compare the sentences. In the comparison, there is a reduction of specificity from Sentence 1 to Sentence 2, from \\"passage graves\\" to just \\"graves.\\" However, since \\"passage graves\\" are a type of grave, Sentence 1's claim that Knowth has two \\"passage graves\\" would also imply that Knowth has two \\"graves.\\" Step 3: Make a conclusion based on the comparison. Given the reduction in specificity, yet the fact that Sentence 2's claim falls within the scope of what is conveyed in Sentence 1, it can be said that Sentence 2 (Knowth has two graves) is indeed entailed by Sentence 1 (Knowth has two passage graves). This is because if Sentence 1 is true (Knowth has two passage graves), then Sentence 2 (Knowth has two graves) must also be true.

But I am afraid you are wrong. If you don't believe, you may do a small experiment . First, put two objects with the same weight into two boxes. Then cover the boxes. Wrap  one box with a red piece of paper, the other with a white piece of paper. Now hold the boxes with your hand one by one. It is certain that you will think the red one is a little heavier. Why does it happen? A scientist found that different colours have different weight in a man's mind. So he did many tests and at last he got the result. That is to say, every colour has its own weight in our mind. The heaviest colour is red, then blue, green, orange, yellow and white. The scientists told us that colours also have smell. Can you smell the colour? Of course not. Then why did the scientists say so? That is because every colour represents a kind of light wave ------ a certain wavelength . It reaches our brain  through organs  According to this discovery, scientists say that people accept the colour they like, and _ the colour they hate. So your body and mind will be healthy by using the colours you like. Or you'll be nervous or even get ill. If you stay in a room with red windows, wallpapers and furniture  for two hours, you'll feel you have been there for four hours. But if the room is blue, you'll feel you have been there for only one hour. Another example, if a person walks out of a red room and into a blue room, his temperature will fall.

Answer: The U.S. subprime mortgage crisis was a set of events and conditions that led to a financial crisis and subsequent recession that began in 2008. Question: when us subprime mortgage market collapse Answer:","output":"Yes, the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis was indeed a significant event that contributed to the financial crisis and recession that started in 2008. The collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage market began in 2007 and reached its peak in 2008, causing severe consequences for the global financial system. Subprime mortgages refer to home loans given to borrowers with lower credit scores and a higher probability of defaulting on their repayments. In the years leading up to the crisis, there was an immense growth in the subprime mortgage market, largely driven by factors such as low-interest rates, increased securitization of mortgages, and a housing market boom. Major financial institutions, attracted by high-interest rates and the seemingly never-ending growth of the housing market, started issuing more subprime mortgages and invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities (MBS). These securities pooled together mortgages and were sold to investors who hoped to profit from the repayments made by borrowers. In order to create more MBS, lenders began lowering underwriting standards for mortgages, approving riskier loans, and lending to borrowers who would have previously been ineligible. The subprime mortgage market began to collapse when housing prices started to decline significantly in 2006, and many borrowers found themselves with mortgages they could not afford. As a result, the default rates on subprime mortgages skyrocketed, leading to substantial losses for the investors who held MBS and other mortgage-related securities. This ignited a series of events that led to the broader financial crisis. In 2007, banks and other financial institutions began experiencing liquidity issues, and by mid-2007, the situation deteriorated so severely that some of the largest subprime mortgage lenders in the United States filed for bankruptcy. These events exposed the excessive risk-taking and flawed practices that had taken place within the financial sector. As institutions across the world started to report major losses on their subprime-related investments, the financial crisis spiraled out of control, leading to the collapse of several major banks and the government bailouts of others. The crisis spilled over into the broader economy, resulting in job losses, decreased consumer spending, and a prolonged recession that lasted well into the next decade. In summary, the U.S. subprime mortgage market collapse began in 2007 and reached its peak in 2008, significantly contributing to the global financial crisis and subsequent recession. This crisis stemmed from a series of unsustainable practices in the financial sector, such as issuing risky loans and investing in complex mortgage-backed securities. The fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis had widespread and long-lasting effects on the economy, affecting millions of individuals and businesses around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please write a short summary for the following article: Inside the mind of Oscar Pistorius Oscar Pistorius, the double amputee and Olympic athlete on trial for murder, has said that, once he was introduced to competitive running, he has “never looked back.” That may be one reason why he vomited upon hearing how the Black Talon bullets he fired into his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp ripped apart his girlfriend’s body. He couldn’t turn his back; he couldn’t run away. The past would not disappear. Without question, Pistorius’ past is full of trauma and triumph. Born without fibulas, he underwent below the knee amputations when he was just 11 months old. No one can underestimate the struggles of a boy to grow up without legs, or the courage required to do so, nor the remarkable force of will it takes to compete against able-bodied athletes while wearing carbon fiber limbs. Maybe, though, there was more than sadness and resolve that took hold inside the mind of Oscar Pistorius as he moved forward in life, through sheer determination. I have never met the man, and certainly have not treated him, but it seems as though rage was building up inside Pistorius, too. During 2008, when a young woman refused to leave a party he was hosting, he was arrested for assaulting her by slamming a door on her leg. The charges were later dropped. A former girlfriend, Samantha Taylor, has testified that Pistorius was both controlling and prone to rage. Once, after being stopped by police for a traffic violation, Pistorius reportedly fired a gun through the open sunroof of his car. Oscar Pistorius, it seems, does not like being stopped. And he does not like looking back. The trouble with that, of course, is that, when taken to an extreme, it prevents a person from confronting and being humanized by the pain and suffering inherent in his past, and risks being dehumanized by it. Maybe buried feelings of vulnerability from being a child without legs can explain why, as a man, he kept tigers as pets. Maybe the halting steps he needed to take at three and four and nine years old can explain why he not only had a passion for speed as a runner, but, according to a profile in the New York Times magazine, drove at 155 miles per hour, in the rain. Maybe it explains why he was in the habit of going to a gun range to shoot when he couldn’t sleep at night—to use the alchemy of gunpowder to turn anxiety into power. Maybe it explains why he reportedly threatened to break the legs of a man who he believed was flirting with his then-18-year old girlfriend. Maybe it even explains why he reportedly accidentally once shot a friend of his in the foot. When a man without legs slams a young woman’s leg in a door, threatens to break another man’s legs and shoots his buddy in the foot, it doesn’t take a psychiatrist to wonder whether he has really overcome all his feelings about losing his limbs and whether he has run away from feeling disempowered, in part by seeking power over others. If Oscar Pistorius is found guilty of murdering Reeva Steenkamp, it may well be because she argued with Mr. Pistorius and locked the door to the bathroom in which she died, putting something immovable in his path—something he might have liked to—but couldn’t—kick down. And for a man who has “never looked back” at the past once he strapped carbon fiber blades to his knees and started running, that door, standing defiantly on its hinges, could have been an intolerable reminder of it. Dr. Keith Ablow is a psychiatrist and member of the Fox News Medical A-Team. Dr. Ablow can be reached at info@keithablow.com.","output":"The article delves into the mind of Oscar Pistorius, providing an insight into the struggles he has faced and his determination to overcome them. Born without fibulas, Pistorius underwent amputations at the age of 11 months before going on to become a renowned Olympic athlete despite his disability. However, his past is filled with a mix of trauma and triumph, creating potential rage within him. Instances of this rage include an arrest for assault in 2008, having been controlling with an ex-girlfriend, Samantha Taylor, and even firing a gun through his car's sunroof after being stopped for a traffic violation. The article suggests that Pistorius' actions may be driven by past feelings of vulnerability and a desire to gain power and control over others. If found guilty of murdering Reeva Steenkamp, it could be because she put an obstacle in his path, arguing and locking the bathroom door, reminding him of the past he tries so hard to move beyond."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is more blood flowing to the right or left knee?  Ryan is carrying groceries from his car back to his apartment when he trips and falls landing on his knees. Embarrassed, he gets back up, picks up his groceries and carries them into his apartment with his head down. After putting his groceries away, he notices that although both of his knees are scraped, only his left knee is warm to the touch. His right knee feels cool when he puts his hand on it.  Hint: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. Answer:","output":"Based on the given paragraph, more blood is flowing to Ryan's left knee. This can be inferred from the description of his left knee being warm to the touch, which is a sign of inflammation. Inflammation is a natural defense mechanism of the body against infections or injuries and is caused by chemicals released when skin or other tissues are damaged. These chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand, leading to increased blood flow in the affected area. In Ryan's case, the fact that his left knee is warm indicates that there is an ongoing inflammatory response taking place in his left knee due to the scrape that occurred when he fell. The dilation of blood vessels in the area has led to increased blood flow, making his left knee warm. On the other hand, his right knee is cooled and doesn't show signs of warmth or inflammation, which suggests that there is less blood flow to that area. To sum up, more blood is flowing to Ryan's left knee in response to the inflammatory process happening there."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Information:  - Odontoglossum, first named in 1816 by Karl Sigismund Kunth, is a genus of about 100 orchids. The scientific name is derived from the Greek words \\"odon\\" (tooth) and \\"glossa\\" (tongue), referring to the two tooth-like calluses on the base of the lip. This genus of cool to cold growing orchids is to be found on open spots in the humid cloud forest at higher elevations from Central- and West South America to Guyana, with most species around the northern Andes. The abbreviation for this genus is Odm. in the horticultural trade.  - Miltonia, abbreviated Milt. in the horticultural trade, is an orchid genus formed by nine epiphyte species and eight natural hybrids inhabitants of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, one species reaching the northeast of Argentina and east of Paraguay. This genus was established by John Lindley in 1837, when he described its type species, \\"Miltonia spectabilis\\". Many species were attributed to \\"Miltonia\\" in the past, however, today, the species from Central America and from cooler areas on northwest of South America have been moved to other genera. \\"Miltonia\\" species have large and long lasting flowers, often in multifloral inflorescences. This fact, allied to being species that are easy to grow and to identify, make them a favorite of orchid collectors all over the world. Species of this genus are extensively used to produce artificial hybrids.  - The Oncidiinae is a subtribe within the Orchidaceae that consists of a number of genera that are closely related.   - The West Indies or Caribbean Basin is a region of the North Atlantic Ocean in the Caribbean, that includes the island nations and surrounding waters of three major archipelagoes: the Greater Antilles, the Lesser Antilles and the Lucayan Archipelago. The term is synonymous with the term \\"Caribbean Basin\\". The region is known as the area running from Florida westward along the Gulf coast, then south along the Mexican coast through Central America and then eastward across the northern coast of South America. Bermuda is also included within the region even though it is in the west-central Atlantic, due to its common cultural history created by European colonization of the region, and in most of the region by the presence of a significant group of African descent.  - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León.  - Oncidium, abbreviated as Onc. in the horticultural trade, is a genus that contains about 330 species of orchids from the subtribe Oncidiinae of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). As presently conceived (May 2014), it is distributed across much of South America, Central America, Mexico and the West Indies, with one species \\"(O. ensatum)\\" extending into Florida. Common names for plants in this genus include dancing-lady orchid and golden shower orchid. In 2008, Oxfords Annals of Botany labeled the \\"Oncidium\\" alliance \\"grossly polyphyletic.\\" The American Orchid Society labeled this genus a \\"dumping ground.\\" After DNA testing and much debate, a consensus was announced (April 2013) resulting in major taxonomic changes to \\"Oncidium, Gomesa, Odontoglossum, Miltonia,\\" and others. Much of this debate and subsequent housekeeping was initiated by significant research for the scientific publication Genera Orchidacearum Volume 5. As a result, much of the information in this article is now deprecated, but still of great value. One significant change is the move of most Brazilian \\"Oncidium\\" with a fused lateral sepal to the genus \\"Gomesa\\". The Royal Horticultural Society system, the World Checklist of Monocots database at http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/home.do and the American Orchid Society have already updated their databases to reflect most of these changes.  Description. This genus was first described by Olof Swartz in 1800 with the orchid \\"Oncidium altissimum\\", which has become the type species. Its name is derived from the Greek word , \\"onkos\\", meaning \\"swelling\\". This refers to the callus at the lower lip.  - Florida (Spanish for \\"land of flowers\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Alabama and Georgia, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Straits of Florida and Cuba. Florida is the 22nd most extensive, the 3rd most populous, and the 8th most densely populated of the U.S. states. Jacksonville is the most populous municipality in the state and is the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is Florida's most populous urban area. The city of Tallahassee is the state capital.  - Annals of Botany is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal, founded in 1887, that publishes research articles, brief communications, and reviews in all areas of botany. The journal is supported and managed by Annals of Botany Company, a non-profit educational charity, and published through Oxford University Press. According to the 2011 \\"Journal Citation Reports\\" it has an impact factor of 4.030, in 2009 ranking 18th out of 172 in the category Plant Sciences.  - Olof Peter Swartz (September 21, 1760  September 19, 1818) was a Swedish botanist and taxonomist. He is best known for his taxonomic work and studies into pteridophytes. He attended the University of Uppsala where he studied under Carolus Linnaeus the Younger and received his doctorate in 1781.  He first traveled in 1780, to Lapland in the company of several other botanists. In 1783 he sailed for North America and the West Indies, primarily in the area of Jamaica and Hispaniola, to collect botanical specimens. His botanical collection, of an impressive 6000 specimens, is now held by the Swedish Museum of Natural History, as part of the Regnellian herbarium. By 1786 he left for London to prepare his collection. There he met Joseph Banks, who was impressed with his knowledge of Botany. He was offered a position with the British East India Company as a travelling physician, but turned it down, and returned to Sweden in 1787. Ten years later he proposed to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (of which he became a member in 1789) the idea of a permanent travel grant, based on the methods he had seen employed by Banks within the British Empire. In 1791 he became Professor Bergianus at the Academy of Sciences at Stockholm. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1805.  - The American Orchid Society is a horticultural society devoted to education, conservation, and research of orchids (plant family Orchidaceae). The organization was founded in 1921, and now has a worldwide membership. The organization publishes a monthly magazine, \\"Orchids, The Bulletin of the American Orchid Society.\\" The society's website American Orchid Society website has the answer to all questions orchid, including helpful, reliable information on how to grow your orchids.   - × Brassidium , abbreviated in trade journals Brsdm , is an intergeneric hybrid between the orchid genera Brassia and Oncidium ( Brs x Onc ) .  - Brassia is a genus of orchids classified in the Oncidiinae subtribe.

Try wearing lip balm at night to moisturize your lips while you sleep. Apply the lip balm right before bed so that your lips will benefit from the treatment in the morning. If you do not have any lip balm, then you can just use a bit of olive or coconut oil (at room temperature) on your lips instead. Moisturizing your lips during the day is also important. You can use an intense moisturizing balm if your lips are extra dry, but a regular tube of lip balm will also work. Keep your lip balm handy and reapply it often. Before you apply any liner or lipstick to your lips, you should apply a deep moisturizing lip balm or at least a heavy layer of regular lip balm. This will help to create a moist, smooth canvas for your lipstick. Apply the lip balm to your lips about 15 to 30 minutes before you want to apply your lipstick. Look for a lipstick that is moisturizing rather than long lasting. Long lasting lipsticks may dry out or irritate your lips more than other types of lipstick.  If you are planning on some serious kissing, then you may want to go with a nude or pale pink shade rather than a bright red or coral. Otherwise your kissing partner may end up with lipstick all over. A lip stain may also be a good choice because stains do not come off your lips as easily.","output":"To have soft and kissable lips, keep them moist by putting on lip balm before bed and during the day.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Hi, my name is Wang Jun. Do you want to know about my staying in America? Well, to tell you the truth, it is really an eye-opening experience here. In China, I had English classes five times a week since Grade Five. But I didn't know textbook English could be so different from everyday English until I came to Hotchkiss School, Connecticut. When I first studied English, I was told to say \\"I'm fine.\\" when people say \\"How are you?\\" But in the USA, I found that people say \\"I'm good.\\" or \\"I'm tired.\\" One day, someone greeted   me with \\"What's up?\\" It made me _ I thought for a moment and then smiled because I didn't know what to say.

Please answer this question: who was involved in the valentine's day massacre?","output":"To accomplish this task, I'll need to research the details of the Valentine's Day Massacre and identify the individuals involved. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of my approach: 1. Understand the context: The Valentine's Day Massacre, an infamous event, took place on February 14, 1929. It was a major incident during the Prohibition Era in the United States. 2. Determine the nature of the event: I already know that the Valentine's Day Massacre was a violent incident, so I'll focus on any criminal organizations or individuals that were involved in it. 3. Research details about the event: By searching for information on the Valentine's Day Massacre, I can learn about the motivation behind the event, the parties involved, and the individuals implicated. After researching the Valentine's Day Massacre, I found the following details: - The Valentine's Day Massacre was a gangland mass murder that took place in Chicago, Illinois, between two powerful criminal organizations: the North Side Irish gang, led by George \\"Bugs\\" Moran, and the South Side Italian gang, led by Al \\"Scarface\\" Capone. - The event led to the murder of seven members of Bugs Moran's gang. - Al Capone's gang is believed to have orchestrated the massacre to eliminate Bugs Moran and take control over the lucrative bootlegging business in Chicago. However, Bugs Moran was not present at the massacre and managed to escape the attack. - The actual killers have never been conclusively identified, but suspects included notorious hitmen from both the Capone gang and other criminal groups. To summarize, the two main parties involved in the Valentine's Day Massacre were Al Capone's South Side Italian gang and George \\"Bugs\\" Moran's North Side Irish gang. The specific individuals who carried out the attack have never been definitively identified."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Question: what is the difference between multistage and cluster sampling I found the following answer on Google: Assuming a fixed sample size, the technique gives more accurate results when most of the variation in the population is within the groups, not between them. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"Yes, the given answer is correct to some extent, but it does not fully explain the difference between multistage and cluster sampling. Let me provide a more detailed and long answer: Multistage and cluster sampling are both probability sampling techniques used when dealing with large, dispersed populations. They are methods to select a representative sample from a population for the purpose of research or data analysis. However, the approach and structure used in each method are different. Multistage Sampling: Multistage sampling is a technique that involves multiple stages in selecting samples from a population. In this approach, the population is divided into various subgroups (usually hierarchical), and then the samples are selected sequentially at each level. The primary purpose of multistage sampling is to simplify the process of data collection and reduce costs without sacrificing the representativeness of the sample. Multistage sampling usually follows these steps: 1. Divide the population into different levels like regions, cities, districts, or neighborhoods. 2. Select the first-stage samples from these levels. 3. Further divide the first-stage samples into smaller units. 4. Select the second-stage samples from these smaller units. 5. Continue this process until the desired unit of analysis is reached. Cluster Sampling: Cluster sampling is a technique in which the population is divided into groups or clusters; these clusters should be heterogeneous and contain similar variations as in the whole population. Then, a random sample of clusters is selected, and all units within these chosen clusters are included in the sample. Cluster sampling usually follows these steps: 1. Divide the population into non-overlapping clusters. 2. Select a random sample of clusters. 3. Include all units within the selected clusters in the sample. Comparison of Multistage and Cluster Sampling: The primary difference between the two methods lies in the process of selecting samples. In multistage sampling, samples are selected step by step from different levels, while in cluster sampling, samples are selected all at once in the form of clusters. When it comes to accuracy, multistage sampling can be more accurate if there is a high degree of similarity within the subgroups in each stage, whereas cluster sampling gives more accurate results when there is significant variation within the clusters but less variation between the clusters. Another difference is that multistage sampling can be more efficient in terms of data collection costs because samples are selected sequentially, thus reducing the need for collecting data from the entire population. In conclusion, both multistage and cluster sampling are useful techniques for dealing with large, dispersed populations. The choice between the two methods depends on factors like the population structure, available resources, and research objectives. While the provided Google answer is correct to some extent, it does not differentiate between the two methods and explain their unique characteristics."},{"instruction":"We have two daughters: Kristen is seven years old and Kelly is four.Last Sunday evening, we invited some people home for dinner.I dressed them nicely for the party, and told them that their job was to join Mommy in answering the door when the bell rang.Mommy would introduce them to the guests, and then they would take the guests' coats upstairs and put them on the bed in the second bedroom.

Question: You are given a new situation: Two brothers owned two adjacent parcels of land. Tom's land was forested, while Bill's was covered with grasslands.  and a hint : Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers.  Please answer this question : Which parcel of land had an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information, the parcel of land that had an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers is Tom's land.

Let's analyze the original sentence and the derived sentence to understand why this is the case. Original sentence: \\"Man plays backgammon on a cobbled sidewalk with another man while talking on his cellphone while a third man looks on.\\" From this sentence, we can gather the following information: 1. There are three men involved in this situation. 2. Two of the men are engaged in playing backgammon on a cobbled sidewalk, which implies an outdoor location. 3. One of the men who is playing backgammon is also talking on his cellphone. 4. There is a third man who is observing the situation or \\"looking on\\". Now, let's examine the derived sentence: \\"A person watches two others play a game outdoors.\\" This sentence conveys the following facts: 1. There is a person observing or watching the scene. 2. Two other people are engaged in playing a game. 3. The game and the watching are both happening in an outdoor setting. Comparing the original sentence and the derived sentence, we can see that the derived sentence captures the essence of the original one, albeit with fewer details. The two men playing backgammon are represented as \\"two others playing a game,\\" the cobbled sidewalk confirms the outdoor setting, and the third man looking on can be considered as \\"a person watches\\". Therefore, the sentence \\"A person watches two others play a game outdoors\\" is indeed a true sentence based on the information provided in the original sentence.

In a letter sent to NBC news and released on Friday, Manning says the Defence Department has not followed through with its promises after the defence secretary, Chuck Hagel, approved a treatment plan that includes allowing her to dress as a woman. “Unfortunately, despite silence, and then lip-service, the military has not yet provided me with any such treatment,” Manning wrote in a statement sent to NBC from Fort Leavenworth prison in Kansas. “However, prisons – and especially military prisons – reinforce and impose strong gender norms – making gender the most fundamental aspect of institutional life.” Manning was sentenced as Bradley Manning in August 2013 for leaking nearly 700,000 documents to the site WikiLeaks. The documents revealed a 38-minute video of an American airstrike in Baghdad that killed two Reuters journalists and wounded children, as well as embarrassing diplomatic cables. Shortly after the sentence was handed down, Manning went public with her gender dysphoria. “Despite having received at least four diagnoses of gender dysphoria, Chelsea has received no treatment,” Manning’s attorney, David Coombs, told NBC News. Manning’s requests for hormone therapy and amended grooming and clothing standards have all been denied, Coombs said. “If the military does not do the right thing, we are prepared to pursue litigation to vindicate her constitutional rights,” Coombs said. Earlier this month, Coombs threatened to file a lawsuit if treatment did not begin by 4 September. Manning said in her letter to NBC that the prison’s gender norms make it hard to “feel comfortable in my own skin”. “For example, in my daily life, I am reminded of this when I look at the name on my badge, the first initial sewed into my clothing, the hair and grooming standards that I adhere to, and the titles and courtesies used by the staff. Ultimately, I just want to be able to live my life as the person that I am.” “The continued failure to provide Ms Manning with this treatment is inconsistent with well-established medical protocols and basic constitutional principles,” Chase Strangio, attorney for the ACLU’s Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender Project, said in a statement to the Associated Press earlier this month. Strangio said refusing to treat Manning is “cruel and unusual punishment,” and advocates for Manning stressed that “there is a clear medical consensus that gender dysphoria is a serious medical condition,” which, left untreated, “can lead to severe medical problems”. The army declined to tell NBC if treatment would begin soon. “The Department of Defence has approved a request by army leadership to provide required medical treatment for an inmate diagnosed with gender dysphoria. I can’t discuss the medical needs of an individual,” an army spokeswoman, Lt Col Alayne Conway, told NBC. Calls from the Guardian to Fort Leavenworth were directed to the military’s chief public information office. Calls to that office were not immediately returned.","output":"US Army private Chelsea Manning, who was sentenced to a 35-year prison term for giving secret documents to WikiLeaks, claims she is being denied gender-reassignment treatment by the military.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. John is an automotive enthusiast. He was visiting the auto show in his city. Two cars caught his attention, car A and car B. Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter. On the contrary, car B was older and didn't have catalytic converter. But he found the design of older car more attractive.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which car would contribute to less cleaner atmosphere, car A or car B?  Hint: Catalytic converters in cars increase the rates of several important reactions. Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere.","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph and the hint, car B, the older car without a catalytic converter, would contribute to a less clean atmosphere compared to car A.  The absence of a catalytic converter in car B means that the harmful emissions produced during the combustion of fuel are not effectively converted into less harmful substances. As the hint explains, catalytic converters help increase the rate at which unburned hydrocarbons are converted into carbon dioxide and water, carbon monoxide is oxidized into carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. These processes significantly decrease the harmful emissions released by cars and contribute to a cleaner atmosphere. In contrast, car A is newer and has a catalytic converter, ensuring that the harmful emissions are treated before being released into the atmosphere. This results in cleaner and more environmentally friendly emissions, making car A the better choice in terms of reducing air pollution and contributing to a cleaner atmosphere. Despite John's preference for car B's design, it is important to consider the environmental impact, and car A would be a more environmentally responsible choice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They convey different information about the number of votes Lee and Chiang received. Let's break down both sentences to see the differences. In the first sentence: \\"Lee received 1,012 out of 1,064 votes while Chiang received 873 votes.\\" This sentence tells us that: 1. Lee received 1,012 votes. 2. There were a total of 1,064 votes cast. 3. Chiang received 873 votes. In the second sentence: \\"1,012 out of 1,064 votes, while Lee received 873 votes.\\" This sentence presents incomplete information. It tells us that: 1. Someone (not specified) received 1,012 votes out of 1,064 votes, which implies that this person won by a large margin. 2. There were a total of 1,064 votes cast. 3. Lee received 873 votes. (However, it does not provide any information about Chiang's votes in this sentence) By comparing these two sentences, we can see that the subjects and the number of votes they received are not the same in both sentences. In the first one, Lee received the higher number of votes (1,012), while Chiang received the lower number of votes (873). In the second sentence, Lee received 873 votes, but the person who received 1,012 votes is not identified, and it omits information about Chiang's votes. To make the second sentence convey the same meaning as the first sentence, it should be rewritten as: \\"Chiang received 873 votes while Lee received 1,012 out of 1,064 votes.\\" Now, both sentences convey the same information about Lee and Chiang's votes."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Movie plot title: The Hunted Movie plot: Paul Racine, a computer-chip executive from New York, is on a business trip to Nagoya. He meets Kirina in the hotel lounge, and they have a one-night stand. Kirina is approached by Kinjo and two ninjas. Kirina shows no fear and Kinjo, the leader of a cult of ninja assassins and grants her final wish by showing his face. Paul returns and hides in the foyer while calling the police. When Kinjo decapitates Kirina, Paul tries to come to her defense and then tries to flee. Enraged that someone has seen his face, Kinjo's men stab Paul, hit him with a poisoned shuriken and slash his throat, leaving him for dead. Paul awakes in a hospital room, but his claims of seeing Kinjo are met with disbelief by the police. Lieutenant Wadakura dismisses the allegation and suspects that the murder is the work of a Yakuza syndicate. Paul is approached by Ijuro Takeda, an expert on the cult and Kinjo. Paul discovers that Takeda is the last in a samurai line and has a score to settle with Kinjo. The ninjas attempts to murder Paul at the hospital, killing several hospital staff and police officers, including Wadakura, but Paul escapes. Takeda and his wife Mieko subsequently take Paul to their family's stronghold, located on an island several hundred miles away. Leaving the city, Takeda uses Paul as bait to draw Kinjo out, leading to a battle on the train where several passenger cars of innocent people are slaughtered by the ninjas. Takeda and Mieko defeat the attackers, but Kinjo was not among them. The ninja leading the attack was Junko, Kinjo's lover, giving Kinjo motivation to kill Paul and Takeda. On the island, Paul spends time with the drunken blacksmith Oshima, who is constructing a sword for Takeda, and the old man teaches him about smithing and swordsmanship. Mieko explains the history of the two clans' conflict and the samurai concepts of courage and honor. Mieko is sympathetic toward Paul, the polar opposite of her husband, although she remains loyal to Takeda. Kinjo decides to find out who hired his clan to murder Kirina....

Given the question \\"How would you describe Addison?\\", is \\"sad that the show was over\\" a valid answer? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, the answer \\"sad that the show was over\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"How would you describe Addison?\\", because there is no mention of her emotional state after the show. However, we can infer her emotions before or during the event. Addison scheduled Casey, her cat, to appear at the cat show. This action shows that she is proactive and probably has a passion for cats or is proud of her cat's qualities and achievements. She might have invested time and effort into making sure Casey is well-groomed, trained, and prepared for the show. Furthermore, Addison is described as excited, which indicates that she is enthusiastic about the event and looking forward to the cat show. Excitement usually implies that someone is looking forward to an experience or anticipates positive outcomes, such as receiving compliments about her cat or even winning an award at the event. People who feel excited are typically characterized as being in a positive and high-energy emotional state. Since there is no information about Addison's feelings after the show, we cannot assume that she would feel sad when it is over. It is essential to gather more information or context to provide accurate descriptions about any individual's emotions after a particular event. To conclude, given the question \\"How would you describe Addison?\\", the answer \\"sad that the show was over\\" is not valid based on the available information.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person for whose illustrations it is suggested that the Embarkation of Henry VIII at Dover likely served as a source of inspiration?, using the article: The \\"ship portrait\\" had a long history in maritime art, from medieval seals and coins to early engravings in the 15th century, and the plain side-on view of a ship under sail, often with no crew shown, was well established as the most effective way of recording the build of vessels.  The Anthony Roll belongs to a genre of works that was intended to serve a dual role for the king and the military leadership: as reasonably informative overviews listing details of ships or strategic areas of coastlines they could be studied to determine strengths and weaknesses, and as boastful and lively depictions of Tudor military might they could be used to flatter the king, impress courtiers and impose martial authority on foreign ambassadors. Contemporary maps, or \\"plats\\", were routinely decorated with detailed pictures of ships, to mark bodies of water as much as to liven up the scenes. Such maps were common at the time, and were even embellished by artists if deemed too simple or drab. The navy was expanded during Henry VIII's reign, and he was known to take an interest in warships, as can be seen by the epic painting Embarkation of Henry VIII at Dover which portrayed, if rather unrealistically, the ships that took the 29-year-old king to the summit meeting with Francis I of France at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. This painting, recently dated to around 1545, has also been suggested as a likely source of inspiration to Anthony for his illustrations.There are three such plats depicting naval actions and expeditions that are attributed to Anthony: the route of Anne of Cleves from the Low Countries to England (1539), a French attack on a coastal fort (date unknown) and a French raid on Brighton (July 1545). The design of the ships in these paintings, especially that of the Brighton raid, closely match those in the rolls. It is not known exactly when work on the rolls began nor when it was finished. It is only certain that it was presented to the king the year it was dated, 1546. The inclusion of the Mary Rose that..., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","output":"Anthony. The name of the person for whose illustrations it is suggested that the Embarkation of Henry VIII at Dover likely served as a source of inspiration is Anthony. In the context provided, it is evident that Anthony created detailed ship illustrations and that his work on the three plats depicting naval actions and expeditions share similarities with the painting \\"Embarkation of Henry VIII at Dover.\\" Therefore, the painting is considered a likely source of inspiration for Anthony's illustrations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging. According to the above context, answer the following question. What is probably true about John? Answer:","output":"It's important to note that the original text does not provide direct information about John, and thus making any definitive statements about him could be misleading or inaccurate. However, we can infer some possibilities about John's role or experience in an organization, based on the context provided. In an organization characterized by the dynamics explained in the context, John could be: 1. An employee who faces challenges due to the traditional management hierarchy, which may restrict or impact his creativity, ideas, and potential. 2. A leader who recognizes the complexities and nuances within the organizational structure, and strives to promote a more inclusive, engaging working environment, where employees feel valued and can contribute more effectively. 3. A professional who has experienced growing divides between senior leadership and employees on the ground level in previous organizations, thus gaining insights and understanding of the common issues that arise in such settings. 4. Someone who has identified issues within organizational structures, and perhaps endeavors to foster a healthier, more cohesive work environment that allows for employees to feel empowered, respected, and able to contribute. 5. An individual who understands that frustrations and conflicts, while unavoidable, can serve as catalysts for improvement within companies, and therefore may be inclined to view challenges within his organization as opportunities for positive change and growth. In summary, while we cannot make specific claims about John due to a lack of information, it's probable that he is involved in the organizational dynamics discussed in the context, experiencing or attempting to manage the challenges presented."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - \\"Help Me Make It Through The Night\\" is a country music ballad written and composed by Kris Kristofferson and released on his 1970 album \\"Kristofferson.\\"  - Kristoffer \\"Kris\\" Kristofferson (born June 22, 1936) is an American singer, songwriter, musician and actor. He wrote and recorded the songs \\"Me and Bobby McGee\\", \\"For the Good Times\\", \\"Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down\\" and \\"Help Me Make It Through the Night\\". Kristofferson composed his own songs and collaborated with Nashville songwriters such as Shel Silverstein. In 1985, Kristofferson joined fellow country artists Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash in forming the country music supergroup The Highwaymen. In 2004, Kristofferson was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. He is also known for his starring roles in \\"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\\" and \\"A Star Is Born\\", the latter for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor.  - The Nashville sound originated during the mid 1950s as a subgenre of American country music, replacing the chart dominance of the rough honky tonk music which was most popular in the 1940s and 1950s with \\"smooth strings and choruses\\", \\"sophisticated background vocals\\" and \\"smooth tempos\\". It was an attempt \\"to revive country sales, which had been devastated by the rise of rock 'n' roll.\\"  - Willie Hugh Nelson (born April 29, 1933) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, author, poet, actor, and activist. The critical success of the album \\"Shotgun Willie\\" (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of \\"Red Headed Stranger\\" (1975) and \\"Stardust\\" (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana.  - Johnny Cash (born J. R. Cash; February 26, 1932  September 12, 2003) was an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, actor, and author. He was widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century and one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 90 million records worldwide. Although primarily remembered as a country music icon, his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel. This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple inductions in the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame.  - Shotgun Willie is a 1973 album by Willie Nelson. The recording marks a change of style for Nelson, who later stated that the album \\"cleared his throat\\". When Nelson refused to sign an early extension of his contract with RCA in 1972, the label decided not to release any further recordings. Nelson hired Neil Reshen as his manager, and while Reshen negotiated with RCA, Nelson moved to Austin, Texas, where the ongoing hippie music scene at the Armadillo World Headquarters renewed his musical style. In Nashville, Nelson met producer Jerry Wexler, vice president of Atlantic Records, who was interested in his music. Reshen solved the problems with RCA and signed Nelson with Atlantic Records as their first country music artist.  - \\"Me and Bobby McGee\\" is a song written by Kris Kristofferson and Fred Foster, originally performed by Roger Miller. Others performed the song later, including the Grateful Dead, Kristofferson himself, Kenny Rogers and The First Edition and most famously by Janis Joplin, whose posthumously released version topped the U.S. singles chart in 1971, making the song the second posthumously released No. 1 single in U.S. chart history after \\"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\\" by Otis Redding. \\"Billboard\\" ranked Joplin's version as the No. 11 song for 1971.  - Outlaw country is a subgenre of American country music, most popular during the 1970s and early-1980s, sometimes referred to as the outlaw movement or simply outlaw music. The music has its roots in earlier subgenres like honky tonk and rockabilly and is characterized by a blend of rock and folk rhythms, country instrumentation and introspective lyrics. The movement began as a reaction to the slick production and popular structures of the Nashville sound developed by record producers like Chet Atkins.  - Sings Kristofferson is a studio album recorded by Willie Nelson in 1979 consisting of all covers of Kris Kristofferson songs . It reached # 5 on the US Country albums chart , # 42 on the US Pop albums charts , and was certified gold in Canada and platinum in the US . The cover is very simple , a single picture of Nelson 's face against a black background , with the song titles to the right of his face . The back cover is the same background with both Nelson and Kristofferson 's faces together .  - Red Headed Stranger is a 1975 album by American outlaw country singer Willie Nelson. After the wide success of his recordings with Atlantic Records, coupled with the negotiating skills of his manager, Neil Reshen, Nelson signed a contract with Columbia Records, a label that gave him total creative control over his works. The concept for the album was inspired by the \\"Tale of the Red Headed Stranger\\", a song that Nelson used to play as a disk jockey on his program in Fort Worth, Texas. After signing with Columbia he decided to record the song, and arranged the details during his return to Austin, Texas, from a trip to Colorado. It was recorded at low cost at Autumn Sound Studios in Garland, Texas. The songs featured sparse arrangements, largely limited to Nelson's guitar, piano and drums. Nelson presented the finished material to Columbia executives, who were dubious about releasing an album that they at first thought was a demo. However, Nelson had creative control, so no further production was added.    What is the relationship between 'sings kristofferson' and 'columbia records'? A:","output":"The relationship between 'Sings Kristofferson' and 'Columbia Records' is that 'Sings Kristofferson,' an album recorded by Willie Nelson in 1979, consisting of all covers of Kris Kristofferson songs, was released under the Columbia Records label. Columbia Records gave Willie Nelson total creative control over his works after he signed with them. The success of his previous \\"Red Headed Stranger\\" album in 1975, which was also released under Columbia Records, further solidified this relationship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Spacemen 3 were an English alternative rock band, formed in 1982 in Rugby, Warwickshire by Peter Kember and Jason Pierce. Their music is known for its brand of \\"minimalistic psychedelia\\". Spacemen 3 had their first independent chart hits in 1987, gaining a cult following, and going on to have greater success towards the end of the decade. However, they disbanded shortly afterwards, releasing their final studio album post-split in 1991 after an acrimonious parting of ways. Context: In November 1985, Spacemen 3 played a gig at a leisure centre in Coventry to an audience of fewer than ten people. Nevertheless, encouraged by the support of Pat Fish, they determined that they ought to record a new demo tape. By this time they had reconfigured and honed their musical style, and their repertoire consisted of newer songs and re-worked older ones. \\"The band's sound had crystallised into the intense, hypnotic, overloaded psychedelia which characterised their early [record] output, and which would serve as a template for their live act throughout their existence\\" (Ian Edmond, Record Collector).  At Pierce's instigation, Pete Bain rejoined the band on bass in order to fill out their sound. Despite being a 4-piece again, they would retain the name 'Spacemen 3'. Kember and Pierce opted to upgrade their guitar equipment ahead of recording the new demos. Kember purchased a Burns Jazz electric guitar and 1960s Vox Conqueror amplifier; whilst Pierce bought a Fender Telecaster and a 1970s HH amplifier. Both of their new amplifiers included distortion/fuzz and tremolo; these two effects were key components of Spacemen 3's signature sound.  In January 1986, Spacemen 3 attended the home studio of Carlo Marocco at Piddington, outside Northampton, to record their new demo tape. They spent three-and-a-half days at the 16-track studio. Recording live as a group, with minimal overdubs, they managed to get demos for approximately seven songs. Kember and Pierce handled the production. These \\"fine set of performances\\" (Ned Raggett, AllMusic) would later be unofficially released as the vinyl album Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs To on the Father Yod label in 1990 (albeit described incorrectly as \\"rehearsals in Rugby\\").  Spacemen 3 managed to obtain a record deal shortly after producing their new demos. Pat Fish had given a copy of the demo tape to Dave Barker, the owner of the independent record label Glass Records, to whom Fish's band The Jazz Butcher were signed. Spacemen 3 signed a three-year, two-album recording contract with Glass Records in early 1986. Question: what was the album called?. Whats the answer?","output":"The album mentioned in this context is called \\"Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs To.\\" It was an unofficial release, which consisted of the demos recorded by Spacemen 3 in January 1986 at Carlo Marocco's home studio. The vinyl album was released in 1990 on the Father Yod label and featured approximately seven songs from the demo tape. These recordings showcased the intense, hypnotic, and overloaded psychedelia that characterized Spacemen 3's sound during their early years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Groening was born on February 15, 1954 in Portland, Oregon, the middle of five children (older brother Mark and sister Patty were born in 1950 and 1952, while the younger sisters Lisa and Maggie in 1956 and 1958, respectively). His Norwegian American mother, Margaret Ruth (nee Wiggum; March 23, 1919 - April 22, 2013), was once a teacher, and his German Canadian father, Homer Philip Groening (December 30, 1919 - March 15, 1996), was a filmmaker, advertiser, writer and cartoonist. Homer, born in Main Centre, Saskatchewan, Canada, grew up in a Mennonite, Plautdietsch-speaking family. Groening described life in Los Angeles to his friends in the form of the self-published comic book Life in Hell, which was loosely inspired by the chapter \\"How to Go to Hell\\" in Walter Kaufmann's book Critique of Religion and Philosophy. Groening distributed the comic book in the book corner of Licorice Pizza, a record store in which he worked. He made his first professional cartoon sale to the avant-garde Wet magazine in 1978. The strip, titled \\"Forbidden Words,\\" appeared in the September/October issue of that year.  Groening had gained employment at the Los Angeles Reader, a newly formed alternative newspaper, delivering papers, typesetting, editing and answering phones. He showed his cartoons to the editor, James Vowell, who was impressed and eventually gave him a spot in the paper. Life in Hell made its official debut as a comic strip in the Reader on April 25, 1980. Vowell also gave Groening his own weekly music column, \\"Sound Mix,\\" in 1982. However, the column would rarely actually be about music, as he would often write about his \\"various enthusiasms, obsessions, pet peeves and problems\\" instead. In an effort to add more music to the column, he \\"just made stuff up,\\" concocting and reviewing fictional bands and nonexistent records. In the following week's column, he would confess to fabricating everything in the previous column and swear that everything in the new column was true. Eventually, he was finally asked to give up the \\"music\\" column. Among the fans of the column was Harry Shearer, who would later become a voice on The Simpsons.  Life in Hell became popular almost immediately. In November 1984, Deborah Caplan, Groening's then-girlfriend and co-worker at the Reader, offered to publish \\"Love is Hell\\", a series of relationship-themed Life in Hell strips, in book form. Released a month later, the book was an underground success, selling 22,000 copies in its first two printings. Work is Hell soon followed, also published by Caplan. Soon afterward, Caplan and Groening left and put together the Life in Hell Co., which handled merchandising for Life in Hell. Groening also started Acme Features Syndicate, which syndicated Life in Hell, Lynda Barry and John Callahan, but now only syndicates Life in Hell. At the end of its run, Life in Hell was carried in 250 weekly newspapers and has been anthologized in a series of books, including School is Hell, Childhood is Hell, The Big Book of Hell, and The Huge Book of Hell. Although Groening has stated, \\"I'll never give up the comic strip. It's my foundation,\\" he announced that the June 16, 2012 strip would mark Life in Hell's conclusion. After Groening ended the strip, the Center for Cartoon Studies commissioned a poster that was presented to Groening in honor of his work. The poster contained tribute cartoons by 22 of Groening's cartoonist friends who were influenced by Life in Hell.","output":"This text is about Matt Groening, an American cartoonist, writer, producer, and animator born on February 15, 1954, in Portland, Oregon.

Though the exterior had a charming appeal, the ambiance inside was quite lacking. The lighting was too dim, making it hard for us to read the menu, and the music was so loud that it was difficult to have a conversation with my friends. Our server seemed to be in a hurry and barely had time to attend to our queries about the menu. We had to wait for more than 30 minutes for our food, which was quite frustrating. The menu had a good variety of dishes, but the portion sizes turned out to be smaller than expected, even for upscale dining. While the presentation of the dishes was remarkable, the taste and quality were a letdown. The chicken dish we ordered was overcooked and dry, and the seafood pasta, though flavorful, had a fishy odor indicating that the ingredients might not have been fresh. The salad, however, was enjoyable, with a tangy dressing and a blend of fresh greens. Considering the high price we paid for our meal, the overall experience was disappointing.

Given the below context:  The modern interest in the Hoysalas is due to their patronage of art and architecture rather than their military conquests. The brisk temple building throughout the kingdom was accomplished despite constant threats from the Pandyas to the south and the Seunas Yadavas to the north. Their architectural style, an offshoot of the Western Chalukya style, shows distinct Dravidian influences. The Hoysala architecture style is described as Karnata Dravida as distinguished from the traditional Dravida, and is considered an independent architectural tradition with many unique features.A feature of Hoysala temple architecture is its attention to exquisite detail and skilled craftsmanship. The tower over the temple shrine  (vimana) is delicately finished with intricate carvings, showing attention to the ornate and elaborately detailed rather than to a tower form and height. The stellate design of the base of the shrine with its rhythmic projections and recesses is carried through the tower in an orderly succession of decorated tiers. Hoysala temple sculpture replicates this emphasis on delicacy and craftsmanship in its focus on depicting feminine beauty, grace and physique. The Hoysala artists achieved this with the use of Soapstone (Chloritic schist), a soft stone as basic building and sculptural material.The Chennakesava Temple at Belur (1117), the Hoysaleswara temple at Halebidu (1121), the Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura (1279), the temples at Arasikere (1220), Amruthapura (1196), Belavadi (1200), Nuggehalli (1246), Hosaholalu (1250), Aralaguppe (1250), Korvangla (1173), Haranhalli (1235), Mosale and Basaralu (1234)  are some of the notable examples of Hoysala art. While the temples at Belur and Halebidu are the best known because of the beauty of their sculptures, the Hoysala art finds more complete expression in the smaller and lesser known temples. The outer walls of all these temples contain an intricate array of stone sculptures and horizontal friezes (decorative mouldings) that depict the Hindu epics....  Guess a valid title for it!

These slow moving streams create different types of features than mountain streams. Slow moving water erodes the sides of their channels more than the bottom. Also, large curves in the stream form. These curves are called meanders. Meanders are caused by erosion and deposition. Remember, faster moving water causes erosion more quickly. Slower moving water erodes material more slowly. If water is moving slowly enough, the sediment being carried may settle out. This settling out, or dropping off, of sediment is deposition. The curves are called meanders because they slowly wander over the land. As meanders erode from side to side, they create a floodplain. This is a broad, flat area on both sides of a river. Eventually, a meander may become cut off from the rest of the river. This forms an oxbow lake.  After reading the above, is \\"False\\" the correct answer to the question \\"True or false.

Memorize the first section individually, then move on to the next, repeating the process. Then, once you've memorized each section, put them all together. Make a mental note about the overall topic of each section you created. This will provide a point of reference and help jog your memory while you recite your monologue. While you are reviewing your monologue, make mental images in your mind for each section you created. If at any point you forget a line from the script, think back to the mental images you created. This strategy is especially helpful for visual learners. A part of the memorization process is repeating the lines out loud over and over again. While you’re doing this, don’t repeat it in the exact same way every time. Instead, play around with the lines. This will help you to keep the lines fresh in your mind and learn them subconsciously instead of mechanically. For example, recite your monologue as fast and as slow as you can, say it in a funny voice, or say with a different dialect. Writing things down can increase your retention because you use different parts of your brain than when you're speaking. Writing also activates muscle memory and allows you to slowly absorb every word and sentence. So write down your entire monologue a couple of times until it stays in your memory. When memorizing a monologue, it helps to do some sort of physical activity while you practice it. You can do something simple while you recite it, like washing the dishes or cleaning your room. This will help you to learn the monologue without giving it much thought. Make sure to keep the script nearby during your physical activity, so if you forget a line you can easily refer to it. During one of your practicing sessions, use your cell phone, computer, or digital camera to record yourself reciting the lines.  Then, watch the recording and take mental notes about your performance. This will not only help you memorize the monologue, but it will also help you determine aspects of your performance that you can improve upon.  If you’re auditioning for a role or trying to get a good grade in an acting class, pay close attention to your facial expressions, posture, speed, and volume. These are important features that the judges will be looking at during your performance. It may help to repeat your recording multiple times. While listening, try to say the words along with or slightly ahead of the recording. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article suggests that memorizing a long monologue can be made easier by dividing it into sections and practicing them individually before putting them together. Creating mental images for each section, experimenting with different ways of reciting the lines, writing down the monologue, and incorporating physical activities while practicing can help improve retention. Recording oneself while performing the monologue and reviewing it multiple times allows for observation of facial expressions, posture, speed, and volume, which can lead to improvements in overall performance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The last major building work took place during the reign of King George V when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room. This room, 69 feet (21 metres) long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has a ceiling designed specially by Nash, coffered with huge gilt console brackets.\\"?

He labeled that part of his study as forest A. To understand the differences between forests he then visited the temperate forest in Germany. He labeled that part of his study as forest B. He found significant differences in these two types of forests.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which forest would see higher rates of chemical weathering, forest A or forest B?  Hint: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color. Answer:","output":"Given the information provided in the paragraph and the hint, Forest A, the tropical forest in Brazil, would see higher rates of chemical weathering compared to Forest B, the temperate forest in Germany. Tropical forests, such as Forest A, experience higher temperatures, more insolation (sun exposure), and more rainfall over longer growing seasons. These factors contribute to an extremely productive biomass, leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. The higher temperatures and larger amounts of water in these forests lead to higher rates of chemical weathering. In these tropical forests, increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Due to this, tropical forests have little to no podzolization (a soil formation process that creates distinct soil layers) and therefore do not show marked visual and chemical contrasts between soil layers. In contrast, mobile metals such as magnesium, iron, and aluminum are precipitated as oxide minerals in these tropical soils, resulting in a rusty red color. Temperate forests like Forest B experience cooler temperatures, less rainfall, and shorter growing seasons than tropical forests. Due to these differences in environmental conditions, the chemical weathering process in temperate forests would be slower as compared to tropical forests. Consequently, Forest A would experience higher rates of chemical weathering, compared to Forest B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: During May, June, and July, the Northern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere.  Now, I have a new situation: In the year 1630 during the month of January Captain Cook began his voyage from the port of Calais in Europe, which is in the Northern Hemisphere. His intention was  to find the mythical land in the Southern Hemisphere. After about eleven months of sailing, in December 1630, he reached Australia, which is indeed in the Southern Hemisphere. Thinking he finally reached the mythical  land, he commenced his return voyage to Europe on June,  1631, He reached Europe in the middle of the following year on July, 1632.  Answer this question please: Which place received less direct sunlight when Captain Cook started his voyage to the mythical land in 1630, Europe or Australia? A:","output":"When Captain Cook started his voyage to the mythical land in January 1630, Europe received less direct sunlight compared to Australia. This is because Europe is in the Northern Hemisphere, and during January, the Northern Hemisphere experiences winter due to its axial tilt away from the Sun. In contrast, Australia is in the Southern Hemisphere, and during the same month (January), it experiences summer as the Southern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, receiving more direct sunlight."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Can you tell me the answer to when will the fourth of july be observed this year??","output":"The Fourth of July, also known as Independence Day, is observed every year on the same day, which is the 4th of July. The holiday commemorates the Declaration of Independence of the United States on July 4th, 1776. The celebrations typically involve fireworks, parades, barbecues, carnivals, fairs, picnics, concerts, baseball games, family reunions, and political speeches and ceremonies, in addition to various other public and private events celebrating the history, government, and traditions of the United States. If your question is related to what specific day of the week the Fourth of July falls on this year, it varies year by year because our modern Gregorian calendar cycles every 7 days. You could easily determine this by looking at a current year calendar.  However, if your question pertains to when the Fourth of July will be observed in terms of a public holiday, it depends on the specific circumstances. If July 4th happens to fall on a Saturday, the public holiday might be observed on the preceding Friday. If it falls on a Sunday, the public holiday might be observed on the following Monday, as per the \\"Friday-to-Monday\\" rule in the United States, which shifts certain holidays to ensure employees still get a day off. This is determined by each individual state government and can also vary by company. Lastly, if your question refers to when the Fourth of July will be celebrated in the sense of major public festivities such as parades and fireworks displays, that is typically determined by local city or town governments and can vary widely. Some cities may have their major celebrations on the weekend nearest to July 4th, regardless of which day it falls on, to accommodate more people being off work.  In conclusion, while the Fourth of July is always on the 4th of July, exactly when it is observed as a public holiday or when the major public celebrations occur can vary depending on a variety of factors. Nonetheless, the spirit of the day, in celebrating the United States' declaration of independence, remains the same annually."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Queen of the Vampires Context: The Rape of the Vampire[edit] Four sisters living in an old chÃ¢teau are convinced that they are vampires. One believes she was raped by the villagers years before, and is blind. Another is afraid of sunlight. They all react violently to crucifixes. The sisters are being manipulated by a sinister old man who alternates between admonishing them to kill newcomers that threaten their exposure, and groping their breasts. The four seem to worship a bestial idol in the forest who speaks to them with a disembodied voice. The newcomers are three Parisians, Thomas (Bernard Letrou), Brigitte (Solange Pradle) and Marc (Marquis Polho), who have come to the countryside to cure the sisters of their so-called illness. They do not believe that the sisters are vampires, and don't believe in vampires at all. Thomas is a psychoanalyist, determined to cure them from their madness. He believes it has been induced by the superstitious villagers, who have driven the confused women insane with their religious symbols and persecution. He tries to convince them that crucifixes and sunlight won't harm them, and that the blind sister can actually see. He takes all of this as proof that their vampirism is all in their minds. When one of the sisters fall for Thomas' charms, the old man orders another sister to kill him, Brigitte and Marc. When this fails, he unleashes the peasants, who brutally murder all the women they can find, which also includes Brigitte. Thomas asks one of the sisters to bite him to prove her wrong, and discovers she is, in fact, a vampire, and that he was misled by his own preconceptions. The two flee to the beach and are gunned down by Marc, who is distraught by Brigitte's death at the hands of the peasants. Queen of the Vampires/The Vampire Woman[edit] The vampire queen (Jacqueline Sieger) is introduced. She briefly arrives by boat to the beach where the dead couple lies.

This indicates that they likely found great deals and were satisfied with the products or discounts they encountered during the sale. 2. Although not explicitly stated, the fact that the store is a clearance store may be seen as a positive aspect by some potential customers who are looking for discounted items. Negative aspects of the review: 1. The reviewer expresses surprise at realizing it was a clearance store. This surprise may indicate a lack of clear advertising or signage that the store is focused on clearance items. 2. The mention of the store being old and run down implies that the physical appearance and maintenance of the store are not up to the reviewer's standards. These factors can significantly impact the shopping experience and may deter some potential customers from visiting the store. In conclusion, while the review contains positive elements related to finding value during the New Year's Day sale, negative aspects regarding the store's appearance and initial lack of clarity about its clearance status may dampen the overall impression of the reviewer's experience.

She is more sociable and calmer than normal apes, and has succeeded in completing the Towers of Hanoi puzzle in 20 moves, which is close to a perfect score of 15. Will Rodman (James Franco) talks to his boss, Steve Jacobs (David Oyelowo), and convinces him that he has data to enable them to proceed with human trials for the drug.The next day, Rodman and Jacobs appear before the board of directors in the Gen Sys conference room. Will explains that the new drug causes neurogenesis, the growth of new brain cells (something that doesn't typically happen after birth) and may heal any number of degenerative brain disorders, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. The only side effect is that the subjects exposed to the drug have a green sparkle to their eyes.Back in the lab, the senior ape caretaker, Robert Franklin (Tyler Labine), is having trouble coaxing Bright Eyes out of her cage. She acts aggressively towards Robert and the other helpers. They attempt to lure her out of the cage with orange soda, but when they try to wrangle her with a lasso pole, she goes \\"ape\\" and runs rampant through the building. The chase ends when she crashes through the glass window of the conference room and the building's security guards kill her.Fearing that what they witnessed with Bright Eyes is a violent side effect of the drug, Jacobs pronounces the drug project 'dead.'

The retirement comes on the heels of a dismal third-quarter earnings report that saw profit fall 14% amidst weakening demand, reports the Wall Street Journal, which calls the announcement a \\"surprise development\\": Historically, Intel execs hold on to their positions until they hit the mandatory retirement age of 65. Intel also used the opportunity to promote three senior executives to executive vice-president. Otellini leaves a strong legacy, writes Terrence O'Brien at Engadget. He oversaw, for instance, Intel's bounce-back from the ill-received Pentium 4, and Apple's transition from PowerPC to Intel processors. But Rocco Pendola at TheStreet is less impressed. \\"It's about time,\\" his headline declares, and he criticizes Otellini for being \\"about five years too late\\" in jumping into the smartphone and tablet market. \\"What a complete and total embarrassment.

Q: The First of March is my most hated day of the year. Every year, without fail, I feel a little bit depressed on the First of March. I absolutely love summer. I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States. Formaldehyde is one of the biggest nasties that I make a real effort to avoid. I did my PhD in Forensics and spent a lot of time watching autopsies. Once the body parts have been harvested, they are stored in Formaldehyde to be preserved. The Formaldehyde alters the proteins in the tissue to stop them breaking down - fine for the dead, not something I want to use whilst I am alive. It is nasty, nasty stuff.

Answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Where did the professional career of the director of music videos of an American rapper born in 1975 begin? Answer:","output":"The professional career of the director of music videos for an American rapper born in 1975 began in the early stages of the rapper's musical journey and the rise of the hip-hop scene in the 1990s. Although this question does not specify a particular rapper or director, I will provide a comprehensive answer by examining various possibilities and scenarios. One of the most renowned American rappers born in 1975 is Marshall Mathers, popularly known as Eminem. Eminem's music video career began to take off after he signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment. The director most closely associated with Eminem's early music videos is Phillip Atwell, who began his professional career in the mid-1990s as a director and cinematographer. Atwell started out by working on various music videos and commercials, eventually making a name for himself in the hip-hop community. He first collaborated with Eminem in 1999 for the \\"My Name Is\\" music video, which marked the beginning of their long-standing relationship in Eminem's video career. Another notable American rapper born in 1975 is Curtis \\"50 Cent\\" Jackson. The music video director who has frequently worked with 50 Cent from the beginning of his career is Jessy Terrero. Terrero began his professional career in the late 1990s, directing music videos for many artists within the hip-hop and R&B genres. He gained prominence in 2003 when he directed 50 Cent's \\"Wanksta\\" music video, which contributed to the rapper's skyrocketing fame. This collaboration established a strong partnership, with Terrero directing several other 50 Cent music videos over the years. A third example of an American rapper born in 1975 is Sean \\"Diddy\\" Combs, who was also the founder of Bad Boy Records. The music video director most associated with his early work is Hype Williams. Williams began his career in the early 1990s, directing several music videos for various artists within the hip-hop and R&B genres. He cultivated a distinctive visual style that incorporated vibrant colors, fish-eye lens perspectives, and cinematic aesthetics. Hype Williams' collaborations with Diddy started back in 1994 with the music video for \\"Can't Nobody Hold Me Down,\\" which initiated Combs' progression in the music video realm. In summary, the professional careers of music video directors for American rappers born in 1975, such as Eminem, 50 Cent, and Sean \\"Diddy\\" Combs, commenced during the 1990s and early 2000s as the hip-hop industry underwent significant growth. Directors like Phillip Atwell, Jessy Terrero, and Hype Williams emerged as prevalent forces within the music video production landscape, working with some of the biggest names in the hip-hop scene, including these rappers born in 1975. Their artistic visions and cinematic approaches not only contributed to the rappers' successful careers but also to the overall development and impact of the hip-hop music video genre."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How is \\"The 40-year-old works part-time as a stagehand, earning 400 euros a month, forcing her to live with her mother and sister.\\" said in Turkish?","output":"\\"Kırk yaşındaki kadın, ayda 400 euro kazanarak yarı zamanlı sahne elemanı olarak çalışmakta ve bu durum onu annesi ve kız kardeşiyle yaşamaya zorlamaktadır.\\" In this translation, the sentence has been adapted in a way that is appropriate for Turkish grammar and sentence structure while maintaining the original meaning. Here's a breakdown of the translation: - Kırk yaşındaki kadın (The 40-year-old woman): In Turkish, it is more common to specify the gender when describing someone's age. We have assumed the gender is female in this translation; if the subject is male, you can replace \\"kadın\\" with \\"adam\\". - Ayda 400 euro kazanarak (earning 400 euros a month): In Turkish, to express that an action is ongoing or continuous, we use the present continuous tense. The verb \\"kazanmak\\" (to earn) is suffixed with the gerund/instrumental suffix -arak (in this case -arak, because the last vowel of \\"kazanmak\\" is 'a'), making it \\"kazanarak\\" (earning). The monthly earnings and the adverb \\"ayda\\" (per month) are placed before the gerund to form the complete phrase. - Yarı zamanlı sahne elemanı olarak çalışmakta (works part-time as a stagehand): In Turkish, sentence structure often places the object before the verb. In this case, the object (sahne elemanı) is placed after \\"yarı zamanlı\\" (part-time) and before \\"olarak çalışmakta\\" (working as). The verb \\"çalışmak\\" (to work) is also in the present continuous tense, suffixed with -ta to form \\"çalışmakta\\" (working). - Ve bu durum onu annesi ve kız kardeşiyle yaşamaya zorlamaktadır (and this situation forces her to live with her mother and sister): In Turkish, the conjunction \\"ve\\" (and) is used to combine the two clauses. The subject \\"bu durum\\" (this situation) is followed by the verb \\"zorlamak\\" (to force) in the present continuous tense as \\"zorlamaktadır\\". The indirect object \\"onu\\" (her) is placed before \\"annesi ve kız kardeşiyle yaşamaya\\" (to live with her mother and sister) to form the complete clause."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review: Very bad but watchable science fiction film that suffers from abominable special effects, poor acting, and a ridiculous story. The film opens with a spaceship returning from exploration on Mars with a woman and a man with green slime on his arm. She, through some hokey plot contrivances, begins to tell what happened on this fateful trip as almost all the tapes seemed to be magnetically wiped off. Four astronauts take on this journey: a military type played by Gerald Mohr, a poor man's Humphrey Bogart who enjoys saying the word \\"Irish\\" and has the acting savvy of a codfish, then there is Naura Hayden, a beautiful redhead and only female crew member on flight with three men wearing the most formfitting suits possible to accentuate all her curves, next, Les Tremaine, a wonderful character actor from cheap sci-fi films like this as the egghead, and last, Jack Kruschen as Sammy - the guy from Brooklyn with jokes and doesn't seem too bright although chosen for his expertise in electronics. None of these performers are really any good, and all of them say their dialog with little conviction. Watch Tremaine as he utters that scientific nonsense! Really, the best out of the four is Kruschen - and that really says a lot about this film. But bad acting aside, the movie just falls apart when they land on Mars via flashback. The Angry Red Planet had a real cheap budget because Mars is really the American Southwest with a heavy red tint over it. When the story calls for something that might look Martian, there are drawings placed with a heavy red tint over them. You can tell they are drawings The monsters are perhaps even worse as we get a Bat-rat-spider with a size upwards of 40 feet that looks like some kids got together piecing dead animals together. The other significant creature is a giant amoeba with an oscillating eye. Whew! These are bad. There is a nice drawing of a Martian city, but there just was not enough of this in the film. Despite all these big problems, The Angry Red Planet is a fun bad film. It is really fascinating to see how far we have come as a civilization. Most of the stuff they used in the movie is so outdated. One guy is using an electric razor with a cord and I thought they can get to Mars but they are still using cords. Director Ib Melchior gives an interesting look to much of the film even with the budgetary constraints, but the story by him and Sid Pink doesn't fly.

ABC Television had paid an advance for a TV show. His publisher, Macmillan, was demanding a manuscript of the poem/novel Tarantula. Manager Albert Grossman had scheduled a concert tour for the latter part of the year. On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his 500cc Triumph Tiger 100 motorcycle near his home in Woodstock, New York, and was thrown to the ground. Though the extent of his injuries was never disclosed, Dylan said that he broke several vertebrae in his neck. Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized. Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered Dylan the chance to escape the pressures around him. Dylan confirmed this interpretation in his autobiography: \\"I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered. Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race.\\" Dylan withdrew from public and, apart from a few appearances, did not tour again for almost eight years.Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work, he began to edit D. A. Pennebaker's film of his 1966 tour. A rough cut was shown to ABC Television, which rejected it as incomprehensible to a mainstream audience. The film was subsequently titled Eat the Document on bootleg copies, and it has been screened at a handful of film festivals. In 1967 he began recording with the Hawks at his home and in the basement of the Hawks' nearby house, \\"Big Pink\\".

It is inhabited by various types of Digimon, who are digital lifeforms with unique abilities and forms. The stories revolve around a group of children, known as the \\"DigiDestined\\" or \\"Chosen Children,\\" who are chosen to protect the Digital World and their own world from various evil forces. Throughout the Digimon franchise, there are slight variations of the Digital World depending on the series, but the core concept remains consistent. The Digital World is typically a vast landscape composed of diverse environments, such as forests, deserts, mountains, and oceans. These environments are inhabited by Digimon from different levels and attributes, who interact with the DigiDestined and help them on their journey. Throughout their adventures in the Digital World, the DigiDestined form strong bonds with their partner Digimon. These bonds empower the Digimon to evolve (Digivolve) into stronger forms, allowing them to face ever-increasing challenges and enemies. The process of Digivolving can change a Digimon's appearance significantly and often results in a change in personality or abilities. Through their journey in the Digital World, the DigiDestined learn valuable life lessons about friendship, courage, and responsibility, and they grow as individuals. The Digimon franchise has spanned multiple TV series, movies, video games, and other media, introducing new characters and Digital World variations, but the essence of the story and the core values it teaches remain the same."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The majority of Indian women wear a red dot   between their eyebrows. While it is generally taken as an indicator of their marital   status, the practice is primarily related to the Hindu religion. The dot goes by different names in different Hindi dialects, and \\"bindi\\" is the one that is most commonly known. Traditionally, the dot carries no gender restriction: Men as well as women wear it. However, the tradition of men wearing it has faded in recent times, so nowadays we see a lot more women than men wearing one. The position of the bindi is standard: center of the forehead, close to the eyebrows. It represents a third, or inner eye. Hindu tradition holds that all people have three eyes: The two outer ones are used for seeing the outside world, and the third one is there to focus inward toward God. As such, the dot serves as a constant reminder to keep God in the front of a believer's thoughts. Red is the traditional color of the dot. It is said that in ancient times a man would place a drop of blood between his wife's eyes to seal their marriage. According to Hindu beliefs, the color red is believed to bring good fortune to the married couple. Today, people go with different colors depending upon their preferences. Women often wear dots that match the color of their clothes. Decorative or sticker bindis come in all sizes, colors and variations, and can be worn by young and old, married and unmarried people alike. Wearing a bindi has become more of a fashion statement than a religious custom. Question: What is the importance of the third eye in Hindu tradition? Options: A: To pay respect to God. B: To stay in harmony with nature. C: To see things with a subjective view. D: To observe the outside world more clearly. Answer:","output":"A: To pay respect to God."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".  Question: Who is Marybeth and Benny's principal source of drugs? Movie plot title: Life Is Hot in Cracktown Movie plot: The film intertwines several unsettling stories of people in a Manhattan neighborhood ravaged by crack cocaine.[1][2] Romeo, a 14-year-old criminal, is the leader of a gang. In the beginning of the movie, he lures his girlfriend, Debbie, to a secluded alley where he and another gang member gang rape her. He leads his gang into robbing and torturing a very sick pensioner, and then steps up to doing a murder-for-hire at the behest of a local drug dealer, unaware of the enormous risks. Manny and Concetta, a young couple, are desperately trying to rise out of poverty and care for their sick baby. Manny works two jobsâthe front desk of a drug-riddled flop house by day and the cash register of a frequently-robbed bodega at night. It hardly matters that he is working so hard because the baby's non-stop crying will not allow him to sleep. Another young couple, Marybeth and Benny, are both drug addicts. Marybeth is a transgender woman who makes a bit of money as a street prostitute to pay for surgery, and Benny is into very low-paying burglaries. Their principal source of drugs is a well-off transvestite, Ridley, who is looking to follow in Marybeth's footsteps. Young Willy and younger Susie are the much-neglected children of an addict named Mommy, who makes them sleep on the floor of their one-room apartment. Mommy's current boyfriend, a hot-tempered addict named Chaz, makes the children beg on the street for his drug money. Willy's one bright spot is neighbor child Melody, whose mother pimps her out every night. When Chaz and Mommy leave the children behind while they embark on a drug-fueled quest to get more drug money from a relative of Chaz, and Melody is picked up by the police. Willy, meanwhile, is sent on a wild goose chase by Betty, an aging prostitute who enjoys tormenting her neighbors.

How is \\"The Dusit Dubai Hotel is one of Dubai's foremost deluxe hotels, where guests are assured a memorable vacation or business trip to the UAE's most exciting city.\\" said in Russian?","output":"\\"Отель Dusit Dubai - один из ведущих люксовых отелей Дубая, где гостям гарантирован незабываемый отдых или деловая поездка в самый захватывающий город ОАЭ.\\"  Now, let's break it up:  Отель Dusit Dubai - this is \\"The Dusit Dubai Hotel\\". In Russian, the order of the words often changes when compared to English. Один из ведущих люксовых отелей Дубая - this means \\"one of Dubai's foremost deluxe hotels\\". In Russian, adjectives tend to come before what they are describing (i.e., \\"deluxe hotels\\"). где гостям гарантирован незабываемый отдых - this translates as \\"where guests are assured a memorable vacation\\". Again, the adjective comes before the noun in Russian, so \\"memorable vacation\\" becomes \\"незабываемый отдых\\".  или деловая поездка - This means \\"or business trip\\". Note, the word \\"или\\" is used to say \\"or\\" in Russian. в самый захватывающий город ОАЭ - Lastly, it translates into \\"to the UAE's most exciting city\\".  Russian has a different syntactic structure than English, that is why the translation goes from left to right as \\"The Dusit Dubai Hotel\\", \\"one of the leading luxury hotels in Dubai\\", \\"where guests are guaranteed an unforgettable vacation\\", \\"or a business trip\\", \\"to the most exciting city in the UAE\\".  Russian language also differs from English by conjugating verbs according to the subject, and has cases for nouns, pronouns and adjectives.

Q:Sam lived in Chicago for many years and experienced those high humidity days during the summer, the Indian summers in October and harsh and humid winters, so he decided to move to San Diego, in a warmer and much dryer climate.  Which city has more humidity during winter? A:","output":"During the winter months, Chicago experiences more humidity than San Diego. To understand why, it is essential to compare the climates of these two cities during the winter season. Chicago, located in the Midwest and positioned near the banks of Lake Michigan, has a humid continental climate characterized by harsh, cold winters. The average high temperature in Chicago during winter typically ranges from 31°F to 34°F (-1°C to 1°C), while the average low temperature hovers between 16°F to 22°F (-9°C to -6°C). Due to its proximity to Lake Michigan, Chicago experiences lake-effect snow, which forms when cold air moves over the relatively warmer water of the lake. This causes an increase in moisture and eventually leads to snowfall on the leeward side of the lake. This phenomenon not only increases the humidity levels during winter but also results in significant snow accumulation, averaging about 35 inches (89 cm) per season. San Diego, on the other hand, is situated on the southern coast of California and enjoys a Mediterranean climate, with mild to cool winters and warm, dry summers. The average high temperature in San Diego during winter typically ranges from 65°F to 67°F (18°C to 19°C), while the average low temperature falls between 48°F to 52°F (9°C to 11°C). Due to the influence of the Pacific Ocean and the semi-arid climate, San Diego experiences less humidity during winter months than Chicago. Although San Diego can get occasional rainfall during winter, it is not as frequent or significant as the snowfall in Chicago, resulting in overall lower humidity levels. In conclusion, Chicago experiences more humidity during winter compared to San Diego, primarily due to its humid continental climate, the proximity to Lake Michigan, and the impact of lake-effect snow. San Diego's Mediterranean climate, coastal location, and infrequent winter rainfall contribute to its relatively lower humidity levels during the winter season."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: Aves and a sister group, the clade Crocodilia, contain the only living representatives of the reptile clade Archosauria. During the late 1990s, Aves was most commonly defined phylogenetically as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and Archaeopteryx lithographica. However, an earlier definition proposed by Jacques Gauthier gained wide currency in the 21st century, and is used by many scientists including adherents of the Phylocode system. Gauthier defined Aves to include only the crown group of the set of modern birds. This was done by excluding most groups known only from fossils, and assigning them, instead, to the Avialae, in part to avoid the uncertainties about the placement of Archaeopteryx in relation to animals traditionally thought of as theropod dinosaurs. What is the answer to this question: Besides Aves, what group contains the only living representatives of the reptile clade Archosauria?","output":"Besides Aves, which are the birds, the other group that contains the only living representatives of the reptile family called Archosauria is Crocodilia.

Just over half of them - 78,000 - were about PPI policies, the sale of which has been largely banned for some time. The ombudsman deals with complaints which financial firms have been unable to settle themselves. Caroline Wayman, who heads up the body, said: \\"PPI complaints are down, but there are some suggestions that this could be the calm before the storm.\\" A deadline of June 2019 could be set by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for disgruntled customers to make compensation claims to their banks and credit card issuers about mis-sold PPI policies. The FCA wants to decide on the deadline in the middle of this year along with a public awareness campaign. \\"The FCA's proposals - including the PPI deadline - are likely to heavily influence our complaints volumes,\\" Ms Wayman said. Millions of people have already been paid compensation following what was one of the banking industry's biggest scandals. More than Â£40bn has already been set aside by banks to cover the payouts and the associated overhead costs of processing claims, and it is widely suspected that many more complainants could come forward. The compensation process has not been smooth for customers though. Since 2003 about one and a half million people have been so dissatisfied with the PPI offers that were made to them, or the outright rejection of their claims, that they have subsequently gone to the financial ombudsman. In the second half of 2016, nearly half of the PPI complaints to the ombudsman were upheld against the top ten most-complained about businesses. However, the uphold rate varied wildly between providers, from 9% for Nationwide to 29% for Bank of Scotland and 69% for Financial Insurance Company Ltd, part of the AXA group. The list of most-complained about businesses - for all types of complaint to the financial ombudsman - is still dominated by the UK's High Street banks, and some credit card lenders. Top of the list in the last half of 2016 was the Bank of Scotland, which is part of the Lloyds banking group, with nearly 20,000 new complaints against it.

Joseph Lewis Miller spent more than 33 years hiding, ducking police for a murder charge out of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, according to a statement from U.S. Marshal Martin Pane. Now 78, Miller was arrested Monday in Mineola, Texas, where he was living under the alias Roy Eugene Eubanks and serving as a deacon at a church, the statement said. A 1981 arrest warrant charges Miller with murder, committing crimes with a firearm, being a convict in possession of a firearm and carrying a firearm without a license. Harrisburg police accused Miller of killing Thomas Waller in a parking lot adjacent to a hotel in January 1981. \\"The murder occurred more than three decades ago, and while this case presented us with a significant challenge it also exemplifies the dedication, thoroughness and diligence the fugitive task force has toward cold cases,\\" Pane said. This wasn't the first time Miller was charged with murder. Miller pleaded guilty to killing John H. Lumpkins in Harrisburg in 1960, and throughout that decade, Pane said, Miller applied to have his sentence commuted, a request that was granted with lifetime state parole in 1971. Ten years later, Miller became a fugitive after Waller's death.

With the growing number of people relying on taxis for their daily commute, starting a taxi company can be a lucrative business venture. However, starting a successful taxi company requires careful planning, hard work, and a clear understanding of the industry. In this article, we will discuss the key steps and strategies for starting and operating a profitable taxi company. Step 1: Determine Your Niche Before you dive headfirst into starting a taxi company, it is essential to define the specific niche you intend to target. There are several niches to choose from, such as airport transfers, corporate clients, intercity travel, and local passengers. Identifying your target market will enable you to tailor your services to meet their specific needs and preferences. Additionally, focusing on a specific niche will allow you to differentiate your business from competitors and establish a strong presence in the market. Step 2: Construct a Solid Business Plan A well-crafted business plan is the foundation of any successful enterprise. Your business plan should include: - Start-up costs: Calculate the initial capital required to launch your taxi company, taking into account vehicle purchases or leases, insurance, office and garage rentals, fuel, maintenance, and advertising expenses. - Management strategy: Outline your company's organizational structure, including the roles and responsibilities of each team member. Clearly define your goals and objectives, as well as the strategies you will implement to achieve them. - Marketing plan: Develop a comprehensive marketing plan to promote your taxi company, attract clients, and build a strong brand image. This may include creating a website, leveraging social media, offering promotions and discounts, and engaging in local advertising campaigns. - Expansion plan: Consider your long-term goals and plan for the growth and expansion of your taxi company. This may include adding more vehicles to your fleet, expanding your service area, or even entering niche markets such as courier and delivery services. Step 3: Secure Funding Once you have developed a solid business plan, the next step is to secure the necessary funding to launch your taxi company. You can apply for a loan from your bank or seek funding from private investors. Be prepared to present your business plan and financial projections to secure the required capital. Step 4: Obtain a Commercial Driver's License To operate a taxi company, you and your drivers will need to obtain commercial driver's licenses (CDL) from your local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). The specific requirements for obtaining a CDL vary by state, so make sure to consult your local DMV for information on the process. This may involve passing a series of written and practical driving tests, as well as completing special training for transporting passengers. Step 5: Register Your Taxi Company and Obtain a Business License After obtaining the necessary licenses for yourself and your drivers, it's time to register your taxi company with your city and obtain a business license. This process typically involves submitting your business name, address, contact information, and other relevant details to your city's business registration office. Additionally, you may need to apply for a taxi operating permit, which may require providing proof of insurance, vehicle inspections, and other necessary documentation. Step 6: Build Your Fleet and Establish a Base of Operations Once you have registered your business and secured the necessary licenses and permits, the next step is to establish your fleet of taxi vehicles. This may involve purchasing or leasing vehicles, branding them with your company's logo, and installing any necessary equipment like taxi meters and navigation systems. In addition to building your fleet, establishing a base of operations is essential for the day-to-day management of your taxi company. This will typically involve leasing or purchasing commercial office space and a garage for storing and maintaining your vehicles. Conclusion Starting a taxi company can be a rewarding and profitable endeavor. However, it requires a thorough understanding of the industry, careful planning, and the perseverance to overcome challenges along the way. By following the steps outlined above, you will be well on your way to launching a successful taxi business that meets the transportation needs of your target market and stands out from the competition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. which process produces the most atp molecules in aerobic cellular respiration??","output":"Aerobic cellular respiration is a process in which cells generate energy (adenosine triphosphate or ATP) from nutrients, primarily glucose, in the presence of oxygen. It consists of three main stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle), and the electron transport chain (ETC) coupled with oxidative phosphorylation. The process that produces the most ATP molecules in aerobic cellular respiration is the electron transport chain (ETC) coupled with oxidative phosphorylation. During this stage, most of the ATP is generated by harnessing the energy from the flow of electrons through a series of protein complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Now, let's examine how many ATP molecules are created in each stage of aerobic cellular respiration: 1. Glycolysis: This initial stage takes place in the cytoplasm and does not require oxygen. One glucose molecule (a six-carbon molecule) is broken down into two pyruvate molecules (three-carbon molecules), producing a net gain of 2 ATP molecules through substrate-level phosphorylation. 2. Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle): During this process, each pyruvate molecule generated from glycolysis is converted to acetyl-CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle. The cycle occurs twice per glucose molecule, once for each pyruvate. For each turn of the cycle, 1 ATP molecule is produced through substrate-level phosphorylation, resulting in a total of 2 ATP molecules for both turns. While glycolysis and the citric acid cycle produce a relatively small amount of ATP directly, they also generate high-energy electron carriers: NADH and FADH₂. These electron carriers play a crucial role in the oxidative phosphorylation process that takes place within the electron transport chain. 3. Electron Transport Chain (ETC) and Oxidative Phosphorylation: This stage takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane and exploits the potential energy of the high-energy electron carriers generated in the preceding stages. NADH and FADH₂ donate their electrons to the ETC, releasing their chemical energy. As the electrons pass down the chain through a series of redox reactions, energy is used to pump protons (H⁺) across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating an electrochemical gradient (proton motive force). The final electron acceptor in the ETC is molecular oxygen, which combines with electrons and protons to form water. The protons in the intermembrane space flow back into the matrix through ATP synthase, a protein complex that synthesizes ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) by using the energy released by the proton gradient. This process is called oxidative phosphorylation. The electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation generate roughly 30 to 34 ATP molecules per glucose molecule (10 NADH x 2.5 ATP/NADH + 2 FADH₂ x 1.5 ATP/FADH₂). The actual yield can vary depending on the efficiency of the transport and the cell's specific conditions. In conclusion, the electron transport chain coupled with oxidative phosphorylation is the process that produces the most ATP molecules during aerobic cellular respiration. While glycolysis and the citric acid cycle contribute to the direct production of 2 and 2 ATP molecules, respectively, these stages also contribute indirectly by generating high-energy electron carriers, which ultimately produce the highest ATP yield through the ETC and oxidative phosphorylation."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Choices:  - scheme - elephant - chess game - north carolina - chess set  The rationale to choose \\"chess set\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"The correct answer to choose is \\"chess set.\\" The rationale for choosing \\"chess set\\" as the answer is as follows: 1. Context: The question mentions a \\"pawn,\\" which is one of the pieces used in the game of chess. This context makes it clear that the topic is related to chess. 2. Hand-carved: The question states that the pawn is hand-carved, which implies that it is part of a crafted item rather than an abstract concept like a scheme. This eliminates \\"scheme\\" as a possible answer.  3. Relevance: Among the choices given, only \\"chess set\\" is directly related to chess and can include a hand-carved pawn. This makes it the most appropriate answer.  4. Inappropriateness of other choices: The other choices are not relevant or appropriate for the context of the question. \\"Elephant\\" is an animal and not related to chess. \\"Chess game\\" refers to the actual game played between two opponents, not the pieces themselves. \\"North Carolina\\" is a location and has no direct connection to the context of the question."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They are reading fewer novels, comics, magazines and websites, according to a National Literacy Trust study of 21,000 children and teenagers. While many enjoyed reading, some 17% said they would be embarrassed if a friend saw them with a book. A government spokesman said the findings showed the need to help young people develop a love of reading. Half of those questioned said they enjoyed reading very much, or quite a lot, almost the same as in 2005 when the figure was 51%. But the findings showed that just three in every 10 youngsters read daily in their own time, down from four in 10 in 2005. More than a fifth (22%) said they rarely or never read in their own time and more than half (54%) said they preferred watching television to reading. In 2005 more than three quarters (77%) of children read magazines, but now only 57% do. Comic reading has dropped from 64% to 50%, and reading on websites from 54% to 50%. The researchers said the figures highlighted \\"a clear issue with children's leisure time with many children enjoying reading but pushing it out in favour of other activities\\". Jonathan Douglas, director of National Literacy Trust, said: \\"The fact that children are reading less than in 2005 signals a worrying shift in young people's literacy habits. We are calling for the Government to back a campaign to halt this reading decline and to give children time to read in their daily lives. \\"We need to make reading irresistible. We want to call on families and professionals working with children and young people to make ten minutes in their day for reading.\\" The report said it was \\"essential\\" for children to make time to read because reading outside lessons was linked to strong academic achievement. It added that young people who read outside class on a daily basis were 13 times more likely to read above the expected level for their age. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: \\"The findings of this survey come as no surprise and shows that we need to continue our drive to encourage young people to develop a love of reading. In a world of so many distractions for young minds, the place of literature is more important than ever. \\"Children need to master the basics of reading as early as possible in primary school so they can then go on to explore magical and powerful books such as Private Peaceful, Harry Potter, and, in good time, books such as Lord of the Flies, Animal Farm and those by Charles Dickens. \\"That's why we've introduced a short and simple phonics check at the end of Year 1 to make sure children have mastered the basics.\\" The study, which coincides with International Literacy Day on Saturday, comes as the World Literacy Foundation called on world leaders to tackle a global literacy crisis. Chief executive Andrew Kay said: \\"Globally, almost 800 million people are illiterate and 100 million children don't attend school each day\\". What is a summary of this text?","output":"The National Literacy Trust recently conducted a study of 21,000 children and teenagers, revealing a decline in novel, comic, magazine, and website reading compared to 2005.

The study found that only three in 10 young people read daily in their own time, down from four in 10 in 2005. In light of these findings, the National Literacy Trust is urging the government to support a campaign to halt this reading decline and to encourage families and professionals to allocate at least 10 minutes of their day for reading.

If you beat a dog in Schuylkill County, you'll probably get a 100 fine. If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred.  Question: \\"What solution is West offering and how is it different for a plaintiff from what is already being practiced?\\" Answer: \\"The minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"No, the answer provided does not correctly address the question. The question asks what solution Valerie West is offering and how it is different for a plaintiff. Let me provide the correct answer. Answer: Valerie West's solution is to allow a custody order to stand for the full term of the PFA, which is up to 18 months, like it does in many other counties in the state. This is different from the current practice in Schuylkill County, which requires a custody order to be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West believes that the current requirement places undue burdens on the plaintiff in terms of cost, finding legal representation, and facing their abuser."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: dinosaur, genus, live, organism, period","output":"The term \\"dinosaur\\" refers to a broad range of creatures across multiple genera, and these organisms lived during various periods, such as the Jurassic and Cretaceous, exemplifying one of the most prolific and diverse groups in Earth's biological history. These creatures have fascinated and intrigued scientists not just because of their diverse sizes and structures, ranging from diminutive bird-like species to massive, lumbering beasts, but also due to their widespread geographical distribution, lucidly providing insights into different climatic patterns and geologic periods when they thrived.  The countless arrays of genera imply that each type of dinosaur had unique behavioral and biological characteristics that set them apart from the rest. Some, such as the Velociraptor, were small, fast, and more suited to hunting in packs, whereas others, like the gargantuan Argentinosaurus, belonged to the genus that boasted some of the largest land animals ever to have lived.  These dinosaurs live on today as fossils, petrified impressions of what was once a living, breathing organism, providing us with the essential keys to unlocking the mysteries of their existence. These organisms symbolize the immense diversity of life on our planet and the truth about nature's resilience and inventiveness in the face of changing climatic and environmental challenges.  The various periods during which these organisms lived, spanning from the mid-Mesozoic era to the late Cretaceous period, were marked by significant geological and climatic changes. These periods saw drastic changes in the earth’s climate, from warm and humid to arid and cold, and these changes shaped the evolution of not just the dinosaurs but all life forms during those times.  Therefore, when considering the dinosaurs, one is not merely looking at a specific genus or group of extinct creatures with a fossil record. On the contrary, it implies a comprehensive study of organisms that once roamed the planet during different periods. Understanding them provides unique insight into adaptability and evolution, monumental climatic shifts, and the intricate dance of life and extinction that shapes our world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But among the instantly-recognisable faces of Royal Mail's 'Great Britons' stamp set is one that may leave you a little lost. John Archer, former Mayor or Battersea, is one of the characters featured in the set - a choice which is likely to leave some stamp collectors a little confused. Pioneer: John Archer, Mayor of Battersea, was the first person of African-Caribbean descent to hold civic office in London. For while his achievements heading up a London borough are indeed admirable, they are not quite as well-known as those of his fellow countrymen. The set of 10 first class stamps, released today,  also includes David Lloyd George, Benjamin Britten and Vivien Leigh. Royal Mail said it aimed to include people in sport, journalism, music, politics and the arts whose anniversaries of birth fall in 2013. A spokesman said that the unconventional choice of Mr Archer recognised the contribution he made to public life as 'the first person of African-Caribbean descent to hold civic office in London'. First class Britons: Others featured on the stamps are photographer Norman Parkinson, actress Vivien Leigh, actor Peter Cushing, David Lloyd George, writer Elizabeth David, composer and pianist Benjamin Britten, archeologist Mary Leakey, footballer Bill Shankly and broadcaster Richard Dimbleby. Inspiration: John Archer was elected into Battersea Borough Council in 1906. Also part of the set are actress Vivien Leigh, famous for her leading roles in Gone with the Wind, and actor Peter Cushing. From the world of sport, Scottish footballer and manager William 'Bill' Shankly features for his triumph as First Division champions in 1964, 1966 and 1973. Notable figures from the world of politics are also featured with the first and only Welsh Prime Minister, David Lloyd George. One of the UK's best loved classical composers Benjamin Britten is included in the ten, with celebrated portrait and fashion photographer Norman Parkinson bolstering the arts contingent. There is also Richard Dimbleby, the well known journalist, and cookery writer Elizabeth David, who was credited with introducing post-war Britain to 'exotic' Mediterranean cooking. Completing the ten is eminent archaeologist and anthropologist, Mary Leakey, who was credited with forcing scientists to re-think their long held views on human evolution thanks to her significant discoveries. Andrew Hammond, Royal Mail Stamps spokesperson, said: 'We are delighted to be honouring some of the UK's most distinguished figures in history through our latest special stamp collection. 'We hope the stamps will serve as a lasting tribute to their memory and once again encourage people to remember their significant contribution to our Great British way of life.'","output":"This article is about a special set of 10 stamps called \\"Great Britons\\" which has pictures of famous people from Britain.

Even though not many people know about him, Royal Mail wanted to show that he did something important. Other famous people on the stamps are: - Actress Vivien Leigh, who acted in famous movies. - Actor Peter Cushing, who played in many films. - Football player and manager Bill Shankly, who was very successful. - David Lloyd George, who was a powerful leader in Britain. - Benjamin Britten, who created beautiful music. - Photographer Norman Parkinson, who took amazing pictures. - Journalist Richard Dimbleby, who told important news. - Writer Elizabeth David, who shared delicious food recipes. - Mary Leakey, who studied old human bones and history.

Патель Which language is this?","output":"The word \\"Патель\\" appears to be in Cyrillic script and seems to be most closely associated with the Russian language. It's worth mentioning that Cyrillic script is used in various languages, such as Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Serbian, and Macedonian, among others. However, the given word doesn't have a clear meaning in Russian or any other Cyrillic-based language. There is a possibility that it could be a transliteration or a proper noun, such as a surname.  If you are looking for the word \\"patel\\" in English, it is a common Indian surname, particularly among Gujaratis and people from the Indian state of Gujarat. The name \\"Patel\\" is derived from the Gujarati term \\"patidar,\\" which is a combination of two words, \\"pati\\" (meaning land or farm) and \\"dar\\" (meaning ownership or possession). So, essentially, the name Patel implies someone who is a landowner or farmer.

TEXT:A low point in human interaction was reached by the Maysles Brothers with this film. Do remember, you who used words like \\"masterpiece\\"when reviewing this film, that these Maysles creeps didn't just happen to drive to the Hamptons and happen to shoot film on some eccentric people. No, when they found these two poor pathetic people they then had to finance their project (and imagine what they told the money people to sell the project). Then they befriended the two extremely vulnerable women. No meeting of minds here or real consensual participation. These wretched Maysles smiled, kissed ass, did whatever they had to to get the Beales to cooperate and then exploited them as viciously as has ever been done. One would like to think that these hustlers had occasional thoughts of remorse and guilt. But the film-making process, given the preplanning, actual shooting and then editing took a lot of time and their goal had no provisions for actually relating to the Beales as human beings. An exploitation film perpetrated by the vilest of people. As time accrued their film-making reputation has been seriously stained by what they did here. Their reputation as human beings is execrable. That is what people will remember them as. Grotesque hustlers.","output":"1. negative"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The elections of 2002 were the first elections in which Erdogan participated as a party leader. All parties previously elected to parliament failed to win enough votes to re-enter the parliament. The AKP won 34.3% of the national vote and formed the new government. Turkish stocks rose more than 7% on Monday morning. Politicians of the previous generation, such as Ecevit, Bahceli, Yilmaz and Ciller, resigned. The second largest party, the CHP, received 19.4% of the votes. The AKP won a landslide victory in the parliament, taking nearly two-thirds of the seats. Erdogan could not become Prime Minister as he was still banned from politics by the judiciary for his speech in Siirt. Gul became the Prime Minister instead. In December 2002, the Supreme Election Board canceled the general election results from Siirt due to voting irregularities and scheduled a new election for 9 February 2003. By this time, party leader Erdogan was able to run for parliament due to a legal change made possible by the opposition Republican People's Party. The AKP duly listed Erdogan as a candidate for the rescheduled election, which he won, becoming Prime Minister after Gul handed over the post.  On 14 April 2007, an estimated 300,000 people marched in Ankara to protest against the possible candidacy of Erdogan in the 2007 presidential election, afraid that if elected as President, he would alter the secular nature of the Turkish state. Erdogan announced on 24 April 2007 that the party had nominated Abdullah Gul as the AKP candidate in the presidential election. The protests continued over the next several weeks, with over one million people reported to have turned out at a 29 April rally in Istanbul, tens of thousands at separate protests on 4 May in Manisa and Canakkale, and one million in Izmir on 13 May.  The stage of the elections of 2007 was set for a fight for legitimacy in the eyes of voters between his government and the CHP. Erdogan used the event that took place during the ill-fated Presidential elections a few months earlier as a part of the general election campaign of his party. On 22 July 2007, the AKP won an important victory over the opposition, garnering 46.7% of the popular vote. 22 July elections marked only the second time in the Republic of Turkey's history whereby an incumbent governing party won an election by increasing its share of popular support. On 14 March 2008, Turkey's Chief Prosecutor asked the country's Constitutional Court to ban Erdogan's governing party. The party escaped a ban on 30 July 2008, a year after winning 46.7% of the vote in national elections, although judges did cut the party's public funding by 50%.  In the June 2011 elections, Erdogan's governing party won 327 seats (49.83% of the popular vote) making Erdogan the only prime minister in Turkey's history to win three consecutive general elections, each time receiving more votes than the previous election. The second party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), received 135 seats (25.94%), the nationalist MHP received 53 seats (13.01%), and the Independents received 35 seats (6.58%).

Henry Ford grew up on an un-electrified farm, and as a young man he followed Edison's career as the inventor became a national role model.Ford took a job at the Edison Illuminating Company working his way up to chief engineer.  In 1896 Ford was thirty-three and, though still working for Edison Co.,he had created his first experimental automobile the Ford Quadricycle2 during his off-time. At an Edison company party in New York, Ford had his first chance to meet his hero Edison and was able to explain his new automobile to the great inventor. _ Young man, that's the thing! You have it! Your car is self-contained and carries its own power plant.\\" Edison himself had been working on the idea, but had only been considering electricity as the power source, so the idea of a gas engine was a somewhat new one.  The words comforted Ford greatly, who immediately set out building a second car which was to become the Model-T.6.The two men became f'ast friends and would go on camping trips together.When Edison later became limited to a wheelchair, Ford brought an extra one to his house so they could race.At the 50th anniversary of the invention of light-bulb, Ford honored Edison.When Edison spoke, he ended his speech directed at Ford:\\" As to Henry Ford, words fail to express my feelings.I can only say that he is my friend.\\" Therefore it is no surprise that Ford wanted something to remember Edison by after he passed away in 1931.  Once, Ford asked Thomas Edison's son Charles to sit by the dying inventor's bedside and hold a test tube next to his father's mouth to catch his final breath. Ford was a man with many strange behaviors( as was Edison)including some interest in reanimation and spiritualism and some say that he was attempting to catch Edison's soul as it escaped his body in hopes of later bringing the inventor back to life.  The test tube itself didn't turn up until 1950 when it was listed in the Ford possessions after Clara Ford's passing away, and then lost again until 1978 when it was discovered in an exhibit Entitled \\"Henry Ford-A Personal History\\" in the Henry Ford Museum.It would then be discovered that the tube was labeled \\"Edison's Last Breath\\".  There is a further mystery of this \\"last breath\\" test tube. It would seem as if Edison had quite a last breath indeed, as the Edison Estate holds a collection of 42 test tubes all supposedly containing Edison's last breath.  Regardless of the excitement over the last breath, the test tube is quite touching in its meaning.Although both men were known for all sorts of poor behavior towards .their loved ones and mistreatment of employees, between them at least, there was clearly a deep respect and admiration.

What source had he considered? 5. Were Ford and Edison companions? 6. When did Edison die? 7. What do some people believe Ford tried to collect from Edison? Numbered answers:","output":"1.

If this current got disrupted, North American and European climates would become Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the role of The Great Ocean Conveyer ocean current system The Great Ocean Conveyer, also known as the thermohaline circulation, helps regulate Earth's climate by distributing heat around the planet. Warm water flows towards the poles, while cold water from the poles sinks and flows back towards the equator, creating a continuous cycle which helps to maintain a balanced temperature between different regions. Step 2: Identify the effects of a disrupted current If the Great Ocean Conveyer were disrupted, the movement of warm water towards the North American and European regions would be significantly reduced or halted. This would result in less heat being transported to these areas, which are already at higher latitudes. Step 3: Determine the consequences for North American and European climates Considering the reduction in heat transported to these regions, the climates of North America and Europe would likely be impacted. The most probable consequence would be a cooling effect and a shift towards colder conditions.

Which experiment was more successful and appreciated?  the two groups of students used yeasts in two different experiments: they baked bread using baker's yeast, and made beer, using brewer's yeast. They learned a lot about sugars and chemistry. the bread making experiment was more successful and appreciated.than the beer experiment.  Hint: Baker's yeast is the common name for the strains of yeast commonly used in baking bread and bakery products, serving as a leavening agent which causes the bread to rise (expand and become lighter and softer) by converting the fermentable sugars present in the dough into carbon dioxide and ethanol. Baker's yeast is of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae,[1] and is the same species (but a different strain) as the kind commonly used in alcoholic fermentation, which is called brewer's yeast.[2] Baker's yeast is also a single-cell microorganism found on and around the human body. A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the bread making experiment using baker's yeast was more successful and appreciated than the beer experiment using brewer's yeast.  We can deduce this from the statement, \\"the bread making experiment was more successful and appreciated than the beer experiment.\\" This suggests that the students had a better outcome and experience while baking bread as opposed to making beer. Additionally, the paragraph provides a detailed explanation about baker's yeast, which is a type of Saccharomyces cerevisiae commonly used in baking bread and bakery products. As a leavening agent, it helps the bread rise, become lighter, and softer by converting fermentable sugars into carbon dioxide and ethanol. On the other hand, the paragraph mentions that brewer's yeast is also a strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae but is primarily used for alcoholic fermentation. While both yeasts are similar in nature, their specific applications and purposes differ. In conclusion, the bread making experiment using baker's yeast was more successful and appreciated by the students due to its positive outcome, as well as the learning experience that was achieved related to sugars and chemistry. This could be attributed to the different properties and uses of baker's yeast in comparison to brewer's yeast."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Halla , National 's chairman , president and CEO . \\" This deal makes sense for both companies , \\" Halla said in a prepared statement . Choose from: A. no B. yes...I think the answer is","output":"B. yes.  Both sentences are indicating the same thing, that the deal is advantageous or logical for both companies involved. The adjective “good” in the first statement acts as an intensifier of the noun “sense” but does not alter the core meaning of the statement.  In the first sentence, Brian L. Halla is identified as the chairman, president, and CEO of \\"National\\". His statement suggests his opinion, in his roles as chairman, president, and CEO, that the deal positively benefits both companies.  In the second sentence, Brian L. Halla is not specifically identified by his roles, but the use of just 'Halla' also refers to the same person. The fact that he made this statement in a prepared format suggests that he and possibly others have given thought to the deal, how it affects both companies, and their public response about it. Thus, regardless of whether his statement was made informally (in the first sentence) or as part of a prepared statement (in the second sentence), the essential meaning remains unchanged: he believes that the deal is beneficial or suitable for both companies. Additionally, in different contexts, the usage of \\"good\\" can amplify the positive impact of the deal or show a degree of enthusiasm from the speaker, but the central idea is still that the deal makes sense for both companies. If we remove the word \\"good,\\" the sentence still conveys the same fundamental meaning. However, it's important to note that while the overall meaning is the same, the nuances could be interpreted slightly different depending on the context. In informal speech or writing, the first sentence could be perceived as more enthusiastic or positive due to the use of the word \\"good\\". The second sentence, in a prepared statement, might be interpreted as more reserved or formal. Nevertheless, these are just nuances and do not affect the main message of the sentences, which remains the same."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Yes or no? Answer: Pagers operate as part of a paging system which includes one or more fixed transmitters (or in the case of response pagers and two-way pagers, one or more base stations ), as well as a number of pagers carried by mobile users. Question: how is a telephone pagers made A:","output":"Yes, the provided answer gives a basic overview of how pagers work within a paging system. To expand on this and provide a more comprehensive understanding of how telephone pagers are made, let's explore the main components and the process involved in making a pager. A pager, also known as a beeper, is a wireless telecommunications device that receives and displays alphanumeric or voice messages. These are primarily used for on-site or wide-area communication purposes. Pagers became popular in the 1980s and 1990s but have since been largely replaced by mobile phones. However, they are still utilized in specific industries, such as healthcare, emergency services, and hospitality. Telephone pagers are made up of several key components: 1. Casing: The outer casing is usually made of plastic or a similar light-weight material to protect the pager's internal components and maintain durability. 2. Display: Pagers often incorporate small LCD or LED displays for showing alphanumeric messages. More modern pagers might include graphical screens. 3. Electronics: The main electronic components include a microcontroller, memory, radio frequency (RF) receiver/transmitter, and a buzzer or speaker for alarm notification. 4. Battery: Pagers are typically powered by small, replaceable batteries. These can be AA, AAA, or button cell batteries, depending on the size and power requirements of the device. 5. Antenna: A crucial component in the pager manufacturing process is the integration of an antenna, which receives signals from the paging system's transmitter/base station. The process of making a telephone pager involves assembling these components, integrating the hardware, and installing firmware. Here's a step-by-step outline of the process: 1. Design: Engineers design the electronic circuitry, casing, and antenna layout, usually using computer-aided design (CAD) software. 2. Manufacturing: The plastic casing is molded and the electronic components are assembled on a printed circuit board (PCB). The PCB also holds the integrated circuits and other passive components. 3. Integration: The electronics, battery, and antenna are integrated into the casing, followed by the installation of the display. 4. Firmware and software: The microcontroller must be programmed with firmware. This software controls the pager's behavior, such as receiving and decoding signals, displaying messages, and managing user interaction. 5. Testing and quality control: Finally, each pager must be tested to ensure it functions correctly and meets all specified requirements. In summary, pagers operate as part of a paging system that includes fixed transmitters or base stations and multiple pager devices that users carry. The manufacturing process of a pager involves designing the casing, electronics, and antenna, assembling these components, programming the firmware, and performing thorough quality control checks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In this statement, the speaker is expressing their agreement with the opinion or perspective of another person concerning the situation or circumstances faced by women. The condition of women may refer to various aspects of daily life, including but not limited to social, economic, political, and cultural factors. It may encompass the opportunities available to women, the challenges they face, and their overall status and role in society. It is essential to recognize that the condition of women is not the same universally. Indeed, their experiences and situations may differ significantly based on factors such as cultural background, geographic location, socio-economic status, education level, and family structure. Thus, it is important to analyze and address the diverse range of experiences and issues faced by women across different contexts. Some key components that can affect the condition of women include: 1. Gender equality: The level of gender equality present in various aspects of society can impact the condition of women. This may involve equal access to opportunities in areas like education, work, healthcare, and political representation. Gender stereotypes and socially ingrained gender roles can also hinder progress towards gender equality. 2. Economic empowerment: Women's economic empowerment is an essential factor in improving their condition. This can involve access to quality education, job opportunities, fair wages, and support for entrepreneurship. Economic empowerment enables women to have greater control over their own lives, make decisions, and contribute to the welfare of their communities and society as a whole. 3. Health and safety: Access to quality healthcare and a safe environment is crucial to the overall condition of women. This includes reproductive healthcare, access to family planning, protection from gender-based violence, proper nutrition, and mental health support. 4. Political representation: Women's involvement and representation in political processes play a significant role in addressing their issues and improving their condition. Greater political representation allows women to advocate for their rights, policies, and programs that benefit them and contribute to the overall development of society. 5. Cultural factors: Cultural norms, practices, and attitudes can significantly influence the condition of women. It is vital to challenge and change harmful cultural practices and beliefs that perpetuate gender inequality and undermine women's wellbeing and opportunities. In conclusion, to improve the condition of women and work towards a more gender-equitable society, it is crucial to address the various factors that influence their lives, within the context of their specific situations. Creating opportunities for education, economic empowerment, political representation, and healthcare while challenging cultural norms that perpetuate gender-based discrimination is vital in achieving this goal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The most prominent struggle for power was the conflict that erupted after the death of Yaroslav the Wise. The rivaling Principality of Polotsk was contesting the power of the Grand Prince by occupying Novgorod, while Rostislav Vladimirovich was fighting for the Black Sea port of Tmutarakan belonging to Chernihiv.[citation needed] Three of Yaroslav's sons that first allied together found themselves fighting each other especially after their defeat to the Cuman forces in 1068 at the Battle of the Alta River. At the same time an uprising took place in Kiev, bringing to power Vseslav of Polotsk who supported the traditional Slavic paganism.[citation needed] The ruling Grand Prince Iziaslav fled to Poland asking for support and in couple of years returned to establish the order.[citation needed] The affairs became even more complicated by the end of the 11th century driving the state into chaos and constant warfare.

It does not inherently hold a positive or negative sentiment but derives its sentiment from the accompanying adjective – in this case, \\"flawless.\\" Considering the sentence as a whole, it is evident that it conveys a positive sentiment. The film is being praised with a strong, positive adjective, which ultimately indicates the speaker's positive feelings and admiration for the film in question.

Judge: 'The criminal law applies equally to all - travellers and others alike' Ruling by Mr Justice Ouseley lasts more than three hours. Clearance 'will not be before Monday' the council confirmed tonight.","output":"Title: Travellers' Appeal Facing Eviction, Legal Battle to Top £18m Introduction: In an ongoing legal battle, travellers from the disputed site have vowed to appeal again and cannot be evicted until Monday at the earliest. Despite the recent decision to uphold their eviction, the determined travellers are not ready to give up their fight to stay on the land they have occupied for many years. 1. Three Linked Appeals Against Eviction Fail After Judicial Review The legal battle over the right of the travellers to remain at the site took a negative turn as three linked appeals against eviction failed to sway the court's opinion. A judicial review of the case found that the decision to evict the travellers remains valid, leaving the occupants scrambling for new ways to defend their position. 2. Legal Battle Estimated to Top £18m Including Huge Bill for Basildon Council Though the case may seem relatively straightforward, the entire legal battle is estimated to reach a staggering £18m, which includes a significant financial burden for Basildon Council. As the municipality struggles to keep up with the rising costs of the dispute, there is the danger that citizens will feel the impact in reduced services or increased taxes to cover the costs. 3. Judge: 'The Criminal Law Applies Equally to All - Travellers and Others Alike' In delivering the ruling, Mr Justice Ouseley reminded all parties involved that the rule of law should be applied equally to everyone, regardless of their background or lifestyle. This position underscores the importance of maintaining a fair and unbiased legal system that protects the rights of all its citizens. 4. Ruling by Mr Justice Ouseley Lasts More Than Three Hours It was clear that the judge carefully considered the details of the case, as his ruling spanned over three hours in length. In this time, Mr Justice Ouseley examined the nuances of the situation and emphasized the necessity of following established legal procedures. 5. Clearance 'Will Not Be Before Monday' the Council Confirmed Tonight In a statement released by Basildon Council, it was confirmed that the earliest date for the clearance of the site would be on Monday. This provides a brief respite for the travellers as they prepare to make yet another appeal in their ongoing battle against eviction. Conclusion: With the appeals failing to reverse the decision, and eviction looming on the horizon, the travellers' determination to fight against their removal remains stronger than ever. As the legal battle continues to escalate, not only are the travellers at risk of being displaced, but the mounting costs to taxpayers should not be overlooked."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She was armed with a pair of guns in open barbettes and had a top speed of . Her service was limited, in large part due to the rapid pace of naval development in the 1890s, which quickly rendered her obsolescent. As a result, her career was generally limited to routine training and the occasional visit to foreign countries. In 1897, she took part in an international naval demonstration to force a compromise over Greek and Ottoman claims to the island of Crete. Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie was decommissioned in 1905, hulked in 1910, and converted into a barracks ship in 1914.

However, Naval investigator and lawyer Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway (Demi Moore) suspects that Dawson and Downey, who were otherwise exemplary marines, were carrying out a \\"Code Red\\", an unofficial act of discipline in which soldiers are submitted to methods akin to bullying in order to get them to improve their performance, toe the line or follow procedure. Santiago compared unfavorably to his fellow Marines, being clumsy and lagging behind on exercises and was socially ostracized. He denounced Dawson in an attempt to be transferred away from Guantanamo.Dawson and Downey are taken to a military prison in Washington D.C. to await trial. Galloway requests to defend them but the case is given to Lieutenant Junior Grade Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise), an inexperienced U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps lawyer. Kaffee has a reputation for arranging plea bargains and has never even argued a case in a court room, which gives him time to devote himself to his passion for softball.

Q:Given the below context:  Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home.  Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at  the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895.

The University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and Royal Northern College of Music. The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom and was created in 2004 by the merger of Victoria University of Manchester founded in 1904 and UMIST, founded in 1956, though the university's logo appears to claim it was established in 1824. It includes the Manchester Business School, which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.The three Universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct. Together they have a combined population of 76,025 students in higher education as of 2015, although almost 6,000 of them were based at Manchester Metropolitan University's campuses at Crewe and Alsager in Cheshire.One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the Manchester Grammar School. Established in 1515, as a free grammar school next to what is now the Cathedral, it moved in 1931 to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, south Manchester, to accommodate the growing student body. In the post-war period, it was a direct grant grammar school (i.e. partially state funded), but it reverted to independent status in 1976 after abolition of the direct-grant system. Its previous premises are now used by Chetham's School of Music. There are three schools nearby: William Hulme's Grammar School, Withington Girls' School and Manchester High School for Girls.

Here is a question about this article: Evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the evolution of human physiology and human behaviour and the relation between hominins and non-hominin primates. Evolutionary anthropology is based in natural science and social science, combining the human development with socioeconomic factors. Evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans, past and present. It is based on a scientific approach, and brings together fields such as archaeology, behavioral ecology, psychology, primatology, and genetics. It is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field, drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience, past and present. What is the answer to this question: Which humans does evolutionary anthropology concern itself with the biological and cultural evolution of?","output":"Evolutionary anthropology concerns itself with the biological and cultural evolution of all humans, both past and present. This includes the study of our human ancestors, known as hominins, as well as modern humans, Homo sapiens. The field aims to understand the complex interplay between biology, culture, and the environment that has led to the development of human societies throughout history. By examining various aspects of human existence, such as genetics, morphology, behavior, and cultural practices, evolutionary anthropology seeks to unravel the patterns and processes underlying human evolution and diversification. Ultimately, this comprehensive approach allows researchers to gain a more nuanced understanding of what it means to be human and how our species has adapted to different circumstances throughout our evolutionary history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: President Donald Trump suffered a political setback Tuesday when Democrats won easy victories in governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey. In addition, Democrats cheered a turnout that could have major implications for next year's congressional midterm elections, when all 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate will be on the ballot. Democrats are pointing to exit polls in both Virginia and New Jersey that showed that anger at Trump was a major factor in stimulating Democrats to get to the polls. They also note Democratic gains in the battle for state delegate seats in Virginia, another sign of grass-roots enthusiasm that could help Democrats in races for lower-level offices across the country. In New Jersey, Governor-elect Phil Murphy, a Democrat, saw his election as a direct rebuke of the Republican president. \\"New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation. We are better than this!\\" Murphy told cheering supporters at his victory rally. In Virginia, Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in a campaign that focused, in part, on Trump and his policies, especially on immigration. At a news conference Wednesday, Northam said his victory showed that Virginians had a message for the country and the world. \\"The divisiveness, the hatred, the bigotry, the politics that is tearing this country apart, that is not the United States of America that people love and it certainly not the Commonwealth of Virginia that they love,\\" he said. Political analysts said Democratic enthusiasm and a focus on Trump were clearly on display in both states. \\"We have heard for months and months about all this energy on the left. It had not materialized until tonight,\\" said Steve Peoples of the Associated Press. \\"A big night for Democrats and, really, it was a repudiation of sorts of the Trump nationalist message.\\" Even some Republicans saw the results as a rejection of the Trump political brand.

And in ancient Egyptian fairy tales, the hippo was a goddess that guided the dead to the afterworld. Despite their popular appeal, hippos, as well as other animals, have difficulty when their needs conflict with those of humans. The early Egyptians liked to hunt hippos for their teeth and because they were dangerous animals. Amulets to protect babies from demons were made from hippo bones. About 4,000 years ago, there were so many hippos in Egypt that they caused serious crop damage. Egyptian farmers killed them routinely, and by the beginning of the 19th century, all the hippos in Africa had been killed. People used to see hippos fight in the arenas of ancient Rome. After the fall of the Roman Empire, hippos weren't seen in Europe again until a few zoos began to exhibit them in the mid 1800s. All the various uses and abuses of hippos through the centuries have made their population fall greatly. Where they do occur, mostly in national parks, they live in such high density that they make the grasslands bare.

Much action recently has focused in and around the key northern city of Konna, which insurgents took on Thursday only to retreat the following day after a combined air and ground assault. \\" OPTIONS: - Bamako, in this operation, is not pursuing any interest ... other than safeguarding a friendly country, and (France) does not have any goal other than fighting against terrorism,\\" the French president said Saturday. - CNN, in this operation, is not pursuing any interest ... other than safeguarding a friendly country, and (France) does not have any goal other than fighting against terrorism,\\" the French president said Saturday. - France, in this operation, is not pursuing any interest ... other than safeguarding a friendly country, and (France) does not have any goal other than fighting against terrorism,\\" the French president said Saturday. - French, in this operation, is not pursuing any interest ... other than safeguarding a friendly country, and (France) does not have any goal other than fighting against terrorism,\\" the French president said Saturday. - Islamist, in this operation, is not pursuing any interest ... other than safeguarding a friendly country, and (France) does not have any goal other than fighting against terrorism,\\" the French president said Saturday. - Konna, in this operation, is not pursuing any interest ... other than safeguarding a friendly country, and (France) does not have any goal other than fighting against terrorism,\\" the French president said Saturday. - Mali, in this operation, is not pursuing any interest ... other than safeguarding a friendly country, and (France) does not have any goal other than fighting against terrorism,\\" the French president said Saturday. - Malian, in this operation, is not pursuing any interest ... other than safeguarding a friendly country, and (France) does not have any goal other than fighting against terrorism,\\" the French president said Saturday. - West African, in this operation, is not pursuing any interest ... other than safeguarding a friendly country, and (France) does not have any goal other than fighting against terrorism,\\" the French president said Saturday. - al Qaeda, in this operation, is not pursuing any interest ... other than safeguarding a friendly country, and (France) does not have any goal other than fighting against terrorism,\\" the French president said Saturday.","output":"Based on the information provided in the passage, the most accurate option to choose is: - France, in this operation, is not pursuing any interest ... other than safeguarding a friendly country, and (France) does not have any goal other than fighting against terrorism,\\" the French president said Saturday. This option is the most suitable because the passage states that France, the former colonial ruler of Mali, has sent troops to join Mali in combating militant Islamist forces linked to al Qaeda. The French president's statement emphasizes that France's goal in assisting Mali is solely to fight terrorism and protect a friendly nation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He decides that his mother, who abandoned him at the orphanage as an infant, is the only one who ever truly loved him and works on a machine to scan his memory to locate her. Taking his memory scanner to his school's science fair, Lewis meets 13-year-old Wilbur Robinson, a mysterious boy claiming to be a time cop from the future. Wilbur needs to recover a time machine that a man wearing a bowler hat has stolen. Lewis tries to demonstrate the scanner, but it falls apart, throwing the science fair into chaos. Upset, Lewis leaves while the Bowler Hat Guy, with the help of a robotic bowler hat named Doris, repairs and steals the scanner. Wilbur meets Lewis at the orphanage and asks him to repair the scanner. Lewis agrees to do so only if Wilbur can prove he is telling the truth, which Wilbur does by taking them to the year 2037 in a second time machine. When they arrive, however, Lewis says he can use the time machine instead of the scanner, and he and Wilbur get into an argument and crash. Wilbur then asks Lewis to fix the time machine, but Lewis has another condition: Wilbur has to take him to visit his mother afterwards. Reluctantly, Wilbur agrees and hides Lewis in the garage. Lewis doesn't stay there for long, however, and ends up meeting the rest of the Robinsons except for Cornelius, Wilbur's father, who is away on a business trip. Following Lewis, the Bowler Hat Guy and Doris unsuccessfully try to kidnap him. Meanwhile, the Robinsons offer to adopt Lewis, but change their mind when they learn that he's from the past. Wilbur admits to lying to Lewis about taking him back to see his mom, causing Lewis to run off in disgust. Lewis then discovers that Cornelius Robinson is, in fact, a future version of himself, and Wilbur is his future son. Lewis also finds out that the Bowler Hat Guy is a grown-up version of Lewis' roommate, Michael \\"Goob\\" Yagoobian. Because he was always kept awake by Lewis...

Context: I have been preparing our house for the market and in doing so, I have gotten rid of a lot of stuff! I am definitely the hoarder in our house. My husband could live out of two bags, use about five kitchen items each year, and doesn’t gather anything for future use or hang on to much for sentimental value. (Which probably means the items he has hung on to mean a whole lot more!) I am always tucking something away here or stashing materials there…all in preparation for “some day.” It’s also part of the teacher in me. Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help. PACK If you know you don’t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it’s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it’s on the market. I took a look at everything and kept the essentials (well, maybe even more than the essentials), and packed up the rest. Question: How does the author suggest that one can save money?

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the title of the song that peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100? ?  In July, two singles were issued on the Brother imprint: \\"Heroes and Villains\\" and \\"Gettin' Hungry\\". The former peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. The latter was not credited to the Beach Boys, but instead to Brian Wilson and Mike Love.  On September 18, 1967, Smiley Smile  was released in the US. The LP peaked at number 41 on the Billboard charts, making it their worst-selling album to that date. It spent most of its 21-week chart time bubbling under 100 and 197. When released in the UK in November, it performed better, reaching number 9 of the UK Albums Chart.Critics and fans were generally underwhelmed by the album and controversy involving whether the band was to be taken as a serious rock group ensued. A review in Hit Parader praised the album for \\"probably [having] more a cappella harmony than on any album since the fall of the singing-group era in the late 1950s\\", but that they \\"still like Pet Sounds better\\". NME wrote of the album: \\"By the standards which this group has set itself, it's more than a grade disappointing.\\" Hi Fidelity said: \\"... they are making the psychedelic route ... perhaps in the unforgettable city of Fresno. Until they reach the San Francisco Bay Bridge or return to the shores of Malibu ... their work can only receive partial approval.\\" Rolling Stone referred to it as a \\"disaster\\" and an \\"abortive attempt to match the talents of Lennon and McCartney.\\" On December 14, 1967, the magazine's editor and co-founder Jann Wenner printed an influential article that denounced Wilson's \\"genius\\" label, which he called a \\"promotional shuck\\", and the Beach Boys themselves, which he called \\"one prominent example of a group that has gotten hung up on trying to catch The Beatles\\". He wrote that \\"for some reason, [Smiley Smile] just doesn't make it ... [the songs] just don't move you.

Which island had the average beak size in the finch population increase? Answer:","output":"To determine which island had an increase in the average beak size in the finch population, we must consider the factors that could lead to such a change. Let's analyze the situation step-by-step: 1. The explorers visited Galapagos 1 and Galapagos 2, which are part of the same archipelago. 2. Island 1 experienced a drought in recent years. Droughts can lead to a scarcity of food and change in the types of food available. 3. Both islands have bird populations, specifically finches. 4. Due to the drought on Island 1, it is likely that the food sources changed, favoring finches with larger beaks. Finches with larger beaks are better suited to crack open hard seeds and access other food sources that require a stronger beak. 5. Through the process of natural selection, it is expected that finches with larger beaks survived and reproduced more successfully in the drought conditions on Island 1, which would have led to an increase in the average beak size in the population. In conclusion, based on the information provided, Island 1 (Galapagos 1) would have seen an increase in the average beak size in the finch population due to the recent drought and the process of natural selection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  The parasympathetic division controls internal organs and glands during the rest of the time. It controls processes like digestion, heartbeat, and breathing when there is not an emergency.   Choices:  - endocrine  - synaptic  - dopaminergic  - parasympathetic   A: Answer:","output":"The parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system is responsible for controlling processes like digestion, heartbeat, and breathing when there is not an emergency. The autonomic nervous system has two primary divisions: the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches. The sympathetic division is responsible for the \\"fight or flight\\" response and is more active during situations of stress or danger, while the parasympathetic division is responsible for the \\"rest and digest\\" response and is more active during periods of rest. The parasympathetic division works to maintain homeostasis and ensure the proper functioning of internal organs and glands. It regulates the heartbeat, helping to lower the heart rate during rest and relaxation. This division also manages the process of digestion, as it stimulates the secretion of digestive enzymes and bile, helps with the absorption of nutrients, and aids in peristalsis – the rhythmic contractions of the digestive tract that propel food along. Breathing is another process controlled by the parasympathetic division. When an individual is relaxed, the parasympathetic nerves work to slow down the respiratory rate, decrease the volume of air inhaled and exhaled with each breath, and maintain a steady and even flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide within the body. Other functions regulated by the parasympathetic division include dilation of blood vessels, stimulation of salivary glands, the production of lacrimal fluid (for tear production), and control of the pupil size in the eye, among others. In conclusion, the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system is responsible for controlling various processes such as digestion, heartbeat, and breathing during non-emergency situations, ensuring the body remains in a state of balance and optimal functioning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize this article: Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The pair have had a contentious relationship throughout the race      Defeated Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz has endorsed Donald Trump in the race for the White House.      The Texas senator fought Mr Trump in a bitter primary battle, marked by mud-slinging and personal insults.      Mr Cruz said he would fulfil his promise to vote for the Republican nominee and that electing Hillary Clinton would be \\"wholly unacceptable\\".      He drew ire at the Republican National Convention in July, when he was booed off stage for not endorsing Mr Trump.      \\"This election is unlike any other in our nation's history. Like many other voters, I have struggled to determine the right course of action in this general election,\\" Mr Cruz announced in a Facebook post.      \\"After months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I have decided that on Election Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump.\\"      Everything Ted Cruz has said about Trump      The comments underscore a dramatic U-turn for Mr Cruz, who has referred to Mr Trump as a \\"trainwreck\\" and a \\"pathological liar\\" who could not be trusted in the White House.      Mr Trump responded to the Cruz reversal by saying he was \\"greatly honoured\\" to have the endorsement of \\"a tough and brilliant opponent\\".      But some of Cruz supporters decried the senator's announcement, including his former campaign spokesman, Rick Tyler, who told NBC: \\"It's mourning in America for conservatives. We lost our leader today.\\"      Meanwhile, Trump campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, who previously worked for a super PAC supporting Mr Cruz, expressed her relief on social media.      Image copyright Twitter      Analysis - Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington      By endorsing Donald Trump now - after all the heat he took for his \\"vote your conscience\\" stand in July - Mr Cruz appears to be acknowledging two realities.      The first is that Mr Trump might actually win the presidency even without Mr Cruz's support.      At the very least, he will be competitive, diminishing the Texas senator's ability to tell his fellow party mates \\"I told you so\\".      The second is that Trump-ism is the future of the Republican Party - and if Mr Cruz wants to be a part of that, he's going to have to play ball.      The Texas senator has to run for re-election in 2018, and he faces the threat of a pro-Trump primary challenger. This endorsement could be a way to defuse that political bomb.      Although he styles himself as an ideological true believe, Mr Cruz has shown remarkable political flexibility.      The Ivy League establishment lawyer turned into anti-Washington firebrand to win a Senate seat. During the presidential campaign, he embraced Mr Trump when he saw it in his interest, then turned on the front-runner when the field narrowed.      Now, it seems, the Trump-Cruz bromance has been rekindled. But the Republican nominee would be wise to watch his back.      Mr Cruz said he decided to back his former foe due to six key policy differences between Mr Trump and Hillary Clinton, including the fate of the Supreme Court, Obamacare, immigration and energy.      Mr Trump and Mr Cruz repeatedly clashed during the primary campaign both on and off the debate stage.      Mr Trump came under fire after he tweeted an unflattering photo of Mr Cruz's wife, Heidi.      He also suggested that Mr Cruz's father, Rafael Cruz, was connected to the assassination of US President John F Kennedy.      Media caption The moment the crowd turned on Ted Cruz      Just before the Indiana primary election, Mr Cruz called the New York businessman a \\"braggadocios, arrogant buffoon\\" and a \\"serial philanderer\\".      At the Republican National Convention in Ohio, Mr Cruz refused to throw his support behind the official Republican nominee while giving a speech during a primetime slot.      He instead told Americans to \\"vote your conscience\\" in November and was subsequently booed off the stage.      After the event, Mr Cruz said: \\"I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father.\\"      In announcing his decision on Friday, Mr Cruz emphasised that he was focused on preventing Mrs Clinton from winning the White House.      \\"Our country is in crisis. Hillary Clinton is manifestly unfit to be president, and her policies would harm millions of Americans,\\" he said.      \\"And Donald Trump is the only thing standing in her way.\\"      The news comes as Mr Trump prepares to face Mrs Clinton in the first presidential debate on Monday at Hofstra University in New York. ||||| Washington (CNN) Ted Cruz endorsed Donald Trump for the presidency Friday afternoon, a stunning turn of events after a contentious primary filled with nasty personal attacks and a dramatic snub at the Republican National Convention.      \\"After many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I have decided that on Election Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump,\\" Cruz wrote in a Facebook post      \\"A year ago, I pledged to endorse the Republican nominee, and I am honoring that commitment. And if you don't want to see a Hillary Clinton presidency, I encourage you to vote for him.\\"      \\"I am greatly honored by the endorsement of Senator Cruz,\\" Trump said in a statement obtained by CNN. \\"We have fought the battle and he was a tough and brilliant opponent. I look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make America great again.\\"      The move -- three days before Trump's critical first debate with Clinton -- comes as the Trump and Cruz camps have moved closer in recent weeks.      Trump's vice presidential nominee Mike Pence played a key role in bringing Cruz into the fold. Pence and Cruz traded multiple messages, then spoke at length once on the phone and again in person, when Pence visited Capitol Hill a few weeks ago, a source close to Pence said.      Trump has hired key Cruz allies such as Kellyanne Conway as his campaign manager, and Jason Miller as a spokesman.      Wednesday, Trump's campaign expressed support for a Cruz-backed, Internet-related proposal in government funding talks in the Senate.      Friday, Trump released a new list of conservative judges likely to appeal to the former Supreme Court clerk -- including perhaps Cruz's closest friend in Congress, Utah Sen. Mike Lee.      Cruz cited Trump's pledges on the judiciary in his Facebook post. \\"We know, without a doubt, that every Clinton appointee would be a left-wing ideologue. Trump, in contrast, has promised to appoint justices 'in the mold of (the late Antonin) Scalia,' Cruz wrote. \\"For some time, I have been seeking greater specificity on this issue, and today the Trump campaign provided that, releasing a very strong list of potential Supreme Court nominees — including Sen. Mike Lee, who would make an extraordinary justice — and making an explicit commitment to nominate only from that list.\\"      A Cruz endorsement could be the last pillar to helping Trump shore up the support of conservatives who have remained reticent about supporting his campaign.      Trump has already gotten most Republicans and conservatives on board with his campaign -- largely by reassuring them on the Supreme Court and on issues like the Second Amendment and abortion. But Cruz's principled opposition to offering his support has given some conservatives high-profile cover.      Just as Cruz's refusal to endorse Trump at the RNC fueled Democrats' efforts to paint Trump as divisive even within his own party, Cruz's endorsement will help undermine that narrative -- suggesting to conservatives unsure about Trump that perhaps the brash billionaire has changed, and can be trusted to bring conservative change to Washington.      'Lyin' Ted' and 'utterly amoral'      The move marks a dramatic turnaround from the personal insults Cruz and Trump traded during the previous year.      The two men clashed repeatedly during the primaries, as Trump taunted the senator with the nickname \\"Lyin' Ted,\\" suggested Cruz wasn't eligible to be president due to his Canadian birthplace, and even speculated that Cruz's father was involved in the JFK assassination. Trump also said Cruz should \\"be careful\\" or he would \\" spill the beans on your wife ,\\" and retweeted an unflattering picture of Heidi Cruz. Those tweets have not been deleted from Trump's account.      Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2016      On his last day of the GOP campaign -- the Indiana primary in early May -- Cruz let loose against Trump , calling the businessman a \\"serial philanderer,\\" \\"utterly amoral,\\" and \\"a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen.      At the RNC in Cleveland, Cruz gave a memorable speech espousing conservative values but ended without endorsing Trump, as Trump allies booed from the convention floor. \\"Don't stay home in November,\\" Cruz said. \\"Stand and speak and vote your conscience.\\"      The next day, he defended the move by citing Trump's attacks against his family.      \\"I'm not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father,\\" Cruz told members of the Texas delegation . \\"That pledge was not a blanket commitment that if you go and slander and attack Heidi that I'm going to nonetheless come as a servile puppy dog and say, 'Thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.'\\"      After the convention, Trump said that he would not accept Cruz's endorsement if he offered it.      \\"I don't want his endorsement. If he gives it, I will not accept it, just so you understand. If he gives it I will -- I will not accept. It won't matter. Honestly he should've done it because nobody cares and he would've been in better shape for four years from now,\\" Trump said.      Facing Senate primary in 2018?      Cruz's move may also be politically expedient. He faces a possible 2018 Senate primary challenge from Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, who has increasingly made an issue of Cruz's failure to endorse Trump.      Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus has said Republicans who don't back Trump could pay a price down the road. And Trump also floated the idea of setting up a super PAC to oppose Cruz if he decided to run for office again.      Clinton's campaign, after Cruz's message posted on Facebook, was happy to note a number of shots Cruz took at Trump during the primary, including when he called on the businessman to release his tax returns.      Clinton's official twitter account retweeted a tweet Cruz sent during the primary that said, \\"I've released 9 years of tax returns. RT if you agree it's time for Donald Trump to release his!\\"      I've released 9 years of tax returns. RT if you agree it's time for Donald Trump to release his! https://t.co/08whtFVC0r — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) April 19, 2016      Clinton's campaign has been hounding Trump to release his taxes, arguing that he isn't doing so because they show shady business deals and ties to Russia. Trump has said he would release his taxes after an IRS audit.      Clinton's vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine, campaigning in Austin, Texas, Friday, said he couldn't support someone who used the same language Trump did about Cruz's father.      \\"I just can't help but say this,\\" Kaine said. \\"Donald Trump suggested that Ted Cruz's dad was involved in the JFK assassination. Now we know that that is false, but false isn't, there's not the right word to describe what that is. It is so outrageously false. And as far as I know Donald Trump has not retracted it. As far as I know he has not apologized for it. And so if somebody said that about my dad they would never have me as a supporter for anything.\\"      Radio host Steve Deace tweeted his disappointment, calling the move a mistake and speculating that Cruz backers may not all follow the senator.      \\"I think it's the worst political miscalculation of my lifetime. I hope I am wrong. The people will decide that,\\" Deace tweeted. ||||| Summary:","output":"Ted Cruz has endorsed Donald Trump in the US presidential race, despite having been a bitter rival during the Republican primary race. Cruz had previously referred to Trump as a “trainwreck” and a “pathological liar.” However, the Texas senator now claims that he has decided to vote for Trump after “months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience.” Cruz also stated that electing Hillary Clinton would be “wholly unacceptable.” At this year’s Republican National Convention, Cruz was booed for not endorsing the candidate. Many of Cruz’s supporters are unhappy about his endorsement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

British Empire: In September 1982, Prime minister Margaret Thatcher travelled to Beijing to negotiate with the Chinese government on the future of Britain's last major and most populous overseas territory, Hong Kong. Under the terms of the 1842 Treaty of Nanking, Hong Kong Island itself had been ceded to Britain in perpetuity, but the vast majority of the colony was constituted by the New Territories, which had been acquired under a 99-year lease in 1898, due to expire in 1997. Thatcher, seeing parallels with the Falkland Islands, initially wished to hold Hong Kong and proposed British administration with Chinese sovereignty, though this was rejected by China. A deal was reached in 1984—under the terms of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Hong Kong would become a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China, maintaining its way of life for at least 50 years. The handover ceremony in 1997 marked for many, including Charles, Prince of Wales, who was in attendance, \\"the end of Empire\\". Please answer a question about this article.

Answer: In Unicode it is encoded at . Question: what is the sign for degrees Answer:","output":"The degree symbol, denoted as °, is a widely recognized symbol utilized to represent degrees in various fields, such as temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit), geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude), and angular measurements. The presence of the degree symbol indicates that the value expressed is in terms of degrees, which helps to differentiate it from other possible units of measurement. In Unicode, the degree symbol is encoded at U+00B0 (decimal 176) under the name \\"DEGREE SIGN.\\" This makes it possible for computers and related systems to process, display, and exchange this symbol consistently. Additionally, the degree symbol can also be accessed using various keyboard shortcuts or input methods, depending on your device, operating system, or software application. For instance, common keyboard shortcuts to type the degree symbol include: - On Windows: Alt+0176 (using the numeric keypad) - On Mac: Option/Alt+0 (that is a zero) - On MS Word: Ctrl+Shift+2, followed by the spacebar In HTML, you can insert the degree symbol by using the following character entities: - Numeric: &#176; or &#x00B0; - Named: &deg; In the context of your original question, the degree symbol is the sign used for representing degrees in various fields, and in Unicode, it is encoded at U+00B0.

Q: Review: The first of the official Ghibli films, Laputa is most similar to its predecessor Nausicaa, but whereas Nausicaa was a SF epic, this is more of an action comedy-adventure with a fairly weak SF premise.For the first half hour of the movie I thought I was going to love it. Once again you find yourself in awe of Miyazaki's attention to detail, and his ability to conjure up an imaginary world in meticulous, beautiful perfection. The animation, though still not in the league of the later Ghibli films, is a little better than in Nausicaa.I mentioned in my review of Nausicaa that one character is drawn in a more 'Lupinesque' anime style. Here there are a whole bunch of them: the pirates. They provide the comic element in the film, though quite why it needs a comic element I'm not sure. There was nothing funny about Nausicaa, and I think it was better off for it. Still. having said that, Dola, the pirate leader, is easily the most memorable character in the film (even if she's basically a female Long John Silver. Don't be surprised if you're reminded of 'Treasure Planet' at times) and is well voiced by Cloris Leachman in the American dub.The English voice cast acquit themselves well for the most part, actually. However something started going pear-shaped for me about this movie by about the halfway mark. I think the best way that I could describe it is that the characters get swallowed up by the vast scope of the story. I'll come back to that later.There is so much to admire about Laputa, and so many people obviously love it, that I almost feel mean for only giving it 8 out of 10, but for me the operative word here is 'admire'. It was more impressive than personally affecting, and at over two hours it just started to drag.The crucial thing for me was this: I really found that I didn't care much about any of the characters. Disney would have taken the care to develop the characters, make you really fall for them, rather than leave them as relatively two-dimensional pieces to be moved around while you gawked at the amazing vistas in the movie. Even that would have been tolerable if there was some hard SF in the story to make up for it, but it was basically a lot of gobledegook about Princesses and magic crystals. That's where Laputa falls down as far as I'm concerned, and that's what holds it back from being a potential 10 out of 10 movie. Having said that, it must be admitted that Miyazaki was leagues ahead of Disney in general in 1986, when you consider that their movie of the same year was the pretty dire 'Great Mouse Detective'.Laputa is a good film in some ways an amazing film, and you should definitely see it, but I do feel it's over-rated. I definitely prefer the earlier 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind'.BTW, if you manage to watch them in chronological order, watch for the fox-squirrel from Nausicaa popping up briefly in Laputa.

The show, which won multiple Emmy Awards, BAFTAs, and a Golden Globe, received praise for its combination of soap opera intrigue, realistic historical events, and intricate portrayal of British life during that time. 3. Snobs (2004): Apart from screenwriting, Fellowes has ventured into the world of literature with several novels. His debut novel, Snobs, is a satirical look at the British upper class and social climbers in contemporary society. The story centers on the life of Edith Lavery, a middle-class woman who becomes entangled with aristocratic circles after marrying an Earl. 4. Past Imperfect (2008): Fellowes' second novel, Past Imperfect, is a mystery story that explores the themes of class, power, and societal expectations through the perspective of a middle-aged man as he revisits events from his past in the late 1960s. 5. Belgravia (2016): Belgravia is a serialized novel by Fellowes, later adapted into a television miniseries in 2020. The story takes place in the early 19th century, set in the exclusive London district of the same name. It follows the lives of two families, the Trenchards and the Brockenhursts, amidst the turmoil and changes of the era. 6. The Gilded Age (2022): Fellowes has written and created a new American television period drama series called The Gilded Age, which is set to premiere in 2022. The story is based in the 1880s and revolves around the intersecting lives of old and new money in New York society. 7. Romeo and Juliet (2013): Fellowes wrote the screenplay for the 2013 adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, directed by Carlo Carlei. This adaptation retained the original Elizabethan dialogue while incorporating linguistic alterations for easy comprehension by modern audiences. 8. The Tourist (2005): Fellowes co-wrote this psychological thriller film about a group of British tourists traveling through Namibia whose lives take a dark turn after a tragic accident. In addition to these notable works, Julian Fellowes has made various television and radio appearances, written for many TV series episodes, and has worked on different theatrical adaptations.

Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city. Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared. Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half. By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: \\"THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT.\\" Question: The belief that \\"The customer is always right\\" suggests that   _  .

Cunningham played 16 seasons in the NFL, for the Philadelphia Eagles, Minnesota Vikings, Baltimore Ravens and Dallas Cowboys. \\"You want to make sure that you're getting somebody that's going to be great, not only for the football program, but a positive role model for the kids,\\" Silverado principal Bob Mars told the Las Vegas Review-Journali. \\"I think that's what we're getting in Coach Cunningham.\\" Cunningham played college football at UNLV/ He led the Rebels to an 11-2 record as a senior in 1984. Additionally, he was a two-time All-American selection as a punter. \\"There's many strengths he brings to the program,\\" Mars said. \\"He's a member of our community, so he's familiar with that. He is extremely knowledgeable about the game and the sport, and he's certainly got name recognition, which is going to help as well. He's a real positive role model.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: If possible, meet where you won't be recognized. You don't want your parents, your relatives, community leaders, or your parents' friends to see you while you're out with your boyfriend. Meet when your parents think you're somewhere else, you could pretend to have a club meeting, or to be hanging out with a friend. You might even sneak out of the house at night.  If you live in a city, you could meet almost anywhere: a big city park, a free museum, a scenic hill, or a little cafe in your favorite neighborhood. The same goes for the suburbs, although it might be harder to get around if you and your boyfriend don't have your own cars. If you live in a rural area, you might need to meet up outdoors. Don't hang out with your boyfriend in the park across the street from your house, or the local supermarket, or anywhere that your parents or their friends might run into you. When you go out with your boyfriend, your parents will probably want to know where you are. It may be best to bring a friend or two with you when you go out. That way, when they call you, you can just say \\"Oh, I'm with Amy,\\" and then put Amy on the phone with them to verify that indeed, you are with her and not your boyfriend! This is a classic move, but you'll need to be very careful about your story to pull off. The basic idea: if you want to meet up with your boyfriend after hours or even stay over at his house, tell your parents that you are sleeping over at a friend's house. If your parents insist on meeting your friends, then you should use a good friend (who your parents have met) to corroborate your story.  Tell your friend about your plan. If possible if you are completely certain that you can trust your friend's parents have your friend's parents agree to pretend that you're sleeping over. It helps if you name a friend whose house you've slept over at many times before. If your parents are suspicious, they might call your friend's parents to check out your story. Consider whether this is likely to happen. If so, then you may not want to risk it. Understand the risks: if you bring your boyfriend into your parents' space, then you are giving them a huge opportunity to find out about him. Wait for a time when they aren't home, a whole weekend is even better.  If you sneak your boyfriend into your house while your parents are home, make sure that he has a secret way to enter and escape. Try to bring him in once your parents are asleep, and be extremely quiet so that they don't suspect anything. Keep the noise level down so you can listen for your parents voices or footsteps in case they're walking toward your room. Be prepared to hide him under the bed or in a closet at a moment's notice, or have him leave through the window if possible! Don't leave any evidence that your boyfriend was there. Your parents will get suspicious if they see a men's comb or a men's jacket. If he gives you a gift (a note, a photo, a bouquet of flowers) don't leave it out in the open!

Article: Traveling should be easy and enjoyable, and one of the ways to make sure your trip remains fun is to know exactly how to keep your valuables safe. If you are traveling alone, distribute your money through your luggage. Place most of it in your main suitcase or bag. Make a rough estimate of how much money you will spend on the journey, till you reach your destination. Place this money in a different wallet and carry this in your pocket. Spend from this pocket till you get to your destination. If you are travelling with someone, distribute the money among yourselves. Instead of wearing your jewels, you can put your jewels at the bottom of your suitcase or bag. DO NOT carry in your purse, just in case it is stolen; or in case you misplace your purse. In addition, if you are going to be frequently opening your purse for things like tickets and phone numbers, what if you accidently just drop them. Have you ever seen a mini backpack purse? It looks really fashionable and is very smart. Plus, It's really convenient to use. The best thing to do is to hang the mini backpack purse in the front, like a baby carrier. There are two big advantages to do this; one, your hands remain free to carry your luggage and other things; and two, your purse is always monitored, and is just under your nose! Credit cards are very useful in many ways. But if you misplace your credit card, it is quite easy for someone else to find it and use it to his/ her maximum benefit before you even realize you have lost it! If you lose cash, you lose only that much cash as you are carrying. But a lost credit card means the money in your bank account is lost. So always try to use cash instead of credit card while traveling Question: Carrying a mini backpack can help you because - it is convenient to carry and monitor. - it is easier to carry your baby. - it reduce the burden on your back. - it can use to carry more things.

Step 1: Simplify the equation Combine the terms containing v on the right side of the equation: -429 = (33 - 34)*v - 463 Since 33 - 34 = -1, the equation becomes: -429 = -1*v - 463 Step 2: Isolate the variable, v Now, to solve for v, isolate it by performing the inverse operation on the constants. First, add 463 to both sides of the equation: -429 + 463 = -1*v - 463 + 463 34 = -1*v Next, divide both sides of the equation by -1 (the coefficient of v): 34 / (-1) = (-1) * v / (-1) -34 = v So, the solution to the given equation is v = -34."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Read this: Conventional bleaching of wood pulp using elemental chlorine produces and releases into the environment large amounts of chlorinated organic compounds, including chlorinated dioxins. Dioxins are recognized as a persistent environmental pollutant, regulated internationally by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. Dioxins are highly toxic, and health effects on humans include reproductive, developmental, immune and hormonal problems. They are known to be carcinogenic. Over 90% of human exposure is through food, primarily meat, dairy, fish and shellfish, as dioxins accumulate in the food chain in the fatty tissue of animals.

His real birthday, as revealed by his biological mother, was on 4 February, instead of 26 January. At a young age, he was given up for adoption by his biological mother to the Kim family, and his name was changed to Kim Jae-joong. When Kim was fifteen, he moved to Seoul by himself in order to take part in the auditions held by SM Entertainment. On 17 January 2013, Kim released his first solo EP titled I/MINE, a rock-themed album which Kim penned all the lyrics to. The album debuted at the top of both the Hanteo and Gaon weekly charts in Korea. It was also met with resounding success throughout Asia, topping Taiwan's Five Music's Korean and Japanese music chart, Japan's Shinseido weekly chart and Yin Yue Tai's V chart for K-pop. It also topped the iTunes rock charts in nine countries. Additionally, the pre-released single \\"One Kiss\\" and lead single \\"Mine\\" topped both domestic charts and foreign charts, including a German Asian music chart.  On 26 and 27 January, Kim held two days of special concerts at the KINTEX Ilsan to celebrate the launch of the album, as well as his birthday. Kim then released a repackaged version of his album, titled Y which consists of contains two additional tracks: \\"Only Love\\" and \\"Kiss B\\" . The album was met with success and sold 50,000 copies upon release.  His first full-length solo album, WWW was released on 29 October 2013. A single titled \\"Sunny Day\\" was released ahead of the album and topped the iTunes EP chart in Japan. A repackaged version of the album, WWW: Remove Makeup was subsequently released in January 2014 and included the title track \\"Heaven\\", a pop ballad with label-mate Gummy. To promote his first album, Kim embarked on his first Asia tour which traveled to regional countries like Japan, Taiwan and China.  His second solo album, No.X was released on 12 February 2016. It topped iTunes charts of 39 countries around the world upon its release, and was named the most popular K-pop album in China for 2016.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"Well, sweetie, this article talks about the life of a man named Kim Jae-joong.

Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget.  It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. According to the above context, answer the following question. What does the narrator probably think of dried foods? Pick from:  --That you can eat dried food as much as fresh food  --not enough information  --That you shouldn't buy dried food as much as fresh food  --That dried food is awful","output":"--That you shouldn't buy dried food as much as fresh food"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 2014, Tennessee saw a record number of visitors, with 100 million people visiting the state. The total tourism-related expenditure reached 17.7 billion, marking a 6.3% increase over the previous year, 2013. Consequently, the tax revenue generated from tourism in Tennessee amounted to 1.5 billion. This remarkable growth in tourism tax revenue can be attributed to numerous factors. Tennessee has a rich offering for tourists, including various famous tourist attractions, a vibrant music scene, and captivating historical sites. Cities such as Nashville, Memphis, and Knoxville contribute significantly to these figures, drawing tourists from all over the world. Moreover, Tennessee's picturesque landscapes and outdoor recreational opportunities, such as the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, have also been major attractions for visitors. Furthermore, the tourism sector's widespread impact on the state's economy is unmatched by many other industries. This sector creates jobs, boosts local businesses, and encourages cultural exchange – all essential components for a thriving community. In summary, tourism is an essential contributor to Tennessee's economy, and in 2014, the state saw significant financial returns from a record number of visitors spending 17.7 billion on tourism-related activities.

Critics lashed out Wednesday against the Federal Aviation Administration, which extended its ban on U.S. airlines' flights to and from Tel Aviv, Israel. Calling the decision a \\"mistake,\\" Michael Bloomberg -- who arrived in Israel on El Al, Israel's national airline -- praised Tel Aviv Ben Gurion International Airport as most secure airport on Earth. \\"The real world is that there are things going on near airports all over the world. Ben Gurion airport, because Israel has been threatened since it was formed in 1948, is the most secure airport,\\" the former New York mayor told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. \\"You have to take reasonable precautions but you cannot shut down everything just because one terrorist someplace on the other side of the world says I'm going to be a threat,\\" he said. The ban now runs through 12:15 p.m. ET Thursday. The FAA said it is \\"working closely with the government of Israel to review the significant new information they have provided and determine whether potential risks to U.S. civil aviation are mitigated so the agency can resolve concerns as quickly as possible.\\" The agency did not detail what the \\"significant new information\\" is. But the Israeli government told CNN that Ben Gurion is safe from any rocket attack by militants in Gaza. \\"The security in Ben Gurion and in Israel is as good as it gets,\\" said Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat. \\"The reality is that the risk coming to Israel is minimal, and if it would be larger we would take the initiative and tell everyone not to come here.\\" Hamas: 'Great victory for the resistance' The ban was enacted Tuesday after a rocket struck about a mile from the airport. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told CNN the military had tracked the rocket, as it does in general with those fired by militants from Gaza. Israel chose not to shoot the rocket down, knowing the airport would not be hit. \\"Any incoming rocket that would hit the airport ... would immediately be taken out by our system,\\" Regev said. Ben Gurion was still expecting 206 flights Wednesday despite cancellations from U.S. and some European airlines, Israel's Transport Ministry said. American Airlines, which owns US Airways, said it will consider resuming service to the Israeli airport once the FAA approves. Delta Air Lines said Tuesday it was suspending flights until further notice. German airline Lufthansa said that \\"based on an analysis of presently available information,\\" it will continue to suspend flights Thursday. The European Aviation Safety Agency recommended avoiding Ben Gurion on Tuesday. Air Canada canceled Wednesday night's flight to Tel Aviv, as well as its return on Thursday. The airline typically flies one flight a day from Toronto to Tel Aviv. But British Airways continued flying into Israel even after other airlines canceled. Hamas hailed the slowdown as a clear victory. \\"The resistance success in stopping the air traffic and isolating Israel from the world is a great victory for the resistance,\\" said spokesman Fawzi Barhoum. Bloomberg: Banning flights rewards Hamas. Bloomberg landed safely Wednesday and tweeted a photograph of himself sitting down with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyhu. \\"I just wanted to do something personally to show my support for standing up for what's right. I think Israel is doing that. Hamas is trying to kill the Palestinians and kill the Israelis and somebody's got to say that they've got to stop this,\\" he told CNN's Blitzer. The exchange grew heated when Blitzer asked about the State Department's travel advisory for Israel and the West Bank. \\"I think the State Department is just overreacting in typical bureaucratic fashion,\\" Bloomberg said. When asked whether he thought there were political reasons behind the advisory, Bloomberg replied: \\"By asking the question you're implying that our government does things for political reasons. ... Just the allegation against our government I personally take as an offense.\\" He praised Ben Gurion Airport as the best-protected such facility in the world. \\"The flight restrictions are a mistake that hand Hamas an undeserved victory and should be lifted immediately,\\" Bloomberg said late Tuesday. In an opinion column for Bloomberg View, part of the media company he owns, the former New York mayor compared his trip to Israel to the way he responded to terror threats in the city. Sometimes it's prudent to act out an abundance of caution during a crisis, he wrote. \\"But closing down access to major infrastructure networks in the face of terrorist threats can be self-defeating,\\" he said. The FAA said its decision was necessary due to the \\"potentially hazardous situation.\\" And after the shooting down last week of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine, some jittery travelers understand the FAA decision. \\"You have a rocket and you bring down 300 people at one shot,\\" one said. But it didn't stop her from boarding her El Al flight. The airport is a key economic artery for Israel. While more than 2,000 rockets have been fired into Israel from Gaza, 6,000 flights have landed and departed at Ben Gurion, the Civil Aviation Authority of Israel said. \\"It is not a miracle and not a trick,\\" the authority's director, Giora Romm, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. \\"We know how to defend Ben Gurion, period.\\" CNN analyst: Incident could bring diplomatic consequences. It's unusual for the FAA to prohibit U.S. carriers from flying to a particular airport, said Mary Schiavo, a former U.S. Department of Transportation inspector general. \\"In the past when the FAA has done it, there have been diplomatic consequences,\\" she said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry landed Wednesday at Ben Gurion on a mission to try to stop all hostilities. The airline suspensions didn't affect his flight because he traveled on a military plane. The flight suspensions have stranded some travelers in Tel Aviv. And others, who flew out on Israeli carriers, had to run for cover before takeoff when sirens went off at the airport. \\"You had to run for about a minute to get to shelter and just wait there for about 10 minutes,\\" a passenger arriving in New York from Tel Aviv told CNN affiliate NY1, describing what happened before the all-clear sounded. \\"It was nerve-racking, actually.\\" Rabbi Shalom Lewis, whose synagogue is in an Atlanta suburb, was stuck at Ben Gurion with a group of American travelers all looking for a way to get home to the United States. But none was running scared over missiles. \\"Every one of them was just aggravated by the inability to get home easily, but nobody was afraid,\\" Lewis told NY1. On Wednesday, the Transport Ministry ordered the opening of the small Uvda airport in the far southeast of Israel. Canceling flights to Israel is a serious blow to the country's economy, said Romm of the Civil Aviation Authority of Israel. Tourism is a major source of income. Last year, Israel received a record 3.5 million visitors, according to its Central Bureau of Statistics. Before the recent violence, the bureau reported a record 1.4 million visitors for the first half of 2014. The violence will likely put a damper on tourism.

Wanted for amassing a collection of photos and images numbering in the hundreds and suspected in a sex attack last year, authorities had Stanley Simms in their grasp, even questioning him while searching his home.But Simms, 47, of Sunrise, FL, simply walked away after cops searched his home, according to reports. Not seen since June 7, the day police seized his pornography-rich computer, he is also considered a suspect in a sexual assault investigation dating back to last year, officials said.“We want to get him off the streets,” Jim Marshall, spokesman at the FBI’s Miami division, told local media. On the run: The FBI is asking for the public's help in finding accused pedophile Stanley Simms, 47, of Sunrise, FL. The computer found by law enforcement during a June 7 search of Simms’ home held over 200 child pornography files, according to the Sun-Sentinal. It was originally found sharing both movies and pictures on a file-sharing network in September, the paper reported.Simms told investigators the files were downloaded by accident during a June 7 search of his home, according to the paper, which also reported the officials declined to comment this week on why Simms was allowed to leave his home later that afternoon without being arrested – despite a federal warrant being issued for his arrest that day. Federal officials also have questions for the accused pedophile about an incident in which a south Florida woman was allegedly drugged and sexually assaulted in December, the Miami Herald reported.Known to frequent ‘adult entertainment clubs’ in south Florida, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Simms is said to drive a green/gray BMW and/or a purple pickup truck. Pervert: Simms, seen here with a relative's young baby, was found by the FBI to be in possession of hundreds of child pornography files. ‘If there’s someone out there who has information on where [Simms] is, please call the FBI, call the local police. Don’t approach him yourself,’ Marshall’s statement continued. Attempts by Mail Online to reach the FBI’s Miami office were unsuccessful. This is not the first time the feds have asked for help tracking down a suspected pedophile.

John Doe: This man is wanted by officials for filming graphic sexual attacks on a young girl and sharing them online. Identified as ‘John Doe,’ the only leads investigators have to go on are a Frito-Lay Rold Gold thin pretzels bag seen in the videos and music equipment strewn all over the room where the depraved acts were filmed. Rold Gold pretzels are available only in the U.S. and Canada, and the packaging – in English – is seen only in the States, according to officials.Anyone with information regarding the whereabouts of Stanley Simms is urged to call the FBI’s Miami field office at (305) 944-9101. ICE also urges anyone with information about the identity or whereabouts of the the man to the right to call 1-866-347-2423 from the U.S. and Canada, or 1-802-872- 6199 from anywhere else in the world.","output":"A man named Stanley Simms from Florida had lots of bad pictures of kids on his computer.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Sequencing the human genome has increased our knowledge of genetic disorders. These are diseases caused by mutations. They may be caused by single gene mutations or the failure of chromosomes to separate correctly during meiosis.   Q: What causes genetic disorders?   A: Answer:","output":"Genetic disorders are caused by abnormalities or variations in an individual's DNA sequences, which result in the disruption of the normal functioning of specific genes or multiple genes. These abnormalities typically originate from mutations or errors that occur within the genetic material of the organism. The paragraph provided mentions two primary causes of genetic disorders: single gene mutations and chromosome segregation errors during meiosis. 1. Single gene mutations: Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence, which can either result from errors that occur naturally during the process of DNA replication or from external factors such as radiation or harmful chemicals. Single gene mutations occur when alterations take place in a specific gene. These mutations can be classified into three main types:    a. Point mutations: A point mutation arises when there is a change in a single nucleotide base within the DNA sequence. This can result in an amino-acid substitution in the protein, which may alter the protein's function or impair its ability to carry out its role in the body.        b. Insertions: This type of mutation involves the addition of extra nucleotide bases into the DNA sequence. Depending on where the insertion occurs, it can lead to a frameshift mutation, which affects the reading frame during the translation of the protein-coding region. Consequentially, this might result in the synthesis of a non-functional protein.        c. Deletions: Deletion mutations occur when one or more nucleotide bases are removed from the DNA sequence. Similar to insertions, the deletion of bases can lead to a frameshift mutation, causing an abnormal or non-functional protein.    2. Failure of chromosomes to separate correctly during meiosis: Meiosis is a form of cell division that produces sex cells, or gametes, such as sperm and eggs. During this process, the chromosome pairs normally segregate, ensuring that each gamete receives a complete set of chromosomes. Occasionally, errors might occur in this separation process, which can lead to the following:    a. Aneuploidy: This refers to an abnormal number of chromosomes in an individual's cells, in which the individual either has more or fewer chromosomes than the typical 46 (23 pairs) found in human cells. Aneuploidy can arise if chromosomes fail to separate appropriately during meiosis, leading to either the presence of an extra chromosome or the absence of a chromosome in the child. Examples of aneuploidy include Down syndrome (an extra copy of chromosome 21) and Turner syndrome (a missing or partially missing X chromosome in females).    b. Translocations: Chromosome translocation is a condition in which a segment from one chromosome becomes abnormally attached to another chromosome. Translocations can either be balanced (no genetic material is gained or lost) or unbalanced (genetic material is added or removed). Unbalanced translocations can lead to genetic disorders due to the disruption or loss of important genes. In summary, genetic disorders are primarily caused by single gene mutations (including point mutations, insertions, and deletions) and chromosomal abnormalities that emerge during meiosis (such as aneuploidy and chromosome translocations). These alterations and errors disrupt the genes' functions, affecting the individual's physical and/or cognitive development and leading to various health issues associated with genetic disorders."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the premise \\"A man and a woman walk through the street during a parade.\\" true if \\"A couple walk home\\"?","output":"It is not possible to definitively confirm if the premise \\"A man and a woman walk through the street during a parade\\" is true when given the statement \\"A couple walk home.\\" To understand why this uncertainty exists, let's dive deeper into the context and possibilities in each scenario. Premise: \\"A man and a woman walk through the street during a parade.\\" In this situation, the focus is on a man and a woman walking together during a parade. There are multiple scenarios to consider when analyzing this premise: 1. The man and woman are together, as a couple, participating in or observing the parade. 2. The man and woman are not together but just happen to be going in the same direction during the parade. 3. The man and woman are friends, coworkers, or acquaintances attending the parade together but not romantically involved. 4. The man and woman are strangers who randomly and temporarily walk side-by-side during the parade, purely coincidental. The provided statement: \\"A couple walk home.\\" In this statement, a couple is walking home together. There are a few possible scenarios to consider: 1. The couple attended an event (e.g. a party, dinner, parade, etc.) together and are now walking home. 2. The couple met up somewhere and decided to walk home together. 3. The two people in the couple live nearby or share a home, and they are heading to that common destination. When comparing the premise and the provided statement, the element of uncertainty arises from the lack of specificity in the statement as well as the premise. The statement of \\"A couple walk home\\" does not clarify if the couple came from a specific event, like the parade, or if they were walking through the street together at the time. They could have been anywhere prior to walking home, and there's no context provided regarding their previous location or activity. Similarly, the premise does not specify if the man and woman are indeed a couple or just happened to be walking through the street together. They might be part of the couple mentioned in the statement, or they could be unrelated individuals with no connection to the couple going home. In conclusion, based on the available information, we cannot accurately determine if the premise \\"A man and a woman walk through the street during a parade\\" is true when given the statement \\"A couple walk home.\\" Further context, details, and clarification are needed to confirm or refute the veracity of the premise based on the provided statement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Every autumn, as families across the United States get ready to send their kids to college, the economics of higher education receive renewed attention. College is expensive and becoming more so in the U. S. The situation raises two questions: Why does it cost so much, and how can students and their families afford it? Several studies published in the past few weeks reflect on these questions. The findings provide comfort to poor families. First, it appears that only the minority actually pay the \\"high price\\". A study by the US Education Department's National Center for Education Statistics found that 55 percent of college students last year received some forms of help--scholarships, loans or jobs. Other factors are also at work. The government has increased the size of its grants  to lower-income students. Grants, unlike loans, don't have to he repaid and are awarded only to college students who have not earned a bachelor's or professional degree. At the same time, most colleges are spending more on undergraduate education than they are collecting in tuition fees. A study, which is part of the Williams College Project on the Economics of Higher Education, reaches the conclusion that on average colleges \\"subsidize  \\" their students. The results of these studies, however, leave unanswered the questions of whether educational costs are higher than they need to be. Some experts argue that much of the college cost results from educational competition for fame, students and facilities. This puts upward pressure on tuition, hut many colleges feel that good fame will enable them to attract students even if they charge them more. Therefore, until something important changes in the marketplace, costs seem likely to continue rising. And American families will continue to beat down the doors of the high price \\"college in the end. Question: The writer of this passage seems to hold the opinion that   _  .

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the name of the person who applied to the High Court?  The sessions were interrupted by the escalating disagreement between Waters and Pink Floyd over who had the rights to the Pink Floyd name. O'Rourke, believing that his contract with Waters had been terminated illegally, sued Waters for £25,000 of back-commission. In a late-1986 board meeting of Pink Floyd Music Ltd (Pink Floyd's clearing house for all financial transactions since 1973), Waters learnt that a bank account had been opened to deal exclusively with all monies related to \\"the new Pink Floyd project\\". He immediately applied to the High Court to prevent the Pink Floyd name from being used again, but his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed. Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to gain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour's team responded by issuing a press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist; however, Gilmour told a Sunday Times reporter: \\"Roger is a dog in the manger and I'm going to fight him, no one else has claimed Pink Floyd was entirely them. Anybody who does is extremely arrogant.\\"Waters twice visited Astoria, and with his wife had a meeting in August 1986 with Ezrin; Ezrin later suggested that he was being \\"checked out\\". As Waters was still a shareholder and director of Pink Floyd Music, he was able to block any decisions made by his former bandmates. Recording moved to Mayfair Studios in February 1987, and from February to March – under the terms of an agreement with Ezrin to record close to his home – to A&M Studios in Los Angeles: \\"It was fantastic because ... the lawyers couldn't call in the middle of recording unless they were calling in the middle of the night.\\" The bitterness of the row between Waters and Pink Floyd was covered in a November 1987 issue of Rolling Stone, which became the magazine's best-selling issue of that year.

When evaluating whether this phrase would be considered positive or negative, it is essential to consider these factors. 1. Context: When used to describe someone's actions, words, or behavior, \\"cheeky\\" could be intended as a compliment if it is highlighting the person's wit, playfulness, or charm. In such cases, it would be considered positive. On the other hand, if \\"cheeky\\" is used to criticize someone's rudeness, disrespect, or inappropriateness, it would have a negative connotation. For example: Positive: \\"Her cheeky sense of humor always makes me laugh.\\" Negative: \\"His cheeky remarks during the meeting were out of line.\\" 2. Tone of the speaker: The tone with which the phrase \\"cheeky\\" is said also greatly influences how it is perceived. If it is said in a lighthearted, playful, or affectionate tone, it is more likely to be considered positive. However, if it is said in a dismissive, angry, or disapproving tone, it could be seen as negative. 3. Cultural background: Different cultures may interpret \\"cheeky\\" differently based on cultural norms and values. In some cultures, being cheeky is seen as a sign of quick wit, intelligence, and creativity; thus, the phrase would be taken positively. In contrast, other cultures may view cheekiness as impolite, impudent, or lacking in respect, and so it would be regarded as negative. In summary, the phrase \\"cheeky\\" can be seen as both positive and negative, depending on various factors such as context, tone, and cultural background. To better understand whether the phrase is meant to be positive or negative, it's essential to consider the entire conversation and individual backgrounds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mary scoffed at Jane's new hat, but was jealous of Jane's new watch, because Mary yearned for the  Options: (1). hat .; (2). watch .;","output":"(2). watch .; Mary tried to suppress her envy as she stared at the beautiful silver watch that adorned Jane's wrist. The delicate hands of the watch seemed to be elegantly capturing each passing second, only increasing Mary's desire for it. The hat, on the other hand, seemed like a flimsy, gaudy piece of headwear; its unremarkable design and plainness did not trigger any envy. A few days later, the two friends were at the local coffee shop, deep in conversation. Mary couldn't help but keep glancing at Jane's watch, wondering how her friend had been able to afford such an exquisite timepiece. Perceiving her friend's infatuation with the watch, Jane confided in Mary about a recent windfall, explaining that she had received a substantial inheritance from a distant relative she barely knew. This sudden wealth had enabled her to buy the stunning timekeeping accessory that gleamed so brightly on her wrist. Mary tried her best to offer her congratulations and admiration; however, a seed of jealousy had started growing inside her, threatening to strangle their friendship. Not only did Mary still crave the watch, but she also felt a burning desire for a windfall of her own. In the days that followed, she became increasingly distant, engrossed in thoughts of how she could get her hands on a similar watch and what she would do with newfound fortune like Jane's. As the weeks passed by, Mary noticed that Jane was sporting additional luxurious items, such as designer clothes, shoes, and even a new car. These material possessions only heightened her covetousness and widened the rift between them. She started spending time researching online for that perfect watch but couldn't find one that wouldn't break the bank. In a desperate attempt to satisfy her own hunger for material possessions, Mary became obsessed—she started visiting pawnshops and online sites, hoping to find a valuable item like Jane's watch or a piece of jewelry she could acquire at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately, this relentless quest led her further away from her friend and deeper into her obsession. One day, while scouring a quaint pawnshop on the outskirts of town, Mary finally discovered a stunning gold watch that appeared to be just within her budget. Without giving it a second thought, she immediately purchased it, feeling a sense of accomplishment and personal satisfaction. She couldn't wait to show off her own beautiful watch to Jane and let her see that she too could enjoy the finer things in life. However, the next time Mary and Jane met, their friendship had visibly soured. Their conversations were laden with jealousy and a taste of superficiality. Jane's once-genuine smile was replaced with a forced, reluctant grin, and Mary's warm laughter now contained a subtle hint of scorn. But when Jane caught a glimpse of Mary's new watch, she surprised her by complimenting it, confessing that it was even more attractive than her own. But before they could rekindle their friendship, Mary learned that her watch, though beautiful, was counterfeit and virtually worthless. In her pursuit to outshine Jane, she'd unknowingly sacrificed her hard-earned savings, and worse, her dear friendship. Over time, Mary came to realize that her obsession with Jane's watch and newfound wealth only served to corrupt her values and poison their friendship. In chasing after the shimmer of material objects, she had lost sight of the genuine, simple joy of honest camaraderie and the pleasures of shared experiences. And so, with remorse and a heavy heart, she decided to shed her futile longing for material possessions and renew her appreciation for the more profound treasures in life: love, friendship, and the passage of time – beautifully and sadly – symbolized by the very watch that had once captured her imagination and started this tale."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The tiebreaker race is scheduled for one week later at the (fictional) Los Angeles International Speedway in California. Lightning is desperate to win the race, since it would not only make him the first rookie to win a championship, but also allow him to leave the unglamorous sponsorship of Rust-Eze and allow him to take The King's place as the sponsored car of the lucrative Dinoco team. Eager to start practice in California as soon as possible, he pushes his big rig, Mack, to travel all night long. While McQueen is sleeping, the exhausted Mack drifts off and is startled by a gang of four reckless street racers, causing McQueen to fall out the back of the trailer and onto the road. McQueen wakes in the middle of traffic and speeds off the highway to find Mack, only to end up in the run-down desert town of Radiator Springs, while inadvertently ruining the pavement of its main road. After being arrested and impounded overnight (while guarded by a rusty, but friendly, tow truck named Mater), McQueen is ordered by the town judge, Doc Hudson, to leave town immediately.

The","output":"decision to adopt rather than purchase stemmed from both ethical and practical reasons, as Gator recognized the importance of giving a loving home to an abandoned or rescued puppy in need, while also supporting the hardworking rescue organizations that focus on animal welfare. Moreover, Gator understood that adopting a puppy from a shelter could potentially decrease the demand for puppies bred in inhumane and overcrowded conditions, commonly found in puppy mills and unregulated breeding facilities.

This invaluable assistance would ensure that Gator and their new companion could enjoy a rewarding and fulfilling relationship, built on trust, mutual understanding, and compassion. Finally, Gator appreciated that the adoption process includes crucial veterinary support, such as initial vaccinations, spaying or neutering, and microchipping, allowing for a smooth transition into their new life together and minimizing any potential health issues or concerns.

News article: Former South African Olympic and Paralympic athlete sentenced after shooting dead his girlfriend at his home      Oscar Pistorius, the South African Olympic and Paralympic athlete who killed his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, by firing four bullets through a closed toilet door, has been sentenced to a lower than expected six years in prison.      Oscar Pistorius is sentenced for murder of Reeva Steenkamp – live Read more      The sentence, given by Judge Thokozile Masipa in the high court in Pretoria, may be the final chapter in a story that attracted intense worldwide attention.      Pistorius, who gained global fame when he reached the semi-finals of the 200m sprint at the 2012 Olympics in London, was taken down to cells immediately after the sentencing at 10.30am on Wednesday.      The former athlete showed little emotion, but looked relieved. His family made no immediate statement.      The sentence was much lower than many had expected and public prosectors had demanded the mandatory minimum for murder of 15 years.            Andrew Fawcett, a defence lawyer, said: “We respect the decision of Judge Masipa and from a defence perspective we will not be making any application [to appeal].”            Public prosecutors may decide to challenge the sentence but supporters of the Steenkamps said “the law has run its course”.

Photograph: Mike Hutchings/Reuters      “There is nothing [the family] can do about the sentence. Nothing will bring Reeva back. The best thing to do is to maintain a dignified silence,” said Doup De Bruyn, a lawyer who has represented the family.            Anneliese Burgess, a spokesperson for the Pistorius family, said the trial had been a “long, drawn out process” and considered the case over.      “To a certain extent there is relief that this is the last chapter, that they won’t be coming back,” she told reporters outside the courthouse.      Carl Pistorius, brother of the former athlete, said on Twitter that the family had “the utmost respect” for Masipa.

The truth will always prevail. #justice      Campaigners for women’s rights in South Africa expressed disappointment.      “The judgment is an insult to women. It sends the wrong message,” said Jacqui Mofokeng of the African National Congress women’s league, who has attended much of the trial and was in court on Wednesday.            Pistorius, 29, was initially convicted of culpable homicide and sentenced to five years in prison for shooting Reeva Steenkamp, a law graduate and model, at his home on Valentine’s Day 2013.

Photograph: Gallo Images/Rex Shutterstock      After an appeal by state prosecutors he was convicted of murder last year, a crime which carries a mandatory sentence of 15 years.      Pistorius arrived for court looking anxious but healthier than during the hearings last month. He hugged members of his legal team and his family. Relatives of Pistorius and those of his victim filled a bench along the front of the courtroom.      Prosecutors had called for the mandatory minimum, saying that a message needed to be sent in a country with extremely high levels of violent crime, often involving firearms. Defence lawyers had argued that a non-custodial sentence – such as community service – would be most appropriate.      In an hour-long judgment, Masipa said the evidence she had heard convinced her Pistorius was “not a violent person”, was unlikely to reoffend and had shown remorse.      The judge said she had to balance the interests of society, the accused and relatives of the victim.      Pistorius, she said, was “a fallen hero, who has lost his career, and been ruined financially. He cannot be at peace.”      She also stressed that a court should not be swayed by public opinion but that punishment must also reflect the seriousness of the offence. It should be “unpleasant, uncomfortable and painful”.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Judge Thokozile Masipa said she had to balance the interests of society, the accused and relatives of the victim. Photograph: Rex      Under South African law, Pistorius, who has been living in his uncle’s large home in a suburb of Pretoria, would be eligible for parole long before the end of the sentence.      Pistorius, who became the first double-leg amputee to participate in the Olympics in 2012, was a hero to many in South Africa and across the world. He landed a series of lucrative sponsorship deals with leading brands, and was labelled the “blade runner”, a reference to the carbon fibre prosthetics he used to compete.      But the fairytale story of tenacity and talent overcoming disability ended abruptly in the early hours of 14 February 2013, when Pistorius, whose lower legs were amputated when he was 11 months old, shot Steenkamp dead with a 9mm handgun.      In court on Wednesday, Masipa described Steenkamp as “young, vivacious, full of life and hopes for the future”.      “It is clear from the evidence the Steenkamps have a very close bond,” she said.      Pistorius has always denied deliberately shooting Steenkamp, claiming that he believed a burglar was hiding in the toilet in his home. Prosecutors said he killed Steenkamp in a jealous rage.      Masipa said she accepted the defence version of events but stressed that “murder is always a very serious crime … the fact that the accused thought it was an intruder does not make it any less serious”.      The trial revealed a different and much darker side to Pistorius: a taste for fast cars and guns – and a short temper.      His defence lawyers argued that, though a hero to many, the truth was that the athlete was a deeply anxious man.      On the third and final day of the sentencing hearing last month, Pistorius removed his prosthetics to hobble on his stumps across the courtroom to demonstrate his physical vulnerability.      Barry Roux, who led the team representing the former athlete, argued he should not return to jail on account of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression and called a clinical psychologist as a witness who told the court Pistorius was a “broken man” who has “left his fate up to God”.      “[In 2014 I saw two Oscars … one was this super-Olympian, very successful, who seemed totally in control and even physically tall with his prostheses. Then there was the other [Oscar] without his prostheses who was a vulnerable, anxious man. More recently, I saw a third Oscar that really has almost given up. His spirit seems broken. I believe he is quite ill. If he was my patient, I would admit him to hospital,” Prof Jonathan Scholtz told the court.            Facebook Twitter Pinterest Reeva Steenkamp’s parents June and Barry Steenkamp react after the sentencing. Photograph: Masi Losi/AFP/Getty Images      But, in emotional testimony, Barry Steenkamp, the 73-year-old father of the victim, called for Pistorius to “pay for his crime”.      With his hands shaking and voice trembling, Steenkamp described the moment he learned of his daughter’s death and the intense pain of bereavement.      “Ever since Reeva’s death I have spent my time on my veranda, at two or three in the morning. I smoke my cigarettes. I think of Reeva every day, every day of my life, morning, noon and night … I talk to her every day in my head … my daughter,” he said.      During the sentencing hearing Gerrie Nel, leading the prosecution team, told Masipa any sentence needed to consider the needs of the broader community and send a strong message to deter violent crime.      “I cannot think of a more excessive use of a firearm than … firing four shots through that doorway,” said Nel, whose belligerent style has attracted both praise and criticism. “Murder remains the most reprehensible crime … Society demands that appropriate sentences be imposed.”      The killing and the trial also held a mirror to South Africa more than 20 years after the end of apartheid and the coming of democracy amid widespread disillusionment at a perceived failure to achieve the lofty goals of that time.      “In the same way that [Nelson] Mandela was the symbol of the country in the glorious years of generosity and pragmatism and all those good things, Pistorius … was a national icon of whom everyone was proud. His cataclysmic fall was a metaphor for broader disappointed dreams,” John Carlin, who attended the trial and is the author of a book on the former athlete, told the Guardian last month.             ||||| Oscar Pistorius, left, arrives inside the High Court in Pretoria, South Africa, Wednesday, July 6, 2016. A South African judge is expected to announce Pistorius' sentence for murdering girlfriend Reeva... (Associated Press)      PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) — Oscar Pistorius was sentenced to six years in prison Wednesday for the murder of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, with the judge who decided the punishment calling the double-amputee Olympian a \\"fallen hero.\\"      South Africa's minimum sentence for murder is 15 years but the judge said \\"substantial and compelling circumstances\\" existed to give Pistorius a lesser sentence for shooting Steenkamp at his home in 2013.      Judge Thokozile Masipa described Pistorius as a \\"good candidate for rehabilitation.\\"      Pistorius was asked to stand and face Judge Masipa as she announced his sentence in a courtroom in the South African capital, Pretoria. He was calm after the sentence was announced, embracing his aunt and tearful sister before being led down a courtroom staircase to a holding cell.      Steenkamp's parents, Barry and June, were also present in the courtroom, which was packed with relatives of both Pistorius and Steenkamp, journalists and other observers.      After announcing Pistorius' sentence, the judge ordered a recess to give prosecutors and Pistorius' defense lawyers time to decide they want to appeal the sentence. It was not immediately clear if either would.      Prosecutors had sought at least 15 years in prison for the 29-year-old Pistorius. His defense lawyers had asked for no jail time at all for the athlete, and asked that he be allowed to do charity work with children.      The sentencing is the latest act of a three-and-a-half year legal drama that has often played out on live television and shown the fall from grace of a runner once viewed as an inspiration to many for overcoming his disability. Pistorius had both legs amputated below the knees when he was 11 months old because of a congenital defect.      He made history by running at the 2012 Olympics on his carbon-fiber running blades, and was one of the world's most recognizable athletes.      Pistorius killed Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model and reality TV star, in the pre-dawn hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting her multiple times through a toilet cubicle door in his home. Pistorius maintained he killed Steenkamp by mistake thinking she was an intruder hiding in the bathroom.      Prosecutors charged that he killed her intentionally after the couple argued.      In 2014, Pistorius was acquitted of murder by Masipa following a dramatic seven-month trial. He was instead convicted of manslaughter and served one year in prison.      His conviction was upgraded to murder last year when prosecutors appealed to South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal.      ___      Imray reported from Somerset West, South Africa. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Oscar Pistorius, the South African Paralympian who killed his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, in 2013, has been sentenced to six years in prison for murder.

Question: Given the below context:  Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United...  Guess a valid title for it!

He became prime minister in 2006 but resigned three years later when police recommended charges against him. The 71-year-old is currently being investigated by the state attorney's office over suspicions he smuggled a chapter of a book he is writing out of prison, raising fears that it might compromise national security. The parole board said Olmert had been \\"punished for his deeds and paid a heavy price\\", according to AFP news agency. \\"The inmate underwent a significant rehabilitation process in prison and displays motivation to continue it,\\" the board added. The board said Olmert's behaviour had been largely \\"impeccable\\". Last week, Olmert was taken to hospital after complaining of chest pains. But he was given the all-clear and returned to prison a few days later. A leaked picture of Olmert in a hospital gown looking gaunt circulated on social media, leading to calls for leniency, including from Education Minister Naftali Bennett. In 2014, Olmert was convicted of bribery in connection with a property development when he was mayor of Jerusalem between 1993 and 2003.

Output:","output":"1, 2, 4, 5 Explanation: <1> If the temperature is increased at constant pressure, the reaction will shift to where more moles will be produced.

This option is incorrect. <4> If a gas that participates in the reaction is added, the reaction will shift to where more gas is produced to counteract the increase in pressure. <5> If the temperature is decreased, the reaction will shift to where the reaction is exothermic, as the system will want to generate more heat to counteract the loss of temperature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

With its many international releases, the film had additional English titles of \\"Pray to Kill and Return Alive\\", \\"To Kill a Jackal\\", and \\"Renegade Gun\\". The script by Adriano Bolzoni is inspired by American noir-crime films of the 1930s and 1940s, and Kinski's entry into the scene reprises Edward G. Robinson's presence in \\"Key Largo\\" (1948).  - Klaus Kinski (born Klaus Günter Karl Nakszynski; 18 October 1926  23 November 1991) was a German actor. He appeared in more than 130 films, and was a leading role actor in the films of Werner Herzog, including \\"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\\" (1972), \\"Nosferatu the Vampyre\\" (1979), \\"Woyzeck\\" (1979), \\"Fitzcarraldo\\" (1982), and \\"Cobra Verde\\" (1987). He also appeared in many Spaghetti Westerns, such as \\"For a Few Dollars More\\" (1965), \\"A Bullet for the General\\" (1966), \\"The Great Silence\\" (1968), \\"And God Said to Cain\\" (1970), \\"Shoot the Living and Pray for the Dead\\" (1971) and \\"A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe\\" (1975). A controversial figure in Germany, some of Kinski's violent outbursts on set were filmed in Herzog's documentary \\"My Best Fiend\\".  - For a Few Dollars More is a 1965 Italian Spaghetti Western film directed by Sergio Leone and starring Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Gian Maria Volontè. German actor Klaus Kinski also plays a supporting role as a secondary villain. The film was released in the United States in 1967 and is the second part of what is commonly known as the \\"Dollars Trilogy\\", following \\"A Fistful of Dollars\\" and preceding \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\".  - Aguirre, the Wrath of God, known in the UK as Aguirre, Wrath of God, is a 1972 West German epic film written and directed by Werner Herzog. Klaus Kinski stars in the title role. The soundtrack was composed and performed by West German progressive/Krautrock band Popol Vuh. The story follows the travels of Spanish soldier Lope de Aguirre, who leads a group of conquistadores down the Orinoco and Amazon River in South America in search of the legendary city of gold, El Dorado. Using a minimalist story and dialogue, the film creates a vision of madness and folly, counterpointed by the lush but unforgiving Amazonian jungle. Although based loosely on what is known of the historical figure of Aguirre, the film's storyline is, as Herzog acknowledged years after the film's release, a work of imagination. Some of the people and situations may have been inspired by Gaspar de Carvajal's account of an earlier Amazonian expedition, although Carvajal was not on the historical voyage represented in the film. Other accounts state that the expedition went into the jungles but never returned to civilization.  - And God Said to Cain is a 1970 Italian Western film directed by Antonio Margheriti and starring Klaus Kinski.  - Nosferatu the Vampyre is a 1979 West German art house vampire horror film written and directed by Werner Herzog. Its original German title is Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht (\\"Nosferatu: Phantom of the Night\\"). The film is set primarily in 19th-century Wismar, Germany and Transylvania, and was conceived as a stylistic remake of the 1922 German \\"Dracula\\" adaptation \\"Nosferatu\\". It stars Klaus Kinski as Count Dracula, Isabelle Adjani as Lucy Harker, Bruno Ganz as Jonathan Harker, and French artist-writer Roland Topor as Renfield.

To be well disciplined is to have learned to live in accordance with the sensible rules and regulations that society has set up for the behavior of its members. Unless the child learns from each disciplinary situation how better to govern his conduct, effective discipline has not been developed. Parents must accept for themselves the idea that successful discipline results in learning. When they approach situations in which a child must adapt themselves to demands made upon them as learning situations, many problems usually thought of in connection with discipline disappear. Unfortunately, the word discipline has come to have other less constructive meanings. Far too often discipline is thought of as punishment. To many people, to discipline a child means to spank him or use some other method of punishment. Such people consider discipline a way of either keeping a child from doing something or of forcing him to do something. It is the task of parents to build within themselves and within the children with whom they live this capacity for self-direction, based upon an understanding of what is required of individuals in a democratic society. This means learning to act in those ways known to be necessary for the \\"good life\\", not for one's self alone but also for others. Developing the capacity for self-discipline in a child is a long, slow process. Much patience is required on the part of the parents. During this development, it is important that the child's self- confidence and comfortable acceptance of himself should never be sacrificed in a disciplinary battle; instead it should be increased through the ways in which his parents meet disciplinary situations. Many parents show a good deal of impatience if the little child does not rapidly learn how to keep clean, eat well, be orderly, and do what he is told. They are so eager for him to achieve these things that they seem to try to push him rapidly through his baby period. They seem also to think that learning to do these things...

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"While the two questions seem similar in the sense that they both deal with the process of moving on from a person or relationship, they do possess different nuances and implications. Let's break down each question and provide detailed answers to better understand the differences. 1. How do I get unhooked from somebody? The term \\"unhooked\\" implies a sense of detachment from someone with whom you might be emotionally, mentally, or physically connected. This could be a romantic partner, a friend, or even a harmful influence in your life. The objective is to remove their presence or influence in your day-to-day life. Here are some ways you can work through this process: a. Self-awareness: Recognize the negative impact this person or relationship has on your life. Be honest with yourself about why you are seeking to distance yourself from them. b. Establish boundaries: Set clear and firm limits regarding communication or interaction with this person, which could include reducing or eliminating in-person meetings, phone calls, or digital interactions. c. Seek support: Reach out to trusted friends, family members, or a professional therapist to help you work through and manage your emotions related to this relationship. d. Focus on personal growth: Engage in activities that contribute to your self-improvement, such as taking up a new hobby, learning a new skill, or seeking out new friendships. e. Time and patience: Allow yourself time to adjust to the new boundaries and keep reminding yourself of the reasons for creating distance. It's natural for the process to take time and involve some emotional fluctuations. 2. How do I get over somebody? The phrase \\"get over\\" typically refers to recovering emotionally from a romantic or platonic relationship's ending or termination. In this case, the focus is on healing from the loss and moving forward with your life. Here are some steps to help you in this process: a. Acceptance: Acknowledge that the relationship has ended and allow yourself to feel the emotions that come with it. It's crucial to let yourself grieve and process this loss. b. Cut contact: While every situation is different, it is often helpful to reduce or eliminate contact with this person initially. This distance will enable you to focus on healing without the constant reminder of what once was. c. Surround yourself with support: Reach out to friends, family members, or professional therapists, as they can offer comfort, perspective, and advice during the healing process. d. Redirect your focus: Engage in new activities to help shift your attention away from the past relationship. This could include joining clubs or groups, learning new skills, or dedicating time to self-improvement. e. Forgive and learn: Understand that every relationship teaches us valuable lessons. Reflect on your experiences, learn from them, and apply these insights to future relationships. In summary, while the two questions might seem like paraphrases of one another, they address different aspects of moving on from a relationship. The first question explores ways to detach from someone to create a healthier life, while the second question emphasizes the healing process and emotional recovery after the end of a relationship. Nonetheless, both questions involve establishing boundaries, seeking support, and focusing on personal growth."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the premise, we are given the following information: \\"A man in a uniform playing with a black dog.\\" The key components of this statement include a man, a uniform, a black dog, and the action of playing. The man is specifically described as being in a uniform, and the dog is described as being black.  Now, let us examine the hypothesis: \\"Man playing with dog.\\" The hypothesis consists of a man and a dog interacting with each other, specifically through the action of playing. No description about the man or the dog is mentioned in the hypothesis. Comparing the premise and the hypothesis, we notice that both involve a man and a dog engaging in play. The premise elaborates on the context by providing more specific details such as the man's uniform and the dog's color, but these are not necessary for the broader hypothesis to hold true. As long as there is a man and a dog interacting playfully, the hypothesis is valid. Based on the given information, the premise confirms the hypothesis to be true. Both statements focus on the same main idea (a man playing with a dog), with the premise simply adding more specificity.

This option takes into account the initial strangeness of the situation. 2. Very amused: If Lee has a good sense of humor, she might find it amusing that her child is starting to sound like her. This option assumes that Lee can find humor in the situation and is not bothered by it. 3. They are like Lee: This is an observation, and not a direct answer to how Lee would feel. If Lee is proud of her own personality and characteristics, she may feel happy that Ash is displaying similar traits. This option focuses on the similarities between the two and considers a positive reaction from Lee. Based on the context and analyzing each option, I would say a possible answer to how Lee would feel as a result of Ash starting to sound like her is: Answer: Very amused.

What is the lightest solid element????","output":"The lightest solid element is Lithium (Li), which holds the third position on the periodic table of elements. It has an atomic number of 3 and an atomic weight of 6.939 amu (atomic mass units). Lithium belongs to the alkali metal group, and is the lightest member of this group. Discovered in 1817 by Johan August Arfwedson, the name \\"lithium\\" is derived from the Greek word \\"lithos,\\" meaning \\"stone.\\" Lithium is a soft, silver-white metal with a low density, making it the lightest solid element. In its pure form, it has a density of 0.534 grams per cubic centimeter, which is less than half of the density of water. Due to its high reactivity, lithium is not found freely in nature. Instead, it exists in compounds such as spodumene and lepidolite in the Earth's crust or as lithium salts in various water sources. Lithium has several attractive qualities, such as its high specific heat capacity, which allows it to absorb a significant amount of thermal energy with minimal temperature increase. This property is useful for various applications, such as thermal energy storage and temperature regulation. In addition, lithium is highly conductive, making it an excellent choice for use in the electronics industry—particularly for lithium-ion batteries, which power devices like smartphones, laptops, and electric vehicles. In recent years, the demand for lithium has grown rapidly due to its use in modern technology. The element also has several other applications, such as in alloys for aircraft manufacturing and as a medication (lithium carbonate) to stabilize mood swings in individuals with bipolar disorder. In summary, lithium is the lightest solid element on the periodic table. It is characterized by its low density, high reactivity, and various useful properties across a range of industries, including energy, technology, and medicine."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Stretching east-northeast from New York Harbor into the Atlantic Ocean, the island comprises four counties: Kings and Queens (which comprise the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, respectively) to the west; then Nassau and Suffolk to the east. However, many people in the New York metropolitan area (even those living in Brooklyn and Queens) colloquially use the term \\"Long Island\\" (or \\"The Island\\") exclusively to refer to the NassauSuffolk county area collectively, which is mainly suburban in character. More generally, \\"Long Island\\" may also refer collectively both to the main Island as well as its nearby, surrounding outer barrier islands.

QUEBEC CITY, CANADA — On the eve of the G-7 summit in Canada, the U.S. president lashed out at host Justin Trudeau and the White House announced Donald Trump would skip some of the sessions. In two tweets Thursday evening, Trump accused the Canadian prime minister, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron, of “charging the U.S. massive tariffs” and creating “non-monetary barriers.” Trump also said Trudeau was being “indignant” about the cross-border trade relationship. Later Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter again to urge the European Union and Canada to “Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!” Trump’s tweets came after Macron threatened to exclude the United States from the G-7 final statement to be issued in the mountainous tourism destination of Charlevoix. In his own tweets in French and English, Macron stated that while Trump “may not mind being isolated” the other six leaders meeting in Canada would also not mind signing an agreement among themselves. “American jobs are on the line because of his actions and because of his administration,” Trudeau said at a joint news conference with Macron earlier in the day in Ottawa. “When we can underscore this, and we see that there’s a lot of pressure within the U.S., perhaps he will revise his position.” “A trade war doesn’t spare anyone,” Macron said. “It will start to hurt American workers. The cost of raw materials will rise and industry will become less competitive.” After the contentious salvos on social media and the Trudeau-Macron news conference, the White House announced Trump would depart the summit at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, following the session on women’s empowerment. \\"The president will travel directly to Singapore from Canada in anticipation of his upcoming meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un Tuesday.

The Moon thus tends to \\"stretch\\" the Earth slightly along the line connecting the two bodies. The solid Earth deforms a bit, but ocean water, being fluid, is free to move much more in response to the tidal force, particularly horizontally.  As the Earth rotates, the magnitude and direction of the tidal force at any particular point on the Earth's surface change constantly; although the ocean never reaches equilibrium—there is never time for the fluid to \\"catch up\\" to the state it would eventually reach if the tidal force were constant—the changing tidal force nonetheless causes rhythmic changes in sea surface height.  Paragraph: Mike was reading about an instrument that could measure gravity, gravimeter. He then found how gravimeter was used to measure the gravitational field of the Moon. He read about two distinct cases where the Moon's gravitational field was measured on earth, side A and side B. In side A the Moon's gravity was measured from the side where the Earth was facing the Moon. And in side B the Moon's gravitational field was measured from the opposite side of the Earth. He found these two locations showed very different consequences of Moon's gravitational field.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: On which side the Moon's gravitational field would exert weaker force, side A side B?

Q: WASHINGTON — Republicans in the U.S. House of Representative plan to hold a vote next week on an immigration bill despite Trump urging them Friday to abandon efforts to pass legislation until after the mid-term elections. Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage. Earlier in the week, the president had called for Congress to quickly approve sweeping immigration legislation. But in a Friday tweet the president said, \\"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!\\" Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican representing a majority Hispanic district in the state of Florida, who is not running for re-election, termed the president's tweets \\"schizoid policy making.\\" Another retiring lawmaker, Republican Congressman Mark Sanford of South Carolina, a frequent Trump critic who recently lost his primary election, said Trump's reversal sends \\"a horrifically chilling signal\\" that \\"makes immigration reform that much more unlikely.\\" On Saturday, California Democratic Senator Kamala Harris spoke in Otay Mesa, a community in San Diego, at a rally for revised immigration policies. \\"This is a fight born out of knowing who we are and fighting for the ideals of our country,\\" she said. Harris spoke after touring a detention facility and speaking with several mothers.​ Trump's call for Congress to postpone action came as House Republican leaders failed to garner enough support for two bills that would overhaul U.S. immigration laws and bolster border security. A hard-line measure authored by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte failed to pass on... According to the above context, answer the following question. Why did the President want to wait for approval? A:","output":"The President wanted to wait for approval on immigration legislation because he believed that Republicans should stop wasting their time on the issue until after the mid-term elections in November. In his tweet, Trump suggested that Democrats were playing games and had no intention of resolving the immigration issue.

On to the Twentieth Century: The British extended their control over the peninsula by putting together the whole panoply of colonial administration — civil service, public works, judiciary force, police force, post office, education, and land regulation — with teams of British administrators, teachers, engineers, and doctors to go with it. At the same time, the tin industry, dominated by Chinese using labor-intensive methods in the 19th century, passed increasingly into Western hands, who employed the modern technology of gravel pumps and mining dredges. Petroleum had been found in northern Borneo, at Miri, and in Brunei, and the Anglo-Dutch Shell company used Singapore as its regional depot for its oil supplies and exports. But the major breakthrough for the Malay economy was the triumph of rubber, when Singapore's new garden director, Henry Ridle (\\"Rubber Ridley\\" to his friends, \\"Mad Ridley\\" to all doubting Thomases) had developed new planting and tapping methods and painstakingly spread his faith in rubber around the peninsula. World demand increased with the growth of the motor-car and electrical industries, and sky-rocketed during World War I. By 1920, Malaya was producing 53 percent of the world's rubber, which had overtaken tin as its main source of income. The Malay ruling class again took a back seat. Together with effective control of the rubber and tin industries, the British now firmly held the reins of government. The sultans were left in charge of local and religious affairs, content with their prestige, prosperity, and security. The census of 1931 served as an alarm signal for the Malay national consciousness. Bolstered by a new influx of immigrants to meet the rubber and tin booms of the 1920s, non-Malays now slightly outnumbered the indigenous population. The Great Depression of 1929 stepped up ethnic competition in the shrinking job market, and nationalism developed to safeguard Malay interests against the Chinese and Indians rather than the British imperial authority. Though hampered by the peninsula's division into the States and the Straits Settlements, relatively conservative Muslim intellectuals and community leaders came together at the Pan-Malayan Malay Congress in Kuala Lumpur in 1939. In Singapore the following year, they were joined by representatives from Sarawak and Brunei. Teachers and journalists urged the revival of the common Malay-Indonesian consciousness, split by the Anglo-Dutch dismemberment of the region in the 19th century. This spirit became a factor in the gathering clouds of war.  Question: \\"What caused the Malay ruling class to take a back seat?\\" Answer: \\"Malaya's rubber production\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"Answer: No, the answer to the question is not correct. The correct answer is that the Malay ruling class took a back seat because the British firmly held the reins of government and control of the rubber and tin industries.

Through a series of serendipitous events, the two realize that true love sometimes unfolds in the most unconventional ways. Plot: Act 1: The movie opens at a bustling coffee shop, where Travis, an aspiring writer, is a regular customer. Travis often writes at the coffee shop, accompanied by his best friend Sammy, a confident, extroverted guy who continuously tries to push Travis out of his comfort zone. Travis is captivated by Miley, a barista at the coffee shop, who fills the space with her vibrant and charming personality. As a connoisseur of stories, Travis loves how Miley always has an anecdote for every customer and enjoys eavesdropping on her conversations. In reality, he would give anything to get closer to her. However, due to his introverted nature, he has never worked up the courage to even have a proper conversation with her, let alone ask her out. One day, Travis accidentally leaves his notebook at the coffee shop, which is filled with personal stories and thoughts about Miley. After closing up, Miley discovers the notebook and, out of curiosity, reads it. Miley is touched by Travis's words and is intrigued by the shy young man who has been admiring her from afar. Act 2: The next day, Travis realizes that he has lost his notebook and gets anxious. When Travis returns to the coffee shop, Miley approaches him and hands it back with a smile. Intrigued by Travis's words, she asks to read his stories and offers to give him feedback. As they bond over their shared love of storytelling, they become friends. Through their conversations, they realize that they have a surprising amount in common. One day, Miley playfully confronts Travis about the various hints in his stories that imply a secret crush on someone he knows.  Travis becomes flustered, but Miley urges him to ask the girl out, unaware that the girl is herself. She constantly encourages Travis, telling him that he is a great guy who deserves happiness, and that sometimes it's essential to take a leap of faith. Travis wonders if Miley may have feelings for him too but dismisses the thought, believing he has misinterpreted the signs. Act 3: As Travis continues receiving Miley's support and encouragement, he musters up the courage to finally ask her out. When Travis finally professes his feelings to Miley, she is caught off guard, having not realized that she was the one mentioned in his stories. Miley reacts with surprise, but after a moment, she admits that she has fallen for him as well. The movie ends with Travis and Miley going on their first date, laughing and connecting as they share their stories and experiences. The camera pans out, leaving the audience with a warm, heartwarming feeling as a new chapter begins in Travis's and Miley's lives. In A Serendipitous Encounter, love and friendship unfold in unexpected ways, reminding the audience that sometimes what we are searching for is right in front of us, and all it takes is a little push from the very people we desire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Porky and a rival neighbor both plan to win the agricultural farm prize, Porky with his garden and the neighbor with his chickens. Porky carefully plans a box of seeds, one by one while the man is busy mixing a bunch of bottles of items together. Porky goes to retrieve something as the man feeds the brand new mixture into the feeding bin for his chickens. But when they try it out, they spit the food out in disgust and seek food elsewhere. Porky grabs his bottle of quick grow, a hair tonic he hopes would work on his garden. To his amazement, it does. But he says nothing of it and heads inside his house. The neighbor checks out his handy work and comments on it, allowing his chickens to come over and eat all of his fruits and vegetables. A little chick and a bigger chicken fight over a watermelon until it flings the chick away. The chick sadly retreats until it sees a bunch of spinach and decides to munch on it instead. The chick then comes back and punches the mean chicken before finishing the watermelon. (The chick eating spinach and then changing is a thinly-veiled Popeye reference). When his garden has almost entirely been eaten, Porky finally notices the chickens and tries to get rid of them.

[+] no [+] yes Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Answer to Question 1: To get rid of best friends on Snapchat, you cannot remove them directly from the \\"Best Friends\\" list, but you can manipulate the list by changing your interactions with them. Here are a few steps to help you get rid of best friends on Snapchat: 1. Adjust the settings: Open Snapchat and navigate to your profile by tapping on your Bitmoji icon or the user icon in the top left corner. Then, tap on the settings gear icon in the top right corner. Scroll down to the \\"Who Can...\\" section and tap on \\"Contact Me.\\" Change it from \\"Everyone\\" to \\"My Friends,\\" and this will prevent any new friend from immediately becoming a best friend. 2. Increase interactions with other friends: Snapchat's best friends list is based on the frequency of interactions with your friends. If you want to remove someone from your best friends list, start interacting more with other friends so that they can replace the ones you want to remove from the list. 3. Decrease interactions with the best friend: To remove a best friend from the list, stop sending snaps to them, avoid opening their snaps, and do not interact with their stories. This will lower their score on your best friends list, eventually moving them off the list. 4. Unfriend or block the user: If you absolutely need to remove someone from your best friends list, you can unfriend or block them. To do this, go to your chat list, long-press on the user's name, tap on \\"More,\\" and choose \\"Remove Friend\\" or \\"Block.\\" Keep in mind that by doing this, you will cut all connections with the user, and they will not be able to send or receive snaps from you. Answer to Question 2: Yes or no - whether or not you should have Snapchat depends on your personal preferences and what you look for in a social media platform. Here are some points to consider before deciding to have Snapchat: Pros: 1. Unique features: Snapchat offers a range of interactive and entertaining features such as lenses, filters, and Bitmoji. It is constantly updating and introducing new features to keep users engaged. 2. Ephemeral content: Disappearing photos and videos that are only available for a short time encourage users to share authentic, unfiltered moments from their daily lives. 3. Option for privacy: Snapchat allows you to control who can view your story, who can send you snaps, and who can view your location using Snap Map. Cons: 1. Time-sensitive messages: The disappearing nature of snaps can be frustrating for users who miss important information or would prefer to save and view messages at their leisure. 2. Limited discoverability: Unlike other social media platforms like Instagram or Facebook, it is harder to discover new users and build a large following on Snapchat unless the account is being promoted through other channels. 3. Privacy concerns: Sharing your location or taking screenshots of snaps can pose privacy risks for users. It's essential to know the app's privacy settings and how to use them. The answer to these two questions is not necessarily the same. The first question asks about a specific feature on Snapchat and how to manage it, while the second question focuses on whether or not you should use the platform. Choosing to use Snapchat is a personal decision based on the above pros and cons, and once you start using it, you can manage the features of the app, such as the best friends list, according to your preferences."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Test sentence: \\"The man who I gave John this picture of was bald.\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence?","output":"Yes, this test sentence is a correct grammatical English sentence, though it might sound a bit complex and awkward due to its structure. Let's break the sentence down for better understanding. The sentence is: \\"The man who I gave John this picture of was bald.\\" Firstly, the sentence contains a relative clause (\\"who I gave John this picture of\\"), which provides additional information about the subject \\"the man.\\" Relative clauses are dependent clauses that are introduced by relative pronouns like \\"who,\\" \\"whom,\\" \\"which,\\" \\"that,\\" and \\"whose.\\" In this case, we can divide the sentence into two statements: 1. \\"I gave John this picture.\\" 2. \\"The man (from the picture) was bald.\\" Now, combining these two statements using the relative pronoun \\"who\\" to form a single sentence: \\"I gave John this picture of the man who was bald.\\" By using the relative clause, we obtain the original sentence: \\"The man who I gave John this picture of was bald.\\" Although the sentence structure might sound unusual and a bit confusing, it is grammatically correct. It could be rephrased to make it easier to understand, as demonstrated in the earlier rearranged version. However, the main point is that the original sentence follows proper grammatical rules in English and conveys the intended meaning, which is about a man who is bald and whom the speaker gave John a picture of."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He and the usually tipsy First Lady have a 28-year-old, sex-starved daughter named Gloria. The President is surrounded by a number of eccentric staffers and allies, including vice president Shockley, ambassador Spender, press secretary Bunthorne and a presidential aide named Feebleman. He also is advised by General Dumpston, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The administration needs the support of the (fictional) African nation of Upper Gorm for an upcoming vote and must deal with Longo, that country's United Nations ambassador. Unfortunately, it can find only one American who knows how to speak the Upper Gormese language, a man named Alexander Grade. As best they can understand it, the ruler of Upper Gorm wants, in exchange, a number of Americans sent to his land so that his country, like the United States, can know what it's like to have an oppressed minority. Gloria is kidnapped and Americans are transported to Africa like slaves., what would be the answer ?

Sentence 2: Fenner neglected to signal the wagons to stop.

The first sentence describes a situation where someone approaches quickly (poundin' leather), and in response, Fenner pulls up Tar (likely a horse), and raises his hand to signal the wagons to halt. In this scenario, Fenner has clearly taken action to stop the wagons. In the second sentence, it is stated that Fenner neglected to signal the wagons to stop. This would mean that, contrary to the actions described in the first sentence, Fenner did not make any attempt to stop the wagons. Therefore, if we assume the first sentence is true, then the second sentence cannot be true, as they contradict each other. The first sentence establishes that Fenner did signal the wagons to halt, while the second sentence claims that he did not.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Breaking Up Big Banks Is a Severely Conservative Project The columnist George F. Will recently shocked his fellow conservatives by endorsing Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, to be Treasury secretary in a Mitt Romney administration. Fisher’s appeal, in Will’s eyes, is that he wants to break up the largest U.S. banks, arguing that this is essential to re- establish a free market for financial services. Big banks get big implicit government subsidies and this should stop. Will’s endorsement was on target: The true conservative agenda should be to take government out of banking by making all financial institutions small enough and simple enough to fail. As Will asks, “Should the government be complicit in protecting -- and by doing so, enlarging -- huge economic interests?” But Will could have gone further -- much of what Fisher recommends also is appealing to people on the left of the political spectrum. Fisher should be considered for a top administration post regardless of who wins the presidency on Nov. 6. He also should be a strong candidate to become chairman of the Federal Reserve Board when Ben Bernanke’s second term ends Jan. 31, 2014. Unfortunately, Fisher’s views on “too big to fail” banks draw the ire of powerful people on Wall Street, and he almost certainly will remain in Dallas. That is, until the next crisis. Fisher and Harvey Rosenblum, executive vice president and director of research at the Dallas Fed, have laid the groundwork for a comprehensive reassessment of finance and banking -- and the effects on monetary policy. The closest parallel is the rethink that happened during the 1930s, as the gold standard broke down and the world descended into depression followed by chaos. But their approach is also reminiscent of the way that monetary policy was reoriented in the early 1980s, as Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and others brought down inflation. The world and the U.S. economy have changed profoundly. We need to alter the way we think about the financial system and monetary policy. Fisher and Rosenblum have expressed, separately and together, three deep ideas since the financial crisis erupted in 2008. First, very large banks are too complex to manage. “Not just for top bank executives, but too complex as well for creditors and shareholders to exert market discipline,” they wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed in April. “And too big and complex for bank supervisors to exert regulatory discipline when internal management discipline and market discipline are lacking.” Complexity, they say, magnifies “the opportunities for opacity, obfuscation and mismanaged risk.” This is a problem in other industries, too, though market forces compel U.S. businesses to reconfigure their organizational structures all the time, including through divestitures and by becoming smaller in other ways. Banking is different. There are large implicit government subsidies available if your financial institution is perceived as too big to fail. These subsidies -- in the form of implicit downside protection or guarantees for creditors -- drive up size and exacerbate complexity. Second, too-big-to-fail banks do actually fail, in the sense that they require bailouts and other forms of government support. This is exactly what happened in the U.S. in 2007 through 2009, and it is what is occurring in Europe today. For anyone who finds the phrase “break up” hard to swallow -- for example because you believe the government shouldn’t take on this role -- Fisher and Rosenblum argue: “Though it sounds radical, restructuring is a far less drastic solution than quasi-nationalization, as happened in 2008-09.” Third, monetary policy cannot function properly when a country’s biggest banks are allowed to become too complex to manage and prone to failure. In “The Blob That Ate Monetary Policy,” a Wall Street Journal op-ed published in September 2009, Fisher and Rosenblum pointed out that cutting interest rates doesn’t work when systemically important banks are close to insolvency. The funding costs for banks go up, not down, as a crisis develops. So pulling the classic policy lever, the federal funds rate, becomes less than effective in such an environment. (For more, see this essay and this article.) As banks come under pressure, the Fed may cut its policy rate but the interest rates charged by banks to customers may actually go up, and it becomes harder to get a loan. This is what happened in 2008 and 2009. Or think about what happens during any attempted economic recovery -- such as the one we are in now. “Well-capitalized banks can expand credit to the private sector in concert with monetary policy easing,” Rosenblum wrote with his colleagues Jessica J. Renier and Richard Alm in the Dallas Fed’s “Economic Letter” of April 2010. “Undercapitalized banks are in no position to lend money to the private sector, sapping the effectiveness of monetary policy.” If you want monetary policy to become effective again, you need the largest banks to be broken up. Equity capital also must increase, relative to debt, throughout the financial system.

His new football coach, Coach McDevitt, drives him onto the campus. His coach, awkwardly asks about any special \\"dietary\\" needs David might have, presumably because of his Jewish background and stresses to not to tell the other boys any more about himself than he has to. When he meets the \\"other big men on campus\\" --Dillon, Connors, Van Kelt, Reece-- he becomes aware of their feelings towards Jews in a conversation about team follower McGivern's new hi-fi he \\"Jewed down\\" from forty to thirty dollars.Greene finds his faith tested when he attends Protestant chapel and when he must choose between going to temple for Rosh Hashanah as his father wishes and playing football. He copes with this second challenge by playing the game where he establishes himself as the team's leader and throws a long touchdown pass late in the 4th quarter to give St. Matt's a 13-7 win in the game, and later that night reciting Jewish prayers in the chapel in honor of Rosh Hashanah.Beyond dealing with religious prejudice this film deals with social prejudices, abuse of power, and the concept of honor. Fairly early on in the film, it becomes clear that although they are gifted by the circumstances of birth, not all of Greene's classmates are gifted academically.

A title can arouse curiosity and interest in the film.  At first glance, the movie described here is about a Jewish boy named David Greene who faces prejudice at his new school while shouldering responsibilities as a football quarterback. It's also about the internal conflict he experiences due to his heritage and his dreams.  1. Filtered main and unique elements: I started by filtering out the main elements of the plot. The main elements consist of 'Jewish boy', 'prejudice', 'football', and 'fight against prejudice'. The elements are combined in a unique way in the movie.  2. Generated connotations: I thought about words or phrases that can represent these main elements. For instance, 'Gridiron' is connotative to football, and 'Yarmulkes' to Jewish heritage.  3. Combined connotations: Combining these two words, we obtain \\"Gridiron & Yarmulkes\\", which gives a hint about the movie's sport-related and religious aspects. 4. Added theme: The second part of the title, \\"Breaking Prejudice\\", signifies another core theme in the movie - fighting against prejudice.  5. Created intrigue: A bit of intrigue is useful to pique the viewers' interest.

What is the full name of the person who could not find any tools to change the wheel of a tire?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Phillip Bellamy, a leading barrister, tells his wife, psychiatrist Anne Dyson, about his most recent case defending a young man, Harry Jukes, who has apparently shot a policeman on a country road and been found by police still holding the gun. Bellamy is convinced of his guilt but Anne is less sure. Much of her practice is with troubled young people and she feels there is more to the story than the police evidence. Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help. He flagged down a lorry to ask to borrow a jack. The lorry stopped but the passenger immediately produced a gun and shot the policeman. Harry managed to grab the gun off the killer as the lorry drove away. Shortly after, a police car arrived and Harry was arrested. Anne believes Harry's story and tries to persuade Bellamy of Harry's innocence. She interviews Harry several times and begins to follow up some aspects of his story. She visits the gang that Harry hung out with in a café in Battersea and they agree to help her by trying to find the couple in the parked car. She also visits Taplow, the man whose car was stolen, several times and finds his account unconvincing. One of the boys from the cafe agrees to take a job at Taplow's frozen food depot to do some investigating there.","output":"Based on the given context, the full name of the person who could not find any tools to change the wheel of a tire is Harry Jukes.

Saturday, Durga Moparti got married at the mansion.      Two days later she's still in the area, stressing instead of celebrating.      \\"I think he just went for a casual walk because one of my family members actually saw him walking down the road,\\" Moparti said.

Many wedding guests spent the day trying to solve that mystery by scouring the area alongside search crews.      The Sacramento Sheriff's Department had a boat out in the river with a cadaver dog.      Family and friends spread missing person's posters throughout the area.      Because he walked away from the party, the sheriff's department says Moparti is considered a \\"voluntary missing person\\" and that some relatives told investigators he was recently depressed.      The bride paints a different picture.      \\"He was a very happy person, and he enjoyed the entire wedding. He was actively participating in all the events,\\" Moparti said.      For now, all plans are on hold until the family figures out what happened to the father of the bride.      \\"Our only focus is to get our father back, and our efforts will continue until we get our father back,\\" Moparti said.

Arsenal F.C.: Expansion of Highbury was restricted because the East Stand had been designated as a Grade II listed building and the other three stands were close to residential properties. These limitations prevented the club from maximising matchday revenue during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, putting them in danger of being left behind in the football boom of that time. After considering various options, in 2000 Arsenal proposed building a new 60,361-capacity stadium at Ashburton Grove, since named the Emirates Stadium, about 500 metres south-west of Highbury. The project was initially delayed by red tape and rising costs, and construction was completed in July 2006, in time for the start of the 2006–07 season. The stadium was named after its sponsors, the airline company Emirates, with whom the club signed the largest sponsorship deal in English football history, worth around £100 million; some fans referred to the ground as Ashburton Grove, or the Grove, as they did not agree with corporate sponsorship of stadium names. The stadium will be officially known as Emirates Stadium until at least 2028, and the airline will be the club's shirt sponsor until the end of the 2018–19 season. From the start of the 2010–11 season on, the stands of the stadium have been officially known as North Bank, East Stand, West Stand and Clock end. Please answer a question about this article.

You can increase your chances of remembering your dream by taking a few extra minutes both to go to sleep and to wake up. If you allow yourself to wake up gradually, you're less likely to startle the dream out of your head. Dream memories are fleeting, and almost always dissipate unless you catch them early on. As soon as you awake, take a pen and jot down whatever you can remember, whether it's a colour, shape, or feeling. Every little detail will help you to make better sense of your dream. When you wake up, you won't have long to catch your dream memories before they fade away. Having a pen and paper at your bedside will give you the fastest way possible to get your thoughts onto paper. When you wake up, try to get the main symbols in your dream down on paper so they don't disappear from your mind. You can write them or draw them, whatever is easiest for you. Obviously, you dreamed about a doll, but think about what else you saw.  What other symbols showed up? Were other people there? Just try to get down the main ideas right now. The emotional impact of the dream is often more important than the visual symbols in your dream. As you write down the details of your dream, think about the emotions that accompanied it. Did you feel upset when you woke up? Did the dream make you happy or anxious? Try to identify what you're feeling upon waking, and write those thoughts down, too. Now that you've got the main ideas down, fill in the details. The details are any extra things you can think of that happened in the dream but weren't necessarily the main focus of the dream. The details can help put the symbols you see into context.  For example, think about the setting. Was it night or day? Did you notice anything else in the dream that you may have left out? Maybe a particular color stood out to you, or maybe you saw a recurring flower. Just try to fill in as much as you can.
