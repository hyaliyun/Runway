Article: Australian scientists say an organic compound  used by Indian women to paint dots or bindi on their foreheads could hold the key to a breakthrough in cancer treatment. Rose Bengal was first used in the early 1900s as a dye for food, textiles and cosmetics. But now it is proving to be a useful weapon in the fight against skin cancer. Television advertisements constantly warn of the dangers of overexposure to the fierce sun. Among them is the possibility of the disease melanoma , a type of skin cancer. More than 1,200 Australians die every year from the disease. Initial trials of a solution of Rose Bengal injected into some melanoma cells have had a 75 percent success rate in controlling the disease. Professor John Thompson, the director of the Melanoma Unit at the University of Sydney, says this organic dye could become a powerful cancer-fighting treatment. \\"We believe it works by getting into the tumor  cells and causing them to self-destruct. But the exact mechanism by which it works is not totally clear. It's not useful for people who have a primary melanoma. The treatment of primary melanoma is surgical excision ,\\"he said. \\"It's useful to inject tumors for people who have recurrences; when the primary treatment has failed and when recurrence in the area, or at more distant sites has occurred.\\" About 90 percent of Australians who develop melanoma survive thanks to early diagnosis and treatment. If left untreated, however, the disease can be fatal. Convincing younger people in Australia about the dangers of overexposure to the sun is a battle campaigners are constantly waging. Veronica Manock, a 21-year-old student, had two major operations to remove a cancerous tumor from her leg. \\"I've had a lot of friends who just said 'I thought it was just, you know, I'll get a mole  cut out and that's it', whereas I don't think people realize how much danger they're putting themselves into and how easy it is to stop something like this happening to you just from doing little things,\\"said Marock.

Darwin presented natural selection as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as inheritance of acquired characters were possible. His strategy established that evolution through natural laws was worthy of scientific study, and by 1875, most scientists accepted that evolution occurred but few thought natural selection was significant. Darwin's scientific method was also disputed, with his proponents favouring the empiricism of John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic, while opponents held to the idealist school of William Whewell's Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, in which investigation could begin with the intuitive truth that species were fixed objects created by design. Early support for Darwin's ideas came from the findings of field naturalists studying biogeography and ecology, including Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1860, and Asa Gray in 1862. Henry Walter Bates presented research in 1861 that explained insect mimicry using natural selection.

If you're purchasing or adopting multiple ferrets at once, visit a pet store or shelter to choose a bonded pair. These ferrets will already get along, so you won't have to deal with introductions or socialization issues.","output":"However, if you're bringing a new ferret into your home to join your existing ferret(s), you'll need to take things step by step to ensure a smooth transition. Here are some tips on how to raise ferrets together and create a harmonious environment for them: 1. Quarantine the new ferret: Before introducing the new ferret to your existing ferret(s), keep them separated for a short period, ideally 7-10 days. This will give you time to check for any signs of illness and treat if necessary. This is important to protect the health of all ferrets involved. 2. Introduce each other's scents: During the quarantine period, swap bedding and toys between the two groups of ferrets. This will allow them to become familiar with each other's scents, making the eventual introductions easier. 3. Neutral territory: When you're ready to introduce the ferrets, choose a neutral area where none of them have previously spent time, such as a different room or a pet-safe playpen. This will prevent territorial behavior and give them equal footing during their first meeting. 4. Supervised playtime: During the initial introductions, supervise their interactions closely. Watch for signs of aggression, such as hissing, biting or puffing up. Break up any fights and separate them immediately if the situation gets out of hand. 5. Take it slow: Introduce the ferrets to each other for short and gradually increasing periods over several days or weeks. Start with just a few minutes, and increase the duration as they become more comfortable with each other. 6. Look for signs of bonding and friendship: Positive signs include grooming each other, cuddling, and playing together. 7. Gradual cohabitation: Once you see consistent positive interactions, you may gradually allow the ferrets to share a cage. Begin by placing their cages near each other, allowing them to explore and interact through the bars. As they become comfortable, slowly move them closer together until they are eventually sharing a single cage. 8. Keep an eye on the hierarchy: Ferrets are social animals and will establish their own hierarchy within the group. Some gentle wrestling, chasing, and play fighting is normal as they establish their ranking. However, continue to monitor for any signs of aggression or stress, and intervene if necessary. 9. Maintain separate feeding stations: To reduce the potential for food-related aggression, provide separate feeding stations for each ferret. Offer multiple water sources as well to ensure they all have access to hydration. 10. Enrichment and playtime: Provide plenty of toys, hideouts, and tunnels for your ferrets to explore and interact with, both independently and with each other. Regular playtime and environmental enrichment will keep them mentally stimulated and physically active, promoting a healthy and happy social dynamic. Remember that patience is crucial when raising ferrets together. Give them enough time to adapt to each other's presence and form a strong bond. This will ensure a harmonious and happy life for your furry friends."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given those answer options, answer the question: Q: In an environment, symbiosis, competition, and relying on other organisms for food are examples of what?   A: A:","output":"In an environment, symbiosis, competition, and relying on other organisms for food are examples of ecological interactions. Ecological interactions are the relationships between various living organisms within an ecosystem and their surrounding environment. These interactions play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of natural systems, enabling species to coexist, adapt, and evolve. The three mentioned types of ecological interactions highlight the complexity and interconnectedness of life on Earth. 1. Symbiosis: This is a close, long-lasting association between two or more different species that can be mutually beneficial (mutualism), harmful to one while benefiting the other (parasitism), or beneficial to one without affecting the other (commensalism). Mutualism refers to a positive, reciprocal relationship in which both organisms benefit from the interaction. Examples of mutualism include the relationship between bees and flowers, where bees gather nectar for food while simultaneously pollinating the flowers. In parasitism, one organism, known as the parasite, benefits at the expense of the host organism. This interaction harms the host, often leading to illness or death. An example of parasitism is the relationship between ticks and their hosts, where ticks feed on the blood of mammals, birds, and reptiles, potentially transmitting diseases in the process. Commensalism is an interaction where one species benefits while the other remains unaffected. A classic example of commensalism is the relationship between barnacles and whales, where barnacles attach themselves to the whale's skin and gain a free ride and access to food without affecting the whale. 2. Competition: Competition occurs when individuals or species vie for limited resources, such as food, water, territory, and mates, resulting in various degrees of harm or benefit depending on the situation. There are two primary forms of competition: a) Interspecific competition: This type of competition occurs between different species. In this scenario, species compete for resources, which may limit their growth, reproduction, and survival. b) Intraspecific competition: This form of competition occurs within the same species. Here, individuals of the same species compete against each other for resources to establish dominance, territory, or mating access. Competition serves as a key driving force in evolution, as it generally leads to natural selection. This means that species with traits that allow them to compete more effectively will be more likely to survive and reproduce than those with less advantageous traits. 3. Relying on other organisms for food: This interaction is based on the concept of predation, herbivory, and scavenging. In predation, one organism (the predator) hunts and kills another organism (the prey) to consume it for nourishment. This interaction plays a significant role in balancing ecosystems by controlling population numbers and allowing for the natural process of adaptation and survival of the fittest. Herbivory is a subset of predation where the consumer feeds on plants. This relationship also plays a crucial role in shaping ecosystems, as plants provide food and resources for herbivores, which in turn become prey for higher-level predators. Scavenging is an interaction where organisms feed on dead or dying animals that they did not kill themselves. Scavengers, such as vultures and hyenas, help maintain a clean and healthy environment by breaking down and consuming decaying matter. In conclusion, symbiosis, competition, and relying on other organisms for food are vital examples of ecological interactions. Each interaction demonstrates the complex relationships between living organisms and their environment, highlighting the importance of these connections in maintaining the delicate balance of natural systems. As humanity continues to influence Earth's ecosystems, understanding these interactions will be crucial for conserving biodiversity, ensuring the health of our environment, and the survival of countless species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Given the question: I read this background article the other day: There are many examples in the chemical world of changes in entropy. Phase transitions are one obvious example. When a substance makes a transition from the liquid state to the gaseous state, the particles have many more possible arrangements, because they are no longer confined to a specified volume in which they are close to each other; gas particles can move freely throughout their container. Vaporization represents an increase in entropy. In the opposite direction, a liquid loses entropy when it freezes to a solid. Because solids have very ordered structures, there are fewer possible arrangements of particles that would result in the properties associated with a solid.  I am facing a new situation today: George is going camping and forgot to bring water with him. He decides to collect water from a nearby stream and boil it to make it safe for drinking.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Will boiling the water increase or decrease entropy?

Please answer the following question: This article: By 1930, Szigeti was established as a major international concert violinist. He performed extensively in Europe, the United States and Asia, and made the acquaintance of many of the era's leading instrumentalists, conductors and composers. In 1939, to escape the war and Nazi persecution of the Jews, Szigeti emigrated with his wife to the United States, where they settled in California. (A year later, Bartók also fled to America, and just two days after his arrival, he and Szigeti played a sonata recital at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.)During the 1930s, 1940s and into the 1950s, Szigeti recorded extensively, leaving a significant legacy.

Question: What is Max's first public school? Title: Rushmore Movie plot: Max Fischer (Schwartzman), an eccentric 15-year-old, is a scholarship student at Rushmore Academy, a private school in Houston. He is both Rushmore's most extracurricularly active and least scholarly student. He spends nearly all of his time on elaborate extracurricular activities, not at all bothered how it affects his grades. He also has a feud with the school's headmaster, Dr. Guggenheim. Herman Blume (Murray) is a disillusioned industrialist who finds his operation of a multimillion-dollar company to be tedious. He is upset that his marriage is failing and the two sons he's putting through Rushmore are impolite and obnoxious brats spoiled by their mother. Herman comes to like Max, and the two become good friends. Max is proud of Herman's success while Herman is interested by Max's arrogant persona. Rosemary Cross (Williams) is a widowed teacher who arrives at Rushmore as a new first grade instructor. She joined Rushmore after the death of her husband, who was also a former Rushmore student. Max quickly develops an obsession with Rosemary and makes many attempts at pursuing her. While she initially tolerates Max, Rosemary becomes increasingly worried by his obvious infatuation with her. Along the way, Blume attempts to convince Max that Rosemary is not worth the trouble, only to fall for Rosemary himself. The two begin dating without Max's knowledge. After Max attempts to break ground on an aquarium without the school's approval, he is expelled from Rushmore. He is then forced to enroll in his first public school, Grover Cleveland High. Max's attempts to engage in outside activities at his new school have mixed results. A fellow student, Margaret Yang, tries to befriend Max, but he acts hostile towards her. Rosemary and Blume attempt to support him in his new school.

This sentence translates: \\"A chief of a border police station and a police officer were involved.\\". One important thing to note in translation between English and Turkish is the placement of the verbs. In English, the verb typically comes right after the subject. However, in Turkish, verbs are usually placed at the end of the sentence. So, \\"were involved\\" translates into \\"dahil olmuştur\\" and is placed at the very end of the Turkish sentence. The roles of the individuals involved, \\"chief of a border police station\\" and \\"police officer,\\" are translated into \\"sınır polis istasyonu şefi\\" and \\"polis memuru\\" respectively. Here, \\"polis istasyonu\\" means \\"police station,\\" \\"şefi\\" means \\"chief,\\" \\"sınır\\" represents \\"border,\\" \\"polis\\" is \\"police,\\" and \\"memuru\\" is \\"officer\\". It's also important to remember that Turkish words often have affixes that give additional information about their roles in the sentence or the conditions of the verb – in this case, \\"dahil olmuştur\\" contains both the status of being involved (dahil olma) and a suffix (-muştur) denoting the past tense and the reportive evidentiality, meaning that the speaker did not witness the event directly, but states it as a fact."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing.  I am facing a new situation today: Jeremy works on a construction site operating a jackhammer and a large welding machine. Jeremy is frequently exposed to sounds with high decibel levels due to being around these machines so often. Jeremy's brother, Alexander, on the other hand works in a library. Unlike Jeremy, Alexander is frequently exposed to sounds with very low decibel levels during his work.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who is exposed to sounds that are less dangerous? The answer is:","output":"Alexander is exposed to sounds that are less dangerous.  Based on the background article, high-decibel sounds are dangerous as they can damage the ears and cause hearing loss. In the new situation, Jeremy works at a construction site operating a jackhammer and a large welding machine. These machines are known to produce loud noises, meaning Jeremy is frequently exposed to high-decibel sounds. Operating such equipment without proper hearing protection can pose serious threats to his long-term hearing capabilities. On the other hand, Alexander works in a library, a typically quiet environment characterized by low-decibel sounds. Libraries are designed to maintain a quiet atmosphere, facilitating a conducive space for reading, studying, and research. Due to the nature of his work environment, Alexander is exposed to sounds with lower decibel levels, which are considered less dangerous compared to the loud sounds Jeremy is subject to in his line of work. It is important to note that prolonged exposure to loud noises can increase the risk of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Therefore, it is crucial for Jeremy to adopt protective measures, such as using earplugs or earmuffs, to minimize the risk of damage to his ears from the high-decibel sounds in his workplace. In contrast, Alexander's exposure to low-decibel sounds in the library presents a significantly lower risk to his hearing health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: TL:DR: I un-professionally get mad at a customer and verbally slam the door on her way out. I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'. All I say is ‘Good’ and move on to the next customer. Hitler-lite phones my corporation to voice a complaint, so a suit comes out and asks the team who did it, I fess up so I can save the time and not have a reason to hate one of my co-workers.

The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2,  Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about 30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought  Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance.  Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately 300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994,  Bin Laden received about 1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a 300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the  Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale. This action had the effect of divesting  Bin Laden of what otherwise might indeed have been a large fortune. Nor were  Bin Laden's assets in Sudan a source of money for al Qaeda. When  Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, he owned a number of businesses and other assets.  Question: \\"To fund a jihad, how much of Bin Laden's personal inheritance could have gone to the terrorists?\\" Answer: \\"30 million\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, the answer is not correct. Bin Laden's personal inheritance was about 1 million per year from 1970 through 1994. Al Qaeda's funding mostly came from donations, and it cost about 30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11. However, it's important to note that Bin Laden's personal inheritance wasn't used entirely to fund the terrorists, as al Qaeda primarily relied on its fundraising network."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer a question about the following article about Korean War: The initial assault by North Korean KPA forces were aided by the use of Soviet T-34-85 tanks. A North Korean tank corps equipped with about 120 T-34s spearheaded the invasion. These drove against a ROK Army with few anti-tank weapons adequate to deal with the Soviet T-34s. Additional Soviet armor was added as the offensive progressed. The North Korean tanks had a good deal of early successes against South Korean infantry, elements of the 24th Infantry Division, and those United States built M24 Chaffee light tanks that they encountered. Interdiction by ground attack aircraft was the only means of slowing the advancing Korean armor. The tide turned in favour of the United Nations forces in August 1950 when the North Koreans suffered major tank losses during a series of battles in which the UN forces brought heavier equipment to bear, including M4A3 Sherman medium tanks backed by U.S. M26 heavy tanks, along with the British Centurion, Churchill, and Cromwell tanks.

Question: The latest research suggests that the key factor separating geniuses from the merely accomplished is not I.Q., a generally bad predictor of success. Instead, it's purposeful practice. Top performers spend more hours practising their craft. If you wanted to picture how a typical genius might develop, you'd take a girl who possessed a slightly above average language ability. It wouldn't have to be a big talent, just enough so that she might gain some sense of distinction. Then you would want her to meet, say, a novelist, who coincidentally shared some similar qualities. Maybe the writer was from the same town, had the same family background, or shared the same birthday.  This contact would give the girl a vision of her future self. It would give her some idea of a fascinating circle who might someday join. It would also help if one of her parents died when she was 12, giving her a strong sense of insecurity and fuelling a desperate need for success. Armed with this ambition, she would read novels and life stories of writers without end. This would give her a primary knowledge of her field. She would be able to see new writing in deeper ways and quickly understand its inner workings.  Then she would practise writing. Her practice would be slow, painstaking and error-focused. By practising in this way, she delays the automating process. Her mind wants to turn conscious, newly learned skills into unconscious, automatically performed skills. By practising slowly, by breaking skills down into tiny parts and repeating, she forces the brain to internalize a better pattern of performance. Then she would find an adviser who would provide a constant stream of feedback, viewing her performance form the outside, correcting the smallest errors, pushing her to take on tougher challenges. By now she is redoing problems--how do I get characters into a room--dozens and dozens of times. She is establishing habits of thought she can call upon in order to understand or solve future problems.  The primary quality our young writer... The passage mainly deals with_.

Zero-hours contracts: where the truth lies in their use Officially there are 1.4m zero-hours contracts in the UK. To George Osborne they are evidence of a flexible workforce that is helping to drive GDP growth. Photograph: Luke Macgregor/Reuters The Tory right will no doubt cheer the vast numbers of workers considered to be \\"flexible\\" after official figures showed the UK has 1.4 million people on zero-hours contracts. A flexible workforce is one of the reasons the UK is now pulling away from France and the rest of the eurozone in terms of GDP growth. In No 11 there will be nods of agreement as George Osborne's advisers swipe their free market credentials at the door before starting work. Labour will seize on the figure to press home arguments that Britain is developing a low-wage underclass, consigned to be at the beck and call of their employer in a miserable repeat of our Victorian past. The truth seems to be somewhere between the two. Not just a slave-shop ethic, but one that also fits with the increasingly complicated nature of many people's lives. Without questioning why so many workers reach for flexible working (a 42% divorce rate is one depressingly familiar reason) there is no doubt demand exists and many people do want those arrangements. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development found that hundreds of zero-hours workers appreciated the flexibility and the way work rotas could be fitted around their family commitments. Students and older workers make up a large slice of this group. Now students must supplement their incomes for more than beer money – many view some form of paid work as essential to survival. To fit around lectures they need flexibility. They work for the retailers and pub chains that are in some cases almost exclusively run on zero-hours contracts (Sports Direct and JD Wetherspoons to name just two). Older workers seeking to supplement meagre pensions also say they want to fit around caring responsibilities. But this is less than half the story. For most people zero-hours contracts are the sharp end of a knife held by companies for which it makes economic sense to keep employees dangling each month, at their beck and call for zero cost. Complain and their workers just might find themselves with reduced hours the next month. While they are entitled to holiday pay, many employers say \\"it's in the hourly wage\\". When most are also paying the minimum wage, it is a legitimate cause for concern. Sick pay is denied and pensions are off limits. Mortgages are difficult to obtain without lying, which in the current climate, with banks asking ever more intrusive questions, is going to be difficult. These are not small businesses, precariously poised on the edge of bankruptcy. Most zero-hours employers have at least 250 staff. There is, for those who appreciate not only free markets but also austerity, a further boon. Zero-hours contracts are big in the public sector. Universities are big users, as are further education colleges. Local councils pay for long-term care and virtually all private providers use such contracts, which puts around 160,000 people on them. The health service is increasingly pooling professional staff and putting them on rotas without any guarantee of work from one month to the next. It is a growing trend that is justified by the positive reaction of students and the older people, but harms everyone else. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Zero-hours contracts have become a significant part of the UK labour market, with official figures indicating that 1.4 million people have such contracts. They have been praised for facilitating a flexible workforce that drives GDP growth and providing workers with an opportunity to fit their work around other commitments, such as family or studies. Students and older workers, in particular, value this flexibility, and large retailers such as Sports Direct and JD Wetherspoons rely heavily on zero-hours contracts. However, there is also a darker side to zero-hours contracts. For many people, these contracts represent the uncertainty and pressure exerted by companies who use them to keep employees at their beck and call without providing stability, sick pay, or pensions. Furthermore, getting a mortgage can be challenging for those on zero-hours contracts, and the majority of their employers are not small, struggling businesses, but larger companies with over 250 staff. The public sector also extensively uses zero-hours contracts, particularly in universities, further education colleges, and local councils. Around 160,000 people in the long-term care sector are on these contracts. While zero-hours contracts may have their benefits, it is important to consider the potential detrimental effects on workers who rely on them for their livelihoods."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Jonathan Israel rejects the attempts of postmodern and Marxian historians to understand the revolutionary ideas of the period purely as by-products of social and economic transformations. He instead focuses on the history of ideas in the period from 1650 to the end of the 18th century, and claims that it was the ideas themselves that caused the change that eventually led to the revolutions of the latter half of the 18th century and the early 19th century. Israel argues that until the 1650s Western civilization \\"was based on a largely shared core of faith, tradition and authority\\". Question: What does Israel argue Western civilization was based on until the 1650s?","output":"Jonathan Israel posits that prior to the 1650s, Western civilization was fundamentally built upon three key constructs: faith, tradition, and authority.  When Israel mentions \\"faith,\\" he alludes to the profound religious beliefs that were prevalent during this time period. Christianity had a robust influence over the social, political, and intellectual aspects of Western society. Faith models and teachings dictated moral codes, legal principles, and social interactions. Moreover, faith fuelled scholarly investigation and intellectual contemplation, thereby shaping and informing various scientific and philosophical inquiries. \\"Tradition,\\" the second component Israel identifies, refers to the entrenched customs, practices, and beliefs that were handed down from one generation to the next. These traditions, encapsulating diverse areas like politics, societal norms, family structure, and profession, often provided the framework within which people led their lives. They were seen as guidelines that have stood the test of time, hence they were respected and strictly adhered to. They not only imparted a sense of continuity, but also created shared cultural identities and societal coherence. The third element, \\"authority,\\" stands for the established political and sociological power structures that existed. This could include the power wielded by monarchs, the nobility, and the Church, all of whom played essential roles in governing society, maintaining order, and making crucial decisions that influenced the course of Western civilization. Authority was seldom questioned, reflecting the hierarchical nature of society. It was perceived as a cornerstone of stability and harmony within communities. Therefore, according to Israel, these three elements, deeply intertwined and mutually supportive, formed the bedrock on which Western civilization was built during the period preceding the 1650s. Furthermore, he contends that these elements were largely shared among people, indicating a collective acceptance and adherence to these foundational principles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

U.S. President Donald Trump filed his annual financial disclosure form this week with the Office of Government Ethics, the U.S. government's ethics watchdog. Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. According to the above context, answer the following question. Why did Trump file an annual financial disclosure form with the Office of Government Ethics? OPTIONS: A). to stop false accusations against him for his financial dealings B). it is prerequisite to running for the office of President C). not enough information D). it is required of all top government officials under US law Answer:","output":"D). it is required of all top government officials under US law"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Punch-Drunk Love Movie plot: Barry Egan (Adam Sandler) is a single man who owns a company that markets themed toilet plungers and other novelty items. He has seven overbearing sisters who ridicule and emotionally abuse him regularly and leads a very lonely life punctuated by fits of rage and anguish. In the span of one morning, he witnesses a bizarre car accident, picks up an abandoned harmonium from the street, and encounters Lena Leonard (Emily Watson), a co-worker of his sister, Lena having orchestrated this meeting after seeing him in a family picture belonging to his sister Elizabeth (Mary Lynn Rajskub).Coping with his loneliness, Barry calls a phone sex hotline, but the female operator attempts to extort money and sends her four henchmen, who are brothers, to collect. This complicates his budding relationship with Lena, as well as his plan to exploit a loophole in a Healthy Choice promotion and amass a million frequent flyer miles by buying large quantities of pudding (based on the true story of David Phillips). After Lena leaves for Hawaii on a business trip, Barry decides to follow her. He arrives and calls one of his manipulative sisters to learn where Lena is staying. When his sister tries manipulating him again, Barry snaps and demands she give him the information, which she does. Lena is unexpectedly overjoyed to see Barry, and they have a pillow talk scene. At first, Barry explains that he is in Hawaii on a business trip by coincidence, but he soon admits that he came to pursue a romantic relationship. The romance further develops, and Barry finally feels some relief from the emotional isolation he has endured.After they return home, the four brothers ram their car into Barry's, leaving Lena mildly injured.

What is the solution?","output":"To solve the equation -22*b + 5*b = 85 for b, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the like terms on the left side of the equation -22*b and 5*b are like terms because they both involve the variable b. So, we can combine them as follows: (-22 * b) + (5 * b) = (-22 + 5) * b = -17 * b Now, the equation becomes: -17 * b = 85 Step 2: Isolate the variable b To isolate variable b, we need to remove the coefficient -17 in front of b. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -17: (-17 * b) / -17 = 85 / -17 This simplifies to: b = -5 So, the solution to the equation -22*b + 5*b = 85 is b = -5."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Today, we are going to learn how to make a super-duper wedding invitation that will make everyone excited to come! A wedding is a big party where two people who love each other very much say \\"I do\\" and become a family. To make sure that everyone knows about this special event, we need to send out invitations. So, let's get started! First, let's list the hosts of the wedding. The hosts are the people who are planning and paying for the wedding, like the bride and groom's parents. We need to write their names in the right order, so our guests know who's who. For example, if the bride's parents are named Mr. and Mrs. Johnson and the groom’s parents are named Mr. and Mrs. Smith, we can write: \\"Mr. and Mrs. Johnson and Mr. and Mrs. Smith invite you to celebrate the wedding of their children\\" Now, it's time to tell everyone the names of the special couple! This way, our guests will know who is getting married. Write the bride's name first, then the groom's name, like this: \\"Alice Johnson to James Smith\\" Next, let's share when and where the magical day will happen. We need to tell our guests the date, time, and location of the wedding ceremony. This way, nobody will be late or lost. For example: \\"Saturday, June 19th, 2022, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon Lovely Gardens Ceremony Park 1234 Magic Lane, Hometown, (State)\\" Don't forget about the super-fun party after the wedding, called the reception! Our guests need to know where it is, what time it starts, and what to expect, like dinner or dancing. Here's an example: \\"Please join us for a reception to follow: Enchanted Reception Hall 5678 Fairy Way, Hometown, (State) Dinner, dancing, and happily-ever-afters!\\" Lastly, we should let our guests know how to tell us if they can come to the wedding or not. This is called RSVP, which stands for \\"répondez s'il vous plaît\\" (it's French for \\"please respond\\"). We should give them a way to do this, like an email address or phone number, and when to let us know by. For example: \\"Kindly RSVP by May 1st, 2022 Email: happywedding@email.com or call (555) 123-4567\\" And there you have it! A magical wedding invitation that will make everyone smile and want to come celebrate this special love story.

Sure enough  CT scans showed blood clots in  her  lungs and  she  began treatment. The health scares didn’t stop there. Over the next few days  Williams was back in surgery after one of  her  C-section scars popped open after  she  experienced coughing spells. Doctors found a hematoma in  her  abdomen  and  she  returned to the operating table for one more procedure to prevent clotting. Vogue/Mario Testino \\"Sometimes I get really down and feel like  man  I can’t do this ”  she  told the magazine. After going through all of that  Williams told  Vogue   she  couldn’t get out of bed for six weeks.

Or I’ll get angry about the crying  then sad about being angry  and then guilty  like  why do I feel so sad when I have a beautiful baby? The emotions are insane.” Some days  Williams admitted  she  feels like throwing in the towel. “To be honest  there’s something really attractive about the idea of moving to San Francisco and just being a mom ”  she  said. Williams’ husband  Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian  is based there  while  she  lives in Florida. “But not yet ”  she  added. “Maybe this goes without saying  but it needs to be said in a powerful way: I absolutely want more Grand Slams.” Output:","output":"Serena Williams Opens Up About Pregnancy Complications and Motherhood in Vogue Interview"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Moon orbits Earth at a speed of approximately one kilometer per second. The Moon is kept in orbit by which of the following?","output":"The Moon is kept in orbit around the Earth due to the force of gravity. Let's take a step-by-step approach to understand this: 1. The Earth and the Moon are celestial bodies with mass. According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, any two objects with mass will attract each other with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. 2. Due to this force of attraction, known as gravity, the Moon is constantly being pulled towards the Earth. However, it doesn't fall into the Earth because it is also moving in a direction perpendicular to the force of gravity, which creates a balance. 3. The Moon's tangential velocity (approximately one kilometer per second) causes it to move in a curved path around the Earth. As it moves forward in its orbit, it falls towards the Earth due to gravity, but its sideways motion ensures that it continually \\"misses\\" the Earth. This creates a stable orbit. 4. Additionally, the centripetal force needed to keep the Moon moving in a circular path around the Earth is provided by the gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon. 5. As a result, the balance between the tangential velocity and the force of gravity keeps the Moon in a stable orbit around the Earth. In summary, the Moon is kept in orbit around the Earth by the force of gravity, which provides the necessary centripetal force to balance the Moon's tangential velocity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   you could prove that movements are occurring even in the absence of a gradient. In a similar manner, there are analogous carrier systems that move hydrophobic molecules through water. Channel molecules sit within a membrane and contain an aqueous channel that spans the membrane’s hydrophobic region. Hydrophilic molecules of particular sizes and shapes can pass through this aqueous channel and their movement involves a significantly lower activation energy than would be associated with moving through the lipid part of the membrane in the absence of the channel. Channels are generally highly selective in terms of which particles will pass through them. For example, there are channels in which 10,000 potassium ions will pass through for every one sodium ion. Often the properties of these channels can be regulated; they can exist in two or more distinct structural states. For example, in one state the channel can be open and allow particles to pass through or it can be closed, that is the channel can be turned on and off. Channels cannot, however, determine in which direction an ion will move - that is determined by the ion gradient across the membrane. The transition between open and closed states can be regulated through a number of processes, including the reversible binding of small molecules to the protein and various other molecular changes (which we will consider when we talk about proteins). Another method of channel control depends on the fact that channel proteins are i) embedded within a membrane and ii) contain charged groups. As we will see cells can (and generally do) generate ion gradients, that, is a separation of charged species across their membranes. For example if the concentration of K+ ions is higher on one side of the membrane, there will be an ion gradient where the natural tendency is for the ions to move to the region of lower K+ concentration.222 The ion gradient in turn can produce an electrical field across the plasma membrane. As these fields change, they can produce (induce) changes...   Q: What type of molecules sit within a membrane and contain an aqueous channel that spans the membrane’s hydrophobic region?

Luther came to reject several teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. He strongly disputed the claim that freedom from God's punishment for sin could be purchased with money, proposing an academic discussion of the practice and efficacy of indulgences in his \\"Ninety-five Theses\\" of 1517. His refusal to renounce all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the Pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor.  - Ústí nad Labem Region or Ústecký Region, also Region Aussig (after the German name of the capital), is an administrative unit of the Czech Republic, located in the north-western part of its historical land of Bohemia and the whole country. It is named after its capital Ústí nad Labem. It covers the majority of the former North Bohemia province and is part of the broader area of North Bohemia.  - The Protestant Reformation, often referred to simply as the Reformation (from Latin \\"reformatio\\", \\"restoration, renewal\\"), was a schism from the Roman Catholic Church initiated by Martin Luther and continued by John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli, and other early Protestant Reformers in 16th century Europe. Timing most commonly used for this period is from 1517 (the Ninety-five Theses are published by Martin Luther) to 1648 (Peace of Westphalia ends the Thirty Years' War).  - The Free State of Saxony is a landlocked federal state of Germany, bordering the federal states of Brandenburg, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia, and Bavaria, as well as the countries of Poland (Lower Silesian and Lubusz Voivodeships) and the Czech Republic (Karlovy Vary, Liberec and Ústí nad Labem Regions).

To make certain the U.S. was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilard and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered. He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilard, to President Roosevelt, recommending the U.S. pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research. A secret German facility, apparently the largest of the Third Reich, covering 75 acres in an underground complex, was being re-excavated in Austria in December 2014 and may have been planned for use in nuclear research and development. The letter is believed to be \\"arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II\\". In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the Belgian Royal Family and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House's Oval Office. President Roosevelt could not take the risk of allowing Hitler to possess atomic bombs first. As a result of Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the U.S. entered the \\"race\\" to develop the bomb, drawing on its \\"immense material, financial, and scientific resources\\" to initiate the Manhattan Project. It became the only country to successfully develop an atomic bomb during World War II. For Einstein, \\"war was a disease ... [and] he called for resistance to war.\\" By signing the letter to Roosevelt he went against his pacifist principles. In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, Linus Pauling, \\"I made one great mistake in my life--when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification--the danger that the Germans would make them ...\\"  After reading the above, is \\"17 years\\" the correct answer to the question \\"How many years before Einstein's death did he begin the quest toward creating a nuclear weapon?\\"?","output":"Let's break down the timeline to answer this question: 1. In July 1939, Szilard and Wigner visited Einstein to discuss the possibility of atomic bombs, leading Einstein and Szilard to write a letter to President Roosevelt. 2.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the set of songs that Alan Gibbs believes is at least equal to Vaughan William's Five English Folk songs of 1913? , can you please find it?   During and after the composition of The Planets, Holst wrote or arranged numerous vocal and choral works, many of them for the wartime Thaxted Whitsun Festivals, 1916–18. They include the Six Choral Folksongs of 1916, based on West Country tunes, of which \\"Swansea Town\\", with its \\"sophisticated tone\\", is deemed by Dickinson to be the most memorable. Holst downplayed such music as \\"a limited form of art\\" in which \\"mannerisms are almost inevitable\\"; the composer Alan Gibbs, however, believes Holst's set at least equal to Vaughan Williams's Five English Folk Songs of 1913.Holst's first major work after The Planets was the Hymn of Jesus, completed in 1917. The words are from a Gnostic text, the apocryphal Acts of St John, using a translation from the Greek which Holst prepared with assistance from Clifford Bax and Jane Joseph. Head comments on the innovative character of the Hymn: \\"At a stroke Holst had cast aside the Victorian and Edwardian sentimental oratorio, and created the precursor of the kind of works that John Tavener, for example, was to write in the 1970s\\". Matthews has written that the Hymn's \\"ecstatic\\" quality is matched in English music \\"perhaps only by Tippett's The Vision of Saint Augustine\\"; the musical elements include plainsong, two choirs distanced from each other to emphasise dialogue, dance episodes and \\"explosive chordal dislocations\\".In the Ode to Death (1918–19), the quiet, resigned mood is seen by Matthews as an \\"abrupt volte-face\\" after the life-enhancing spirituality of the Hymn. Warrack refers to its aloof tranquillity; Imogen Holst believed the Ode expressed Holst's private attitude to death. The piece has rarely been performed since its premiere in 1922, although the composer Ernest Walker thought it was Holst's finest work to that date.The influential critic Ernest Newman considered The Perfect Fool \\"the best of modern British operas\\", but its unusually short length (about an hour) and parodic, whimsical nature—described by The Times as \\"a brilliant puzzle\\"—put it outside the...

No. And do we really need yet another trip through that turbulent time? Not really. But if we must have one, does it have to be as shallow as \\"The '60s\\"?  I like to think that co-writers Bill Couturie and Robert Greenfield had more in mind for this two-part miniseries than what ultimately resulted, especially given Couturie's involvement in the superb HBO movie \\"Dear America: Letters Home From Vietnam\\" which utilized little original music and no original footage, letting the sights and sounds of the time speak for themselves. This presentation intercuts file footage with the dramatic production, but it doesn't do anyone any favours by trying to do too much in too little time; like so many of its ilk, it's seen from the point of view of one family. But the children of the family seem to be involved tangentially with almost every major event of the '60s (it's amazing that one of them doesn't go to the Rolling Stones gig at Altamont), making it seem less like a period drama and more like a Cliff Notes version of the decade. The makers rush through it so much that there's little or no time to give the characters any character, with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time - the children's father is especially clichéd - and then when they're back on BLAMMO! it's something else. Garry Trudeau could teach the filmmakers a thing or two about doing this kind of thing properly. In fairness, Jerry O'Connell, Jordana Brewster, Jeremy Sisto, Julia Stiles and Charles S. Dutton give their material the old college try, but they're wasted (especially the latter two); it's undeniably good to see David Alan Grier in a rare straight role as activist Fred Hampton, and Rosanna Arquette (in an uncredited cameo in part 2) is always welcome. What isn't welcome is how \\"The '60s\\" drowns the soundtrack with so many period songs that it ultimately reduces its already minimal effect (and this may well be the only time an American TV presentation about post-60s America never mentions the British Invasion - no Beatles, no Rolling Stones... then again, there's only so much tunes you can shoehorn into a soundtrack album, right?). Capping its surface-skimming approach to both the time and the plot with an almost out-of-place happy ending, \\"American Dreams\\" and \\"The Wonder Years\\" did it all much, much better.

Q:Background: Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat.  The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible.  Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1]  Paragraph: Rob is an environmental scientist. He is studying the effect of insect species on environment. For his study he chose four locations, location A, location B, location C and the entire globe, which he denoted as location D. He noticed location A's loss of biodiversity is temporary , but location B's loss is permanent. Location C's loss of biodiversity yet to be determined.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which location most probably suffered land loss or similar processes, location A or location B? A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is most probable that Location B suffered land loss or similar processes. This is because Location A's loss of biodiversity is described as temporary, suggesting that the environmental degradation leading to the loss may be reversible through ecological restoration or ecological resilience. In contrast, Location B's loss of biodiversity is described as permanent, implying that the environmental degradation may be effectively permanent, such as through land loss or other irreversible processes. Therefore, Location B most likely experienced land loss or similar processes that resulted in the permanent loss of biodiversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

President Donald Trump capped what has been a difficult week politically with an all-out push for tax reform Friday. In a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, Trump promised to deliver on a “giant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country, tax cut.” Trump is eager to move past setbacks on health care reform and the results of a Republican Senate primary Tuesday in Alabama where he found himself on the losing side. The president and his administration also have been on the defensive over hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. Senate Republicans put off a vote on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare after it became clear they did not have enough votes to pass the measure, thanks to a handful of Republican defectors. Democrats expressed relief they had beaten back another attempt to undo former President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. “The reason this bill failed is because millions of Americans didn’t want it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. On the same day, Christian conservative and former judge Roy Moore easily won a Republican Senate primary in Alabama, defeating incumbent Luther Strange, whom Trump had supported. “We are put here on Earth for a short time, and for that short time our duty it to serve almighty God,” Moore said in his victory speech. Moore has made controversial statements on a number of issues in the past, but he is considered the favorite in a race against Democrat Doug Jones in a general election Dec. 12. Trump had appeared with Strange the week before at a rally in Alabama, but even some analysts said his heart did not appear to be in it. “Trump was campaigning for Luther Strange, but you could tell he was having some second thoughts about that,” said Republican strategist John Feehery.  Moore’s victory, aided by the active support of former Trump White House strategist Steve Bannon, signals what could be a series of divisive Republican primary battles heading into next...

After Tuesday’s GOP primary, the 17-year-old is one election... (Associated Press)      CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — A week before her high school graduation, Saira Blair was barely old enough to vote when she unseated a West Virginia lawmaker almost four times her age.      After Tuesday's GOP primary, the 17-year-old is one election away from becoming the youngest state lawmaker in West Virginia history. Larry Swan, sworn in as a 20-year-old delegate in 1972, set the current record.      Blair's birthday is in July, so she would just meet the 18-year-old minimum age for West Virginia House of Delegates members. Seventeen-year-olds who will turn 18 by the November election can vote in West Virginia's primary.      Soft-spoken and on-message, Blair is a churchgoer who says she is pro-life, pro-family, pro-gun rights and pro-business. She can rattle off a laundry list of businesses taxes she wants abolished or lowered.      \\"People saw that you don't need to wait until you are 40, 50 or 60 to realize our conservative principles are beneficial to everyone,\\" the Martinsburg teen said of her primary win.      Blair also has family experience on her side. Her electrician father, Craig Blair, is a state senator who once held the House seat she is seeking.      The teenager has more on her mind than stump speeches. She graduates from Hedgesville High School next Wednesday. Then she'll head to West Virginia University in the fall to pursue economics and Spanish degrees. She says finance is her field of choice.      Blair will skip spring classes if she clinches the Eastern Panhandle seat, since lawmakers convene for business in Charleston from January to March. The two-year House gig pays a 20,000 annual salary, plus per diem.      Only about 150 votes separated Blair from Republican Del. Larry Kump in the Eastern Panhandle primary, according to unofficial results. But midterm turnout was dismal: Only about 1,600 votes were cast in the 59th House District.      Friends in her high school class of 400 helped wave signs at polling places. She rallied some to register to vote. Blair also spent 4,900 and had a 2,300 loan, compared to Kump's 1,840 in spending.      \\"Quite frankly, she out-campaigned me,\\" said Kump, 67, finishing his second House term. \\"It was a low voter turnout election and she won.\\"      Blair's conservative platform meshes with her Eastern Panhandle community, a GOP stronghold filled with Washington, D.C., commuters.      Kump espoused his own brand of quirky conservatism. He sat in the Democratic House's back row with a yellow \\"Don't tread on me\\" flag on his desk. He occasionally tapped into his inner Dr. Seuss and delivered rhymes in opposition to bills he considered government intrusion.      He also wanted the Eastern Panhandle to return to Virginia, which Blair opposed.      Blair has attended GOP meetings with her dad since the sixth grade and volunteers with various groups. She skipped senior prom to participate in a Youth in Government meeting in Charleston.      \\"She has never had a curfew or anything like that,\\" Craig Blair said. \\"As long as you're performing to the best of your ability, I don't make rules for her.\\"      Blair's Democratic opponent, 44-year-old lawyer Layne Diehl, said that it's positive that the teen won the primary, despite their differing views.      \\"She certainly has taken on this challenge and I think that she's up to it,\\" Diehl said. ||||| Close Get email notifications on Matthew Umstead daily!

Her conservative values resonated with her Eastern Panhandle community, which is known as a GOP stronghold. By connecting with friends, classmates, and community members during her campaign, Blair managed to out-raise and outmaneuver her more experienced Republican opponent, Larry Kump. Blair's determination and commitment to public service were exemplified when she skipped her senior prom to attend a Youth in Government meeting in Charleston. Although she faced a Democratic opponent in the general election, Blair's success in the primary demonstrated the power of perseverance and involvement in the political process at a young age. Her story is a unique example of the impact that young people can have in their communities when they take an active role in politics and policy-making."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Education writer Gary Spruce refers to hundreds of similar cases, and cites that of William Crotch of Norwich who in 1778, at the age of three, was giving organ recitals. British scholar Jane O'Connor explains the 18th century fascination with prodigies as \\"the realisation of the potential entertainment and fiscal value of an individual child who was in some way extraordinary\\". Other childhood contemporaries of Mozart included the violinist and composer Thomas Linley, born the same year as Wolfgang, and the organist prodigy Joseph Siegmund Bachmann. Mozart eventually became recognised among prodigies as the future standard for early success and promise.Of seven children born to Leopold and Anna Maria Mozart, only the fourth, Maria Anna (Nannerl), born 31 July 1751, and the youngest, Wolfgang Amadeus, born 27 January 1756, survived infancy. The children were educated at home, under Leopold's guidance, learning basic skills in reading, writing, drawing and arithmetic, together with some history and geography. Their musical education was aided by exposure to the constant rehearsing and playing of Leopold and his fellow musicians.

Write an article based on this \\"Nye Davies of Cardiff University's Wales Governance Centre assesses the Welsh Labour campaign for the general election.\\" Article:","output":"Title: An In-depth Analysis of the Welsh Labour Campaign for the General Election by Nye Davies Introduction Nye Davies, a renowned expert from Cardiff University's Wales Governance Centre, has recently taken a closer look at the Welsh Labour campaign for the upcoming general election. Davies’ assessment offers a comprehensive analysis of the strategies and objectives of the party, as well as the potential challenges and outcomes they may face. This article highlights the key findings of his assessment and sheds light on the various aspects of the Welsh Labour campaign. The Current State of the Welsh Labour Party The Welsh Labour Party has enjoyed considerable political dominance in Wales, governing the devolved administration since the establishment of the National Assembly for Wales in 1999. The party has historically played a crucial role in the United Kingdom's political landscape, providing significant representation in the country's Parliament. Heading into the general election, however, the Welsh Labour Party faces several challenges, such as dealing with Brexit's impact, the rise of other national parties in recent years, and the current political climate within the United Kingdom. In light of these challenges, Davies emphasizes the need for the party to quickly adapt and develop a focused and coherent campaign strategy to retain its influence and electoral success in Wales. Welsh Labour Campaign: Objectives and Strategies To better understand the party’s strategies and objectives, Davies identifies several key areas that the Welsh Labour campaign is focusing on for the general election: 1. Grounding an effective campaign message: Welsh Labour is working on establishing a strong and convincing message that resonates with its traditional voter base and attracts undecided voters. By emphasizing its commitment to social justice, economic opportunity, and public spending, the party aims to convince the electorate that it is best suited to lead the country. 2. Engaging with traditional supporters: Historically, the Labour Party has had a strong and steady base of support within Wales, particularly in working-class communities. In his analysis, Davies highlights the importance of engaging with these traditional supporters while adapting to the changing political landscape to expand their reach among the electorate. 3. Navigating Brexit: The issue of Brexit has been divisive for the United Kingdom and has had a profound effect on political dynamics within the country. Welsh Labour's approach to this complex issue has evolved over time, and the party has recently adopted a more pro-Remain stance. The campaign must now carefully balance its Brexit strategies to appeal to both remain and leave voters within its supporter base. 4. Emphasizing local issues: Welsh Labour aims to demonstrate its understanding of and commitment to addressing local challenges and priorities. The campaign is focusing on topics such as economic development, healthcare, education, and social care, allowing the party to showcase its policies directed at improving the quality of life in Wales. 5. Responding to the rise of other national parties: With the emergence of both Plaid Cymru and the Brexit Party in recent years, the Welsh Labour campaign must rise to the challenge and devise strategies that effectively counter the influence of these parties within Wales. Possible Challenges and Outcomes Facing a dynamic and evolving political landscape, the Welsh Labour party may encounter several challenges that could impact the success of its campaign and affect its electoral prospects. Davies identifies the following potential challenges: 1. Brexit fallout: Brexit's political implications could negatively affect the party's support base, as some voters may opt for more definitive stances on Brexit, either from pro-remain or pro-leave parties. 2. Competition with other national parties: As Plaid Cymru and the Brexit Party continue to gain traction in Wales, the Welsh Labour party must contend with the added challenge of competing against parties that capitalize on nationalist sentiment or specific Brexit-focused policies. 3. Party image: Welsh Labour must work diligently to maintain its image as the party of choice for working-class voters. Any perceived policy missteps or weakening of this image could potentially result in lost support. Conclusion As the general election rapidly approaches, the Welsh Labour campaign faces numerous challenges and uncertainties. Nye Davies' thorough assessment provides valuable insight into the strategies, local and national objectives, and potential outcomes for the Welsh Labour Party. Fulfilling these objectives and overcoming the challenges may be crucial for the party to remain politically influential and ensure its continued success in Wales."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Which statement describes animal embryos?","output":"Animal embryos refer to the early developmental stages of multicellular animals following fertilization. They showcase numerous essential and common features across various animal species, highlighting their evolutionary relationships and providing insights into their growth and developmental processes. Several statements can be made to accurately describe animal embryos: 1. Formation through fertilization: Animal embryos are formed as a result of the fertilization process, wherein a sperm cell from the male fuses with an egg cell from the female, leading to the formation of a single-celled zygote. This process marks the beginning of embryonic development and sets off a series of mitotic cell divisions, leading to the differentiation of various cell types, tissues, and organs. 2. Developmental stages: Animal embryos generally go through a series of developmental stages, which may vary depending on the animal species. These stages include cleavage, gastrulation, and organogenesis. Cleavage refers to rapid cell divisions without significant growth, leading to the formation of a blastula. Gastrulation involves the arrangement of embryonic cells into distinct cell layers, called germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm), which eventually give rise to different tissues and organs. Organogenesis is the process of organ formation from the germ layers. 3. Cell differentiation: Animal embryos undergo extensive cell differentiation, which is the process by which different cell types arise from the initial undifferentiated cells known as stem cells. As embryonic development progresses, cells become specialized and committed to their specific roles, ultimately forming various tissues and organs and contributing to the functional complexity of an adult organism. 4. Common features and patterns: Among different animal species, there are common features observed in embryonic development. One such key feature is known as the Hox genes, which define the anterior-posterior body axis and pattern. These genes are conserved across multiple animal taxa, signifying evolutionary homology and shared regulatory mechanisms for embryonic development. 5. Morphogen gradients: Embryonic development is guided by morphogen gradients, which are spatial concentration gradients of signaling molecules, known as morphogens. These gradients play a role in determining the cells' identity, location, and fate in the developing embryo by providing positional information and regulating gene expression patterns. 6. Induction and gene regulation: Throughout the development of animal embryos, intercellular signaling, induction, and gene regulation are critical components. Cell-to-cell communication and signaling pathways help to coordinate the development process, allowing specific interactions to occur between cells and tissues. This precise coordination helps to ensure the correct formation of body plans, organs, and structures in the developing organism. 7. Plasticity and regeneration: Some animal embryos exhibit a degree of plasticity, meaning they can adjust their development in response to disturbances in their environment or manipulations during the developmental process. Additionally, certain animals, such as amphibians and some invertebrates, can regenerate lost or damaged tissue during embryonic development, showcasing the dynamic nature of these early stages of life. In summary, animal embryos represent the early stages of development in multicellular organisms. They are characterized by a series of organized and coordinated developmental stages, including cleavage, gastrulation, and organogenesis. Throughout these stages, cell differentiation, common patterns, morphogen gradients, induction, gene regulation, and plasticity all contribute to the formation of a fully functional adult organism from a single-celled zygote. The study of animal embryos offers valuable insights into the fundamental principles of development and evolution, as well as potential applications in regenerative medicine and other biological research areas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In this case, let's choose a mystery thriller set in the late 2010s. The movie will take place in a busy metropolitan city, where Spencer and Henry both work at a successful tech company. Step 2: Develop the main characters Spencer is a talented software engineer but somewhat introverted and reserved. He's followed his passion for technology throughout his life and tends to focus on work more than his personal relationships, making his friendship with Henry unique and valuable. Henry, on the other hand, is an outgoing sales representative at the same tech company. He has a natural charisma that helps him form connections easily with clients. Despite their differing personalities, Spencer and Henry have forged a close bond over the years due to a shared love for technology and their sense of humor. Step 3: Introduce the central conflict The plot begins when a valuable piece of unreleased software goes missing from the company's secure database. The higher-ups suspect an insider was responsible for the theft and hire a private investigator to track down the culprit. Tensions rise in the workplace as suspicions mount, putting Spencer and Henry's friendship to the test. Step 4: Add subplots and secondary characters As the investigation progresses, several subplots emerge, such as: 1. Spencer's burgeoning romantic relationship with a fellow software engineer, which begins to grow strained due to the mounting pressure at work. 2. Henry's family life. He is married with two young children, and the financial repercussions of possibly losing his job due to the investigation put a strain on his household. 3. The private investigator, Cassandra, who has her own motivations for solving the case. She is using the investigation to prove her worth to secure a promotion within her agency. Step 5: Reach the climax As the movie reaches its climax, it is revealed that it was actually a competing company that infiltrated the secure database with the aid of an unsuspecting insider, who was manipulated by the rival company. The mole turns out to be someone Spencer and Henry least suspect—a trusted coworker who was struggling financially and saw no other way out. Step 6: Resolve the story With the truth revealed, the trust between Spencer and Henry is restored, and their friendship becomes even stronger. Spencer and his romantic interest overcome their difficulties and commit to better communication. Henry decides to focus more on his family's needs and reassesses his priorities. The outcome of the investigation leads to the rival company facing severe consequences for their corporate espionage. Step 7: Conclude by setting up potential sequel In the final moments of the movie, the audience gets a hint that there may be other corporate espionage activities happening within the tech industry, possibly setting up for a sequel in which Spencer, Henry, and Cassandra team up to expose and take down these illegal practices. In summary, the movie starts with the introduction of Spencer and Henry, their jobs, friendship, and personal struggles. It evolves into a thrilling and suspenseful mystery with unforeseen twists and turns, culminating in the restoration of trust and the strengthening of their friendship. Along the way, subplots and secondary characters add depth and complexity to the overall story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In the United States, the verdict in criminal cases must be unanimous. A non-unanimous verdict results in a hung jury which in turn forces a mistrial. The question they are deciding is whether the defendant, a teenaged boy from a city slum, murdered his father. The jury is further instructed that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence. Under current American criminal law, a defendant must first be found guilty, and then the jury in the sentencing phase must find an aggravating circumstance and unanimously agree to recommend the death penalty, if the state has the death penalty.[citation needed] The jury of twelve retires to the jury room, where they begin to become acquainted with their personalities and discuss the case. The story revolves around their difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict, mainly because of the personal prejudices of several of the jurors. An initial vote is taken and eleven of the jurors vote for conviction. Juror number 8, the lone dissenter, states that the evidence presented is circumstantial and the boy deserves a fair deliberation, upon which he questions the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder, the fact that the knife used in the murder is not as unusual as the testimony indicates (he produces an identical one from his pocket), and the overall shady circumstances. Having argued several points, Juror 8 requests another vote, this time by secret ballot.

Select the topic that this about: PARIS -- Newly armed with Yasser Arafat's medical dossier, his nephew pinned blame on Israel for the late Palestinian leader's death and refused yesterday to squelch rumors of poisoning -- although he acknowledged that doctors found no known poisons.","output":"Topic: Allegations of Yasser Arafat's Death and Possible Poisoning Involving Israel On November 11, 2004, the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat passed away at the age of 75 in a French military hospital in Paris. He had been flown there on October 29, after his health suddenly deteriorated while living in his partially destroyed headquarters in Ramallah, West Bank, under Israeli siege since 2002. Arafat was a highly influential figure in the Palestinian struggle for statehood and a symbol of resistance against the Israeli occupation. His death raised many questions, and several theories emerged surrounding the cause of his sudden illness. French medical authorities conducted a thorough examination but could not determine a conclusive cause of death, which only fueled the speculation. One prominent theory was that Yasser Arafat was poisoned, with Israel being accused of orchestrating his assassination. Arafat's nephew, Nasser al-Kidwa, who was the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations at the time, received Yasser Arafat's medical report from French doctors. Despite the absence of any definitive evidence of poisoning, al-Kidwa accused Israel of being responsible for his uncle's death. He did not dismiss the poisoning allegations, stating that the possibility of \\"invisible or difficult to detect substances\\" remained open. This statement only intensified suspicions and fueled the controversy surrounding Arafat's death. There are a few reasons why al-Kidwa and others might have suspected Israel of involvement in Arafat's death. First, there was the historical animosity between Israel and Arafat, who was seen as a key obstacle to Israel's security and a sponsor of Palestinian terrorism, including suicide bombings and armed attacks against Israeli civilians and military personnel. Second, Arafat's state of health seemed to deteriorate rapidly, which raised questions about whether external factors may have caused this sudden decline. Third, some Palestinian officials claimed that Arafat's symptoms, which included abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea, resembled those of poisoning victims. However, the French medical team who treated Arafat could not identify any known poisons or toxic substances in his bloodstream or body. They diagnosed him with a blood disorder, disseminated intravascular coagulation, which can have various causes, including infection, cancer, or autoimmune disease. Since no definitive cause was identified, the question of poisoning remained unresolved, and the idea that Israel may have played a role in Arafat's death continued to circulate. In 2012, Arafat's widow, Suha Arafat, requested the exhumation of her husband's remains due to new information. Swiss, Russian, and French scientists conducted an investigation to determine if Arafat was poisoned with polonium-210, an extremely lethal radioactive substance. The Swiss team found traces of polonium-210 in Arafat's personal belongings, but the Russians and the French did not reach the same conclusions. The results of this investigation remained inconclusive and could neither confirm nor rule out the presence of polonium-210 or any other poison in Arafat's remains. In conclusion, the exact cause of Yasser Arafat's death remains uncertain, even after considering the various investigations carried out after his passing. Although his nephew, Nasser al-Kidwa, accused Israel of being involved in the death and could not rule out poisoning, the medical examinations and investigations conducted have not provided conclusive evidence of any foul play. Despite the lack of definitive proof, the mystery surrounding Arafat's death has led many to continue to believe that Israel played a role in his demise, further fueling tensions between Israelis and Palestinians."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Growing up, she cut everyone in our family’s hair; she dyed mine whenever I wanted, and whatever crazy color I wanted, too. Until I was a senior in high school, I had never been to a salon. I don’t even remember why I went this time. Mom was going to have her hair done, and I had tagged along. She asked if I wanted a cut too and I said why not? So while Mom was getting her hair done I looked through the books and picked out a cute pageboy style that I liked. Finally it was my turn and after talking with the stylist and showing her what I wanted, she led me to the shampoo station. Now, as everybody who has ever been to a salon knows, you sit back in the chair with your neck in the indentation and they wash your hair. But I had never been to a salon. When mom washed my hair after dyeing it, I always leaned over the sink. So … I started to climb into the chair and lean over the sink here, too. My mom was mortified and the stylist couldn’t figure out what in the heck I was doing. Mom calls out, “No, Jennifer … you sit in the chair.” I look over my shoulder at her and then realize what I’ve done. Red-faced, I stand up and then turn around to sit and lean back in the chair. I honestly wanted to die right there. I’m pretty sure the stylist thought I was developmentally delayed or something because she talked to me for the rest of the time like one would talk to a three-year-old. Mom tried to explain that I’d never been to a salon before, but I think that just made the situation worse. Thankfully I’ve been to many salons now and understand how everything works, but I’ve never returned to THAT one. Question: What career is Jennifer aiming for?

Afterwards, he directly addresses the audience, and gives them a tour of Cherry Tree Lane, stopping outside the Banks family's home. George Banks returns home to learn from his wife, Winifred, that Katie Nanna has left their service after Jane and Michael ran away again. They are returned shortly after by Constable Jones, who reveals the children were chasing a lost kite. The children ask their father to help build a better kite, but he dismisses them. Taking it upon himself to hire a new nanny, Mr. Banks advertises for a stern, no-nonsense nanny. Instead, Jane and Michael present their own advertisement for a kinder, sweeter nanny. Mr. Banks rips up the letter, and throws the scraps in the fireplace, but the remains of the advertisement magically float up, and out into the air.

There, they are placed in an underground labyrinth to be sacrifices to the Minotaur, the Minoan god. Theo, son of Cyrnan, the village chieftain, is haunted by the loss of his love, Fion, in an earlier sacrifice. A leprous prophetess tells him that Fion is still alive in the labyrinth. Against his father's wishes, he replaces one of the sacrifices and is taken to the Minos Empire capitol. Other captives are Danu (Theo's best friend), Morna (Danu's love interest), Tyro (who initially resents Theo because of his standing), Didi (Tyro's love interest), Vena, Ziko and Nan. After the group are dropped into the labyrinth, the Minotaur immediately begins hunting them and kills Nan. The survivors are approached by Queen Raphaella, Deucalion's sister and unwilling lover, who offers them a way out. Vena does not believe her, and when she attempts to leave the group, the Minotaur impales her with its horn. The rest of the group evade the Minotaur and, led by Raphaella, they get to a chamber at the center of the labyrinth. There, the monster lies asleep on its victims's remains, and a heavy wooden door leads out of the labyrinth. Raphaella had arranged for her servant Ramaya to open the door from the other side, but Deucalion catches the servant and has her executed. Desperate, the group attempt to break down the door. The noise wakes the Minotaur, which kills Ziko and splits up the group. Theo, Danu, and Morna encounter Turag, a villager from a previous offering. Turag has managed to elude the Minotaur thus far, but has become slightly insane over the years.

Q: As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \\"outdated and unduly harsh\\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country’s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction. The American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice...

Paradox: A statement or situation that seems self-contradictory or logically absurd, but upon a closer examination, may reveal a hidden, profound truth. Step 3: Compare and contrast the terms. Irony involves the use of words or situations to convey a meaning opposite from the literal sense, whereas contradiction refers to the opposition between two statements or ideas. Paradox, on the other hand, is a self-contradictory statement or situation that may contain hidden truth. 2. What is the difference between irony and paradox? Step 1: Analyze the question's components. This question is asking for distinctions between two specific terms: irony and paradox. Step 2: Define the terms. These terms have been defined in the first comparison. Step 3: Compare and contrast the terms. In this case, the comparison is given between irony, where the intended meaning is opposed to the conventional sense, and paradox, a statement or situation that appears to be self-contradictory, but may hold a deeper truth. 3. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Step 1: Evaluate the common elements. Both questions involve seeking differences between terms. Also, irony and paradox are shared as components of both inquiries. Step 2: Identify the disparities. The first question encompasses three terms (irony, contradiction, and paradox) and asks for distinctions, while the second question focuses on comparing only irony and paradox. Step 3: Assess paraphrasing. Paraphrasing means restating the same idea or meaning in different words. Since the first question includes the comparison of an additional term (contradiction), it does not entirely convey the same meaning as the second question, although there are similarities. Conclusion: The two questions are not paraphrases of each other because they are addressing slightly different comparisons. The first question wants to know the difference among irony, contradiction, and paradox, while the second question specifically inquires about the difference between irony and paradox."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 1905, the Qing sent Zhao Erfeng to Tibet to retaliate against rebellions. By 1908, Zhao was appointed imperial resident in Lhasa. Zhao was beheaded in December 1911 by pro-Republican forces. The bulk of the area that was historically known as Kham was now claimed to be the Xikang Administrative District, created by the Republican revolutionaries. By the end of 1912, the last Manchu troops were forced out of Tibet through India. Thubten Gyatso, the 13th Dalai Lama, returned to Tibet in January 1913 from Sikkim, where he had been residing. When the new ROC government apologised for the actions of the Qing and offered to restore the Dalai Lama to his former position, he replied that he was not interested in Chinese ranks, that Tibet had never been subordinated to China, that Tibet was an independent country, and that he was assuming the spiritual and political leadership of Tibet. Because of this, many have read this reply as a formal declaration of independence. The Chinese side ignored the response, and Tibet had thirty years free of interference from China. How many years after Zhao Erfeng was sent to Tibet was he appointed imperial resident in Lhasa?","output":"Zhao Erfeng was sent to Tibet in 1905, and he was appointed imperial resident in Lhasa in 1908.

A:","output":"No, \\"Originally, the runtimes were only installed by games or explicitly by the user.\\" would not be a reasonable answer to the question \\"what is compatible with DirectX 9.0b?\\". Instead, a more appropriate answer would be: DirectX 9.0b is a version of Microsoft's DirectX API, which is a collection of application programming interfaces (APIs) for handling multimedia-related tasks, particularly game programming and video, on Microsoft platforms. Compatibility with DirectX 9.0b includes hardware (graphics cards) as well as software (games and applications). For hardware components, you would need a graphics card that supports DirectX 9.0b features, such as Shader Model 2.0 or higher, and the appropriate drivers to enable its functionality. For software compatibility, games and applications designed with DirectX 9.0b support will work on systems with the required DirectX 9.0b runtime libraries installed. Many older games released during the period when DirectX 9.0b was popular (around 2003-2004) would likely support this version of DirectX. Additionally, some games and applications could still offer backwards compatibility support even if they were built on newer DirectX versions.

A study into how lazy British people are has found more than half of the adults are so idle   that they'd catch the lift rather than climb two flights of stairs. Just over 2,000 people were quizzed by independent researchers at Nuffield Health, Britain's largest health center. The results were extremely surprising. About one in six people questioned said if their remote control was broken, they would continue watching the same channel rather than get up. More than one third of those questioned said they would not run to catch a bus. Worryingly, of the 654 respondents with children, 64% said they were often too tired to play with them. This led the report to conclude that it's no wonder that one in six children in the UK are classified as obese (very fat) before they start school. Dr Sarah Dauncey, medical director of Nuffield Health, said, \\"People need to get fitter, not just for their own sake, but for the sake of their families, friends and evidently (;) their pets too.\\" \\"If we don't start to take control of this problem, a whole generation will become too unfit to perform even the most fundamental tasks.\\" And Scotland's largest city, Glasgow, was shamed as the most idle city in the UK, with 75% questioned admitting they do not get enough exercise, followed closely by Birmingham and Southampton, both with 67%. The results bring serious challenges for the National Health Service, where obesity-related illnesses such as heart disease and cancer have been on a steady increase for the past 40 years and are costing billions of pounds every year.

Possible answers: - no; - yes;","output":"Yes, both questions have the same meaning as they are inquiring about the reasons behind a late menstrual period. A woman's period being late can be attributed to various factors. Here is a detailed explanation of the possible causes: 1. Pregnancy: One of the most common reasons for a late period is pregnancy. Fertilization of the egg by sperm causes hormonal changes, which can lead to a missed period. If you are sexually active, it is advised to take a pregnancy test to confirm or rule out pregnancy as the cause of your late period. 2. Stress: Stress has a significant impact on the body, including the menstrual cycle. High levels of stress can disrupt the production of hormones needed for ovulation and menstruation, causing an irregular or missed period. 3. Changes in weight: Both rapid weight loss and weight gain can lead to hormonal imbalances that affect the menstrual cycle. Maintaining a healthy and stable weight can help regulate periods. 4. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): This hormonal disorder causes small cysts to form on the ovaries, which can lead to irregular or missed periods. Other symptoms of PCOS include excessive hair growth, acne, and weight gain. 5. Birth control: Hormonal birth control methods, such as pills, patches, and intrauterine devices (IUDs), can alter the menstrual cycle and cause irregular or missed periods. Additionally, after stopping hormonal birth control, it might take some time for the menstrual cycle to return to normal. 6. Thyroid issues: An overactive or underactive thyroid gland can cause hormonal imbalances that affect the menstrual cycle, leading to irregular periods. Consulting with a healthcare professional and getting appropriate treatment can help regulate periods. 7. Chronic illnesses and certain medications: Certain chronic conditions, like uncontrolled diabetes and Celiac disease, can affect the menstrual cycle. Some medications, such as antidepressants and antipsychotics, can also disrupt hormonal balance, leading to irregular periods. 8. Perimenopause: As women approach menopause, periods can become irregular, causing late or missed periods. Perimenopause typically begins in a woman's 40s, but it can start earlier for some. 9. Excessive exercise: Intense physical activity can cause hormonal imbalances, leading to a disrupted menstrual cycle. It is essential to maintain a balance between exercise and rest so as not to adversely affect the body's natural processes. 10. Eating disorders: Eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia can cause hormonal imbalances due to malnutrition and rapid weight loss, ultimately affecting the menstrual cycle. If your period is consistently late or irregular, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause and initiate any necessary treatment or lifestyle changes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ever since those first interactions we have become really close friends. Today Stuart turns 40 and I just wanted to share a few words about how remarkable a human being he is. Many of you who have listened to Stuart on Bad Voltage, seen him speak, worked with him, or socialized with him will know him for his larger than life personality. He is funny, warm, and passionate about his family, friends, and technology. He is opinionated, and many of you will know him for the amusing, insightful, and tremendously articulate way in which he expresses his views.

After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.

The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  Story: Greg is studying the environmental impact of agriculture. He noticed that in his own state a lake near agricultural lands has been declared as a dead zone. For his study Greg labeled this zone as zone A.

Article: Every day my husband parked his car in the same open-air car park in Zimbabwe. On this particular day, he had been running to his car with a pile of office papers under his arm. As he opened the car door, he suddenly lost control of his body. He felt a stabbing pain in his arm, and became totally breathless and lost consciousness. As he fell down, half in, half out of the car, his last thought was \\"what a way to die\\". A young woman getting into her own car in the deserted car park noticed what was going on and at once ran to my husband's aid, trying to bring his life back. Realizing time was important, she tried to move my husband to her car, calling the guard at the gate. Fearing an ambulance would take too long to arrive, she felt it better to get to the hospital as quickly as she could. She raced through traffic lights sounding her car's horn and rushed into the hospital, calling out, \\"I have an unknown man here who I think is having a heart attack. Having realized he was in capable hands, the woman returned to the car park, found his keys on the ground, collected his papers and piled them in the car. Having seen my husband come out of a certain building each day, the security guard thought he knew where he worked. The young woman managed to locate his colleagues and they in turn contacted my niece, who waited for me to return home so she could break the news to me.

Bowie was born David Robert Jones on 8 January 1947 in Brixton, London. His mother, Margaret Mary \\"Peggy\\" (née Burns; 2 October 1913 – 2 April 2001), was born at Shorncliffe Army Camp near Cheriton, Kent. Her paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants who had settled in Manchester. She worked as a waitress at a cinema in Royal Tunbridge Wells. His father, Haywood Stenton \\"John\\" Jones (21 November 1912 – 5 August 1969), was from Doncaster, and worked as a promotions officer for the children's charity Barnardo's. The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, on the boundary between Brixton and Stockwell in the south London borough of Lambeth. Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child—and a defiant brawler.In 1953, Bowie moved with his family to Bromley. Two years later, he started attending Burnt Ash Junior School. His voice was considered \\"adequate\\" by the school choir, and he demonstrated above-average abilities in playing the recorder. At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly-introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations \\"vividly artistic\\" and his poise \\"astonishing\\" for a child. The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American 45s by artists including the Teenagers, the Platters, Fats Domino, Elvis Presley, and Little Richard.

PUBLISHED:. 04:00 EST, 11 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 09:13 EST, 11 November 2013. Shiva: Katarzyna. Dryden-Chouen said the cannabis was. to have been offered to the god ahead of Dec 21 last year, when she. believed the world would end. A woman who said she grew cannabis to. sacrifice to the Hindu god Shiva because the world was about to end has. been cleared of intending to supply the drug. Katarzyna. Dryden-Chouen, 46, and her husband Clive, 60, had been accused of. making £277,000 by dealing cannabis over a six year period. Police alleged that almost £13,000 found in their home in Littledean, Gloucestershire, was also the proceeds of drug dealing. But. Mrs Dryden-Chouen, who is originally from Poland, insisted that apart. from what she and her husband smoked, the cannabis was to be burnt as a. religious sacrifice. Mrs. Dryden-Chouen, who claimed to have a talking pet mouse, said it would. all have been offered to Shiva ahead of December 21 last year, when she. believed the world would end. She. and her husband admitted growing the cannabis. Plants capable of. yielding up to 2.9lb of the drug - worth about £6,000 - were found. growing throughout their home, a former pub. But. they denied having the drug with intent to supply as well as money. laundering charges and were found not guilty adter a three-week trial at. Gloucester Crown Court. Her. husband said that the £13,000 cash and the £277,000 which went through. their hands in six years was the proceeds of his business converting. cars to run on liquid petroleum gas. He admitted he did not have a bank account and had not paid tax on income which he said he was paid in cash. The. main evidence in the trial had been detailed diaries kept by Mrs. Dryden-Chouen in which she appeared to note details of cannabis growing. and selling. But she. told the jury the notes were a fiction, created in her imagination as. she meditated for long periods at a time without eating. The couple had both pleaded guilty at the start of the trial to cultivating cannabis between January 2009 and August 2012. Mrs Dryden-Chouen denied possessing cannabis with intent to supply between November 2003 and January 2004. She and her husband both denied a similar charge between January 2004 and January 2009 and a third charge relating to the period between January 2009 and August last year when police raided their home. Mr and Mrs Dryden-Chouen further denied a money laundering offence - converting £277,559 which was the proceeds of crime between June 2006 and August 2012. They also denied that the £12,890 found near a 'shrine' in the house was criminal property - the proceeds of drug dealing. Mrs Dryden-Chouen denied a further charge of possessing diazepam tablets with intent to supply on 6th July 2012. After almost five-and-a-half hours of deliberations, a jury found the couple not guilty of all outstanding charges. But Judge Alastair McGrigor warned them they may still face jail on the cultivation of cannabis charge. He bailed them for pre-sentence reports and adjourned to a date to be fixed. The jury heard that when Mrs Dryden-Chouen was arrested in July last year she said she was a homeopath and healer and that she did not know having cannabis was illegal. She said she grew cannabis for religious purposes and medical research. She also said she believed the world was coming to an end on December 21 last year and she intended to create a Homa (a burning pit) for a ceremony to burn the cannabis. Gloucester Crown Court: Judge Alastair McGrigor warned the couple they may still face jail on the cultivation of cannabis charge. He bailed them for pre-sentence reports and adjourned to a date to be fixed. Prosecutor Paul Grumbar said that 'just about every room in the house had cannabis in it' when police stormed in. In all, said Mr Grumbar, the police recovered 15 established plants and 41 juvenile ones which would have yielded 2.866lb of flowering head cannabis. The drug sells for about £2,250 a pound. Also found in three locations in the property were 1,844 blue Diazepam tablets. And in a white metal box in an office/meditation room there was £12,890 in cash which the prosecution claimed was the proceeds of drug dealing. After the jury gave its verdict the judge asked whether Mr Dryden-Chouen might now be prosecuted for not paying income tax. He said it would be helpful to know before he passes sentence on the couple whether the Customs and Revenue will be following that up. Mr Grumbar said: 'The Revenue will no doubt be contacted.' Judge McGrigor granted Mr Grumbar's application to have all the drugs and growing paraphernalia found in the house destroyed. Bailing the couple he told them: 'This matter is not entirely over. You are going to be sentenced in relation to the material that was found in the house. All options are still open to the court.' What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

Speaking to CBS News in a two-part interview, the 68-year-old former president said he thought it was 'the right decision' to take military action in 2003 in a bid to oust Saddam Hussein. But he added: 'My regret is that…a violent group of people have risen up again…This is \\"Al-Qaeda plus\\"…they need to be defeated. And I hope we do…I hope the strategy works.' Scroll down for video. Former president: George W. Bush (pictured speaking to CBS News in a two-part interview that will air on Sunday) has only one regret about invading Iraq - that it paved the way for the rise of the Islamic State. Militant: Bush told correspondent Bob Schieffer: 'My regret is that…a violent group of people have risen up again…This is \\"Al-Qaeda plus\\"…they need to be defeated.' Above, an ISIS militant in Raqqa, Syria. During the interview with Washington correspondent Bob Schieffer,  Bush also revealed that when he threatened to invade Iraq, then-president Hussein did not take him seriously. 'You know, when he was captured... I was told that the FBI agent that talked to him, he said \\"I just didn’t believe Bush,\\"' he said. 'And it’s hard for me to believe he didn’t believe me.' 'In retrospect…I don’t see how he could doubt my word,' Bush, who is currently promoting his new book, '41: A Portrait Of My Father', which is a biography of his father, George H.W. Bush, added. The 2003 invasion of Iraq, which spanned March 19 to May 1 that year, signaled the start of the Iraq War, which claimed the lives of nearly half a million people. Discussing the war: During the interview, the 68-year-old former president (pictured, right, with Schieffer), said he thought it was 'the right decision' to take military action in 2003 in a bid to oust Saddam Hussein. After the invasion: Bush is pictured addressing the nation aboard the nuclear aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln on May 1, 2003. He declared major fighting over in Iraq, calling it 'one victory in a war on terror' Former Iraqi president: During the interview with Washington correspondent Bob Schieffer, Bush also revealed that when he threatened to invade Iraq, then-president Hussein (pictured) did not take him seriously. In December 2011, under the orders of President Barack Obama, all U.S. troops departed from Iraq, bringing the American mission in the war-torn country to an end. However, in the past few years, ISIS has quickly risen to power in  Iraq and Syria, taking control of swathes of both countries. In June, the terror group overran Mosul, Iraq's second largest city. On Saturday, American warplanes reportedly launched a strike on a gathering of ISIS rebels in al-Qaim, Syria, critically wounding their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Bush's two-part interview will air on CBS News's Sunday Morning at 9am on Sunday, as well as the channel's 'Face The Nation' at 10.30am the same day. 'Critically injured': On Saturday, American warplanes reportedly launched a strike on a gathering of ISIS rebels in al-Qaim, Syria, critically wounding their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) In the biography, Bush also reveals his father, now 90, seriously considered not running for re-election in 1992, even though he loved his job. This is because he felt his role was creating scrutiny of his son, Neil Bush, who was facing a federal lawsuit. 'It killed him to see Neil singled out because he was the President's son,' Bush wrote. The book also discusses George H.W. Bush's decision to launch the first war in Iraq in 1991, his early failures in politics and his stinging defeat to Bill Clinton  in 1992.

W: One of the most interesting experiments with dolphins must be one done by Doctor Jarvis Bastian. What he tried to do was to teach a male dolphin called Bass and a female called Doris to communicate with each other across a solid barrier.  M: So how did he do it exactly?  W: Well, first of all, he kept the two dolphins together in the same tank and taught them to press levers whenever they saw a light. The levers were fitted to the side of the tank next to each other. If the light flashed on and off several times, the dolphins were supposed to press the left-hand lever followed by the right-hand one. If the light was kept steady, the dolphins were supposed to press the levers in reverse order. Whenever they responded correctly, they were rewarded with fish.  M: Sounds terribly complicated.  W: Well, that was the first stage. In the second stage, Doctor Bastian separated the dolphins into two tanks. They could still hear one another, but they couldn't actually see each other. The levers and light were set up in exactly the same way except that this time it was only Doris who could see the light indicating which lever to press first. But in order to get their fish, both dolphins had to press the levers in the correct order. This meant of course that Doris had to tell Bass whether it was a flashing light or whether it was a steady light.  M: So did it work?  W: Well, amazingly enough, the dolphins achieved a 100 % success rate.  Question: How did the second stage of the experiment differ from the first stage?   - Only one dolphin was able to see the light.  - The male dolphin received more rewards.  - Both dolphins were put in the same tank. Answer:","output":"The second stage of the experiment differed from the first stage in that only one dolphin, Doris, was able to see the light.

Let us analyze and break down the premise to understand it better and establish the logical reasoning behind this conclusion. Premise: \\"And they then check that name against their list and they find several and without even bothering to try to match up any other information at all they just report everything under that name.\\" 1. \\"And they then check that name against their list\\": This statement indicates that there is a pre-existing list, which contains names (and possibly other relevant information). The task being performed is to cross-validate the name against this given list. 2. \\"And they find several\\": Here, it is mentioned that after checking the name against the list, several entries with that name are identified on the list. 3. \\"Without even bothering to try to match up any other information at all\\": This statement suggests that there might be additional information accompanying the names on the list, but those conducting the task do not take it into consideration. They ignore potentially relevant data points that could be useful for further narrowing down their search or ensuring more accurate reporting. 4. \\"They just report everything under that name\\": The final part of the premise emphasizes that the only action taken after identifying several entries with that name is reporting everything under that name without cross-referencing or matching any other data. Putting these points together, we can analyze that the individuals involved in this situation hold a list containing names (and possibly other information) and perform the task of checking a specific name against the list. Upon finding entries with that name, instead of refining their search or verifying additional details, they choose to report everything associated with that name. Thus, considering the information and actions detailed in the premise, we can confirm that the hypothesis, \\"They check the name against their list and report everything.\\", is true. This conclusion aligns with the given premise, acknowledging that the entire process revolves around checking a name against a list and reporting the findings without further investigation or validation of any accompanying details."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","output":"The answer \\"volume\\" to the question \\"what does energy enter in the form of sunlight or chemical compounds?\\" is not accurate in the context you provided. This is because the term \\"volume\\" typically refers to the amount of space a substance or object occupies and doesn't directly address the manner in which energy enters an organism or its habitat. In an ecological context, primary energy enters ecosystems through two main pathways: sunlight, which is converted into chemical energy by autotrophic organisms through a process called photosynthesis; and chemical compounds, wherein some organisms, like certain bacteria known as chemosynthetic organisms, can convert inorganic compounds into useful energy.  For photosynthetic organisms, light energy from the sun is harnessed and used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (a simple sugar) and oxygen. The glucose is then used to fuel the organism's activities, and any excess is stored for later use. This stored glucose provides energy for the rest of the ecosystem, as other organisms eat the photosynthesizers (or eat those that have eaten the photosynthesizers) and break down the glucose to release the stored energy. On the other hand, chemosynthetic bacteria are less common and typically found in extreme environments, like deep-sea vents, where sunlight does not reach. These organisms manufacture their own food by combining hydrogen sulfide spewed from the vents with oxygen and carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and sulfur, a process that also releases energy stored in the chemical bonds. Therefore, in the specific scenario of organisms and their habitats, energy principally enters as sunlight, which is then converted into chemical energy within the tissues of photosynthetic organisms, or directly as chemical compounds in certain unique ecological circumstances. So, an accurate answer to the question “what does energy enter in the form of sunlight or chemical compounds?” could be “light energy and chemical energy” or “sunlight and inorganic compounds.” Using \\"volume\\" as an answer is not pertinent as it does not correctly portray the forms of energy in play in this situation."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you are given a sentence and a gender.

In March 1861, Victoria's mother died, with Victoria at her side. Through reading her mother's papers, Victoria discovered that her mother had loved her deeply; she was heart-broken, and blamed Conroy and Lehzen for \\"wickedly\\" estranging her from her mother. To relieve his wife during her intense and deep grief, Albert took on most of her duties, despite being ill himself with chronic stomach trouble. In August, Victoria and Albert visited their son, the Prince of Wales, who was attending army manoeuvres near Dublin, and spent a few days holidaying in Killarney. In November, Albert was made aware of gossip that his son had slept with an actress in Ireland. Appalled, Albert travelled to Cambridge, where his son was studying, to confront him. By the beginning of December, Albert was very unwell. He was diagnosed with typhoid fever by William Jenner, and died on 14 December 1861. Victoria was devastated. She blamed her husband's death on worry over the Prince of Wales's philandering. He had been \\"killed by that dreadful business\\", she said. She entered a state of mourning and wore black for the remainder of her life. She avoided public appearances, and rarely set foot in London in the following years.

Yes B. No Answer:","output":"A. Yes The given product review can be considered negative for several reasons. First, the title \\"not as advertised\\" suggests that the customer felt misled by the product description or marketing materials. This commonly indicates a negative experience as the customer's expectations were not met, and they are disappointed by the discrepancy between the product's claims and its actual performance. Second, the content of the review reinforces this negative sentiment. The reviewer states that the product claimed to be a universal clipper set for Oster hair clippers but unfortunately did not fit their Oster model. This means that the product either has compatibility issues or was not accurately described, both of which contribute to customer frustration and dissatisfaction. Furthermore, the use of the word \\"funny\\" in the sentence, \\"Funny that they don't fit on my Oster,\\" indicates sarcasm or disappointment on the part of the customer.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it appears that the question you are trying to verify is about identifying the school district for the city of Alvin, whereas the suggested answer is focused primarily on the school district of another city, Pearland, and its surrounding communities. To provide an accurate and detailed answer to the original question, we first need to clarify that Alvin is a city located in Brazoria County, Texas. The school district that serves Alvin is actually the Alvin Independent School District (AISD). AISD serves not just the city of Alvin but also other communities such as Manvel and portions of Pearland. Founded in 1894, Alvin Independent School District currently operates multiple elementary, junior high, and high schools to cater to the educational needs of the children residing in these communities.

PISD is a separate entity from AISD and has its own set of schools and educational facilities. In conclusion, the answer to the original question, \\"What school district is Alvin in?\\" should be \\"Alvin Independent School District (AISD),\\" not Pearland Independent School District, which the suggested answer seems to refer to. Therefore, you should not validate the suggested answer, as it does not accurately address the initial question about Alvin's school district.

Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying.  I am facing a new situation today: Environmental scientists are trying to find a solution to reducing the harmful effects of chemicals on the environment. To that end, they developed a transgenic crop with the help of Bt toxin - they referred to it as case A. To test the effectiveness of this new crop they also studied Bt toxin spray - they referred to it as case B. They need to figure out which case is safer for the environment.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In which case the Bt toxin does not need to be digested by the insects, case A or case B? Answer:","output":"In case A, the Bt toxin does not need to be digested by the insects. This is because the transgenic crop contains and expresses the genes for the Bt toxin in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, the toxin binds to its gut wall and causes death, without the need for digestion. In case B, the Bt toxin in the spray is in an inactive state and requires digestion by the insect to become active and effective."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Most people think that fleas are microscopic, but if you look closely you can see them without a magnifying class. Adult fleas are very small, less than 1/8 inch long.","output":"They are brownish-black in color, with reddish hues after feeding on the blood of their host. Their bodies are flattened from side to side, which allows them to move through your cat's fur easily. Fleas have six long, spiny legs, with the hind two enabling them to jump remarkable distances and latch onto passing hosts. In contrast, ticks are generally larger and more easily visible than fleas, ranging from a pinhead-sized nymph to an adult the size of a pencil eraser after engorging on blood. Ticks have a more rounded body shape and eight legs, as they are arachnids and not insects like fleas. They are commonly found in areas with tall grass and vegetation, waiting to attach themselves to a passing host such as your cat. Control and prevention are the keys to keeping your cat flea and tick-free. Here are several measures to consider: 1. Regularly check your cat for fleas and ticks: Gently comb through your cat's fur, paying close attention to areas that fleas and ticks prefer, such as the neck, head, tail, and belly. Using a flea comb can give better results, as the fine teeth can capture adult fleas and their eggs. Additionally, monitor your cat for excessive itching, biting, or licking, as these behaviors could indicate a flea infestation. 2. Use preventive treatments: Talk to your veterinarian about recommended flea and tick treatments for your cat. Several options are available, including topical treatments, oral medications, and flea and tick collars. Follow your vet's advice, and always ensure you are using a treatment specifically designed for cats, as some dog treatments can be toxic to cats. 3. Keep your cat's environment clean: Regularly wash and vacuum your cat's bedding, play areas, and other places where they spend time. Fleas and ticks can be found in carpets, rugs, upholstered furniture, and even cracks in your floor or walls. Keeping these areas clean can help prevent reinfestation. 4. Maintain your yard: If your cat spends any time outdoors, keep your yard well-trimmed and free of excessive growth, leaves, and debris. Clear brush and tall grasses to reduce the likelihood of ticks finding their way onto your cat. 5. Treat your home: If your cat already has a flea infestation, you may need to treat your home to eliminate flea eggs and larvae. Foggers, sprays, and powders designed to kill fleas can be effective in removing these pests from your home. Always follow the product's instructions and consult a veterinarian if you have concerns about using these products around your cat. 6. Consider natural remedies: Talk to your veterinarian about using natural remedies, such as essential oils like lemon eucalyptus oil and apple cider vinegar, to help prevent and treat fleas and ticks. Note that not all natural remedies are safe for cats, so always consult with a professional before trying out any new solution. By following these steps, you can effectively combat the menace of fleas and ticks on your cat and ensure they remain happy, healthy, and pest-free. Remember, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, so maintain a regular schedule of checking and treating your cat to prevent infestations from taking hold in the first place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

So a couple of weeks ago I was lucky enough to be invited to The Body Shop® blogger event at my local store in Coppergate, York. It had been organised by blogger Indigo Rosee, in collaboration with the store. The evening had been set up to showcase the new limited edition Christmas make-up collection and also promote the huge sale that the store had on. There were some amazing deals! We were welcomed with prosecco and nibbles and then had a few minutes to browse the store and take some photos. I received a great demonstration of the new make-up products which includes a funky black eyeliner pen with a star stamp on one end which EVERYONE tried out! I always really love The Body Shop® Christmas make-up collections, and I think it’s a shame that it’s a brand that is sometimes forgotten when it comes to make-up. Then everyone was treated to a hand spa and massage using some of the Spa Of The World products. They’re truly luxurious, I recently reviewed the new Firming Ritual collection recently and absolutely loved it. I then had a look round some of the offers that the store was promoting, a lot of the Shower Gels and Body Butters were on sale (I just LOVE The Body Shop® Body Butters) and there were lots of gift sets too. It was a great opportunity to chat with the staff too, to ask questions about new products and find out what their favourites are. I also spent a lot of time looking at the 2017 beauty advent calendars. This year The Body Shop® are offering 3 different advent calendars starting from just £45. The larger calendars included some full size products too which I thought was great. There’s also going to be a Countdown to New Year calendar priced at just £50 which I thought was a great fun idea.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses.

Wearing a German uniform, Tartu then goes to work at a war materiel plant and is told to keep his eyes open for Czechs who try to stop production. At his hotel, he encounters Marúschka Brunn, a formerly wealthy Czech who fraternizes with the Germans and flaunts her distaste of her own people. One day, a woman is shot for sabotage at the plant and landlady Anna Palacek's daughter Pavla, who works at the plant, arrives at home very upset. When German officers arrive to investigate the death of a fellow officer, Tartu gives her an alibi and hides a gun for her. Pavla and Anna now say that they will do anyting for him and he reveals that he must contact the underground to fulfill a secret mission. A short time later, Marúschka asks to see him and he invites her for dinner at a nightclub.

Now she has a chance to see this wish come true thanks to build On, an American non-profit organization that is building a school in her community. For 17 years, build On has been sending American high school students overseas to create schools in places where literacy and formal education are usually out of reach. The organization has built about 300 schools in Mali, Malawi, Nepal, Senegal, Nicaragua and Haiti. Its goal is to get young Americans in mostly urban  areas to get involved in education. At the same time it can bring literacy to children and adults in poor villages in the developing world. Sounkala's school only has about 70 children; mud floors, poor lighting, few desks and an absence of books mean that the school is not the most ideal learning environment. Therefore they certainly could use build On's help. Samake hasn't been to school, but she wants a better future for her five daughters, including Ramatou, 12, and Mariam, 10. \\"When a woman attends school, she will teach what she learns to her children,\\" said Ramatou, who wants to become a doctor. \\"She will also know how to take better care of her family.\\" Build On tries to build schools for grades one to three.

I grew up on the 'Superman II' theatrical version (\\"S2T\\") and as a kid, I loved it more than Part I since not only did it contain more Superman and three Superman-type villains, it started off with a bang  the best Clark Kent to Superman transformations and rescue scenes. Kids no longer had to impatiently wait for Superman to appear on screen, as in part I. Now as an adult, I can see how the mighty had fallen with S2T (See: my review.) I've always heard of the back-story on how they prematurely and unjustifiably fired the original's director, Richard Donner from part II. (It must have been a rarity back then to film two separate movies simultaneously, now it's common: 'Back to the Future' and 'Matrix' 2 & 3 for example.) Unfortunately, after finally seeing the Richard Donner Cut (or, \\"S2RD\\") I still can't fully recommend it. Gone, was the great Superman change scene, the entire Paris rescue, as was the wonderful recap of part I in S2T's opening. In fact, they all but wrote the words: \\"Previously on Superman\\" in S2RD. The special effects weren't great in either Part I or S2T , but S2RD, they were mostly downright laughable  such as Lois falling from the Daily Planet window. I will admit, some new scenes worked and some they took out were welcomed departures, such as any scene in the \\"honeymoon suite.\\" Overall, if you grew up on S2T as I did, and loved it as a child  not nitpicking as I do as an adult, you should absolutely see S2RD as it's almost a brand new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes. (Spoiler alert) Unfortunately, the worst change comes last: gone was also the weird amnesia kiss from S2T replaced with the exact same ending as 'I.'

The album was later mastered at Sterling Sound and Masterdisk. During the sessions, Morton had Johansen record his vocals several times and incorporated sound effects such as gongs, gunshots, and feminine choruses. In a report on the album's progress for Melody Maker, journalist Lenny Kaye wrote that they were taking more time than they had on their first record, \\"bringing in occasional strings and horns, following Shadow's advice not 'to settle'.\\" Morton and the band shared an affinity for each other, as he found the group's energy in the studio refreshing, while Johansen was fond of Morton and the \\"looser\\" feel he provided for their music. \\"That man is completely unpretentious\\", Johansen said of the producer. \\"He doesn't think he ever did a marvellous thing in his life.\\" The New York Dolls and Morton produced little original material together. To complete the album, they had to record cover songs and re-record some of the band's earlier demos; \\"Babylon\\", \\"Who Are the Mystery Girls?\\", \\"It's Too Late\\" and \\"Human Being\\" had been recorded by the band in March 1973 as demos for Mercury before the label signed them. They had also recorded demos of two songs written by guitarist Sylvain Sylvain, \\"Teenage News\\" and \\"Too Much Too Soon\\", before working with Morton, but neither was considered for the album. Sylvain said he confronted Morton about this decision, recalling he had been in a rush: \\"He was too quick with me and said that he'd been told only to listen to David Johansen and Johnny Thunders. He didn't want to tell me who had told him that but obviously it was the managers. I just walked out, it was all driving me nuts.\\"According to journalist Tony Fletcher, Morton would have been more productive on Too Much Too Soon had it not been for his alcoholism and the lifestyles of the band members—bassist Arthur Kane was also an alcoholic, while Thunders and drummer Jerry Nolan had heroin addictions.

Article: Smartphone, poor sight Look around and you will see people busy on their smatrphones  . Smartphones do make our lives easier. But have you ever thought about what they mean to your eyes? According to a study, half of the British people own smartphones and they spend an average (  ) of two hours a day using them. There has been a 35% increase in the number of people in the U.K who suffer from short-sightedness   since smartphones were introduced there in 1997. Staring  at smartphones for a long time gives you dry eyes. When looking at something in the distance, your eyes automatically blink   a certain number of times. However, when you look at the things closer to your face, the blink slows down. This reduces the amount of tears and causes discomfort in your eyes. Another bad habit is using smartphone in dark rooms before going to sleep. If you look at a bright screen while your pupils   become larger, too much light goes into your eyes. This can be bad for your eyes and causes a disease called glaucoma  . Maybe it is possible for you to stop using your smartphone, but there are a few things you can do to protect your eyes. * Hold your phone at least 30 centimeters away from your eyes when using it. *Take a break every hour and try the following: look at something at least 5 meters away from you and then focus on your nose.

If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". Despite Martin Luther's harsh polemics against his Roman Catholic opponents over issues concerning Mary and the saints, theologians appear to agree that Luther adhered to the Marian decrees of the ecumenical councils and dogmas of the church. He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the Theotokos or Mother of God. Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death. \\"Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics. His views are intimately linked to his Christocentric theology and its consequences for liturgy and piety.\\" Luther, while revering Mary, came to criticize the \\"Papists\\" for blurring the line, between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is seen in a human being, and religious service given to another creature.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Arithmetic and algebra are examples of what science?\\"  Context: \\"Mill's empiricism thus held that knowledge of any kind is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience. The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \\"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\\" might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \\"reality\\" that goes beyond mere \\"possibilities of sensation\\", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the \\"gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all\\". Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Arithmetic and algebra are examples of the science of mathematics. Mathematics is a field of study that deals with the properties and relationships of numbers, quantities, shapes, and patterns. It uses a combination of logical reasoning, proof, and abstraction to develop and test mathematical theories and solve various problems. The mentioned context mainly highlights the limitations of Mill's empiricism in explaining the nature of mathematics.

Czech is a West Slavic language, primarily spoken in the Czech Republic. It is spoken by around 10 million people worldwide. The Czech language is closely related to Slovak, with which it shares a mutually intelligible dialect continuum.  Czech has a rich history and developed as a distinct language during the 9th and 10th centuries. It was greatly influenced by Latin and Old Church Slavonic during the Christianization of the region under the rule of the Great Moravian Empire. The modern Czech language saw significant standardization and codification in the 16th and 17th centuries, including the publication of the first complete Czech translation of the Bible. Czech grammar is characterized by its complex system of declensions and conjugations. It uses a fusional inflection system, meaning that one inflectional ending can often convey multiple grammatical functions, such as case, gender, and number. The Czech language has seven cases which are the nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental. One of the unique features of the Czech language is the use of diacritical marks, including the háček (ˇ) and the kroužek (˚). The háček is used to indicate a change in the pronunciation of a consonant, and the kroužek is used to mark the long pronunciation of certain vowels. For instance, the letter š (with a háček) is pronounced like \\"sh\\" in English, and the letter ů (with a kroužek) is pronounced like \\"oo.\\" Here's the translation of the given text: \\"Tak co chcete dělat?\\" means \\"So what do you want to do?\\" in English."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To find the answer to the question, one would need to look further into historical sources pertaining to Alexander Graham Bell's patent or search for more context within the source that provided the sentence mentioned above. Alexander Graham Bell, famous for inventing the telephone, received US Patent No. 174,465 for his revolutionary device on March 7, 1876. After establishing the Bell Telephone Company, the organization became the leading telephone service provider in the United States and eventually became part of AT&T. There are some historical accounts that suggest that Bell and his partners attempted to sell the patent to Western Union, a telegraph company, in 1876. According to these reports, Bell and his partners offered the patent to the company for 100,000. However, Western Union initially declined the offer, not realizing the impact and potential of the telephone. It was only later that they saw the error in their decision, as the telephone became more widely adopted and the Bell Telephone Company grew in scale and prominence. By the time Western Union offered to buy the patent for a higher sum, Bell and his associates realized the potential value of their invention and decided to hold on to the patent themselves. This is when they may have no longer wanted to sell the patent, which is where the provided sentence comes into play. In conclusion, while the given sentence does not directly answer the question, delving deeper into the historical context reveals that Alexander Graham Bell and his partners tried to sell the patent for the telephone for 100,000 at one point. However, they later decided against selling it due to the device's growing potential and significance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Sorting coupons was easier for Rebecca than Natalie because","output":"Rebecca had developed a more efficient system to organize them. First, she would carefully examine each coupon and categorize them based on their type, such as groceries, retail, or dining out. This initial categorization helped her keep the coupons neatly separated in designated folders. Secondly, Rebecca would further subdivide the coupons within each category by their expiration date. By arranging them in chronological order, she ensured that she could make the best use of time-sensitive discounts. This method not only saved her from missing out on great deals, but also helped her plan ahead for her shopping trips. Conversely, Natalie had a less structured approach to sorting her coupons. She tended to keep them in a single envelope, which made it difficult for her to find a specific one when needed. Additionally, without a proper system in place to organize the coupons based on their type or expiry date, Natalie would often miss out on potential savings or end up overlooking certain valuable coupons. Moreover, Rebecca also had the habit of periodically reviewing her coupon collection and would discard any expired or unusable ones. This routine helped her maintain a relevant and useful collection, preventing clutter and making her coupon search even more efficient. On the other hand, Natalie's unsorted collection would grow in size, making it increasingly overwhelming to sift through and less effective in its purpose. Lastly, Rebecca also made it a point to keep track of her coupon usage and savings by maintaining a simple spreadsheet. This allowed her to gauge the effectiveness of her couponing habits and identify any patterns or preferences, which in turn, enabled her to refine her sorting method further. Natalie, on the other hand, did not monitor her coupon usage and thus, was unable to optimize her sorting and savings strategy. In summary, the ease that Rebecca experienced while sorting her coupons could be attributed to her systematic approach, diligent maintenance, and self-evaluation. Meanwhile, Natalie's lack of organization and tracking practices put her at a disadvantage, making the process more challenging and less rewarding for her."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1932, Cohan starred in a dual role as a cold, corrupt politician and his charming, idealistic campaign double in the Hollywood musical film The Phantom President. The film co-starred Claudette Colbert and Jimmy Durante, with songs by Rodgers and Hart, and was released by Paramount Pictures. He appeared in some earlier silent films but he disliked Hollywood production methods and only made one other sound film, Gambling (1934), based on his own 1929 play and shot in New York City. A critic called Gambling a \\"stodgy adaptation of a definitely dated play directed in obsolete theatrical technique.\\" It is considered a lost film.  Cohan earned acclaim as a serious actor in Eugene O'Neill's only comedy, Ah, Wilderness! (1933), and in the role of a song-and-dance President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Rodgers and Hart's musical I'd Rather Be Right (1937). The same year, he reunited with Harris to produce a play called Fulton of Oak Falls, starring Cohan. His final play, The Return of the Vagabond (1940), featured a young Celeste Holm in the cast.  In 1940, Judy Garland played the title role in a film version of his 1922 musical Little Nellie Kelly.

He became a friend of many who were active in the world of the arts in Paris, including Franz Liszt (who had been based there since 1827), George Sand, and Victor Hugo. It is not clear exactly when he first met Frédéric Chopin, who arrived in Paris in September 1831. In 1832 Alkan took the solo role in his first Concerto da camera for piano and strings at the Conservatoire. In the same year, aged 19, he was elected to the influential Société Académique des Enfants d'Apollon (Society of the Children of Apollo), whose members included Luigi Cherubini, Fromental Halévy, the conductor François Habeneck, and Liszt, who had been elected in 1824 at the age of twelve. Between 1833 and 1836 Alkan participated at many of the Society's concerts. Alkan twice competed unsuccessfully for the Prix de Rome, in 1832 and again in 1834; the cantatas which he wrote for the competition, Hermann et Ketty and L'Entrée en loge, have remained unpublished and unperformed.In 1834 Alkan began his friendship with the Spanish musician Santiago Masarnau, which was to result in an extended and often intimate correspondence which only came to light in 2009. Like virtually all of Alkan's correspondence, this exchange is now one-sided; all of his papers (including his manuscripts and his extensive library) were either destroyed by Alkan himself, as is clear from his will, or became lost after his death. Later in 1834 Alkan made a visit to England, where he gave recitals and where the second Concerto da camera was performed in Bath by its dedicatee Henry Ibbot Field; it was published in London together with some solo piano pieces. A letter to Masarnau and a notice in a French journal that Alkan played in London with Moscheles and Cramer, indicate that he returned to England in 1835.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which city had more people with an increased chance of dying from other diseases?  Hint: Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment.","output":"Based on the provided information, Prague, one of the sister cities, experienced significant air pollution problems. The detrimental effects of air pollution on human health and the environment are well-established; approximately 22 million people succumb to air pollution-related illnesses per annum. Exposure to contaminated air exacerbates the risk of developing respiratory conditions like asthma and lung cancer and amplifies the likelihood of dying from other diseases.  Children are particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of air pollution, given that their lungs are still in the developmental stage, and they tend to breathe in more air relative to their size in comparison to adults. Furthermore, air pollution impacts the environment differently based on the specific pollutants involved. Given that Prague suffered from substantial air pollution issues, while Belfast was eco-friendly and its citizens enjoyed good health, it is reasonable to deduce that more people in Prague had an increased chance of dying from other diseases. This conclusion aligns with the insight that air pollution contributes to a heightened risk of developing and ultimately dying from various health problems, negatively impacting both individuals and the environment. Thus, Prague is the city with more inhabitants facing a higher probability of death due to diseases exacerbated by air pollution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose buy more fast food happens, how will it affect the liver having to work SOFTER.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you proposed is that buying more fast food would cause the liver to work \\"SOFTER.\\" If we interpret \\"SOFTER\\" as having a lighter workload or being less efficient, we can analyze the possible effects on the liver. Fast food is typically characterized by high levels of unhealthy fats (saturated and trans fats), sugars, and sometimes excessive sodium. Consuming excessive amounts of fast food can have both direct and indirect effects on the liver processes mentioned in your description. Direct effects: 1. An increased intake of unhealthy fats can lead to fat accumulation in the liver, resulting in a condition called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This can cause the liver to work less efficiently when processing nutrients and removing toxins. 2. Excess sugar consumption can lead to increased conversion of sugar to fat in the liver, exacerbating fat accumulation and increasing liver workload. 3. High sodium intake can lead to water retention, leading to increased blood pressure, which may indirectly stress liver function. Indirect effects: 1. Consuming fast food regularly can contribute to unhealthy weight gain and obesity, which are risk factors for NAFLD and other liver diseases. 2. A diet high in fast food may lack essential vitamins and minerals required for liver function, potentially impairing the liver's ability to perform necessary processes. 3. Continual consumption of fast food may lead to the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, with detrimental effects on liver function. In conclusion, the perturbation of increasing fast food consumption is likely to negatively affect liver processes, making the organ work less efficiently or contributing to various liver-related health issues, rather than working \\"SOFTER\\" in a desirable sense."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the two facts above, what freezes and thaws to cause ice wedging? OPTIONS: a. h2o b. dams c. oxygen d. clouds e. carbon f. rain g. lake h. H20","output":"Ice wedging, a process involved in the weathering of rocks and soil, occurs due to the cycles of freezing and thawing of water. Given the two facts provided and the options available, the correct option is a. H2O. To provide a more detailed explanation, let's first take a closer look at both facts: Fact 1: Cycles of freezing and thawing water cause ice wedging. Ice wedging is a type of mechanical weathering where water enters cracks and crevices in rocks, freezes, and expands. When water freezes, it typically expands by about 9%, exerting a significant amount of pressure on the surrounding rock. As a result, the rock weakens and eventually breaks apart, often in angular or wedge-shaped fragments. This process is particularly effective in environments with repetitive freeze-thaw cycles, such as in temperate and cold regions. Fact 2: Water is made up of H2O molecules. Water (H2O) is a simple molecular compound composed of two hydrogen atoms (H) and one oxygen atom (O) bonded together. The unique structure and properties of water molecules are responsible for many of its distinctive properties, including its ability to dissolve a wide range of substances and its relatively high boiling and freezing points. Given these facts, it is clear that the substance that undergoes the process of freezing and thawing to cause ice wedging is indeed H2O – water, in its liquid form, infiltrates the cracks in rocks and then freezes, leading to the expansion and weathering of rock formations. The rest of the options (b through h) are not suitable for the following reasons: b. Dams: Dams are man-made structures built across rivers to regulate the flow of water and store it for various purposes, including flood control, irrigation, and hydroelectric power generation. They do not directly contribute to the freezing and thawing process associated with ice wedging. c. Oxygen: Oxygen (O2) is a component of water molecules, but it does not freeze and thaw on its own to cause ice wedging. Oxygen, as a separate gas or liquid, doesn't cause the mechanical weathering typically associated with ice wedging. d. Clouds: Clouds are atmospheric collections of water droplets or ice crystals that are suspended in the air. They do not directly participate in the ice wedging process. e. Carbon: Carbon is a non-metallic element, and it is not involved in the freeze-thaw cycles that lead to ice wedging. f.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Report: Iran finds 'unexpectedly high' uranium reserve after Dems seal nuke deal for Obama Iran has reportedly found an unexpectedly high reserve of uranium, following assessments that the country is running low on the nuclear raw material and just days after President Obama essentially secured an international nuclear deal with the country's leaders. The discovery was reported first by Reuters and based on comments made by Iranian nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi to the state news agency IRNA. \\"I cannot announce (the level of) Iran's uranium mine reserves,\\" Salehi was quoted as saying. \\"The important thing is that before aerial prospecting for uranium ores we were not too optimistic, but the new discoveries have made us confident about our reserves.\\" The international deal with Iran, largely brokered by the Obama administration, slows the country’s nuclear development for nearly a decade in exchange for the lifting of billions of dollars worth of crippling economic sanctions. World leaders think Iran is trying to develop a nuclear weapon, despite Tehran’s denial. However, Iran under the deal will still be able to pursue a nuclear-development program, for which the uranium could be used. The remarks by Salehi, head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, could not be found Saturday morning on the IRNA website. But another story had him as saying the deal -- reached in July and officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action -- will not slow the pace of Iran’s nuclear program. “The official said the restrictions which the JCPOA entails are by no means the ones which would restrict Iran in its nuclear activities,” reads one line in the story. Several other news-gathering agencies have either picked up the Reuters’ story or cited it in their own version. That Obama would win congressional approval of the deal became apparent in recent weeks, but not without a fight from the GOP-controlled Congress and other critics including conservative groups and pro-Israel organizations. However, the president worked all summer to garner support from Senate Democrat, who on Thursday block chamber Republicans from disapproving of the deal and from forcing Obama to resort to a presidential veto to win approval for what will likely be considered his biggest foreign policy achievement. Salehi reportedly said uranium exploration had covered almost two-thirds of Iran and would be complete in the next four years. Uranium can be used for energy production and scientific purposes but is also a key ingredient in nuclear weapons. Some Western analysts have previously said that Iran was close to exhausting its supply of yellowcake -- or raw uranium -- and that mining it domestically was not cost-efficient, according to Reuters. A report published in 2013 by U.S. think-tanks Carnegie Endowment and the Federation of American Scientists said the scarcity and low quality of Iran's uranium resources compelled it \\"to rely on external sources of natural and processed uranium,” the wire service also reported. Iran has repeatedly denied overseas media reports that it has tried to import uranium from countries like Kazakhstan and Zimbabwe.

Q:What is the answer for the question: In which of the six main climatic zones of the country that is predominantly temperate is precipitation very heavy? from the following article ?  The climate of Japan is predominantly temperate, but varies greatly from north to south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaido, Sea of Japan, Central Highland, Seto Inland Sea, Pacific Ocean, and Ryukyu Islands. The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu Islands and Nanpō Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.The average winter temperature in Japan is 5.1 °C (41.2 °F) and the average summer temperature is 25.2 °C (77.4 °F). The highest temperature ever measured in Japan 41.1 °C (106.0 °F) was recorded on July 23, 2018. The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north until reaching Hokkaido in late July. In most of Honshu, the rainy season begins before the middle of June and lasts about six weeks. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain.

The answer is:","output":"The intensified changes to the earth's short-term weather patterns evolve into long-term alterations in climate, leading to global warming and climate change.  As the last step in this process, these persistent alterations bring about numerous detrimental consequences for the earth's environment, ecosystems, and biological diversity. Here is how it would look like: One prominent effect of this ongoing process is the progressive increase in average global temperatures, resulting in the phenomenon known as global warming. This rise in temperature is attributable to the amplified greenhouse effect caused by the increased presence of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which traps more heat from the sun. The temperature increase has a domino effect, causing changes in weather patterns, shifting climates, and increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves. Furthermore, the warmer temperatures cause land ice such as glaciers and polar ice caps to melt, subsequently leading to a rise in sea levels globally. This phenomenon poses severe threats to coastal areas and islands which could experience increased coastal erosion, flooding and even submergence. In addition, global warming disrupts the balance of ecosystems, hurting biodiversity. It can shift the timing of natural events like the blooming of flowers or migration of birds, disturb habitats and potentially promote the spread of invasive species and diseases. Over time, some species may not adapt quickly enough to this new climate regime and run a risk of becoming endangered or even extinct. Moreover, deforestation, as indicated in the process, exacerbates this situation. Trees play a crucial role in mitigating climate change as they absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. Thus, a lessened tree population results in enhanced carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Deforestation also directly affects ecosystems and animal habitats, leading to a decrease in biodiversity. Lastly, we must also consider that these climatic and environmental changes have serious socio-economic impacts on human societies. They can affect agricultural production due to new pest populations or unpredictable weather, harm health outcomes because of extreme weather events or increased disease spread, and even cause severe infrastructure damage and displacement of human populations, especially in vulnerable regions. Given the severe and broad-ranging impacts of climate change and global warming, the last step would also involve an urgent call for human action towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions and implementing mitigation and adaptation strategies. This includes sourcing energy from renewable sources, maintaining and expanding forests, and developing resilient and sustainable infrastructures and economies.  In conclusion, the last step of this process encapsulates not only the physical transformations in the climate but also the impacts they can have on life on earth, emphasizing the need for fundamental changes in the human approach towards environment and development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The statement you provided - \\"The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland (a Union state) ended with Confederate retreat at the Battle of Antietam, dissuading British intervention.\\" - addresses one specific event in the Civil War that had a significant impact on international relations but does not fully encapsulate the unique aspects of the Civil War as a whole.  Some major factors that made the Civil War different from others are: 1. It was a conflict between two regions (North and South) within the same country rather than between separate countries. 2. The primary cause of the war was the debate over slavery, with the North supporting its abolition and the South defending its continuation. 3. New technologies, such as telegraphs, railways, and ironclad warships, significantly impacted the course of the war, ushering in a new era of modern warfare. 4. The scale of the conflict was unprecedented, resulting in the highest number of casualties of any war in American history. 5. The outcome of the war led to the abolition of slavery and a significant shift in the social, political, and economic landscape of the United States.

Write an article based on this summary: – Emory Ellis, a black homeless man in Boston, went to Burger King for breakfast and tried to pay with a 10 bill. That simple transaction in November 2015 led to a series of mistakes that landed Ellis in jail for more than three months, reports the AP. It started with the cashier, who accused Ellis, 37, of paying with a counterfeit bill and called police. The police took Ellis to jail and charged him with forgery. Ellis was on probation and the arrest violated that probation, so he was denied bail. The whole thing was cleared up in February 2016 when the Secret Service determined that the bill was real. Now Ellis is suing Burger King Corp., the franchisee, and the cashier for 950,000 in damages. The case was first reported by Law360. Ellis’s attorney, Justin Dreschler, tells the AP that the entire incident was due to Ellis’ race and overall appearance. “A [white] person like me would’ve gotten an apology,” says Dreschler, or at the very least, a cashier who simply refused to accept the bill instead of calling police. “But a person like Emory somehow finds his way in handcuffs for trying to pay for his breakfast with real money.” (The lawsuit claims Ellis never even got the 10 bill back.) Neither Burger King nor the franchisee have commented. The incident adds to a growing national dialogue on how people of color are treated in everyday situations. In other recent incidents, police have been called on black people at a Starbucks, a golf club, an LA Fitness, an Airbnb rental home, a Nordstrom Rack, and a black student napping in a Yale common room.","output":"# Homeless Man Sues Burger King After Spending Months In Jail Over 10 Bill In November 2015, a simple transaction at a Boston Burger King put Emory Ellis, a black homeless man, behind bars for over three months due to a series of mistakes.

Now, Ellis is seeking justice through a lawsuit against Burger King Corporation, the franchisee, and the cashier for the amount of 950,000 in damages. This case was initially reported by Law360.  Ellis's attorney, Justin Dreschler, told the AP that the incident happened due to Ellis's race and overall appearance. \\"A [white] person like me would've gotten an apology,\\" said Dreschler. In other similar situations, a cashier would have refused to accept the bill instead of involving the police. “But a person like Emory somehow finds his way in handcuffs for trying to pay for his breakfast with real money.” The lawsuit alleges that Ellis never even received his 10 bill back. There have been no comments from either Burger King or the franchisee regarding the incident. This case is another example that adds to the increasing national dialogue on how people of color are treated in everyday situations. In recent times, police have been called on black individuals at various locations such as a Starbucks, a golf club, an LA Fitness, an Airbnb rental home, a Nordstrom Rack, and even while a black student was napping in a Yale common room."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the first sentence, it is mentioned that the speaker had to take their son to the doctor due to him getting poison ivy during a camping trip with friends. This statement implies that there is a reason and necessity for the visit to the doctor, typically for examination, diagnosis or treatment of the poison ivy. The second sentence, however, asserts that the son did not need to see the doctor regardless of having poison ivy. This statement contradicts the first sentence, suggesting that there was no necessity or reason for the doctor's visit concerning the poison ivy. In summary, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence because they convey opposing ideas regarding the doctor's visit for the son's poison ivy.

Based on the premise \\"With less than your usual chivalry, you seem to forget that I am commonly accounted a beautiful woman.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"You are usually very rude and abrupt, but this time you are quite the gentleman. \\" is true?","output":"To evaluate the hypothesis \\"You are usually very rude and abrupt, but this time you are quite the gentleman,\\" based on the premise \\"With less than your usual chivalry, you seem to forget that I am commonly accounted a beautiful woman,\\" we must break down both the premise and the hypothesis and analyze how they relate to or contradict each other. First, let's dissect the premise: 1. \\"With less than your usual chivalry\\" implies that the subject (the person being addressed) typically exhibits a certain level of chivalry or courteous behavior. 2. \\"You seem to forget that I am commonly accounted a beautiful woman\\" suggests that the subject is not paying attention or giving the appropriate level of admiration to the speaker, given the speaker's perceived beauty. Now let's break down the hypothesis: 1. \\"You are usually very rude and abrupt\\" asserts that the subject typically behaves in a discourteous and insensitive manner. 2. \\"But this time you are quite the gentleman\\" implies an exception to this general behavior, with the subject showing gentlemanly or polite conduct in this particular situation. Upon comparing the premise and the hypothesis, we observe some inconsistencies: 1. In the premise, the subject is said to have \\"less than your usual chivalry\\", indicating that the subject generally demonstrates at least some level of polite behavior. However, the hypothesis states that the subject is \\"usually very rude and abrupt\\", which contradicts the idea that the subject typically exhibits chivalry. 2. The premise suggests that, in this specific situation, the subject is not acknowledging the speaker's beauty or exhibiting the usual level of chivalry. This contrasts with the hypothesis, which claims that the subject is \\"quite the gentleman\\" in this instance, implying more courteous behavior than their supposed norm. Given these contradictions, it is difficult to conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the premise provided. Instead, the premise seems to convey that the subject usually displays some level of chivalry, but in this particular situation, they are not meeting their usual standards of politeness or acknowledgment of the speaker's beauty. The hypothesis, on the other hand, paints the subject as someone who is typically rude and abrupt, but surprisingly exhibits gentlemanly conduct in this situation. Due to the inconsistencies between the premise and the hypothesis, we cannot confidently assert that the hypothesis is true based on the available information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: The roadside bomb that smashed into Army Sgt. Brian Saaristo's Humvee in northern Iraq two years ago ripped off both legs below the knee. Retired Army Sgt. Brian Saaristo, who lost both legs to a roadside bomb, meets with a doctor in Minnesota. Now he's 45, living in retirement in Minnesota and confronting the rest of his life without the use of his legs. Yet he worries mainly about the thousands of younger U.S. service members who also have been maimed by makeshift bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan. \\"Younger ones are taking it harder,\\" Saaristo said. \\"They feel they don't have the rest of their lives.\\" Roadside bombs and other homemade explosives have been a deadly staple of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, killing or wounding thousands of U.S. service members and civilians. Such improvised explosives devices -- \\"IEDs\\" to the military -- are the \\"weapon of choice\\" for insurgents, U.S. officials say. They're mostly cheap, easy to build and triggered by simple remote control. Protecting U.S. troops from such bombs is a top priority at the Pentagon. It has spent 14 billion in the past four years to fight homemade bombs. It even created an agency for that purpose -- the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization. That agency has had some success, a new report says, but insurgents continue to kill and maim U.S. service members with homemade bombs, in part because the bombs fulfill their purpose and it is easy to acquire the materials used to construct them. The report came from a subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee. It followed two years of hearings and study. The number of IED attacks has dropped in Iraq and gone up in Afghanistan, said Irene Smith, a spokeswoman for the IED organization. Yet there are more than 1,400 such attacks a month in Iraq and Afghanistan and an additional 350 elsewhere, a sign that insurgents continue to rely on them. \\"We are in a long war, a persistent conflict with a group of insurgents who want to wear down our will so we quit -- the purpose of an IED,\\" she said. \\"The enemy recognizes IEDs as the weapon of choice.\\" The IED agency has developed and fielded electronic jammers that prevent the bomb's trigger signal from reaching the explosive, the congressional report said. It also has pursued better vehicle armor. The agency has been developing intelligence, fostering police work, funding surveillance and attacking insurgent networks that produce and set up the bombs. It has been involved in training troops on how to confront and look for the weapon. Yet the report said the group needs to improve the way it measures its performance, because it isn't clear in many cases whether the group's actions or other factors have led to various strides in confronting roadside bombs. The report also said the organization needs to widen its authority to include other agencies that confront roadside bombs, and get better oversight. Smith, the spokeswoman for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization, agrees with these conclusions. She said the organization appreciates the opportunity to work with the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, \\"to identify and resolve any problem areas in our processes.\\" She said the cooperation among agencies is crucial. \\"Global terrorism will continue to manifest itself through use of IEDs,\\" she said.","output":"- Retired Army Sgt. Brian Saaristo, who lost both legs in a roadside bomb attack in Iraq, expresses concern for younger service members affected by similar attacks in Iraq and Afghanistan. - Roadside bombs and homemade explosives, known as improvised explosive devices (IEDs), have caused numerous casualties among U.S. service members and civilians. - The Pentagon considers protecting troops from such bombs a top priority, having spent 14 billion over the past four years to fight IEDs and establishing the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO). - Despite JIEDDO's efforts, including electronic jammers and better vehicle armor, insurgents continue to use IEDs in attacks due to their effectiveness and ease of construction. - A congressional report from a House Armed Services subcommittee suggests the JIEDDO needs to improve its performance measurement, expand its authority to include other agencies, and improve oversight."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To fully analyze this, we need to break down both the premise and the hypothesis and examine their elements.  Premise: Jon looked to Thorn and saw recognition in the big man's dark eyes.

If we focus on the aspect of recognition in both statements, the premise tells us that Jon saw recognition in Thorn's dark eyes. This means that Jon was able to perceive that Thorn knew or recognized him.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, proposes that Jon didn't gain any recognition from Thorn. This is in direct contradiction to what the premise establishes, as it claims that there's an absence of acknowledgment on Thorn's part.

Natasha Porter, 23, developed Guillain-Barre syndrome after being bitten by a mosquito in Australia. A woman bitten by a mosquito while on holiday in Australia was left paralysed from the neck down. Natasha Porter was confined to a wheelchair for four months and was unable to move anything below her neck for three weeks after suffering the bite. Ms Porter was two weeks into the holiday of a lifetime in Australia when she developed Guillain-Barre syndrome - a disease which causes the body attacks its own nervous system. She first noticed numbness in one toe, but within four days she could barely walk. Doctors told her the fast-moving paralysis could freeze her diaphragm within hours and that there was a chance she could die. Ms Porter watched helplessly as she lost control of her entire body within hours. She was unable to feel her hands, feet or legs - or move anything below her neck. ‘Every time I went to sleep at night I wondered if I might not wake up,’ said Ms Porter, from Crawley, West Sussex. ‘All I could think was I'm 23 - I don't want to die.’ Ms Porter flew to Western Australia in March 2012 and spent seven months working in a cafe to save up for a trip down the country’s east coast. However, she began to notice numbness in her toe two weeks after arriving in Cairns. The paralysis then moved to her hands two days later. Ms Porter visited a pharmacist who dismissed her symptoms as an allergic reaction and prescribed antihistamines. But when her arms began to feel so heavy she could not lift them up to brush her hair, she consulted a doctor who diagnosed anxiety and stress. She spent two more days deteriorating on a two-day cruise round the Whitsunday Islands before a concerned couple rushed her to hospital. The condition causes the body to attack its own immune system and it left Ms Porter in a wheelchair for four months and unable to move anything below her neck for three weeks. Doctors tested her reflexes and found she had none. Ms. Porter said: ‘The doctor said he thought it could be Guillain-Barre. syndrome. I had never heard of it. The next words he said were “I'm. worried,\\" and I was so scared. ‘He said it was potentially fatal because it freezes your diaphragm and he said I might need to go on a ventilator really soon. ‘I remember feeling guilty because I knew I was going to have to call my parents. I was thinking, how do I call them up and say I might be dead in a few hours? She was diagnosed after she started to experience numbness in her feet and hands and felt as though her arms were too heavy to lift. Doctors initially thought she was suffering from an allergic reaction or stress. ‘I was thinking I just don't want to die, I'm only just beginning to live.’ Guillain-Barre. syndrome is a rare and serious condition which occurs when the body's. immune system attacks the peripheral nervous system. The exact cause is unknown but around 60 per cent of sufferers develop it when bacteria or a virus enters the body and triggers the immune system to attack nerves. This causes the nerves to become inflamed and stop working and in some cases makes the body numb. She was warned that she could end up on a ventilator, or even die, if her diaphragm also became paralysed by the condition. Her parents had to fly out from England to be at her bedside. Within three weeks she was able to move both her arms a few centimetres, and six weeks after she was paralysed she stood up for a few seconds with the help of three nurses. She had to wear a face mask to protect her from further infections. It can prove fatal but around 80 per. cent of suffers make a full recovery after several weeks in hospital. although some take a year or more to fully recover. Ms. Porter’s father Joe, a taxi driver, flew out to join his daughter, and. called her mother, Sue, a college lecturer, when it became clear she was. very ill. In November, Ms Porter (pictured with father, Joe) was flown back home accompanied by two nurses. Within two days Ms Porter could not move anything but her head. She said: ‘I was trying to wiggle my toe and I was staring at it knowing it should move but it wouldn't. ‘I. couldn't do anything, it was awful. To go from being so independent to. not being able to go to the loo, lift up your own leg. I had to ask to. be turned over in bed. It was depressing. ‘There was a constant burning. It was incredible. I can't describe the pain.’ However, thanks to a lot of physiotherapy, Ms Porter was able to regain her independence one movement at a time. Within three weeks she was able to move both her arms a few centimetres, and six weeks after she was paralysed she stood up for a few seconds with the help of three nurses. She said: ‘People were saying, “bend your legs, straighten your back, tuck you tummy in,” but it was so strange as I just had no idea how to do it. ‘The first time I was able to move for five seconds I remember just yelling and everyone started applauding.’ In November, Ms Porter was flown back home accompanied by two nurses, and reunited with brother Jack, 27, and sister Shelley, 25. By the New Year she was able to take short trips away from her wheelchair and by the end of January she went out dancing with her friends for the first time. Ms Porter has now made a full recovery and returned to work. She and her boyfriend, Tom Kelly, are hoping to finish their travels once they have saved up enough money. In March she began work as an administration assistant, and she is planning to finish the round the world trip she began, and to climb to Everest base camp with boyfriend, Tom Kelly, as soon as they raise the funds. Ms Porter said: ‘I don't want to waste anytime anymore and I hope I have become a better person. ‘I just want to live as much as I can, spend as much time with my friends and family, just enjoying my life.’ Guillain-Barre syndrome (pronounced Ghee-lan Bar-ray) syndrome is a rare but serious condition of the nerves that control the body's senses and movements. It affects about 1,500 people in the UK every year and is slightly more common in men than women. It causes the immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness) to attack these nerves, causing them to become inflamed. Symptoms include a tingly, numb sensation in the arms and legs which can result in a loss of feeling and movement. Most people who develop it have suffered from a viral or bacterial infection a few weeks before. Around 80 per cent of people make a full recovery within a few weeks or months, and do not have any further problems such as permanent nerve damage.

Like many farmers in the Midwest, Poskin is concerned about getting caught in the middle of a trade war, as Trump ramps up economic pressure on China. Those fears were heightened after Trump announced plans Thursday to impose tariffs on as much as 60 billion worth of Chinese imports. \\"I'm fearful they will retaliate on those tariffs,\\" Poskin said. \\"Soybean exports, wheat, poultry, chicken, beef — [there are] any number of products that we export to their country that they could retaliate with.\\" The announcement has unnerved many in Trump's base of supporters in U.S. agriculture. The trade tensions have also rattled global markets, which until recently had performed strongly. Trump's tariff decision was meant to punish Chinese companies that benefit from unfair access to U.S. technology. U.S. businesses have long bristled at Beijing's requirement that they transfer technology to Chinese companies as a condition of entering the Chinese market. U.S. businesses have also had their technology stolen through cyberattacks. \\"We have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on,\\" Trump said during the signing ceremony Thursday. Some U.S. companies in China cheered the move and suggested that concerns about a trade war were overblown. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, dismissed the \\"hair on fire\\" concern that Trump's proposed moves would hurt the global economy. \\"That the U.S. is willing to risk these disruptions indicates how serious the U.S. administration finds China's forced technology transfer, cybertheft and discriminatory industrial policies,\\" he said in a statement to VOA. Zarit pointed to a recent survey suggesting members of his organization wanted the White House to \\"advocate more strongly for a level playing field and for reciprocal treatment to... Question: When did Randy's fear heighten? Answer: Available choices: a. not enough information. b. After Trump announced plans Thursday to impose tariffs on as much as 60 billion worth of Chinese imports. c. before the ban. d. om Friday. Answer:","output":"b.

Given the question \\"What does Remy need to do before this?\\", is \\"be understanding\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"Yes, \\"be understanding\\" can be considered a valid answer in this context. Before the situation unfolds, Remy needs to adopt an understanding and empathetic perspective towards Cameron's unusual and unresponsive behavior. This is a crucial aspect of giving someone the benefit of the doubt, as it entails taking into consideration various factors and circumstances that may contribute to a person's behavior. By being understanding, Remy would be less likely to jump to conclusions or assume the worst about Cameron's actions. In addition to being understanding, Remy can also take several other steps in order to effectively approach the situation and support their friend: 1. Analyze the situation. Remy needs to take a step back and objectively evaluate the circumstances surrounding Cameron's behavior. Have there been any recent events or stressors affecting Cameron's life? Are there external factors that might contribute to Cameron's unresponsiveness? 2. Communicate openly. Instead of making assumptions, Remy should initiate a conversation with Cameron to express their concerns and offer support. They can ask Cameron if there is anything going on that might be causing the shift in behavior or if there's anything they can do to help. 3. Listen actively. In order to properly understand the situation and Cameron's experiences, Remy needs to be an active listener. This means responding in a non-judgmental manner, asking follow-up questions for clarity, and validating Cameron's emotions. 4. Offer support. Depending on Cameron's response, Remy can provide various forms of support. This could include practical assistance, emotional backing, or just being there as a shoulder to lean on. 5. Be patient. Depending on the root cause of Cameron's behavior, the process of overcoming the issue may be a gradual one. Remy should be patient and continue offering support as needed. 6. Seek professional help if necessary. If Cameron's behavior indicates a more serious underlying problem, such as a mental health issue, Remy should encourage them to seek appropriate professional help. In summary, \\"be understanding\\" is certainly a valid answer when it comes to Remy's initial response to Cameron's changed behavior. Adopting an empathetic and non-judgmental perspective lays the groundwork for a supportive, open, and communicative approach. By doing so, Remy can be better equipped to help Cameron navigate through their difficulties, strengthening their friendship in the process."},{"instruction":"The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

Exposure to radiation causes damage to living tissue; high doses result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), with skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure and death, while any dose may result in an increased chance of cancer and genetic damage; a particular form of cancer, thyroid cancer, often occurs when nuclear weapons and reactors are the radiation source because of the biological proclivities of the radioactive iodine fission product, iodine-131. However, calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation is still not well understood and currently estimates are loosely determined by population based data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and from follow-up of reactor accidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster. The International Commission on Radiological Protection states that \\"The Commission is aware of uncertainties and lack of precision of the models and parameter values\\", \\"Collective effective dose is not intended as a tool for epidemiological risk assessment, and it is inappropriate to use it in risk projections\\" and \\"in particular, the calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective effective doses from trivial individual doses should be avoided.\\"  Michael and Robert are scientists who work in a nuclear reactor facility. Michael was replacing a fuel rod in the nuclear reactor when a small explosion happened, causing Michael to be exposed to high doses of radiation in a short period of time.  Robert was in the adjacent room when the explosion happened, and as a result he only suffered low doses of radiation.  Who is less likely to experience internal organ failure? The answer to this question is:","output":"Robert is less likely to experience internal organ failure due to the lower doses of radiation he was exposed to during the explosion. As mentioned before, high doses of ionizing radiation can result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), which includes symptoms such as skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure, and death. In this scenario, Michael was exposed to high doses of radiation while directly working with the nuclear reactor when the explosion occurred, putting him at a greater risk for ARS and its associated health issues, including internal organ failure. On the other hand, Robert was in the adjacent room, which means he was further away from the source of radiation and likely shielded to some degree by barriers such as walls and distance. As a result, Robert suffered from lower doses of radiation exposure. While it is still important to monitor his health given any exposure to ionizing radiation, he is at a significantly lower risk for severe health effects like internal organ failure compared to Michael. It is also important to consider that the risks and effects of ionizing radiation can vary depending on the specific type and energy of the radiation, as well as individual factors such as age, overall health, and genetic predisposition. Nevertheless, based on the information provided in this scenario, Robert is less likely to experience internal organ failure due to the lower doses of radiation he was exposed to during the explosion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Information:  - Mount Mansfield is the highest mountain in Vermont with a summit that peaks at above sea level. The summit located within the town of Underhill in Chittenden County; the ridgeline, including some secondary peaks, extends into the town of Stowe in Lamoille County, and the mountain's flanks also reach into the town of Cambridge.  - In the field of cell biology, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), is a protein functioning as a ligand that induces the process of cell death called apoptosis.  - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.  - The Long Trail is a hiking trail located in Vermont, running the length of the state. It is the oldest long-distance trail in the United States, constructed between 1910 and 1930 by the Green Mountain Club. The club remains the primary organization responsible for the trail, and is recognized by the state legislature as \\"the founder, sponsor, defender, and protector\\" of the Long Trail System.  - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - A landform is a natural feature of the solid surface of the Earth or other planetary body. Landforms together make up a given terrain, and their arrangement in the landscape is known as topography. Typical landforms include hills, mountains, plateaus, canyons, valleys, as well as shoreline features such as bays, peninsulas, and seas, including submerged features such as mid-ocean ridges, volcanoes, and the great ocean basins.  - Quebec (pronounced or ) is the second-most populous province of Canada and the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population, with French as the sole provincial official language.  - A glacier (or ) is a persistent body of dense ice that is constantly moving under its own weight; it forms where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ablation (melting and sublimation) over many years, often centuries. Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features. They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines. Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water.  - Vermont is a state in the New England region of the northeast United States. It borders the other U.S. states of Massachusetts to the south, New Hampshire to the east, New York to the west, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north. Lake Champlain forms half of Vermont's western border with the state of New York and the Green Mountains run north-south the length of the state.  - New England is a geographical region comprising six states of the northeast United States: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. It is bordered by the state of New York to the west and south, and the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec to the northeast and north, respectively. The Atlantic Ocean is to the east and southeast, and Long Island Sound is to the south. Boston is its largest city. Its largest metropolitan area is Greater Boston, which also includes Worcester (the second-largest city in New England), Manchester (the largest city in New Hampshire), and Providence (the capital and largest city of Rhode Island), with nearly a third of the entire region's population.  - The Green Mountains are a mountain range in the U.S. state of Vermont. The range runs primarily south to north and extends approximately from the border with Massachusetts to that with Quebec, Canada. The part of the same range that is in Massachusetts and Connecticut is known as The Berkshires or the Berkshire Hills (with the Connecticut portion, mostly in Litchfield County, locally called the Northwest Hills or Litchfield Hills) and the Quebec portion is called the Sutton Mountains, or Monts Sutton.  - Long-distance trails (or long-distance tracks, paths, footpaths or greenways) are the longer recreational trails mainly through rural areas, used for non-motorized recreational travelling (walking, backpacking, cycling, horse riding or cross-country skiing).  - The Connecticut River is the longest river in the New England region of the United States. Flowing roughly southward for through four U.S. states, the Connecticut rises at the U.S. border with Quebec, Canada, and discharges at Long Island Sound. Its watershed encompasses five U.S. states and one Canadian province   via 148 tributaries, 38 of which are major rivers. Discharging at per second, the Connecticut produces 70% of Long Island Sound's fresh water.  - The Winooski River (formerly the Onion River) is a tributary of Lake Champlain approximately long in the northern half of Vermont. Although not Vermont's longest river, it is one of the state's most significant, forming a major valley way from Lake Champlain through the Green Mountains towards (although not connecting in drainage to) the Connecticut River valley.  - Volcanism is the phenomenon of eruption of molten rock (magma) onto the surface of the Earth or a solid-surface planet or moon, where lava, pyroclastics and volcanic gases erupt through a break in the surface called a vent. It includes all phenomena resulting from and causing magma within the crust or mantle of the body, to rise through the crust and form volcanic rocks on the surface.  - Camel 's Hump ( alternatively Camels Hump ) is Vermont 's third - highest mountain and highest undeveloped peak . Because of its distinctive profile , it is perhaps the state 's most recognized mountain , featured on the state quarter . It is part of the Green Mountain range . With its neighbor to the north , Mount Mansfield , it borders the notch that the Winooski River has carved through the ridgeline of the Green Mountains over eons . The hiking trails on Camel 's Hump were among the first cut in the Long Trail system , and Camel 's Hump remains a popular summit for through - and day - hiking . The mountain is part of Camel 's Hump State Park .  - Lake Champlain (French: \\"Lac Champlain\\") is a natural freshwater lake in North America, mainly within the borders of the United States (states of Vermont and New York) but partially situated across the CanadaU.S. border in the Canadian province of Quebec.  - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.  - A mountain range (also mountain barrier, belt, or system) is a geographic area containing numerous geologically related mountains. A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets.  - New Hampshire is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by Massachusetts to the south, Vermont to the west, Maine and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north. New Hampshire is the 5th smallest by land area and the 9th least populous of the 50 United States.  - The Green Mountain Club is a non-profit membership organization dedicated to preserving and protecting Vermont's Long Trail - America's first long-distance hiking trail which stretches from the Massachusetts state line to the CanadaUnited States border, along the main ridge of the Green Mountains.

Q:Given the below context:  French painter Michel Marnet meets American singer Terry McKay aboard a liner crossing the Atlantic Ocean. They are both already engaged, he to heiress Lois Clarke, she to Kenneth Bradley. They begin to flirt and to dine together on the ship, but his notoriety and popularity on the ship make them conscious that others are watching. Eventually, they decide that they should dine separately and not associate with each other. At a stop at Madeira, they visit Michel's grandmother Janou, who approves of Terry and wants Michel to settle down. As the ship is ready to disembark at New York City, the two make an appointment to meet six months later on top of the Empire State Building. Michel chooses six months because that is the amount of time he needs to decide whether he can start making enough money to support a relationship with Terry.  When the rendezvous date arrives, they both head to the Empire State Building.  However, Terry is struck by a car right as she arrives, and is told that she may not be able to walk, though that will not be known for certain for six months. Not wanting to be a burden to Michel, she does not contact him, preferring to let him think the worst. Meanwhile, Terry recovers at an orphanage teaching the children how to sing. Six months go by, and during Terry's first outing since the accident, the two couples meet by accident at the theater, though Terry manages to conceal her condition.

This is part of their plan to get people living on Mars within the next 20 years. The US space agency is looking for people who are physically strong, have skills in maths, science and engineering, as well as having jet-pilot flying experience! Since it formed in 1958, Nasa has chosen more than 300 astronauts. Nasa will be accepting applications from 14 December through to mid-February 2016. It will hopefully announce the new astronauts in 2017. So what does it take to be an astronaut... In order to be considered to be an astronaut you have to have studied subjects like science, maths or engineering at university. This is so that you can carry out experiments in space and then send back the results to scientists on Earth. A good education also helps astronauts understand how to fix things in the spacecraft and keep everything running smoothly. Living in space causes all kinds of problems for the human body, including having weaker bones and losing muscle strength. After five months in orbit above the Earth, an astronaut would typically lose as much as 40% of muscle and 12% of bone mass, according to Jeremy Curtis from the UK Space Agency. Astronauts use special gyms on board the International Space Station to help keep their muscles active. During blast-off, astronauts can experience three times the force of gravity pressing down on them, than humans are normally exposed to here on Earth. They have to be physically strong to deal with this. Spacemen and women have to go through some pretty tough training before they become official astronauts. Scientists have to be sure that the trainee is strong enough both physically and mentally to live and work in space. It can get lonely when your family is home on Earth, so they have to be emotionally strong until they see them again. As part of their job astronauts might need to explore new places humans have never been to before, so they need to be courageous.","output":"NASA is seeking physically strong individuals with skills in math, science, engineering, and jet-pilot experience as part of their plan to send people to Mars within 20 years; astronauts must maintain their physical and mental strength as they face challenges in space, including muscle and bone loss and loneliness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Recently the subject of discrimination has been something I have been thinking a lot about. It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of. We have all suffered this in different ways, from serious racial hatred to someone not taking you seriously because you have long hair and an Iron Maiden t-shirt.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that owned the Hookend studio? ?  In Waters' absence, Gilmour had been recruiting musicians for a new project. Months previously, keyboardist Jon Carin had jammed with Gilmour at his Hookend studio, where he composed the chord progression that became \\"Learning to Fly\\", and so was invited onto the team. Gilmour invited Bob Ezrin (co-producer of 1979's The Wall) to help consolidate their material; Ezrin had turned down Waters' offer of a role on the development of his new solo album, Radio K.A.O.S., saying it was \\"far easier for Dave and I to do our version of a Floyd record\\". Ezrin arrived in England in mid-1986 for what Gilmour later described as \\"mucking about with a lot of demos\\".At this stage, there was no commitment to a new Pink Floyd release, and Gilmour maintained that the material might become his third solo album. CBS representative Stephen Ralbovsky hoped for a new Pink Floyd album, but in a meeting in November 1986, told Gilmour and Ezrin that the music \\"doesn't sound a fucking thing like Pink Floyd\\". Gilmour later said that the new project was difficult without Waters. He experimented with songwriters such as Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, but eventually settled on Anthony Moore, who was credited as co-writer of \\"Learning to Fly\\" and \\"On the Turning Away\\". Whereas many prior Pink Floyd albums are concept albums, Gilmour settled for the more conventional approach of a collection of songs without a thematic link. By the end of that year, he had decided to make the material into a Pink Floyd project. Answer:","output":"The owner of the Hookend studio, as mentioned in the article, is Gilmour.

When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that. Anger has its place in your life. You have to control it and use it directly to solve a problem. To this day I do not know how I accomplished what I did the way I did it. But, if I hadn't been so angry I would never have attempted it at all. Life is full of little lessons. Pay attention to them and learn.

Does the sentence \\"It was fought about 6 miles (9.7 km) west of Metz, where on the previous day, having intercepted the French army's retreat to the west at the Battle of Mars-La-Tour, the Prussians were now closing in to complete the destruction of the French forces.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"Where was the location of the Battle of Gravelotte?\\"","output":"Yes, the sentence does provide a valid answer to the question \\"Where was the location of the Battle of Gravelotte?\\". The Battle of Gravelotte took place about 6 miles (9.7 km) west of Metz on August 18, 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War. The Battle of Mars-La-Tour, mentioned in the sentence, is important context, as it led to the Battle of Gravelotte. Allow me to elaborate on the topic further. The Battle of Gravelotte, also known as the Battle of Gravelotte-St. Privat, was the largest battle of the Franco-Prussian War, involving nearly 200,000 soldiers. The battle was fought between the French Army led by Marshal François-Achille Bazaine and the Prussian army led by Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke the Elder. The Franco-Prussian War, lasting from July 19, 1870, to May 10, 1871, resulted from a long-simmering rivalry between the French Second Empire, led by Emperor Napoleon III, and the Kingdom of Prussia, which aimed to consolidate the various German states into a unified nation under Prussian leadership. The Prussian victory in the war ultimately led to the formation of the German Empire in 1871, further escalating tensions with France. The Battle of Mars-La-Tour took place on August 16, 1870, and resulted in a narrow Prussian victory over the French forces, who were retreating to the west. The Prussian army was able to prevent the French from reaching the fortress city of Verdun, forcing them to withdraw towards Metz, where Bazaine's forces were then effectively trapped. On August 18, the Prussian army continued to pursue the French by launching an assault on their positions at Gravelotte, about 6 miles west of Metz. The French had established strong defensive positions in several small villages along the road from Metz to Verdun, including Gravelotte and St. Privat. The ensuing battle was marked by bitter and desperate fighting, with both sides suffering massive casualties. Despite the overwhelming numbers of the Prussian forces and their tactical advantages, the French defense held firm. The French suffered approximately 20,000 casualties, while the Prussians sustained around 20,500. Although the battle was considered inconclusive, it provided a strategic victory for the Prussian forces, as it forced the French to retreat and remain trapped in Metz. After the battle, the French army remained besieged in Metz for several months, ultimately surrendering to the Prussians in October 1870. Meanwhile, the Prussian forces continued their advance into France, paving the way for their eventual capture of Paris in January 1871, which effectively ended the Franco-Prussian War and led to the formation of the German Empire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Like many other small boys, I was fascinated by cars, not least because my oldest brother was a bit of a car guy and subscribed to cool magazines like Car and Driver and Motor Trend. Every so often, one of those magazines would run an article on the \\"Car of the Future\\". They featured unconventional styling and things like small nuclear reactors as power sources. Yet, frankly, my car doesn't do anything that my brother's Studebaker didn't do. It goes, it stops, it burns gasoline, it plays music. I still have to steer it, and it still runs into things if I don't steer it carefully. But guess what? All of these things are subject to change in the not-so-distant future. It will still go and stop, but it may not burn gasoline, I may not have to steer it, and it may be a lot better at not running into things. Airbags aren't the be-all and end-all in safety. In fact, considering the recent news about people occasionally being killed by their airbags in low-speed collisions  ,they obviously still need some development. But they aren't going away, and in fact, you can expect to see cars appearing with additional, side-impact airbags, something some European car manufacturers already offer. Better than systems to minimize   injury in the event of an accident, however, are systems that minimize the likelihood of an accident happening in the first place. Future cars may be able to eliminate many of the major causes of accidents, including drunk-driving, tailgating   and sleepiness. Cars could be equipped with sensors that can detect alcohol in a driver's system and prevent the car from being started, for example. Many accidents are caused by people following the car in front too closely. As early as next year, you'll be able to buy cars with radar-equipped control systems. If the radar determines you're closing too quickly with the car in front, it will ease up on the throttle  . For city streets, expect other radar devices that will give advance warning that the car in front of you has slowed abruptly   and you should... According to the author, what will future cars do if the sensors detect alcohol in the driver's system? A) They will give a warning in advance. B) They will brake automatically.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Now that your child is old enough, they should have a big say in their party. Do they want it at home or out? What do they want to do? Do they want it during the day or at night?  If they have a bunch of ideas, narrow it down for them to 3 or so that you've preapproved – they can then pick which one they want from there. Talk about a budget and scheduling constraints. You'll have to be the voice of reason in this conversation. Be honest and let them know what's doable and what's not. Ask your teen to come up with \\"the short list\\" – 8 or so people they want at their party. Ultimately the party should be determined by where it is (if it's somewhere else, that's less work for you) and how long it's going to last. 8 people out for pizza is manageable, but you'll only want to take 3 or 4 to the amusement park.  You're finally at an age where it matters who gets invited – some people may not get along or not want to do certain things. Talk to your teen about what the people they're inviting are like, if they know each other, and any problems they foresee. Consider doing it elsewhere, like at a restaurant, trampoline park, bowling alley or arcade. Your teen likely wants freedom, and it's easier on you, too. Teens are at an age where feelings can get hurt. If your teen is inviting some kids at school and not others, find a way to make it so the invites are sent out discreetly. If they're not, it might start unnecessary drama that could dampen the event. If possible, send them via email. Ask for RSVPs so you know who is coming and can have a head count. Have your teen send reminder texts or phone calls, too, before the big day. Theme parties are fun for 4-year-olds, 40-year-olds, and everyone in between (though the themes change over time). Talk to your teen about having a theme – the kids can then dress up, you'll have fun planning out themed food, and it'll make it easier to decorate and find matching additions. This should be your teen's decision. As long as it's appropriate and doable, it should be a go. If you don't like it, give your teen a good reason why and offer alternatives. This is especially important if you're having the party at home: plan and arrange all the food and decorate till the cows come home. With a theme it'll be easier to pick out; if you don't have one, it's up to you. Here's a few things to keep in mind:  Keep the snacks coming; worry less about the main food. You can always whip up spaghetti or order pizza, depending on what the party-goers feel like. But don't forget the cake! To keep the mess better for you, buy plastic plates, forks, knives, and cups to keep the after-party clean-up to a minimum. Don't be nervous to ask other parents to bring along a few dishes if the party is at your house. A few bags of chips or some liters of soda is an easy way they can chip in. You need to be there to problem-solve and diffuse any tension, but when things are going well, allow them their space and their fun. They're at an age where they can take care of themselves. Be as far away as you feel is appropriate. Odds are your teen will need you to order the pizza or take care of any mess they create. While it may not be in the way you want, you'll likely be needed to stay relatively near.

Summarize: Gayle Nix Jackson is also seeking 10m (Â£6.6m) in compensation over the film shot by Orville Nix in November 1963. He sold the film to a news agency that year but it was later handed to the government for its inquiries. Ms Nix Jackson says she was told this year the government agency believed to be in possession did not have the film. The 8mm Nix film was shot from the opposite side of the presidential limousine from where the famous Zapruder film was taken on 22 November 1963. Why the legend of JFK endures The Nix film shows the bullet hitting the president, First Lady Jackie Kennedy climbing on to the boot of the limousine, and secret service agent Clint Hill jumping into the vehicle. The film is shot from Dealey Plaza, showing Zapruder across the street and the famous grassy knoll, from where some witnesses thought they heard a shot fired. It is not as complete as the Zapruder movie, as it shows only part of the assassination. However, the lawsuit cites the Warren Commission - which investigated the assassination - as saying the Nix film was \\"nearly as important as the Zapruder film\\". The government purchased the Zapruder film for 16m in 1999 in a settlement with his heirs. Orville Nix sold his film to UPI for 5,000 with an agreement for its return after 25 years.

Question: A commandary established in the region of Korea that expanded the rule of Emperor Wu to the Han River was? Context: The Xiongnu, a nomadic steppe confederation, defeated the Han in 200 BC and forced the Han to submit as a de facto inferior partner, but continued their raids on the Han borders. Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC) launched several military campaigns against them. The ultimate Han victory in these wars eventually forced the Xiongnu to accept vassal status as Han tributaries. These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia, divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations, and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road, which reached as far as the Mediterranean world. The territories north of Han's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation. Emperor Wu also launched successful military expeditions in the south, annexing Nanyue in 111 BC and Dian in 109 BC, and in the Korean Peninsula where the Xuantu and Lelang Commanderies were established in 108 BC.

He cleverly stops the truck, and when the LA County authorities find only gasoline in the tank, he shoots the tank and cocaine pours out of the bullet hole. Meanwhile, Cash arrives at his apartment driving an old Corvette. His hair is long and shaggy, and he is dressed in jeans, a T-shirt, and a waist-length jacket. He is shot by an intruder, but is protected by a bullet-proof vest, and captures the shooter in a parking garage after a car chase. At the police station, Cash forces the shooter to tell him about a deal scheduled to take place that night.However, the \\"deal\\" is really a plan by Perret to frame Tango and Cash for murder. Tango and Cash separately go to an empty building, preceded by a man who is revealed later in the film to be Requin (Brion James), Perret's lead henchman. After surprising each other, the two detectives find a dead man with audio equipment hidden under his clothing, and a team of FBI agents swarms in. Wyler, the agent in charge, finds Cash's pistol on the floor and arrests both Cash and Tango.At their murder trial, the detectives are incriminated by an audio tape, secretly given to Wyler by Requin and verified in court by an audio expert, which appears to reveal them shooting the FBI agent after discussing a drug purchase. They plead \\"no contest\\" to a lesser charge in exchange for reduced sentences in a minimum-security prison, but are transported to a maximum-security prison to be housed with many of the criminals they arrested in the past.Once in prison, Tango and Cash are rousted from their bunks and tortured by Perret, Requin, and a gang of prisoners until Matt Sokowski, the assistant warden, rescues them. Sokowski recommends that they escape, and provides them with a plan, but Tango refuses to go along with it. When Cash tries to escape, he finds Sokowski murdered and is attacked by prisoners. Tango rescues him, and... The answer is:","output":"Perret, Requin, and a gang of prisoners."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize this article: David De Silva, who worked at Pimperne Primary School in Blandford, pleaded guilty to false accounting. He submitted two fake invoices to the school's education finance officer to gain £3,300 but was cleared of fraud. The 39-year-old was ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and a 10-day rehabilitation activity. De Silva took out two legitimate loans of cash totalling £3,300 in 2013 from a school account that included charity payments and money paid by parents for school trips, Bournemouth Crown Court heard. Victoria Hill, defending, said the \\"hardship loan\\" was agreed by the chair of governors at the school. But the court heard \\"repeat attempts\\" were made to retrieve the cash from De Silva until 2016 when he announced he would be leaving the school for a new job. He then submitted two fake invoices totalling £3,300 for supposed computer work carried out on behalf of the school in 2013 by an IT company that did not exist until 2015. De Silva, of Organford Road, Holton Heath, Poole, left the school earlier this year and the cash owed was repaid. Sentencing, Judge Recorder Donald Tait said De Silva had \\"fallen a long way\\", but added: \\"No child suffered as a result of your stupidity.\\" At the time of the offence De Silva had marriage problems and was going through \\"a lot of stresses and strains\\", Ms Hill said.

While both questions are related to universities in North America and pertain to the subject of education, their focus and scope differ significantly. 1. The first question, \\"Which is the best university in Canada?\\", is a general inquiry about the top university in Canada. To answer this question, one would need to look at different criteria such as overall reputation, quality of education, research output, student satisfaction, and various ranking systems. Factors like subject specialization, campus facilities, and location might also influence the response, but the question doesn't indicate a specific field of study. A popular ranking system is the QS World University Rankings, which uses several indicators to rank universities, such as academic reputation, employer reputation, research citations, and student-faculty ratio. According to the 2021 QS World University Rankings, the University of Toronto is the best university in Canada, followed by McGill University and the University of British Columbia. 2. The second question, \\"What are the best universities in the USA and Canada for an MS in electrical engineering?\\", is more specific, as it seeks information about multiple universities that excel in offering a Master of Science degree in Electrical Engineering in both the USA and Canada. To answer this question, one would need to focus on the quality and reputation of the Electrical Engineering programs at these universities and their relevance in the professional world. In this case, it would be helpful to look at both overall rankings and subject-specific rankings. Some of the best universities in the USA and Canada for an MS in electrical engineering, based on various rankings and factors, include: - Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - Stanford University - University of California - Berkeley - California Institute of Technology (Caltech) - University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign - University of Michigan - Ann Arbor - University of California - Los Angeles (UCLA) - University of Texas - Austin - University of Toronto - University of Waterloo - McMaster University - University of British Columbia Ultimately, although both questions focus on university education in the context of North America, the first one inquires about the top university in Canada in general, while the second question focuses on the best universities in both the USA and Canada specifically for an MS in Electrical Engineering."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'. All I say is ‘Good’ and move on to the next customer. Hitler-lite phones my corporation to voice a complaint, so a suit comes out and asks the team who did it, I fess up so I can save the time and not have a reason to hate one of my co-workers. I get a lecture and a warning, the end. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How does she probably feel about her job? Options: - not enough information - That if she gets fired for being rude to a customer, she will just find another job - That it can be very stressful, and she doesn't get paid enough to go \\"Above and beyond\\" the call of duty - She really enjoys her job A:","output":"Based on the context provided, it is evident that the individual might feel that her job tends to be extremely stressful, and she does not get paid enough to go \\"above and beyond\\" the call of duty. Some considerations leading to this conclusion include the reference to a long queue of customers, the pressure from her manager to work faster, and her obligation to abide by the phrase \\"the customer is always right.\\" The fact that this chain cafe is consistently busy, with the customers varying from middle-aged to elderly individuals hints at the stress involved in dealing with demanding patrons. She uses the phrase \\"air-hostess smile\\" to illustrate that she has to keep up a facade of friendliness and professionalism, regardless of the pressure or difficulty of the working conditions. The image used suggests that it might be overwhelming sometimes to consistently maintain a pleasant face even in strained situations. Additionally, there is the pressure of dealing with customers in a very timely manner. She expresses her disappointment as she wishes \\"that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves\\" implying that she is under enormous stress trying to serve customers as quickly as possible, against the limitations of time and space. Her interaction with the upset customer and her response, supports the inference of her dissatisfaction with the undervalued and stressful nature of her job. Her statement, ‘Good’, in defiance of the typical customer service script, shows she is unwilling to always go \\"above and beyond,\\" a notion often demanded in roles focused on customer satisfaction. Finally, her readiness to confess to her expressions to the corporate representative further denotes her indifference about the possible consequences. She seems almost apathetic about the warning she receives and doesn't seem too worried about getting fired, which further signifies her low job enjoyment and hints at an unsatisfactory compensation for the level of demand and stress involved in her job.  Therefore, we may conclude that the individual feels her job can be very stressful, and she doesn't get paid enough to continually put in an effort that goes \\"above and beyond\\" her basic obligations. This inference seems to be the most accurate given the contextual information provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Recorded in Paris in August 1969 only two days after Yasmina , a Black Woman , it again features musicians from the Art Ensemble of Chicago . This time , the tone is resolutely set to avant garde and free jazz , with a political edge in the all but explicit tribute to Malcolm X. The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow states : \`\` This LP from the English Affinity LP is a mixed bag . Best is ' Rain Forrest ' on which tenor saxophonist Archie Shepp , in a collaboration with trombonist Grachan Moncur III , pianist Vince Benedetti , bassist Malachi Favors , and drummer Philly Joe Jones , perform some stirring free jazz ; the interplay between Shepp and Jones is particularly exciting . On a four - and - a - half minute ' Oleo , ' Shepp '' battles \`\` some bebop with fellow tenor Hank Mobley , but the other two tracks , a workout for the leader 's erratic soprano on ' Mamarose , ' and his emotional recitation on ' Poem for Malcolm , ' are much less interesting , making this a less than essential release despite ' Rain Forrest ' . '' It was originally issued on CD by Affinity ( paired with Yasmina , a Black Woman ) mastered from a vinyl source and later reissued by Charly ( also paired with Yasmina , a Black Woman ) from the original master tapes .  - Ragtime  also spelled rag-time or rag time  is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories.

Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - Polyrhythm is the simultaneous use of two or more conflicting rhythms, that are not readily perceived as deriving from one another, or as simple manifestations of the same meter. The rhythmic conflict may be the basis of an entire piece of music (cross-rhythm), or a momentary disruption. Polyrhythms can be distinguished from irrational rhythms, which can occur within the context of a single part; polyrhythms require at least two rhythms to be played concurrently, one of which is typically an irrational rhythm.  - Henry \\"Hank\\" Mobley (July 7, 1930  May 30, 1986) was an American hard bop and soul jazz tenor saxophonist and composer. Mobley was described by Leonard Feather as the \\"middleweight champion of the tenor saxophone\\", a metaphor used to describe his tone, that was neither as aggressive as John Coltrane nor as mellow as Stan Getz, and his style that was laid-back, subtle and melodic, especially in contrast with players like Sonny Rollins and Coltrane.

The ensemble integrates many jazz styles and plays many instruments, including \\"little instruments\\": bells, bicycle horns, birthday party noisemakers, wind chimes, and various forms of percussion. The musicians wear costumes and face paint while performing. These characteristics combine to make the ensemble's performances both aural and visual. While playing in Europe in 1969, five hundred instruments were used.  - The Jazz Age was a period in the 1920s, ending with the Great Depression, in which jazz music and dance styles became popular, mainly in the United States, but also in Britain, France and elsewhere. Jazz originated in New Orleans as a fusion of African and European music and played a significant part in wider cultural changes in this period, and its influence on pop culture continued long afterwards. The Jazz Age is often referred to in conjunction with the Roaring Twenties.  - In musical terminology, tempo (\\"time\\" in Italian; plural: \\"tempi\\" ) is the speed or pace of a given piece or subsection thereof, how fast or slow. Tempo is related to meter and is usually measured by beats per minute, with the beats being a division of the measures, though tempo is often indicated by terms which have acquired standard ranges of beats per minute or assumed by convention without indication. Tempo may be separated from articulation, or articulation may be indicated along with tempo, and tempo contributes to the overall texture. While the ability to hold a steady tempo is a desirable skill, tempo is changeable, and often indicated by a conductor or drummer. While practicing, an electronic or mechanical device, a metronome, may indicate the tempo, as one usually works one's way up to being able to perform at the proper tempo. In other words it is the speed at which a passage of music is or should be played.  - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo.  - Île-de-France (, , \\"Island of France\\"), also known as the \\"région parisienne\\" (\\"Parisian Region\\"; see Etymology), is one of the 18 regions of France, and includes the city of Paris. It covers 12012 square kilometers (4638 square miles), and has its own regional council and president. It has a population of 12,005,077 as of January 2014, or 18.2 percent of the population of France.  - BYG Actuel was a French record label specializing in free jazz. The label also released a small number of non-jazz recordings by artists such as Musica Elettronica Viva, Freedom, and Gong.  - Hard bop is a subgenre of jazz that is an extension of bebop (or \\"bop\\") music. Journalists and record companies began using the term in the mid-1950s to describe a new current within jazz which incorporated influences from rhythm and blues, gospel music, and blues, especially in saxophone and piano playing.  - Bebop or bop is a style of jazz developed in the early to mid-1940s in the United States, which features songs characterized by a fast tempo, complex chord progressions with rapid chord changes and numerous changes of key, instrumental virtuosity, and improvisation based on a combination of harmonic structure, the use of scales and occasional references to the melody.  - AllMusic (previously known as All Music Guide or AMG) is an online music guide service website. It was launched in 1991 by All Media Guide which later became All Media Network.  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - Modal jazz is jazz that uses musical modes rather than chord progressions as a harmonic framework. Originating in the late 1950s and 1960s, modal jazz is epitomized by Miles Davis's 1958 composition \\"Milestones\\", 1959 album \\"Kind of Blue\\", and John Coltrane's classic quartet from 196064. Other important performers include Woody Shaw, Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, McCoy Tyner, Larry Young, Pharoah Sanders, Joe Henderson, Chick Corea and Bobby Hutcherson. Though the term comes from the use of the pitches of particular modes (or scales) in the creation of solos, modal jazz compositions or accompaniments may only or additionally make use of the following techniques:  - Free jazz is an approach to jazz music that was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s as musicians attempted to alter, extend, or break down jazz convention, often by discarding fixed chord changes or tempos. Though the music of free jazz composers varied widely, a common feature was dissatisfaction with the limitations of bebop, hard bop, and modal jazz that had developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Often described as avant-garde, free jazz has also been described as an attempt to return jazz to its primitive, often religious, roots and emphasis on collective improvisation.  - Grachan Moncur III (born June 3, 1937) is an American jazz trombonist. He is the son of jazz bassist Grachan Moncur II and the nephew of jazz saxophonist Al Cooper.  - Stanley \\"Stan\\" Getz (February 2, 1927  June 6, 1991) was an American jazz saxophonist. Playing primarily the tenor saxophone, Getz was known as \\"The Sound\\" because of his warm, lyrical tone, his prime influence being the wispy, mellow timbre of his idol, Lester Young. Coming to prominence in the late 1940s with Woody Herman's big band, Getz is described by critic Scott Yanow as \\"one of the all-time great tenor saxophonists\\". Getz went on to perform in bebop and cool jazz groups, but is perhaps best known for popularizing bossa nova with the worldwide hit single \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\" (1964) performed with Astrud Gilberto, and for his work done under the influence of João Gilberto and Antônio Carlos Jobim.  - Yasmina, a Black Woman is a jazz album by Archie Shepp, recorded in 1969 in Paris for BYG Actuel records. It features musicians from the Art Ensemble of Chicago. The first track, giving its title to the album, is a long free jazz piece by an 11-piece orchestra; in it, the references to Africa that Shepp had experimented with only a few weeks earlier in Algiers are to be found in the use of African percussion instruments, or the African incantations sung by Shepp himself at the beginning of the track. The other two pieces, a homage to Sonny Rollins written by trombonist Grachan Moncur III and a standard, played by a more traditional quintet and quartet respectively, are more reminiscent of the hard bop genre, although the fiery playing of the musicians, notably Shepp himself, gives them a definite avant-garde edge. It was originally issued on CD by Affinity (paired with \\"Poem for Malcolm\\"), mastered from an incredibly noisy vinyl source and later reissued by Charly (also paired with \\"Poem for Malcolm\\") from the original master tapes.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: KAT-TUN (katoun, Katun) is a Japanese boy band formed under Johnny & Associates (Johnny's) in 2001. The group's name was originally an acronym based on the first letter of each member's family name: Kazuya Kamenashi, Jin Akanishi, Junnosuke Taguchi, Koki Tanaka, Tatsuya Ueda, and Yuichi Nakamaru. Their debut on March 22, 2006 was marked by a tripartite release of a CD single, album and music DVD on their exclusive record label J-One Records. Since then, all of their single, album and music DVD releases have debuted at number one on the Oricon music and DVD charts. On March 22, KAT-TUN released their debut single \\"Real Face\\", accompanied by an album, Best of KAT-TUN and a DVD Real Face Film. These were released on their own label J-One Records. The group also went on a nationwide tour, Live of KAT-TUN \\"Real Face\\", in support of the album. Within the first week, Best of KAT-TUN, \\"Real Face\\" and Real Face Film topped all three Oricon weekly charts by selling 556,548 copies, 754,234 copies and 374,202 copies respectively. They became the second artists to do so, the first being Ayumi Hamasaki. With these numbers, KAT-TUN holds the record for the highest weekly single debut sales (previously held by Arashi with their debut single \\"Arashi\\" of 557,000 copies sold in 1999). In addition, \\"Real Face\\" topped the Oricon charts for three weeks straight, becoming the first debut single to do so in Japan in 8 years 8 months since KinKi Kids' debut single \\"Garasu no Shonen.\\" The single sold over a million copies in nine weeks, making \\"Real Face\\" the highest selling single for the year 2006.  In March 2006, KAT-TUN became the first group to hold their own performances in Japan's most popular stadium, Tokyo Dome, before debuting. They performed to 110,000 people over two days and about 630,000 people in total during the tour. About three months after releasing \\"Real Face\\", KAT-TUN released their second single, \\"Signal\\", on July 19.  On October 12, member Akanishi announced a hiatus from the group in order to study linguistics abroad in the United States, leaving KAT-TUN as a five-member group for six months. The remaining members continued activities by releasing their third single, \\"Bokura no Machi de\\" as the theme song to members Kamenashi and Tanaka's drama, Tatta Hitotsu no Koi and their second album, Cartoon KAT-TUN II You on December 7.

The Osmond Brothers, also known as The Osmonds, are an American family music band of seven siblings who enjoyed great success in the 1970s. They were initially composed of brothers Alan, Wayne, Merrill, and Jay Osmond. Little brothers Donny and Jimmy joined a bit later. Merrill Osmond, born on April 30, 1953, is the lead singer and bassist of the band. He often shared lead vocals with Donny in the band's hits. He was also the band's “office boy” and was deeply involved in business matters.  Let's look at a brief profile of each brother: 1. Alan Osmond (born June 22, 1949): He functioned as a leader of the band, creating choreography and maintaining group discipline. Alan performed as a lead singer, dancer, and played mandolin and guitar. 2. Wayne Osmond (born August 28, 1951): He sang lead on some of the band's songs as well as backup vocals. He also played guitar, and sometimes piano and saxophone. 3. Merrill Osmond (born April 30, 1953): Known for his strong leading voice, Merrill also played bass guitar and often shared the lead vocals with Donny. 4. Jay Osmond (born March 2, 1955): He served as the main drummer and also provided vocals. His notable strong beat added a unique element to the band's sound. 5. Donny Osmond (born December 9, 1957): He was the most popular Osmond, breaking off into a solo career. He often shared the lead vocals with Merrill. Donny also played keyboard, banjo, and guitar. 6. Jimmy Osmond (born April 16, 1963): He was the youngest of the Osmond Brothers and mostly performed as a solo artist. He occasionally joined his brothers on stage and later began managing the Osmond's business affairs. The brothers produced many popular albums throughout the '70s, disbanded for a while, and later regrouped. All members had their specific roles, contributing to the songs' harmonies, choreography, and charismatic performances. After their peak music career, the brothers diversified their efforts and found success in various ventures like writing, acting, charity work, and business, while still making time for periodic performances together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler.  Now, I have a new situation: David is trying to understand temperature and the science behind it. He took two objects, object A and object B, to his physics professor. Object A had higher temperature, but object B had lower temperature. His physics professor explained him why one object's temperature was higher while other object's temperature was lower.  Answer this question please: Would particles move slower or faster in object A than in object B? Answer:","output":"Considering the given background information about temperature, we can deduce the following: In object A, the temperature is higher. This means the particles of matter in object A are moving more quickly, resulting in more average kinetic energy and a warmer feel. In object B, the temperature is lower.

Abstract: Background:Chronic cyclosporine A (CsA) nephrotoxicity (CCN) is a major cause of chronic renal dysfunction and has no effective clinical interventions yet. Objective: To reveal the mechanisms of renal cell apoptosis in CCN, we analyzed all in vitro studies of such mechanisms. Methods: We collected all in vitro studies about the mechanisms of renal cell apoptosis induced by CsA in Medline (1966 to July 2010), Embase (1980 to July 2010) and ISI (1986 to July 2010), evaluated their quality according to in vitro standards and extracted data following the PICOS principles and synthesized the data. Results: First,CsA could upregulate Fas and Fas-L expression, increase FADD and apoptosis enzymes (caspase-2, -3, -4, -7, -8, -9 and -10) and downregulate the Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Second, CsA could induce oxidative stress and damage the antioxidant defense system. Third, CsA could increase the expression of HERP, GRP78 and CHOP. Fourth, CsA could induce renal cell apoptosis and increase their iNOS and p53 expression in cultured cells. Conclusions: At least four pathways are involved in renal cell apoptosis induced by CsA in different cell species. Caspases might be their final common pathway in vitro. They might all provide potential points for interventions, but these need to be confirmed in vivo..

Information:  - Edgar Allan Poe (born Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809  October 7, 1849) was an American writer, editor, and literary critic. Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story. Poe is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.  - Supernatural fiction or supernaturalist fiction is a genre of literary and media fiction exploiting or requiring as plot devices or themes some contradictions of the commonplace natural world and materialist assumptions about it.   - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature.  - A film genre (or ) is a motion picture category based on similarities in either the narrative elements or the emotional response to the film (namely, serious, comic, etc.). Most theories of film genre are borrowed from literary genre criticism. The basic genres include fiction and documentary, from which subgenres have emerged, such as docufiction and docudrama. Other subgenres include the courtroom and trial-focused drama known as the legal drama. Types of fiction which may seem unrelated can also be combined to form hybrid subgenres, such as the melding of horror and comedy in the \\"Evil Dead\\" films. Other popular combinations are the romantic comedy and the action comedy film.  - Evil Dead II (referred to in publicity materials as Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn) is a 1987 American comedy horror film directed by Sam Raimi. It is a parody sequel to the 1981 horror film \\"The Evil Dead\\". The film was written by Raimi and Scott Spiegel (they wrote the screenplay during the production of another collaboration, \\"Crimewave\\"), produced by Robert Tapert, and stars Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams.  - Abraham \\"Bram\\" Stoker (8 November 1847  20 April 1912) was an Irish author, best known today for his 1897 Gothic novel \\"Dracula\\". During his lifetime, he was better known as the personal assistant of actor Henry Irving and business manager of the Lyceum Theatre in London, which Irving owned.  - Darkman is a 1990 American superhero film directed and co-written by Sam Raimi. It is based on a short story Raimi wrote that paid homage to Universal's horror films of the 1930s. The film stars Liam Neeson as Peyton Westlake, a scientist who is attacked and left for dead by a ruthless mobster, Robert Durant (Larry Drake), after his girlfriend, an attorney (Frances McDormand), runs afoul of a corrupt developer (Colin Friels).  - In works of art, macabre is the quality of having a grim or ghastly atmosphere. Macabre works emphasize the details and symbols of death. The term also refers to works particularly gruesome in nature.  - Horror film is a film genre that seeks to elicit a negative emotional reaction from viewers by playing on their fears. Inspired by literature from authors like Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley, horror films have existed for more than a century. The macabre and the supernatural are frequent themes. Horror may also overlap with the fantasy, supernatural fiction and thriller genres.  - Scott Spiegel (born December 24, 1957) is an American screenwriter, film director, producer and actor. He is best known for co-writing the screenplay for the movie \\"Evil Dead II\\" with longtime friend, film director Sam Raimi, with whom he attended Wylie E. Groves High School in Birmingham, Michigan. Spiegel played the role of Scotty in Raimi's \\"Within the Woods\\", which served as a precursor to \\"The Evil Dead\\".  - The Evil Dead is a 1981 American supernatural horror film written and directed by Sam Raimi and executive produced by Raimi and Bruce Campbell, who also stars alongside Ellen Sandweiss and Betsy Baker. The film focuses on five college students vacationing in an isolated cabin in a remote wooded area. After they find an audiotape that releases a legion of demons and spirits, members of the group suffer from demonic possession, leading to increasingly gory mayhem. Raimi and the cast produced the short film \\"Within the Woods\\" as a \\"prototype\\" to build the interest of potential investors, which secured Raimi US90,000 to produce \\"The Evil Dead\\". The film was shot on location in a remote cabin located in Morristown, Tennessee, in a difficult filming process that proved extremely uncomfortable for the majority of the cast and crew.  - Fear is a feeling induced by perceived danger or threat that occurs in certain types of organisms, which causes a change in metabolic and organ functions and ultimately a change in behavior, such as fleeing, hiding, or freezing from perceived traumatic events. Fear in human beings may occur in response to a specific stimulus occurring in the present, or in anticipation or expectation of a future threat perceived as a risk to body or life. The fear response arises from the perception of danger leading to confrontation with or escape from/avoiding the threat (also known as the fight-or-flight response), which in extreme cases of fear (horror and terror) can be a freeze response or paralysis.  In humans and animals, fear is modulated by the process of cognition and learning. Thus fear is judged as rational or appropriate and irrational or inappropriate. An irrational fear is called a phobia.  - Within the Woods is a 1978 horror short film written, directed and produced by Sam Raimi. Raimi drew inspiration from his earlier short film \\"Clockwork\\", deciding to produce a \\"prototype\\" horror film to help build the interest of potential investors. Raimi cast his friends Bruce Campbell and Ellen Sandweiss as the two protagonists and produced the film for 1600. Shot on location in a remote cabin in the woods, production was a difficult process because of the low budget. Several of the special effects presented in the film were done in a severely low budget manner, some of which were improvised on set. The film centers around demonic possession and mysterious forces originating from the woods.  - Clockwork is a 1978 American short horror film directed by Sam Raimi , starring Scott Spiegel and Cheryl Guttridge .  - Birmingham is a city in Oakland County of the U.S. state of Michigan and a suburb of Detroit. As of the 2010 census, the population was 20,103.  - Samuel M \\"Sam\\" Raimi (born October 23, 1959) is an American film director, producer, screenwriter and actor, famous for creating the cult horror \\"Evil Dead\\" series, as well as directing the original \\"Spider-Man\\" trilogy (200207) and the 1990 superhero film \\"Darkman.\\" His most recent work is the 2013 Disney fantasy film \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\".

Answer the following question: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what do DNA and RNA work together to create?\\" is \\"albumin\\", given that  dNA and RNA work together to create albumin? Pick your answer from: (A). Yes (B). No Answer:","output":"B. No While it is true that DNA and RNA work together to create various proteins, including albumin, it is not accurate to say that they specifically create albumin alone. DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) contains the genetic information required for the synthesis of proteins in our bodies. RNA (Ribonucleic acid) takes on multiple roles in the process of translating the genetic information stored in DNA into functional proteins. There are three main types of RNA that participate in protein synthesis: 1. Messenger RNA (mRNA): mRNA carries the genetic information from DNA in the nucleus to the cytoplasm where protein synthesis occurs. 2. Transfer RNA (tRNA): tRNA brings specific amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, to the ribosomes where the protein synthesis takes place. 3. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA): rRNA forms the core of the ribosome and helps to ensure the proper positioning of mRNA and tRNA for the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids. The process of protein synthesis consists of two main stages: 1. Transcription: During transcription, an mRNA molecule is created through the synthesis of a complementary RNA strand using DNA as a template. This process is carried out by the enzyme RNA polymerase, which unwinds the DNA double helix and reads the sequence of nucleotides to create a corresponding and complementary mRNA molecule. 2. Translation: In the translation process, the mRNA molecule is read by the ribosome, and tRNA molecules bring the appropriate amino acids to the ribosome based on the triplet code specified by the mRNA. The ribosome facilitates the formation of peptide bonds between these amino acids, leading to the formation of a polypeptide chain, which then folds into a functional protein. In summary, DNA and RNA work together to create a wide variety of proteins, not just albumin. Albumin is a specific type of protein primarily found in blood plasma, and although its synthesis involves DNA and RNA, it would be an oversimplification to say that DNA and RNA work together solely to create albumin. Instead, they collaborate in the complex process of protein synthesis, which generates a diverse array of proteins essential for various biological functions within the body."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Squire wrote in 1885: His sense of form was so strong, and his refined nature so abhorred any mere seeking after effect, that his music sometimes gives the impression of being produced under restraint. He seldom, if ever, gave rein to his unbridled fancy; everything is justly proportioned, clearly defined, and kept within the limits which the conscientiousness of his self-criticism would not let him overstep. It is this which makes him, as has been said, so peculiarly a musician's composer: the broad effects and bold contrasts which an uneducated public admires are absent; it takes an educated audience to appreciate to the full the exquisitely refined and delicate nature of his genius. Temperley suggests that, despite his reverence for Mendelssohn, Bennett took Mozart as his model. Geoffrey Bush agrees that \\"[h]is best work, like his piano playing, was full of passion none the less powerful for being Mozartian (that is to say, perfectly controlled)\\", and characterizes him as \\"essentially a composer for the piano, a composer of the range (not necessarily the stature) of Chopin\\".

The principal reason for the Ottoman defeat in the fall of 1912 was the decision on part of the Ottoman government to respond to the ultimatum from the Balkan League on 15 October 1912 by declaring war at a time when the Ottoman mobilization ordered on 1 October was only partially complete. At the time of the declaration of war there were 580,000 Ottoman soldiers in the Balkans facing 912,000 soldiers of the Balkan League. The bad condition of the roads together with sparse railroad network had led to the Ottoman mobilization being grossly behind schedule, and many of the commanders were new to their units, having only been appointed on 1 October 1912. The Turkish historian Handan Nezir Akmeșe wrote the best response when faced with the Balkan League ultimatum on 15 October on the part of the Ottomans would have been to try to stall for time via diplomacy while completing the mobilization instead of declaring war at once. The War Minister Nazim Pasha and the Navy Minister Mahmund Muhtar Pasha had presented over-optimistic pictures of the Ottoman readiness for war to the Cabinet in October 1912 and advised that the Ottoman forces should take the offensive at once at the outbreak of hostilities. By contrast, many senior army commanders were advocating taking the defensive when the war began, arguing that the incomplete mobilization together with serious logistic problems made taking the offensive impossible.

Each of the provided inputs contains a sentence with a target pronoun and a question about how to justify the coreference between a noun phrase and the target pronoun. Good practices involve the discussion about how the descriptions attached to the targeted pronoun relate to the noun phrase candidate in the question. The reasoning could come from one or multiple following knowledge types about commonsense: First: 'Property', the knowledge about property of objects (e.g., ice is cold). Second: 'Object', the knowledge about objects (e.g., cats have ears). Third: 'Eventuality', the knowledge about eventuality (e.g., 'wake up' happens before 'open eyes'). Forth: 'Spatial', the knowledge about spatial position (e.g., object at the back can be blocked). Fifth: 'Quantity', the knowledge about numbers (e.g., 2 is smaller than 10).

Which county used more nuclear fission to produce energy?  Marion county used coal and oil to produce electricity, while James county used nuclear energy for its electricity production. Both counties had a flourishing economy.  Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later.

Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in some areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to \\"put forward views and proposals\\" with \\"determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments\\".  - Damon Quinn (born 12 April 1964) is a Northern Irish actor, writer and producer.

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.

Its grandeur and mystique attracted urban explorers and the bravest kids in town who would dare each other to visit it in the dead of night. The house was filled with stories of peculiar occupants and inexplicable happenings. Locals shared tales about the extraordinary original owners, the Blythefield family, who were believed to possess magical powers. In this same little town lived a girl named Emily. She had a wild imagination and loved reading anything that could make her heart race or escape to far-off places. Naturally, she became drawn to the stories of the Blythefield house. Her curiosity piqued, she decided to unravel the mystery herself.  One sunny afternoon, Emily summoned the courage to enter the house. With her wide hazel eyes, she scanned the magnificent details in each room with eager fascination. Despite her limited understanding of magic, she was determined to unveil the secrets of the Blythefield family, hoping to lift any curses and restore the house's former glory. After several days spent rummaging through dusty tomes in the dilapidated library, Emily stumbled across a cryptic treasure map hidden in an ancient leather-bound tome. The map pointed to the attic, and with her heart pounding and her curiosity stronger than her fear, she ascended the creaky stairs. The attic was full of strange artifacts, but one object caught Emily's eye: a small wooden box carved with intricate symbols. When she approached it, she felt a sudden rush of energy that sent chills down her spine. With trembling hands, she carefully opened the box and found a tiny, pulsating golden orb. In that moment, a ghostly figure appeared before her, startling the young girl. The figure introduced itself as a distant relative of the Blythefields, who had been waiting for the right person to find this very orb. The ghost explained that the family's magical power had been entrapped within the orb, and Emily's discovery had finally freed it. Out of gratitude, the ghost offered Emily both the house and the magical powers embedded in the orb. Emily was ecstatic but nervous, unsure whether to accept such an incredible gift. The ghost assured her that she was the chosen one, and using the Blythefield magic for good would help the world and satisfy her adventurous spirit. Taking a deep breath, Emily decided to embrace her destiny as the new magical owner of the house. With the spirit of the Blythefields residing within her, she vowed to utilize the house as a haven for those in need and share her newfound powers to make the world a better place.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Q: What is the full name of the grandfather of the woman married to Maximilian I? ?  A number of factors led to the popularity of Netherlandish illuminators. Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of liturgical texts. There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death. According to Thomas Kren, Philip's \\"library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety\\". Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and Margaret of York; his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I; and to his son-in-law, Edward IV, who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library.Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important. Illuminators responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites, including Edward IV of England, James IV of Scotland and Eleanor of Viseu.

It's been a while since I visited this place probably the last time was the original location on Maryland Parkway at least 4 years ago.   I gotta say that I was impressed. We were greeted promptly and given a good table. They are very kid friendly as well. Our waitress was very friendly, attentive and helpful. The fries with some sort of remoulade sauce were tasty. Could not stop eating them and took some to go.   I missed having a good calamari app and this one did not fall short of expectations. Crispy light and flavorful with a great tasting marinara type sauce. We also ordered the hummus and eggplant appetizers. This is one of 2 reasons why this is about a 4 - 4.5 star review. The food runner dropped off the the apps but failed to give us any type of flat bread or whatever for dipping. Our waitress was able to correct this about 6 minutes later.   Entrees we had the chicken curry with basmati rice....winner winner you know the rest. The Moussaka unexpectedly had beef, duh shoud have read the menu better, but was nothing short of great.   We took some gyros to go for some friends. Had a bite later, the meat was great, good tzaziki sauce, but it just needs a better wrapper.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence 1: 5 percent, according to the Social Security Trustees' intermediate actuarial projections. Sentence 2: The intermediate actuarial projection of the Social Security Trustees is one percent. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"The two sentences provided present two different projections related to Social Security Trustees' intermediate actuarial forecasts. The first statement puts the projection at 5 percent, while the second sentence suggests a projection of 1 percent. Considering the information given, if the first statement is true and the projection is indeed 5 percent, then the second statement cannot simultaneously be true with a projection of 1 percent.  Actuarial projections, like those made by the Social Security Trustees, are forecasts made based on a variety of statistical and mathematical methods, using assumptions about future demographic, economic, and programmatic trends. They help predict how much money will be needed to provide benefits for future retirees, survivors of workers, and disabled persons. These calculations involve numerous factors including population growth rate, life expectancy, inflation rate, wage growth, unemployment rates, and many more. So, changing just one assumption can produce significantly different projections.  More specifically, the 'intermediate' actuarial projections you're asking about typically represent the trustees' best estimate of future experience. Usually, there are also low-cost and high-cost projections that represent more optimistic and pessimistic possibilities, respectively. Therefore, while there can be a range of possible projections, there must be consensus on which one is the 'intermediate' or most likely scenario. If these two sentences refer to the same point in time, then they present a contradiction, since the same projection cannot be both 5 percent and 1 percent. So if we accept the first sentence as true, implying the projection is 5 percent, then the second sentence must either be outdated, based off of different assumptions, or simply incorrect. In other words, the forecast could indeed change over time, and the projection can vary depending on the assumptions used. However, at any given moment, there can only be one 'intermediate' actuarial projection from the Social Security Trustees, which makes one of these two sentences incorrect under the given circumstances. Assuming that the first statement is true, the second statement must then be false. But to accurately determine the truth of these sentences, one would need to reference the original source of these projections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Rocky runs in and robs the bank, while Bugs steps into the car and is buried under the bags of money Rocky returns with.The car quickly departs the bank. When Rocky realizes they have an unwanted passenger, he trains his pistol on Bugs and asks him what he knows.

And I was wondering What will Austin want to do next? Choices: 1). annoy Austin before this. 2). enter the house before this. 3). hit Tracy on her head.","output":"Given the context provided, it seems that Austin has already hit Tracy on her head after she entered his father's house. However, it is not possible to predict Austin's further actions with absolute certainty, as human behaviors are subject to a myriad of factors such as emotions, values, beliefs, and prior experiences. Nevertheless, it is plausible to speculate on a range of potential reactions Austin might have. Based on the information provided, we can ignore choices 1), 2), and 3) because they have already occurred. Here are some potential next steps for Austin after he has already hit Tracy on her head: 1) Regretting his actions and apologizing: Austin might immediately feel guilt or regret for his violent reaction towards Tracy. He may realize that hitting her was not an appropriate response, regardless of the situation. In this case, he might approach Tracy and apologize for his actions, ensuring that she is okay and uninjured. 2) Escalating the conflict: On the other hand, Austin could feel his initial violent outburst justified his anger and annoyance. Therefore, he could escalate the conflict further, potentially by yelling at Tracy, kicking her out of his father's house, or calling law enforcement to report her trespassing. 3) Seeking help from a third party: Austin might realize that he cannot deal with the situation on his own, prompting him to reach out to a friend, family member, or neighbor for support and advice. This could help him process his emotions and reflect on his behavior, as well as the situation as a whole. 4) Engaging in a conversation with Tracy: If Austin manages to calm down, he might try to engage in a conversation with Tracy to understand her motives for entering his father's house. He may attempt to address and resolve any underlying issues, misunderstandings, or conflicts that led to this incident, and work out a mutually agreeable solution. 5) Reflecting on the incident and re-evaluating personal boundaries: Austin could take some time to reflect on the underlying causes that led to his violent reaction towards Tracy. He may try to identify better ways of managing his anger and establishing clear boundaries with those around him, including Tracy. This could involve seeking professional help, such as visiting a counselor or therapist. In summary, while it is challenging to predict Austin's exact next steps, several potential scenarios can be considered. These include regretting his actions and apologizing, escalating the conflict, seeking help from a third party, engaging in a conversation with Tracy, or reflecting on the incident and re-evaluating his personal boundaries. Ultimately, Austin's response will be influenced by numerous factors, such as his emotions, values, and beliefs, as well as the specific context of the situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

CONTEXT: El ministro egipcio del Interior, general Habib Al Adli, justificó la ampliación por otros tres años del estado de emergencia, vigente en el país desde 1981, al considerar que es necesario para luchar contra el terrorismo. \\"El estado de emergencia se amplió como medida para asegurar lo conseguido en los últimos años, incluido el mantenimiento de la estabilidad y la limitación de los efectos de la violencia y el crimen organizado\\", afirma Al Adli, en una entrevista publicada hoy, viernes, por el diario egipcio de propiedad estatal \\"Al Ahram\\". Para el ministro, \\"la contención del terrorismo en Egipto no significa que haya desaparecido del país\\". \\"Nadie puede proclamar que el terrorismo se ha acabado en Egipto\\", dijo en referencia a los grupos integristas islámicos que, desde hace ocho años, mantienen la lucha armada como método para derrocar al régimen actual e imponer otro de estricta obediencia coránica. El Parlamento egipcio, en el que más del 95 por ciento de los diputados pertenece al gobernante Partido Nacional Democrático (PND), decidió la semana pasada ampliar otros tres años el estado de emergencia en todo el país, vigente desde que hace 19 años fue asesinado el anterior presidente, Anuar Sadat. Pese a que Adli insiste en que el estado de emergencia \\"no supone una limitación para las libertades públicas, la democracia y la libertad de expresión\\", los partidos opositores, las organizaciones de defensa de los derechos humanos y otros grupos comprometidos con las libertades públicas han recurrido la ley ante los tribunales. Estas organizaciones consideran que el estado de emergencia es utilizado por el régimen, que encabeza el presidente, Hosni Mubarak, como arma para combatir a la oposición y reprimir a los defensores de los derechos humanos, al conceder a las autoridades el derecho a actuar y practicar detenciones indefinidas sin control judicial. Miles de integristas islámicos, violentos y contrarios a la violencia, se encuentran encarcelados en Egipto sin juicio merced a esta ley e incluso algunos destacados sindicalistas y defensores de los derechos humanos están procesados por tribunales militares y de seguridad del Estado bajo esta legislación.

Question: What does Delacroix make his gunshot wound appear to be? Title: Bamboozled Movie plot: Pierre Delacroix (whose real name is Peerless Dothan), is an uptight, Harvard University-educated black man, working for the television network CNS. At work, he has to endure torment from his boss Thomas Dunwitty, a tactless, boorish white man. Not only does Dunwitty use AAVE, and use the word \\"nigger\\" repeatedly in conversations, he also proudly proclaims that he is more black than Delacroix and that he can use nigger since he is married to a black woman and has two mixed-race children. Dunwitty frequently rejects Delacroix's scripts for television series that portray black people in positive, intelligent scenarios, dismissing them as \\"Cosby clones\\". In an effort to escape his contract through being fired, Delacroix develops a minstrel show with the help of his personal assistant Sloane Hopkins. Mantan: The New Millennium Minstrel Show features black actors in blackface, extremely racist jokes and puns, and offensively stereotyped CGI-animated cartoons that caricature the leading stars of the new show. Delacroix and Hopkins recruit two impoverished street performers â Manray, named after American artist Man Ray, and Womack â to star in the show. While Womack is horrified when Delacroix tells him details about the show, Manray sees it as his big chance to become rich and famous for his tap-dancing skills. To Delacroix's horror, not only does Dunwitty enthusiastically endorse the show, it also becomes hugely successful. As soon as the show premieres, Manray and Womack become big stars, while Delacroix, contrary to his original stated intent, defends the show as being satirical. Delacroix quickly embraces the show, his newfound fame and awards while Hopkins becomes horrified at the racist nightmare she has helped to unleash. Meanwhile, an underground, militant rap group called the Mau Maus, led by Hopkins' older brother Julius, becomes increasingly angry at the content of the show.

Her childhood home was among 400 buildings engulfed as 200 million tons of ash and lava rained down in the days following the eruption. When OPTIONS: - Eldfell erupted, the lava flow almost cut the harbor off entirely. - Heimaey erupted, the lava flow almost cut the harbor off entirely. - Helga Jonsdottir erupted, the lava flow almost cut the harbor off entirely. - Iceland erupted, the lava flow almost cut the harbor off entirely. - Icelandic erupted, the lava flow almost cut the harbor off entirely. - Jonsdottir erupted, the lava flow almost cut the harbor off entirely. - Reykjavik erupted, the lava flow almost cut the harbor off entirely.","output":"When Eldfell erupted, the lava flow almost cut the harbor off entirely. This eruption on Heimaey, a small island just off the coast of Iceland, had a massive impact on the local community, as well as the landscape and ecosystem of the island. The eruption itself lasted for several months, with millions of tons of lava and ash spewing forth from the volcano, destroying homes and reshaping the geography of the area. In the aftermath of the eruption, the people of Heimaey were faced with an uncertain future. With a large portion of the island's infrastructure destroyed and the landscape drastically altered, many were unsure if they would be able to return to their homes or rebuild their lives. However, the resilient Icelandic spirit prevailed, and the residents of Heimaey began the long process of recovery and reconstruction. One of the most significant tasks in this process was to protect Heimaey's harbor, which was an economic lifeline for the island. The lava flow threatened the harbor, nearly cutting it off completely. If the harbor had been lost, it would have been a devastating blow to the island's economy and livelihood. Consequently, the residents used seawater to cool the lava, forming a protective barrier against further encroachment. This innovative approach prevented additional damage and preserved the harbor's functionality. In the years following the eruption, Heimaey has become a testament to the perseverance and determination of its residents, as well as the power of nature. The island has undergone significant ecological recovery, with new plant and animal life taking root among the once-deadly lava fields. Today, Eldfell serves as a poignant reminder of the destructive power of volcanic eruptions, and the remarkable resilience of the human spirit in the face of disaster. The eruption on Heimaey has also proven to be a valuable case study for volcanologists and disaster relief agencies, providing insight into the challenges and opportunities for community recovery and the science of volcanic eruptions. In conclusion, the most logical way to complete the passage is to use the option \\"When Eldfell erupted, the lava flow almost cut the harbor off entirely.\\" This option not only accurately references the specific volcano involved in the event, but it also emphasizes the geographical and economic challenges that the people of Heimaey faced as they struggled to preserve their harbor and rebuild their lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Answer the following question: when did england make it to world cup final?","output":"England made it to the FIFA World Cup Final for the first and only time on July 30, 1966. The tournament took place in England, making it the host nation. The 1966 World Cup was the eighth edition of the international soccer competition established by FIFA. Sixteen teams participated from around the globe, but England and West Germany emerged as the two strongest contenders and faced off in the championship match. The final match took place at Wembley Stadium in London, an iconic venue for the sport, in front of approximately 98,000 spectators. Sir Alf Ramsey, who was the England manager at the time, played a crucial role in leading the team to victory. The English squad featured many legendary players, including team captain Bobby Moore, Bobby Charlton, Geoff Hurst, and Martin Peters. At the end of regular time, both England and West Germany were tied at 2-2, which led to extra time being played as per FIFA regulations. England's Geoff Hurst achieved a striking hat-trick during the match, scoring goals at the 18th, 101st, and 120th minutes. Martin Peters also contributed to England's victory with a 78th-minute goal. For West Germany, Helmut Haller scored in the 12th minute, followed by Wolfgang Weber's 89th-minute goal. Ultimately, England triumphed over West Germany with a final score of 4-2, causing a significant moment in England's sports history and enabling the country to bring home the Jules Rimet Trophy. The 1966 World Cup victory remains the only time that the England national team has won the championship, and it continues to be a source of national pride and inspiration for English football fans and players alike.

Step 1: Analyze the answer choices and eliminate irrelevant options. - Abrasion: This option refers to the process of wearing down, but not specifically to the moving of substances. - Soil: This option is already mentioned in the question. - Sand: This option could be a possibility, as sand can be a component of soil and can be moved by rain. - Reservoirs: This option refers to water storage bodies and is not relevant to the breaking apart and moving of substances. - Earth: This option is too broad to specifically represent the breaking apart and moving of rocks and soil by rain. - Broken: This option does not specify a substance that is broken apart and moved. - Ground: This option refers to the surface level and does not clearly denote a substance. - Roads: This option is not directly related to the breaking apart and moving of rocks and soil by rain, even though roads can be affected by erosion.

The first step in this process was to agree on a specific genre that would best showcase both of their talents.

Eventually, they settled on an indie folk-rock sound with influences from blues and Americana. This combination would allow them to create soulful melodies and intricate harmonies, while still providing the energy and drive of rock music. Once they had agreed on a genre, Erin and Victoria began to search for inspiration for their original songs. They frequented local music venues, attended concerts and festivals, and studied the works of classic and contemporary artists. Their dedication to this research helped them cultivate a deeper understanding of their craft, as well as refine their own musical personalities. After several months of practicing and writing together, the duo was ready to perform their songs in front of an audience. They decided to start by participating in open mic nights at nearby cafes and bars. These small performances allowed them to test their material, gain valuable stage experience, and network with other musicians and industry professionals. As their confidence grew, Erin and Victoria started booking gigs at larger venues and were soon offered the opportunity to record their debut EP. They enlisted the help of a skilled producer to help them capture the essence of their sound and ensure the highest quality for their recordings. With the EP completed, they focused on promoting their music through social media, sending press kits to local radio stations and music journalists, and distributing their songs on streaming platforms. As their audience grew, they received more invitations to perform at prestigious venues and music festivals, further expanding their reach and influence. Throughout the journey of pursuing their passion and building their careers, Erin and Victoria became not only a powerful musical duo but also a supportive partnership that thrived on collaboration.

Eight Nazi agents who had planned sabotage operations against American targets were arrested, and six were executed (Ex parte Quirin) under their sentences.

This effort confirmed the existence of Americans working in the United States for Soviet intelligence. Hoover was administering this project but failed to notify the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) until 1952. Another notable case is the arrest of Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in 1957.

Write some highlights for the following article: The historic six-month agreement over Tehran's nuclear program may begin a new era of relations with Iran, but it will be a long road back for the country's most vital sector, oil. Iran produces about two and half million barrels a day -- far off its 4-million-barrel-per-day peak a decade ago.  Output is hovering at a level last seen at the end of Iran's war with Iraq. With North Sea Brent crude averaging over 100 a barrel for a record three years running, the sanctions on energy alone are costing Tehran about 50 billion in lost annual revenue. Despite the deal breakthrough, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said most of the sanctions will stick as the world gauges the intentions of this relatively new administration in Tehran. \\"During the six month phase, the oil sanctions that will remain in place will continue to cause over 25 billion in lost revenues to Iran or over 4 billion a month,\\" he said. The message is clear:  the pressure remains, but if all goes well, in a half year's time Iran can expect more in return for transparency. The last few years have been filled with uncertainty. Tensions around the Strait of Hormuz with the on-and-off threats by the previous government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to block oil shipments in the Gulf have kept what strategists call a 10-15% risk premium on global energy prices. Iran sits on about 9% of the world's proven oil reserves, claiming a few years back that it has nearly 150 billion barrels and the world's largest gas field. But its top four customers --China, India, Japan and South Korea -- have all had to cut back their energy imports by a third or more in the past few years due to U.S. and European pressure. With every year that has passed, the screws have been tightened by Washington and the countries of the European Union.  It was not only sanctions against oil, but also blocking Iran's ability to secure shipping insurance and to trade in U.S. dollars and euros.  That economic isolation, many Middle East strategists I have spoken with suggest, is what brought Iran's new government to the negotiating table. In 2012, the Iranian rial plunged by up to 80%.  Basic staples of life, poultry and bread skyrocketed in price and the economy went through a period of hyper-inflation. With rising import prices due to a plummeting currency, industrial Iran is no longer able to compete.  There are reports that the state manufacturing sector had laid off up to 800,000 workers in 2012 and those who have kept their jobs saw their wages eroded by skyrocketing prices. Oil executives with experience in the country say this initial agreement would help lift a cloud of uncertainty over the oil market, but that President Hassan Rouhani and his cabinet have to establish much better contract terms if this honeymoon period lifts sanctions. The blunt-speaking Chief Executive of French energy group Total, Christophe de Margerie, told me at an energy conference in Abu Dhabi this month that Iran needs to try and create a better climate for investment if this weekend's breakthrough is sustained. \\"I can tell you with the experience we have from Iran it doesn't always bring as we say in French partie de plaisir ... a win-win.\\" Oil giant Saudi Arabia has expressed doubts about signing a deal with Tehran, which will introduce more challenges within OPEC.  Iraq plans to double production by 2020 to six million barrels a day and with Iran wanting to rebuild exports, the Kingdom may have trim its own production to defend prices. It is still early days, but this country of nearly 80 million people has been described as potentially being the Germany of the Middle East with plenty of natural resources -- that is, if it can emerge from years of economic isolation.","output":"- The historic six-month agreement over Tehran's nuclear program may signal a new era of relations with Iran, but it will be a long road back for the country's most vital sector, oil. - Iran produces about 2.5 million barrels of oil a day, far from its 4-million-barrel-per-day peak a decade ago, and oil sanctions are costing Tehran about 50 billion in lost revenue annually. - Despite the deal, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says most of the sanctions will remain in place as the world assesses the intentions of Tehran's new administration. - Iran sits on about 9% of the world's proven oil reserves, but its top customers – China, India, Japan, and South Korea – have all had to cut back their energy imports due to U.S. and European pressure. - If the economic sanctions are lifted, Iran may eventually become the Germany of the Middle East in terms of natural resources and economic potential."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

From responses to natural disasters to a catastrophic attack on the homeland, the U.S. military has a plan of action ready to go if either incident occurs. It has also devised an elaborate plan should a zombie apocalypse befall the country, according to a  Defense Department document obtained by CNN. In an unclassified document titled \\"CONOP 8888,\\" officials from U.S. Strategic Command used the specter of a planet-wide attack by the walking dead as a training template for how to plan for real-life, large-scale operations, emergencies and catastrophes. And the Pentagon says there's a reasonable explanation. \\"The document is identified as a training tool used in an in-house training exercise where students learn about the basic concepts of military plans and order development through a fictional training scenario,\\" Navy Capt. Pamela Kunze, a spokeswoman for U.S. Strategic Command, told CNN. \\"This document is not a U.S. Strategic Command plan.\\" Nevertheless, the preparation and thoroughness exhibited by the Pentagon for how to prepare for a scenario in which Americans are about to be overrun by flesh-eating invaders is quite impressive. Read the Pentagon's Zombie apocalypse plan. A wide variety of different zombies, each brandishing their own lethal threats, are possible to confront and should be planned for, according to the document. Zombie life forms \\"created via some form of occult experimentation in what might otherwise be referred to as 'evil magic,' to vegetarian zombies that pose no threat to humans due to their exclusive consumption of vegetation, to zombie life forms created after an organism is infected with a high dose of radiation are among the invaders the document outlines.\\" Every phase of the operation from conducting general zombie awareness training, and recalling all military personnel to their duty stations, to deploying reconnaissance teams to ascertain the general safety of the environment to restoring civil authority after the zombie threat has been neutralized are discussed. And the rules of engagement with the zombies are clearly spelled out within the document. \\"The only assumed way to effectively cause causalities to the zombie ranks by tactical force is the concentration of all firepower to the head, specifically the brain,\\" the plan reads. \\"The only way to ensure a zombie is 'dead' is to burn the zombie corpse.\\" There are even contingency plans for how to deal with hospitals and other medical facilities infiltrated by zombies, and the possible deployment of remote controlled robots to man critical infrastructure points such as power stations if the zombie threat becomes too much. A chain of command from the President on down along with the roles to be played by the State Department and the intelligence community for dealing with the zombie apocalypse are clearly spelled out in the document. 'Walking Dead' finale: The biggest reveals. The training document was first reported by Foreign Policy magazine. This is also not the first time zombies have been used as the antagonist in U.S. government training operations.  Both the Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Homeland Security have used the creatures as a vehicle for training their personnel in the past. Defense officials stress the report in no way signals an invasion of zombies is on the horizon. The only real purpose of the document was to practice how to execute a plan for handling something as large and serious a situation like flesh-eating beings trying to overrun the United States. And why zombies? Officials familiar with the planning of it say zombies were chosen precisely because of the outlandish nature of the attack premise. \\"Training examples for plans must accommodate the political fallout that occurs if the general public mistakenly believes that a fictional training scenario is actually a real plan,\\" the document says.  \\"Rather than risk such an outcome by teaching our augmentees using the fictional 'Tunisia' or 'Nigeria' scenarios used at (Joint Combined Warfighting School), we elected to use a completely impossible scenario that could never be mistaken as a real plan.\\" So, practice for the when, where and how to plan for a more likely disaster scenario?  Yes. But zombies of all stripes would be well advised to take note of this directive to Strategic Command personnel buried within the document. \\"Maintain emergency plans to employ nuclear weapons within (the continental United States) to eradicate zombie hordes.\\" Write highlights for this article.","output":"The US Department of Defense has created an elaborate plan, known as \\"CONOP 8888\\", detailing how to deal with a potential zombie apocalypse.

On the island there were unfriendly Indians who refused to give food to them. Columbus' men were afraid of the Indians, but he had a clever plan. He used sign language to tell the Indians about his mysterious   power to turn off the light in the sky. He knew about a lunar eclipse   the next night because the information was in his almanac  .

Columbus and his crew were in dire need of food and water due to the harsh conditions and the length of their journey. As the desperate sailors spotted an island, they decided to venture onshore in search of resources to sustain them.  Upon their arrival, they encountered a tribe of unfriendly Indians who were unwilling to provide the much-needed food and water. The crew members were frightened by the hostile interactions, but Columbus devised an ingenious plan to leverage his knowledge of astronomy to persuade the natives to cooperate. Columbus was in possession of an almanac, a valuable reference book containing essential astronomical data, including information about lunar eclipses. Knowing a lunar eclipse was imminent, he decided to exploit this knowledge to impress the natives with his seemingly supernatural power to control celestial events.  Using sign language, Columbus communicated the message that he had the power to turn off the light in the sky as a demonstration of his supernatural abilities. The skeptical natives did not believe him at first, but when the lunar eclipse began to unfold the following night, they were overwhelmed with fear and awe. As the moon's luminescence succumbed to the eclipse, the terrified Indians pleaded with Columbus to restore the light in the sky, promising to supply him and his men with the food and water they desperately needed. Grateful for their cooperation, Columbus obliged, and the lunar eclipse set the perfect stage for a stealthy departure. The primary reason Columbus and his men stopped at the island was their urgent need for food and water supplies. Their intention was not to engage with the local population or explore previously uncharted territories. Their motivation was purely survival, and their successful rendezvous with the tribespeople was a testament to Columbus's strategic ingenuity."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

It is situated between the Firth of Tay and the Firth of Forth, with inland boundaries to Perth and Kinross and Clackmannanshire. By custom it is widely held to have been one of the major Pictish kingdoms, known as \\"Fib\\", and is still commonly known as the Kingdom of Fife within Scotland.  - Lochaber is an area in the west of the Scottish Highlands. Historically it referred to the area between Loch Linnhe and Loch Leven, around the town of Fort William. It is now also used to refer to a much wider area, one of the 16 ward management areas of the Highland Council of Scotland and one of eight former local government districts of the two-tier Highland region.   - Grampian Television (now legally known as STV North Ltd and referred to on-air as STV) is the ITV franchisee for the North and North East of Scotland. Its coverage area includes the Northern Isles, the Western Isles, the Highlands (except Fort William and Lochaber, which have always received Scottish Television), Grampian, Tayside (except the Kinross area), and parts of north Fife. The station has been in operation since 30 September 1961.  - Kinross (Gaelic: \\"Ceann Rois\\") is a burgh in Perth and Kinross, Scotland. It was originally the county town of Kinross-shire. The site of the original parish church and churchyard are located down a small wynd overlooking Loch Leven, a little away from the town. Kinross was originally linked by railway to Perthshire, Fife and Clackmannanshire until the rail links gradually disappeared. At one time three independent railway companies had their termini at the town. The Fife and Kinross Railway came from the east, the Kinross-shire Railway came from the south and The Devon Valley Railway came from the west. Recently Kinross has expanded considerably, especially since the construction of the M90 motorway - the main north-south artery which bypasses the town. Many people working within a commuting radius of Kinross have settled in the town owing to its convenient central location and excellent local amenities. Loch Leven is also a popular holiday base for tourists, who especially appreciate its proximity to Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling, Perth and St Andrews (all lying within an hour's drive of Kinross). The burgh is attractively located on the shores of Loch Leven, and there are boat trips around the loch and to Loch Leven Castle, where Mary, Queen of Scots was famously held prisoner in 1567.  - Tayside was a local government region of Scotland from 15 May 1975 to 31 March 1996. It was created by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, following recommendations made by the 1969 Wheatley Report which attempted to replace the mishmash of counties, cities, burghs and districts, with a uniform two-tier system of regional and district councils. Following the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, it is now divided into the council areas of Angus, the City of Dundee and Perth and Kinross, which had previously been the region's districts.  - Scottish Television (now, legally, known as STV Central Ltd and referred to on-air as STV) is Scotland's largest ITV franchisee, and has held the ITV franchise for Central Scotland since 31 August 1957. It is the second oldest ITV franchisee still active (Granada Television being the oldest).

The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801.

This approach would emphasize the importance of rehabilitation for Michael Vick, promoting responsible pet ownership and raising awareness about the cruelty of dogfighting. Through these public interactions and classes, Vick would be able to learn from experts in animal welfare and engage with others who share a commitment to ending this brutal practice. These interactions would serve as opportunities for Vick to demonstrate his remorse and commitment to making a positive change. As he reaches these milestones, the Humane Society of the United States and other animal welfare organizations may reevaluate his suitability for pet ownership. By slowly reintegrating Michael Vick into responsible pet ownership, the hope is that his past mistakes can be transformed into a powerful message about the importance of humane animal treatment and the necessity for strict penalties against those who engage in dogfighting. The close collaboration between Michael Vick and organizations like the Humane Society of the United States also holds the potential for greater public awareness about the harms of dogfighting. With a high-profile individual like Vick actively speaking out against these practices, it may become more difficult for others to engage in dogfighting without facing similar consequences as he did. Additionally, this partnership allows the Humane Society to use Vick's story as an example of redemption and the potential for individuals with past mistakes to learn from them and become advocates for change. It is crucial to remember that this process would not be immediate, and Vick's journey to pet ownership would be contingent on his actions and demonstrated dedication to animal welfare. However, by working closely with the Humane Society of the United States and their affiliates, Michael Vick has the chance to show that, in time, he can regain the trust of the public and the animal protection community, ultimately becoming a responsible, caring pet guardian deserving of a second chance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There were many legal issues at the company but not at the town, as the","output":"town had a very effective and transparent legal system. The company, on the other hand, had a long history of questionable practices and disputes with employees, suppliers, and competitors. In order to understand this complex scenario, it was essential to examine the key factors that contributed to this situation. Firstly, the company's management had a notorious reputation for prioritizing profits over ethical and legal considerations. This approach led to a corporate culture that encouraged aggressive business strategies, even if they crossed legal boundaries. For example, the company had faced multiple accusations of unfair labor practices, such as underpaying employees and ignoring workplace safety regulations. Secondly, the company's internal legal department was understaffed and often overwhelmed by the volume of cases and disputes. As a result, they struggled to provide the necessary guidance and support to the management team, leaving many legal matters unaddressed or poorly resolved. The legal team's inability to handle the scope of issues also led to an overreliance on external law firms, which further drained the company's resources and created a sense of detachment from their legal obligations. Thirdly, while the town's legal system was highly efficient, the company's leadership did not take full advantage of the local expertise and resources. Instead, they remained isolated from the community, neglecting to establish strong relationships with local law enforcement and regulatory agencies. This lack of cooperation and engagement only exacerbated the company's legal troubles, as they missed opportunities to proactively address issues and seek guidance from experts in the town. In order to address these legal issues, the company needed to implement several changes. They needed to review their corporate culture and prioritize legal compliance and ethical practices over short-term profits. This would require a shift in mindset among the senior leadership team, as well as improved training and support for employees at all levels. Secondly, the company needed to invest in its internal legal department by hiring additional staff and providing them with the necessary resources and training to effectively manage the company's legal affairs. This would also involve developing better relationships with external law firms and working more closely with them to ensure a more consistent and informed approach to legal matters. Finally, the company had to invest in building stronger ties with the town's legal and regulatory bodies. By participating in local events, partnering with law enforcement on initiatives, and seeking guidance from the town's legal administrators, the company could demonstrate its commitment to legal compliance and being a responsible corporate citizen. Ultimately, resolving the company's legal issues required a comprehensive approach that addressed both internal and external factors. By acknowledging their shortcomings and implementing these necessary changes, the company could improve its reputation, minimize legal risks, and build a more sustainable, ethical foundation for future growth."},{"instruction":"Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the last year Boult taught at the Royal College of Music? , can you please find it?

Understand the meaning in Polish: The sentence consists of three words - \\"proś\\", \\"o\\", and \\"współczucie\\". The verb \\"proś\\" means \\"ask\\" or \\"ask for\\" in Polish, while \\"o\\" is a preposition that corresponds to \\"about\\" or \\"for\\" in English. Finally, \\"współczucie\\" is a noun that means \\"compassion\\" or \\"empathy\\" in Polish. Putting these together, the sentence means \\"ask for compassion\\" or \\"ask for empathy.\\" 2. Translate the words into Italian: To convey the same meaning in Italian, we need to translate each word into its Italian counterpart. The verb \\"ask\\" can be translated into \\"chiedere.\\" The preposition \\"for\\" can be translated into \\"per.\\" Lastly, the noun \\"compassion\\" can be translated into \\"compassione.\\"  3. Put together the Italian sentence: Combining these translations, the Italian sentence should be \\"Chiedere per compassione\\" which means \\"ask for compassion\\" in English.

The reviewer raises several concerns about the product's quality, functionality, and durability, ultimately suggesting that it is not worth purchasing and that potential buyers should consider alternative options like ADT. Let's break down the issues mentioned by the reviewer: 1. Short lifespan: The user sounds disappointed with the product's performance, stating that the sound only lasts for about 3 weeks. This implies that the product cannot be relied upon for long-term use, which is crucial for a security product. 2. Sensitivity to moisture: The reviewer notes that the product's functionality is compromised if it becomes wet or damp. This is a significant concern, especially as the product is designed to be installed on a window and is therefore likely to be exposed to varying levels of moisture. 3. Difficulty in alignment: According to the reviewer, the alarm must be aligned perfectly for it to work properly. They also mention that the alignment becomes disrupted after opening and closing the window several times, leading to false alarms. This could result in frustration for the user and diminish their trust in the product as a reliable security measure. 4. Overall dissatisfaction: The reviewer concludes by labeling the product as \\"junk\\" and strongly suggesting an alternative security solution. This unambiguously demonstrates their dissatisfaction with the product and its inability to meet their expectations. Given these points, it is clear that the review portrays the product in an unflattering light. The concerns raised about its performance, durability, and ease of use could potentially deter potential buyers from considering this product for their security needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There he saw an unique type of glacier called valley glacier. This year he went further east to visit the Ural mountains in Russia. There he didn't see any valley glacier.  In which year Rob would not observe quarrying effect, this year or last year?","output":"Rob would not observe the quarrying effect in the Ural mountains this year because the Ural mountains do not have any valley glaciers. The quarrying effect is a type of erosion process that happens primarily in glaciated areas where valley glaciers are present. Last year, Rob visited the Alps mountains in Austria, where he saw the unique type of glacier called valley glacier. Valley glaciers are long, narrow ice masses occupying in high mountain valleys. The glacier's movement over time results in the sculpting and deepening of the valley, as well as the formation of certain features such as U-shaped valleys, moraines, and other glacial landforms. One common effect of valley glaciers is the quarrying effect. The quarrying effect (also known as glacial plucking) is a process where a valley glacier erodes the underlying bedrock surface by freezing and thawing cycles. As the glacier slides down the valley, water enters cracks in the bedrock and then freezes, creating tremendous pressure on the rocks. As the ice expands, it can dislodge large blocks of rock from the valley floor and transport these across the landscape. The eroded material is then either deposited further downstream by the glacier or suspended within the ice. This process contributes to the overall shaping of the landscape in mountainous, glaciated regions. In contrast, the Ural mountains in Russia are not known for having valley glaciers. The Ural mountains are much older, lower, and less glaciated than the Alps, which means that the processes associated with valley glaciers like the quarrying effect are not as prominent. The Urals are characterized more by rolling hills, river valleys, rich mineral deposits, and extensive forests. The primary erosional forces in the Ural mountains are weathering and water erosion, not glaciation. As such, it is safe to conclude that Rob would not observe the quarrying effect in the Ural mountains this year as there are no valley glaciers in that region. Last year, however, he would have had the opportunity to observe the quarrying effect in action in the Alps mountains, where valley glaciers contribute to the continuous transformation of the landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The 59-year-old \\"America's Next Top Model\\" judge told Entertainment Tonight the 77-year-old TV legend raped her more than two decades ago. Dickinson claimed that in 1982, Cosby invited her to Lake Tahoe, where he was performing, to discuss a job he had offered her, as well as advice on her singing career. She said that after she arrived in Tahoe, the two had dinner, and then when the two returned to her room, Cosby gave her “wine and a pill.” “The next morning I woke up and I wasn’t wearing my pajamas,” she said. “And I remember before I passed out that I had been sexually assaulted by this man.” “Before I woke up in the morning, the last thing I remember was Bill Cosby, in a patchwork robe, dropping his robe and getting on top of me.” When asked if she ever confronted the TV star about what happened, she said that she had not, and that Cosby had never broached it with her. “I’ll tell you why I’m doing this,\\" Dickinson said. “Because it’s the right thing to do, and it happened to me, and this is the true story.” Dickinson is the self-proclaimed \\"world's first supermodel\\" who claims to have coined the term during her covergirl heyday in the 70s and 80s. She's remained in the public eye over the past decade by appearing on several reality TV shows, including \\"The Surreal Life,\\" \\"The Janice Dickinson Modelling Agency,\\" and \\"Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew,\\" where she confronted addictions to prescription pills, and plastic surgery. Dickinson is the third accuser to come forward since comedian Hannibal Buress called Cosby a rapist during a stand-up routine in Philadelphia last month. The latest accuser before Dickinson, Joan Tarshis, went public over the weekend. In an essay published Sunday on the Hollywood Elsewhere website and an interview with CNN, Tarshis claimed that Cosby raped her in the autumn 1969, when she was a starstruck 19-year-old aspiring actress. Tarshis claimed Cosby lured her to his bungalow at Universal Studios in Los Angeles, drugged her and then forced her to perform oral sex on him. Tarshis said Cosby attacked her again days later at the Sherry Netherland hotel, after she accompanied him to a performance he gave at The Westbury Music Theater on Long Island. Last week, another woman, Barbara Bowman, published a first-person story in The Washington Post alleging that Cosby raped her in 1985 when she was 17. Bowman's story hit some of the same notes as Tarshis'; she said Cosby drugged her at his New York City brownstone and she recalled coming to \\"in my panties and a man's t-shirt, and Cosby was looming over me.\\" Both Joan Tarshis (l.) and Barbara Bowman have come forward with allegations against Bill Cosby. Cosby has never been criminally charged for any of the alleged sexual assaults. However, he did settle a civil case in 2006 brought by Temple University employee Andrea Constand who originally claimed he drugged and groped her in his mansion. Cosby's lawyer John Schmitt issued a statement that dismissed Tarshis and Bowman's claims as \\"decade-old, discredited\\" allegations. ON A MOBILE DEVICE? CLICK HERE TO WATCH VIDEO.

Fed up with her dead-end job with a Minneapolis car rental agency, Martha quits, cashes her final paycheck, and uses the money to purchase an airline ticket to the least expensive international destination she can find - London. At the airport, she meets Daniel, a successful music label executive, who covertly arranges for her to be upgraded to First Class and seated next to him on the flight. When she sells the ticket to another passenger and Daniel finds his seatmate is an obnoxiously loud woman instead of the girl of his dreams, he moves back to the Economy section and takes the vacant seat next to Martha. Before landing in London, he offers her the use of a deluxe suite in a luxury hotel at his company's expense in exchange for a lunch date the following day. Through a series of flashbacks and flashforwards, we learn Laurence, a former bridge champion who now teaches the game to wealthy women, went to the airport to pick up Daniel but missed him because the flight landed early. Instead, he literally runs into Martha, who hits him with a luggage cart while searching for the exit. She coerces him into taking her into the city and invites him to the suite for dinner. While she is in the bathroom, a bouquet of flowers from Daniel is delivered to the suite, and when Laurence sees the attached card, he departs without explanation. The following day, Martha meets struggling actor Frank, who has fled an audition in a panic and has gone to the park to console himself with a half-bottle of whiskey. Having heard about her from Daniel, he realizes who she is and calls Laurence to boast that he is about to make her his conquest. He takes her to a nearby art gallery.

Josie started planning her new garden in the winter. She chose flowers and vegetables that could grow in her area. She looked through the seed magazines. She ordered the tastiest kind of each vegetable and the prettiest kind of each flower. She talked to a friend about her plans. It seemed like the snow would never melt. But Josie didn't have to wait for spring to get started. Six weeks before the last frost, Josie planted seeds indoors. The tiny seedlings pushed up through the soil and began to grow. Finally spring arrived. Each day, Josie moved the seedlings outside for a few hours so they could get used to the cooler temperatures. Josie worked in her garden, digging the soil. She added a special growing mix from the garden store to make the soil better. When everything was ready, she removed the seedlings from their trays and planted them in her garden. The warm sun and rich soil helped her vegetables and flowers grow.

Nabokov's interest in entomology had been inspired by books of Maria Sibylla Merian he had found in the attic of his family's country home in Vyra. Throughout an extensive career of collecting he never learned to drive a car, and he depended on his wife Vera to take him to collecting sites. During the 1940s, as a research fellow in zoology, he was responsible for organizing the butterfly collection of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University. His writings in this area were highly technical. This, combined with his specialty in the relatively unspectacular tribe Polyommatini of the family Lycaenidae, has left this facet of his life little explored by most admirers of his literary works. He described the Karner blue. The genus Nabokovia was named after him in honor of this work, as were a number of butterfly and moth species (e.g. many species in the genera Madeleinea and Pseudolucia bear epithets alluding to Nabokov or names from his novels). In 1967, Nabokov commented: \\"The pleasures and rewards of literary inspiration are nothing beside the rapture of discovering a new organ under the microscope or an undescribed species on a mountainside in Iran or Peru. It is not improbable that had there been no revolution in Russia, I would have devoted myself entirely to lepidopterology and never written any novels at all.\\"  The palaeontologist and essayist Stephen Jay Gould discussed Nabokov's lepidoptery in his essay, \\"No Science Without Fancy, No Art Without Facts: The Lepidoptery of Vladimir Nabokov\\" (reprinted in I Have Landed). Gould notes that Nabokov was occasionally a scientific \\"stick-in-the-mud\\". For example, Nabokov never accepted that genetics or the counting of chromosomes could be a valid way to distinguish species of insects, and relied on the traditional (for lepidopterists) microscopic comparison of their genitalia.  The Harvard Museum of Natural History, which now contains the Museum of Comparative Zoology, still possesses Nabokov's \\"genitalia cabinet\\", where the author stored his collection of male blue butterfly genitalia. \\"Nabokov was a serious taxonomist,\\" says museum staff writer Nancy Pick, author of The Rarest of the Rare: Stories Behind the Treasures at the Harvard Museum of Natural History. \\"He actually did quite a good job at distinguishing species that you would not think were different--by looking at their genitalia under a microscope six hours a day, seven days a week, until his eyesight was permanently impaired.\\" The rest of his collection, about 4,300 specimens, was given to the Lausanne's Museum of Zoology in Switzerland.  Though his work was not taken seriously by professional lepidopterists during his life, new genetic research supports Nabokov's hypothesis that a group of butterfly species, called the Polyommatus blues, came to the New World over the Bering Strait in five waves, eventually reaching Chile.  Many of Nabokov's fans have tried to ascribe literary value to his scientific papers, Gould notes. Conversely, others have claimed that his scientific work enriched his literary output. Gould advocates a third view, holding that the other two positions are examples of the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. Rather than assuming that either side of Nabokov's work caused or stimulated the other, Gould proposes that both stemmed from Nabokov's love of detail, contemplation, and symmetry.

In this task, you are given a context, a subject, a relation, and many options. Based on the context, from the options select the object entity that has the given relation with the subject. Answer with text (not indexes). Q: Context: A kickoff specialist (KOS) is a seldom-used position in gridiron football. Kickoff specialists are members of the special teams. They are responsible for kicking the ball in the kickoff. These players tend to have a strong leg, often capable of making touchbacks, and capable of keeping a ball in the bounds of the field of play but do not have the accuracy or technique required to be a full-time placekicker or punter. Some kickoff specialists later become full-time placekickers, while some are marginal placekickers who are soon out of football., A wide receiver (also referred to as wideouts or simply receivers) is an offensive position in American and Canadian football, and is the key player in most of the passing plays. They get their name because they are split out \\"wide\\" (near the sidelines), furthest away from the rest of the team. Wide receivers are among the fastest players on the field. The wide receiver functions as the pass-catching specialist., End Zone is Don DeLillo's second novel, published in 1972., In American and Canadian football, a line of scrimmage is an imaginary transverse line (across the width of the football field) beyond which a team cannot cross until the next play has begun. Its location is based on the spot where the ball is placed after the end of the most recent play and following the assessment of any penalty yards., Hamilton (2011 population 519,949; UA population 670,580; CMA population 721,053) is a port city in the Canadian province of Ontario. Conceived by George Hamilton when he purchased the Durand farm shortly after the War of 1812, Hamilton has become the centre of a densely populated and industrialized region at the west end of Lake Ontario known as the Golden Horseshoe. On January 1, 2001, the new City of Hamilton was formed through the amalgamation of the former city and the other constituent lower-tier municipalities of the Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth with the upper-tier regional government. Residents of the old city are known as Hamiltonians. Since 1981, the metropolitan area has been listed as the ninth largest in Canada and the third largest in Ontario., Ricky Ray (born October 22, 1979) is a professional Canadian football quarterback for the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League. Ray has also spent time in the af2, as well as spending time on the New York Jets roster in the National Football League. He is most well known for his performance with the Edmonton Eskimos, as he is the franchise's all-time leader in passing yardage, pass completions and passing touchdowns., The Hamilton Tiger-Cats are a professional Canadian football team based in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, founded in 1950 with the merger of the Hamilton Tigers and the Hamilton Wildcats. They are currently members of the East Division of the Canadian Football League (CFL). The Tiger-Cats play their home games at Tim Hortons Field., The tight end (TE) is a position in American football, Arena football, and formerly Canadian football, on the offense. The tight end is often seen as a hybrid position with the characteristics and roles of both an offensive lineman and a wide receiver. Like offensive linemen, they are usually lined up on the offensive line and are large enough to be effective blockers. On the other hand, they are eligible receivers adept enough to warrant a defense's attention when running pass patterns. , Placekicker, or simply kicker (PK or K), is the player in American and Canadian football who is responsible for the kicking duties of field goals and extra points. In many cases, the placekicker also serves as the team's kickoff specialist or punter as well., A running back (RB) is an American and Canadian football position, a member of the offensive backfield. The primary roles of a running back are to receive handoffs from the quarterback for a rushing play, to catch passes from out of the backfield, and to block. There are usually one or two running backs on the field for a given play, depending on the offensive formation. A running back may be a halfback (in certain contexts also referred to as a tailback) or a fullback. A running back will sometimes be called a \\"feature back\\" if he is the team's starting running back., Dave Stala ( born October 25 , 1979 in Myslenice , Poland ) is a professional Canadian football slotback for the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League . He was originally drafted in the 6th round , 50th overall by the Montreal Alouettes as a placekicker in 2003 . He played CIS football for the Saint Mary 's Huskies . After injury plagued seasons in 2007 and 2008 , he signed with the Hamilton Tiger - Cats in 2009 and rejuvenated his career in his hometown . Stala is well known for a unique soccer - inspired touchdown celebration which he performed on July 31 , 2010 . After five seasons with the Tiger - Cats , Stala was released by the club on January 9 , 2014 . He re-signed with Montreal the next day to a two - year contract , reuniting him with the team that drafted him . Dave Stala is often referred to by the nicknames \`\` Sticky Stala '' or just \`\` Sticky '' ., Slotback (sometimes referred to as an A-back or, especially in the United States, slot receiver) is a position in gridiron football. The \\"slot\\" is the area between the last offensive lineman on either side of the center and the wide receiver on that side. A player who lines up between those two players and behind the line of scrimmage is a slotback. The position is a fixture of Canadian football and indoor football, but is also used in American football. The slotback is similar to the wide receiver but also has many of the same traits as a running back or tight end; a slotback lines up closer to the offensive line and often farther back than a wide receiver., Scott Milanovich (born January 25, 1973) is a quarterbacks coach for the Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL). He was previously the head coach for the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL) and former quarterback. Milanovich has previously been the offensive coordinator for the Montreal Alouettes. He played professionally in the National Football League for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in NFL Europe for the Berlin Thunder, in the XFL for the Los Angeles Xtreme, in the Arena Football League for the Tampa Bay Storm, and in the CFL for the Calgary Stampeders., Rogers Centre, originally named SkyDome, is a multi-purpose stadium in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada situated just southwest of the CN Tower near the northern shore of Lake Ontario. Opened in 1989 on the former Railway Lands, it is home to the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB). Previously, the stadium served as home to the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL) and the Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL) played an annual game at the stadium as part of the Bills Toronto Series from 2008 to 2013. While it is primarily a sports venue, it also hosts other large-scale events such as conventions, trade fairs, concerts, travelling carnivals, and monster truck shows., American football, referred to as football in the United States and Canada, and also known as gridiron, is a sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, the team with control of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the team without control of the ball, the defense, aims to stop their advance and take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins., Canadian football is a form of gridiron football played in Canada in which two teams of 12 players each compete for territorial control of a field of play long and wide attempting to advance a pointed prolate spheroid ball into the opposing team's scoring area (end zone)., The Toronto Argonauts are a professional Canadian football team competing in the East Division of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Based in Toronto, Ontario, the team was founded in 1873, and is the oldest existing professional sports team in North America still using its original name. The team's origins date back to a modified version of rugby football that emerged in North America in the latter half of the nineteenth century. The Argonauts played their home games at Rogers Centre from 1989 until 2016 when the team moved to BMO Field, the fifth stadium site to host the team. The current team is coached by Scott Milanovich and led at quarterback by Ricky Ray., The Saint Mary's Huskies are the men's and women's athletic teams that represent Saint Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Their primary home turf is Huskies Stadium located in the centre of the University's campus., Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area .

UPDATED:. 11:32 EST, 3 September 2012. Allem Kerr from Balloch, Dunbartonshire in Scotland, has spent years trying to register her existence but may be forced to go to court to do so. A woman who has lived in Scotland since her British family moved from South Africa when she was four is going to court to prove she exists - after losing her birth certificate. Angry Allem Kerr, 25, was born in South Africa after her parents had emigrated. They returned to the UK more than 20 years ago but she cannot work, go on holiday abroad, apply for a driving licence or go to university after losing her birth certificate 13 years ago. She has tried in vain to register her existence but Home Office officials and the consulate of South Africa keep telling her there is no official record of her birth. Miss Kerr, of Balloch, West Dunbartonshire, even tried to contact the hospital where she was born but to her dismay found it had been shut down and the records moved or lost. The identity crisis means the 25-year-old, who wants to study nursing at university, is also unable to marry long-term boyfriend Joel Healy, 26. Her agonising ordeal has left her Scottish parents Ann, 55, an MS sufferer, and dad Andrew, 59, Ann’s full-time carer, struggling to support her. Out of desperation, she wrote to the Prime Minister last year, whose office vowed to pass her details on to the Home Office. But Miss Kerr said she has been left without a further reply and still has her life on hold. The only option left to her now is to convince the Court of Session in Edinburgh that she is genetically linked to her mother, and therefore automatically a British citizen. The aspiring nurse, who is in talks with lawyers, said: ‘I’m frustrated and angry. ‘I’m British. I happen to have been born in South Africa but I have lived in Scotland almost my entire life, but proving it seems to be a problem. ‘I wrote to David Cameron and his secretary replied that she would pass it on to the Home Office, but that was months ago and I’ve heard nothing. ‘I want to work and go to university. and support myself but I can’t. I will do whatever it takes and if I. have to go to court to prove I exist then that’s what I’ll do.’ Allem. was born in South Africa after her Scottish mum and dad decided to. emigrate but the family returned to Scotland when she was four. Miss Kerr, 25, is unable to marry her long-term boyfriend Joel Healy, 26, without her passport, or even live with him without a job to support herself. Her brother Alasdair, 27, and sister Mallory, 23, both have their birth certificates and are eligible to work, while Miss Kerr’s was lost in a house move when she was 12. Since then she and her parents have tried in vain to track down the vital piece of paper, which has stopped her from gaining a passport and traveling abroad on holiday. Miss Kerr held down part-time jobs until she returned to college five years ago. But when she applied to the University of the West of Scotland to study nursing she was refused as she did not have the documentation. Her desperate struggle has led her to Dumbarton MSP Jackie Baillie, former West Dunbartonshire MP John McFall, the Home Office and the South African Embassy in London. But embassy staff could find no record of her birth and sent her back to the British Government. An attempt to apply for naturalisation was refused because she is not considered an immigrant. Miss Kerr added: ‘I have basically been told I don’t exist. ‘I have cried so many times over this. I just want to live a normal life. ‘I. have been speaking to the passport office from the word go and they. have told me there is no point applying because legally I don’t exist. Pictured as a two-year-old, left, in 1989 with her older brother Alasdair while living in South Africa where she was born. ‘It’s ridiculous. I just want the consulate to recognise my birth so I can do all the things that everyone else takes for granted. ‘It’s not fair on my parents. I want to move in with my boyfriend but we can’t afford to because he doesn’t earn enough to support me. ‘I hate asking for money to do the simplest thing but it is all I can do. I want to earn my own.’ Mum Ann said: ‘The government should be giving her benefits to live until it is sorted. ‘People who move here from other countries are entitled, but my daughter, who is Scottish, isn’t. ‘It  seems she has fewer rights than everyone else and it’s not fair.’ Grace McGill, an immigration lawyer at Scottish law firm McGill and Co, said the only option left is to apply for a declaration of parentage at the Court of Session. ‘Allem’s mum would have to prove to the court that Allem is her daughter using a DNA test and from that Allem’s nationality is inferred, because her mum is British.’ A spokesman for the Identity and Passport Service said: ‘While we sympathise with Ms Kerr’s situation, the Identity and Passport Service can only issue British passports to British citizens. ‘We are offering advice to help her provide alternative supporting documents when she applies for her passport.’ What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

This statement implies that the reviewer sees the app as innovative, possibly bringing in new features or ways of communication not present in current alternatives. The phrase 'the future' suggests that the app may have aspects that could become standards in the evolving landscape of digital communication.  However, your question inquires about a recommendation based on a single, quite generic review. Making a solid recommendation based solely on this would be quite subjective, as it lacks specifics on the features, functionality, reliability, and user-experience of the app. While the review is positive, it doesn't offer any concrete information about the app's performance, ease of use, design, or the needs it addresses specifically.  In spite of these considerations, if forced to pick between the options 'Not at all', 'No', 'Maybe', 'Yes', or 'Definitely', the answer would lean towards 'Yes', but with caution. That's because when a product is described as indicative of 'the future,' the implication is that the product is forward-thinking, indicating certain admirable qualities such as innovation, ease-of-use, enhanced features, or possibly superior technology. But it's crucial to further consider the recommendation based on the friend's specific needs. If the friend values trying out novel technology and is adaptable, then the app could be an interesting suggestion. However, if the friend requires an app with tested reliability and wide usage, or if they aren't inclined towards trying out new tech, then this may not be a suitable recommendation. In conclusion, 'the future of modern messaging' is a promising description suggesting that the app has new and progressive features offering an enhanced messaging experience. However, a clear recommendation would still rely on further specifics about the app and the unique needs and preferences of the friend to whom it's being recommended.

Samuel was asked to bring a cake to work but not tell Michael.","output":"Samuel found it intriguing, having to keep a secret from his good friend Michael. He knew that Michael had a major sweet tooth and would never resist an opportunity to indulge in a delicious dessert. However, since he was asked to keep it under wraps, he realized there must be a reason for the secrecy. Step 1: Devise a plan to purchase and transport the cake without Michael finding out. To accomplish this task, Samuel decided to buy the cake from a bakery that was on his way to work. He would do this early in the morning before Michael could possibly see him. Once the cake was bought, he would carefully place it in his car, ensuring it was hidden from plain sight. Step 2: Create a distraction for Michael at work. To make sure Michael didn't notice the cake when he brought it in, Samuel enlisted the help of a few other coworkers. They came up with a small office emergency that required Michael's immediate attention, providing enough time for Samuel to bring the cake inside and hide it successfully. Step 3: Find a suitable hiding place for the cake at work. Samuel decided that the best place to hide the cake would be in the break room’s large refrigerator. He knew there would be enough space and the cake would remain fresh until it needed to be served. Additionally, he would place the cake in a nondescript box to further prevent Michael from discovering it when he went to grab his lunch. Step 4: Determine the appropriate time to reveal the cake. After consulting with the person who asked him to bring the cake, Samuel learned that there was a surprise planned for Michael to celebrate his recent promotion. The plan was to gather everyone in the break room at the end of the day and surprise Michael with the cake and congratulations.  Step 5: Execute the plan and enjoy the surprise. Just as planned, Samuel and his coworkers successfully distracted Michael, hid the cake, and managed to keep the secret until the end of the day. When it was time for the big reveal, everyone gathered in the break room. At the perfect moment, Samuel retrieved the cake from its hiding spot and presented it to a truly shocked Michael, who was both touched and grateful for the surprise celebration.  In the end, Samuel was able to complete his task faithfully and contribute to Michael's special day, leaving everyone with fond memories of the occasion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In front of a national audience, the Eagles traveled to Foxboro as 22-point underdogs in their matchup against the 10-0 New England Patriots - the first meeting of the teams since Super Bowl XXXIX. The Eagles started A. J. Feeley due to McNabb's injury, and Asante Samuel picked off a Feeley pass and returned it 40 yards for a touchdown on the third play of the game. The Eagles responded with a 14-play drive, capped by a one-yard diving touchdown by Brian Westbrook. Tom Brady finally got a chance late in the first quarter, and marched New England down the field before Heath Evans took it in from a yard out to make it 14-7 Patriots. However, Feeley answered back with a 28-yard touchdown to third receiver Greg Lewis. Andy Reid then tried an onside kick. Hank Baskett recovered the ball, but the Eagles were forced to punt. In a ten-play drive of all pass attempts, the Patriots had first-and-goal, but settled for a field goal to take a 17-14 lead. Feeley found Lewis again on the next series, this time an 18-yard strike with three minutes left in the half, giving Philadelphia the lead. Brady connected with Jabar Gaffney to retake the lead 24-21 with seconds left in the half. A long drive by New England in the third quarter resulted in a missed field goal, and Feeley responded with a touchdown drive capped by an eight-yard reception in the end zone by Reggie Brown and the Eagles took a 28-24 lead as the game moved into the final quarter. Laurence Maroney scored from four yards out midway through the fourth as the Patriots went back on top 31-28. Feeley took the Eagles to within field goal range, but was picked off trying for a touchdown and the Patriots' perfect season survived. Feeley had 345 passing yards and three touchdowns, but his three interceptions were costly. Westbrook had 92 all-purpose yards and a touchdown, while Greg Lewis racked up a surprising 88 receiving yards and two touchdowns. The loss drops the Eagles to 5-6.

Fact: a beak is used for catching prey by some birds Question: What requires nutrients to grow and gets nutrients with use of beak apparatus? What's the answer? Select from: I. dirt. II. birds. III. computers. IV. metals.","output":"The answer is II. birds. Birds are living creatures that require nutrients to grow, survive, and reproduce. To acquire these nutrients, they use their beaks, which are generally curved and pointed. The beak, also known as the bill or rostrum, is a multifunctional structure that covers the jaws of birds and plays an important role in feeding as well as in various behavioral activities. Different types of birds use their beaks differently for catching prey, depending on their environments and feeding habits. For example, raptors like eagles and hawks have strong and sharp beaks designed for tearing the flesh of their prey, while herons and kingfishers have long, thin beaks adapted for grasping fish and other aquatic animals in the water. Similarly, insectivorous birds like woodpeckers have beaks specialized for pecking into tree trunks, boring holes and extracting insects. Apart from catching prey, beaks have multiple roles in a bird's life. These include preening (cleaning and grooming the feathers), nest-building, courtship displays, and self-defense. The morphology of a beak can give insights into a bird's ecological niche, diet, and way of life. The other options, dirt (I), computers (III), and metals (IV), are not living organisms and do not require nutrients to grow or function. Dirt is a mixture of organic matter, minerals, gases, liquids, and living organisms that support plant life. Computers are electronic machines that process information, and metals are chemical elements that are typically hard, dense, and have metallic lusters. In conclusion, among the given options, birds (II) are the living organisms that require nutrients to grow and use their beak apparatus to catch prey and fulfill their nutritional needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The use of evergreens as a symbol and celebration of life during Winter Solstice celebrations started in ancient Roman and Egyptian times. What is this text about?","output":"The text introduces the concept of using evergreen plants as a symbol and celebration during Winter Solstice celebrations, tracing its origins back to ancient Roman and Egyptian times. The Winter Solstice, occurring usually on December 21st or 22nd, marks the shortest day of the year and the official start of winter. This event holds significant cultural and religious significance in many societies and has been observed through a variety of customs and rituals. In this context, evergreen plants are particularly important due to their year-round green leaves, acting as a powerful symbol of life during the winter when most other plants go dormant. These plants, which include holly, ivy, pine, and others, do not lose their leaves or stop growing during winter, symbolizing the persistence of life amidst the cold, dark periods, acting as a sign of hope and vitality amidst the season's dormancy. The text suggests that this tradition of using evergreens during Winter Solstice celebrations can be traced back to ancient Roman and Egyptian societies. In ancient Rome, evergreens were a common decorative element used during the festival of Saturnalia, a winter solstice celebration devoted to Saturn, the god of agriculture and harvest. This festival was marked by elaborate feasts, gift-giving, and decorating homes with greenery. As for ancient Egyptians, they also valued evergreens as a potent symbol of life's triumph over death. Their sun god, Ra, was believed to battle daily against the forces of chaos and darkness. During the Winter Solstice, the Egyptians celebrated the victory of Ra over darkness, and evergreens, as one of the few plants that remained green during the harsh winter, became a significant part of these rituals. So, in essence, the text discusses the cultural and symbolic use of evergreens during Winter Solstice, highlighting how this tradition has roots in ancient civilizations like Rome and Egypt. This serves as an example of how cultural practices evolve over time and how symbols such as the evergreens can transcend time and geography, maintaining their symbolic potency throughout the ages."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Muhammad Ali (; born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr.; January 17, 1942 - June 3, 2016) was an American professional boxer and activist. He is widely regarded as one of the most significant and celebrated sports figures of the 20th century. From early in his career, Ali was known as an inspiring, controversial, and polarizing figure both inside and outside the ring. Cassius Clay was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, and began training as an amateur boxer when he was 12 years old. Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. () was born on January 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky. He had a sister and four brothers. He was named for his father, Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr. (1912-1990), who himself was named in honor of the 19th-century Republican politician and staunch abolitionist, Cassius Marcellus Clay, also from the state of Kentucky. Clay's father's paternal grandparents were John Clay and Sallie Anne Clay; Clay's sister Eva claimed that Sallie was a native of Madagascar. He was a descendant of slaves of the antebellum South, and was predominantly of African descent, with smaller amounts of Irish and English heritage. His father painted billboards and signs, and his mother, Odessa O'Grady Clay (1917-1994), was a domestic helper. Although Cassius Sr. was a Methodist, he allowed Odessa to bring up both Cassius Jr. and his younger brother Rudolph \\"Rudy\\" Clay (later renamed Rahman Ali) as Baptists. Cassius Jr. attended Central High School in Louisville.  Clay grew up amid racial segregation. His mother recalled one occasion when he was denied a drink of water at a store--\\"They wouldn't give him one because of his color. That really affected him.\\" He was also affected by the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, which led to young Clay and a friend's taking out their frustration by vandalizing a local railyard.  Clay was first directed toward boxing by Louisville police officer and boxing coach Joe E. Martin, who encountered the 12-year-old fuming over a thief's having taken his bicycle. He told the officer he was going to \\"whup\\" the thief. The officer told Clay he had better learn how to box first. Initially, Clay did not take up Martin's offer, but after seeing amateur boxers on a local television boxing program called Tomorrow's Champions, Clay was interested in the prospect of fighting. He then began to work with trainer Fred Stoner, whom he credits with giving him the \\"real training\\", eventually moulding \\"my style, my stamina and my system\\". For the last four years of Clay's amateur career he was trained by boxing cutman Chuck Bodak.  Clay made his amateur boxing debut in 1954 against local amateur boxer Ronnie O'Keefe. He won by split decision. He went on to win six Kentucky Golden Gloves titles, two national Golden Gloves titles, an Amateur Athletic Union national title, and the Light Heavyweight gold medal in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. Clay's amateur record was 100 wins with five losses. Ali said in his 1975 autobiography that shortly after his return from the Rome Olympics, he threw his gold medal into the Ohio River after he and a friend were refused service at a \\"whites-only\\" restaurant and fought with a white gang. The story was later disputed, and several of Ali's friends, including Bundini Brown and photographer Howard Bingham, denied it. Brown told Sports Illustrated writer Mark Kram, \\"Honkies sure bought into that one!\\" Thomas Hauser's biography of Ali stated that Ali was refused service at the diner but that he lost his medal a year after he won it. Ali received a replacement medal at a basketball intermission during the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, where he lit the torch to start the games.  Clay made his professional debut on October 29, 1960, winning a six-round decision over Tunney Hunsaker. From then until the end of 1963, Clay amassed a record of 19-0 with 15 wins by knockout. He defeated boxers that included Tony Esperti, Jim Robinson, Donnie Fleeman, Alonzo Johnson, George Logan, Willi Besmanoff, LaMar Clark, Doug Jones and Henry Cooper. Clay also beat his former trainer and veteran boxer Archie Moore in a 1962 match.  These early fights were not without trials. Clay was knocked down both by Sonny Banks and Cooper. In the Cooper fight, Clay was floored by a left hook at the end of round four and was saved by the bell, going on to win in the predicted 5th round due to Cooper's severely cut eye. The fight with Doug Jones on March 13, 1963 was Clay's toughest fight during this stretch. The number-two and -three heavyweight contenders respectively, Clay and Jones fought on Jones' home turf at New York's Madison Square Garden. Jones staggered Clay in the first round, and the unanimous decision for Clay was greeted by boos and a rain of debris thrown into the ring (watching on closed-circuit TV, heavyweight champ Sonny Liston quipped that if he fought Clay he might get locked up for murder). The fight was later named \\"Fight of the Year\\" by The Ring magazine.  In each of these fights, Clay vocally belittled his opponents and vaunted his abilities. He called Jones \\"an ugly little man\\" and Cooper a \\"bum\\". He was embarrassed to get in the ring with Alex Miteff. Madison Square Garden was \\"too small for me\\". Clay's behavior provoked the ire of many boxing fans. His provocative and outlandish behavior in the ring was inspired by professional wrestler \\"Gorgeous George\\" Wagner. Ali stated in a 1969 interview with the Associated Press' Hubert Mizel that he met with Gorgeous George in Las Vegas in 1961 and that the wrestler inspired him to use wrestling jargon when he did interviews.  After Clay left Moore's camp in 1960, partially due to Clay's refusing to do chores such as dish-washing and sweeping, he hired Angelo Dundee, whom he had met in February 1957 during Ali's amateur career, to be his trainer. Around this time, Clay sought longtime idol Sugar Ray Robinson to be his manager, but was rebuffed.  Ali and Frazier's first fight, held at the Garden on March 8, 1971, was nicknamed the \\"Fight of the Century\\", due to the tremendous excitement surrounding a bout between two undefeated fighters, each with a legitimate claim as heavyweight champions. Veteran boxing writer John Condon called it \\"the greatest event I've ever worked on in my life\\". The bout was broadcast to 35 foreign countries; promoters granted 760 press passes.  Adding to the atmosphere were the considerable pre-fight theatrics and name calling. Ali portrayed Frazier as a \\"dumb tool of the white establishment\\". \\"Frazier is too ugly to be champ\\", Ali said. \\"Frazier is too dumb to be champ.\\" Ali also frequently called Frazier an \\"Uncle Tom\\". Dave Wolf, who worked in Frazier's camp, recalled that, \\"Ali was saying 'the only people rooting for Joe Frazier are white people in suits, Alabama sheriffs, and members of the Ku Klux Klan. I'm fighting for the little man in the ghetto.' Joe was sitting there, smashing his fist into the palm of his hand, saying, 'What the fuck does he know about the ghetto?'\\"  Ali began training at a farm near Reading, Pennsylvania, in 1971 and, finding the country setting to his liking, sought to develop a real training camp in the countryside. He found a five-acre site on a Pennsylvania country road in the village of Deer Lake, Pennsylvania. On this site, Ali carved out what was to become his training camp, the camp where he lived and trained for all the many fights he had from 1972 on to the end of his career in the 1980s.  The Monday night fight lived up to its billing. In a preview of their two other fights, a crouching, bobbing and weaving Frazier constantly pressured Ali, getting hit regularly by Ali jabs and combinations, but relentlessly attacking and scoring repeatedly, especially to Ali's body. The fight was even in the early rounds, but Ali was taking more punishment than ever in his career. On several occasions in the early rounds he played to the crowd and shook his head \\"no\\" after he was hit. In the later rounds--in what was the first appearance of the \\"rope-a-dope strategy\\"--Ali leaned against the ropes and absorbed punishment from Frazier, hoping to tire him. In the 11th round, Frazier connected with a left hook that wobbled Ali, but because it appeared that Ali might be clowning as he staggered backwards across the ring, Frazier hesitated to press his advantage, fearing an Ali counter-attack. In the final round, Frazier knocked Ali down with a vicious left hook, which referee Arthur Mercante said was as hard as a man can be hit. Ali was back on his feet in three seconds. Nevertheless, Ali lost by unanimous decision, his first professional defeat. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What happened in the later rounds?","output":"In the later rounds of the fight between Ali and Frazier, Ali employed the \\"rope-a-dope strategy\\", where he leaned against the ropes and absorbed punishment from Frazier, hoping to tire him out.

I am sure that all children who read The Ugly Duckling will be glad to know something about the 'King of Story Tellers', who wrote it for them. Thousands and thousands of children have read this story, only to ask for it again and again. It has travelled the wide world over, and has been told in every country. Hans Christian Andersen, the author of \\"The Ugly Duckling,\\" was born in Denmark. If you look on a map, you will see this little country in northern Europe. There, in the little village of Odense, he spent his boyhood. His father and mother were very poor. The family lived in two little rooms near the top of a house, where his father worked as a shoemaker. On the roof was a box filled with earth. In this box his mother planted her vegetables. Little Hans loved to walk with his father in the woods, where he could pick wild flowers and hear the birds sing. His father read to him when his work was done, or told him stories. What his father did helped him open up a new world. Once, when Hans was still a child, he went into a wheat field with his mother and a number of children, to pick the rest wheat which the reapers  had left in the field. While they were busy picking only a small amount of wheat for each of them, an angry bailiff  came rushing into the field, armed with a whip . All ran, as fast as they could, away from the angry man. _ and the sharp stalks  of the wheat plants which had been cut down, cut his feet so that he could not get away. Unafraid, the boy faced the angry man and his upraised whip. \\"How dare you hit me when you know God sees you?\\" he cried, looking fearlessly into the face of the angry bailiff. The whip came down, but not on little Hans. The bailiff admired the boy's courage, and praised him for it. He sent him home with gifts, rather than punishments.[:] While Hans was still a boy, his kind father died. Then Hans and his mother were left alone, to care for each other. \\"What will you do, Hans?\\" the mother asked \\"Would you like to become a...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. -  A fuel is heated in an oven - Above the oven is a tank of water that is sealed - The tank of water begins to boil above the oven - A the water boils steam is created - The steam is denser than air so it needs a place to go - The steam is forced out of the tank and into a piston - The piston moves up - The valve of the piston closes - The valve on the next piston opens  What might be the last step of the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"The last step of the process might involve the following sequence of events: 1. The valve of the second piston opens, allowing the high-pressure steam to enter the cylinder of the second piston. 2. As the steam fills the cylinder, it pushes the second piston down, converting the thermal energy of the steam into mechanical work. This movement of the piston either powers a piece of machinery or generates electricity, depending on the system's design and purpose. 3. Once the steam has released most of its energy through the piston's downward motion, the exhaust valve of the second piston opens. 4. The used, lower-pressure steam is released from the cylinder through the exhaust valve, either into the atmosphere or into a condensing system. If a condensing system is available, the steam is cooled down and reconverted to liquid water, which eventually returns to the water tank above the oven. This process increases the efficiency of the system, reduces water consumption, and enables continuous operation. 5. As the second piston reaches the bottom of its stroke, the piston's intake valve closes, and its exhaust valve opens to ensure that no residual steam remains in the cylinder. 6. Simultaneously, the first piston's exhaust valve closes, and its intake valve reopens, allowing a new batch of high-pressure steam to enter the cylinder and repeat the process of converting thermal energy into mechanical work. 7. The cycle of heating water, creating steam, moving the pistons, and exhausting or recondensing the steam continues, providing a constant source of power or energy for various applications. This entire process is essentially a type of steam engine or a modified Rankine cycle that harnesses the stored energy in fuel to perform valuable work. The steam engine played a crucial role in the Industrial Revolution and is still used in modern power plants to produce larger amounts of electricity by driving turbines connected to electrical generators."},{"instruction":"Information:  - The Navy of the Argentine Republic or Argentine Navy ( ARA, also \\"Armada Argentina\\") is the navy of Argentina.

Question: You are given a new situation: David is a doctor with the city hospital. Today, he is seeing four patients, patient A, patient B, patient C, and patient D. All four patients are expectant mothers. Moreover, patient A is over thirty five years old, but patient B is under thirty five years old. Patient C has family history of genetic disorder, but patient D does not have any family history of genetic disorder. David needs to prescribe appropriate treatment according to each patient's condition.  and a hint : During Amniocentesis a small amount of amniotic fluid, which contains fetal cells, is extracted from the amnion or amniotic sac surrounding a developing fetus, and the fetal DNA is examined for genetic abnormalities. Amniocentesis is not performed for every pregnancy, but is generally done when an increased risk of genetic defects in the fetus is indicated, by mother's age (over 35 years is common), family history of genetic defects, or other factors.  Please answer this question : Which patient would be more at risk of genetic defects in the fetus, patient A or patient B? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information and the hint provided, Patient A would be more at risk of genetic defects in the fetus as compared to Patient B. There are several factors contributing to this conclusion: 1. Age: One of the most significant risk factors for genetic defects in a fetus is the age of the mother. Women who are over thirty-five years old have an increased risk of having a child with chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down syndrome, as compared to younger women. This is primarily due to the age of the woman's eggs, which are more likely to develop genetic abnormalities as they age. In this scenario, Patient A is over 35 years old, while Patient B is under 35 years old, placing Patient A at a higher risk for genetic defects. 2. Amniocentesis: As stated in the hint, amniocentesis is not performed in every pregnancy but is generally considered when there is an increased risk of genetic defects in the fetus. This is indicated by factors such as the mother's age (with over 35 years being a common threshold for increased risk), past family history of genetic defects and abnormalities, and other factors. In this given situation, Patient A is over 35 years old, which is one criterion to consider amniocentesis to examine any potential genetic defects in the fetus.  On the other hand, Patient B is under 35 years old, which indicates a lower risk of genetic defects in the fetus due to maternal age. Hence, the risk of genetic defects for Patient B is lower as compared to Patient A. However, it is essential to consider other factors like family history and any previous complications before reaching a final conclusion. In many cases, younger women without any apparent risk factors may also have fetuses with genetic defects. In summary, based on the age factor and the hint provided, Patient A, being over 35 years old, would be more at risk of genetic defects in the fetus compared to Patient B, who is under 35 years old. Nevertheless, it is crucial for Dr. David to take into account each patient's entire medical history, family history, and other relevant factors before determining the most appropriate treatment and diagnostic steps."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What was the Great Migration?\\"  Context: \\"Detroit, like many places in the United States, developed racial conflict and discrimination in the 20th century following rapid demographic changes as hundreds of thousands of new workers were attracted to the industrial city; in a short period it became the 4th-largest city in the nation. The Great Migration brought rural blacks from the South; they were outnumbered by southern whites who also migrated to the city. Immigration brought southern and eastern Europeans of Catholic and Jewish faith; these new groups competed with native-born whites for jobs and housing in the booming city. Detroit was one of the major Midwest cities that was a site for the dramatic urban revival of the Ku Klux Klan beginning in 1915. \\"By the 1920s the city had become a stronghold of the KKK,\\" whose members opposed Catholic and Jewish immigrants, as well as black Americans. The Black Legion, a secret vigilante group, was active in the Detroit area in the 1930s, when one-third of its estimated 20,000 to 30,000 members in Michigan were based in the city. It was defeated after numerous prosecutions following the kidnapping and murder in 1936 of Charles Poole, a Catholic Works Progress Administration organizer. A total of 49 men of the Black Legion were convicted of numerous crimes, with many sentenced to life in prison for murder.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The Great Migration refers to the massive movement of African Americans from the rural Southern United States to the urban areas of the North, Midwest, and West, primarily between 1916 and 1970. During this period, approximately six million African Americans left the South in search of better economic opportunities and to escape the harsh reality of segregation, racial violence, and disenfranchisement prevalent in the Southern states. There were two phases of the Great Migration – the first wave occurred during 1916-1940, while the second wave took place from 1940-1970. Detroit, as mentioned in the context, became a primary destination for the African American population during this significant shift, owing to its booming industrial sector, particularly the automobile industry. Factories and businesses in the city offered many job opportunities that attracted both African American workers from the South and white workers from other regions. However, this rapid demographic change in Detroit led to increasing racial tensions, conflicts, and discrimination among the various ethnicities living and working in the city. The arrival of African Americans in Detroit was met with resistance from the city's existing white population. The competition for jobs, housing, resources, and social status significantly contributed to the intensification of both overt and covert forms of discrimination, not only against African Americans but also against immigrant groups of Catholic and Jewish faith. Detroit became a stronghold for the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) in the 1920s. The KKK, notorious for its white supremacist ideologies, targeted African Americans, Catholics, and Jews with acts of violence, intimidation, and terror as they sought to maintain white dominance and control over political and social affairs. This period also witnessed the rise of a secret vigilante group called the Black Legion, which was active in Detroit and surrounding areas in the 1930s. The group had a significantly large presence, with roughly one-third of its 20,000 to 30,000 members being based in Detroit. It perpetrated numerous crimes, including the high-profile kidnapping and murder of Charles Poole in 1936, before ultimately being dismantled following a series of prosecutions and convictions. The Great Migration played a pivotal role in reshaping the economic, social, and political landscape of the United States, particularly in cities like Detroit. Although it enabled African Americans to escape the oppression and prejudice of the South, they often faced new forms of discrimination and hardship in the cities where they sought refuge. Despite the challenges, the Great Migration ignited a rich cultural and artistic movement, ultimately contributing to the fight for civil rights and the eventual desegregation of the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which flowering plant genus, Pelargonium or Sutherlandia, includes about 200 species of perennials, succulents, and shrubs, commonly known as geraniums? A:","output":"The flowering plant genus that includes about 200 species of perennials, succulents, and shrubs, commonly known as geraniums, is Pelargonium. Pelargonium is a genus within the Geraniaceae family, which also includes the closely related genus Geranium. However, it is crucial to differentiate between the two genera, as their common names, geranium and cranesbill, can create confusion between them. Pelargonium species are native to South Africa, where they can be found growing in various habitats such as rocky, coastal, and mountainous areas. They have been widely cultivated and hybridized since they were first introduced to Europe in the 17th century, resulting in numerous cultivars and varieties being available for horticulture today. Pelargonium plants are well known for their attractive, brightly colored flowers and pleasant scent, which are the primary reasons for their popularity as ornamental plants. Many species have fragrant foliage due to the presence of essential oils, which can vary from citrus, mint, or even rose-like scents. Some of the more common types of Pelargonium include: 1. Pelargonium zonale: Known as a \\"zonale\\" pelargonium because of the dark band demonstrated on their leaves, these plants are renowned for their upright growth habit, and brightly colored flowers, which may appear in shades of red, pink, orange, or white. 2. Pelargonium peltatum: Commonly referred to as ivy-leaved geraniums, these plants are characterized by their trailing growth habit, ivy-shaped leaves, and vibrant flowers, making them ideal for hanging baskets or containers. 3. Pelargonium crispum: Often called the lemon-scented geranium, this species is notable for its finely toothed and lemon-scented leaves, along with its tiny, inconspicuous flowers. 4. Pelargonium graveolens: Also known as the rose geranium, this species is valued for its rose-scented leaves and essential oils that are widely used in aromatherapy and the perfume industry. In contrast to Pelargonium, Sutherlandia is a genus in the Fabaceae family, which comprises only a few species, including the well-known Sutherlandia frutescens. This plant, commonly known as cancer bush or balloon pea, is native to southern Africa and is known for its medicinal properties and attractive, red-to-orange flowers. Sutherlandia is considered as an adaptogen, providing immune support and helping to cope with various health ailments. While both genera have valuable characteristics, it is Pelargonium that is linked to the diverse group of perennials, succulents, and shrubs known as geraniums."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  To predict the relative stabilities of metal complexes with different ligands. One of the most important properties of metallic elements is their ability to act as Lewis acids that form complexes with a variety of Lewis bases. A metal complex consists of a central metal atom or ion that is bonded to one or more ligands (from the Latinligare, meaning “to bind”), which are ions or molecules that contain one or more pairs of electrons that can be shared with the metal. Metal complexes can be neutral, such as Co(NH3)3Cl3; positively charged, such as [Nd(H2O)9]3+; or negatively charged, such as [UF8]4−. Electrically charged metal complexes are sometimes called complex ions. A coordination compound contains one or more metal complexes. Coordination compounds are important for at least three reasons. First, most of the elements in the periodic table are metals, and almost all metals form complexes, so metal complexes are a feature of the chemistry of more than half the elements. Second, many industrial catalysts are metal complexes, and such catalysts are steadily becoming more important as a way to control reactivity. For example, a mixture of a titanium complex and an organometallic compound of aluminum is the catalyst used to produce most of the polyethylene and polypropylene “plastic” items we use every day. Finally, transition-metal complexes are essential in biochemistry. Examples include hemoglobin, an iron complex that transports oxygen in our blood; cytochromes, iron complexes that transfer electrons in our cells; and complexes of Fe, Zn, Cu, and Mo that are crucial components of certain enzymes, the catalysts for all biological reactions. Metal complexes are so important in biology that we consider the topic separately in Section 23.6 \\"Transition Metals in Biology\\".

The best-of-five tie takes place over three days in Ghent's Flanders Expo. A capacity crowd of 13,000 is expected each day, with more than 1,000 Britons due at each session despite recent security fears in Belgian capital Brussels, 35 miles away. The British team arrived a day later than planned on Monday but Murray said the team were \\"comfortable\\" with security efforts since their arrival. \\"I know the situation has been difficult for everybody who are making the travel plans,\\" said GB captain Leon Smith. \\"But I know they wouldn't miss it because they've watched us so passionately throughout this whole campaign.\\" Britain are trying to win the 115-year-old competition for the 10th time, but the first since Fred Perry led them to victory over Australia at Wimbledon in 1936. Two years ago, Murray became the first British man since Perry in 1936 to win the Wimbledon singles title, and now he stands on the verge of matching another of his predecessor's achievements. \\"To win the biggest team competition in tennis, having beaten the other three Grand Slam nations [USA, France and Australia in previous rounds], I think it would be a huge victory for everyone in the team,\\" said the Scot. \\"It would be well deserved as well.

I think he's really talented.\\" Edmund said: \\"This is definitely going to be the biggest crowd I've played in front of. Probably the biggest occasion. It's a new experience for me. It's something I'm going to have to learn as I go through the match. But it's a good problem and it's exciting.\\" The second rubber appears something of a mismatch, with left-hander Bemelmans having won just three matches on the ATP Tour this year, compared to Murray's 69 wins and four titles. Murray also boasts a terrific record in the Davis Cup, with just two singles defeats - against Switzerland's Stan Wawrinka in 2005 and Italy's Fabio Fognini in 2014 - and 25 victories. The issue for Murray could well be preserving energy on the indoor clay court before two more days of doubles and singles action. Bemelmans said: \\"It's the first confrontation I have with him, match or practice. It's going to be new for him, as well. I think I probably know him better, how he plays, than him me. Maybe I have a slight advantage there.\\" Murray said: \\"I know his game a bit, but actually I don't know the Belgian players that well because I've never played against any of them except Goffin. It's quite a strange situation to be in. Whoever had played the first day, I would never have practised with them or played against them, so it doesn't change much.\\" Listen to the Radio 5 live podcast:'We're going to take the cup home' Summary:","output":"The Davis Cup final is set to take place over three days at the Flanders Expo in Ghent, Belgium. It will be the British tennis team’s first appearance in the final since 1978. Edmund is set to make his competition debut against Belgium’s number one David Goffin in the opening match. Andy Murray will take on world number 108 Ruben Bemelmans. This competition has been running for 115 years, and Britain is trying to win for the 10th time, but the first since 1936. Belgium has never won the Davis Cup, and the only other time they came close was in 1904, when they lost 5-0 to Britain. Despite recent security fears in Belgium, a capacity crowd of 13,000 is expected each day of the event, with more than 1,000 Britons due at each session."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CHRIS HASTON/NBC) Emmy Award nominations day is a time to congratulate all the creative people in the TV industry for being so darn talented. It’s a time to wonder if “Mad Men” is going to win best drama for a fifth year in a row. It’s a time for Emmy nominees like Zooey Deschanel to talk about what an “incredible honor” it is to be nominated. It’s also a time to grouse over who got snubbed. Every television junkie is probably complaining about a different oversight among this year’s sweeping field of Emmy nominations. But here’s the list of 10 that struck me as most significant or just personally irked me. Because, yes, Emmy nomination day is also a time for being irked. The Pawnee series — which, pssst, is shooting scenes in the District as we speak — was left off the list of contenders for best comedy, although it did snag nominations for Amy Poehler and for writing, one of which was for “The Debate,” an episode Poehler wrote and directed. So it was both a good and bad day for Leslie Knope. I swear this is the last “Parks and Rec”-related entry on this list. But really, what does Ron Swanson have to do to be recognized as one of the most gif-able, beloved characters in television history? (Adam Taylor - Fox via AP) The British actor and deliverer of invariably charming acceptance speeches has never won an Emmy for his role as Dr. Gregory House on Fox’s “House.” (He was nominated six times and never triumphed; all those fab speeches were given at the Golden Globes or the SAGs.) And now he never will, since he was passed over for the final season of the series. He’s won the award for best reality series host so many times that he seemed like a foregone nominee. But he was omitted from the category entirely, probably for reasons that are Betty White’s fault. The CBS political/legal drama seems like classic Emmy bait. But while Juliana Margulies earned a nod for her role as the show’s “good wife,” it was bumped out of best drama contention, edged out, perhaps, by shows like “Homeland” and “Boardwalk Empire.” (Lewis Jacobs - Sony Pictures via AP) “Community” earned its first nomination today in the writing category, which is a good thing. But that hasn’t stopped the ardent supporters of Greendale Community College from expressing their dismay over its lack of inclusion in the best comedy category. See? No Community on the #Emmy noms anywhere. What is mentally wrong with these people? 7. Vincent Kartheiser of “Mad Men” It was great to see Jared Harris, a.k.a. Lane Pryce of “Mad Men,” in the best supporting actor category. I mean, that guy had a rough few months. But it’s unfortunate that none of his colleagues joined him, especially Vincent Kartheiser. As Pete Campbell, Kartheiser bloodied his nose multiple times, broke down crying in an elevator and delivered a significant season-summarizing monologue on “Mad Men.” Pete is such a jerk that Kartheiser’s portrayal is often underestimated. Am I surprised that “Walking Dead” was only recognized for makeup, sound editing and visual effects? No. I didn’t expect it to land a best drama slot, but I thought it might earn something else, like a directing nomination. Apparently Emmy voters do not care for zombies. Louis C.K. was nominated for best actor in a comedy, and the FX series nabbed nods for best writing and directing. But “Louie” was overlooked in the best comedy field, despite the fact that most critics consider it one of the best comedies on television. Is anyone still saying that about “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” which was nominated for best comedy? I love this show. I love it something awful. Pretty much no one pays attention to how consistently strong it is, so, again, no surprise that Emmy didn’t either, with the exception of a guest-actor nomination for Jason Ritter. But it really deserves some recognition. Did one of these snubs make you so angry that you fired off an irate status update about it? Or were you more outraged by the lack of nominations for “Boss,” or the fact that “Glee” wasn’t nominated for best comedy, or that FX’s “Justified” got pretty much bupkus or some other royal injustice that I have yet to mention?

In one technique, the pie crust is lined with aluminium foil or parchment paper, then filled with pastry- or pie weights (sometimes called \`\`baking beans'') to ensure the crust retains its shape while baking. Pie-weights are available as ceramic or metal beads, but rice, dried peas, lentils, beans or other pulses can be used instead. When using this method for a fully baked crust, the weights are removed before the pre-baking is complete in order to achieve a browned crust. Another technique dispenses with weights by placing a second pie tin on top of the crust, then inverting the tins to bake. In this method, the crust browns between the tins. A further simplified technique involves piercing the crust repeatedly with the tines of a fork to produce small holes, allowing steam to escape and preventing the crust from bubbling up, but that does not work with soft doughs such as pâte sucrée. Question: can you use tin foil to blind bake?","output":"Yes, you can use tin foil (also known as aluminum foil) to blind bake a pie crust. Blind baking is a method used to pre-bake a pie crust before adding the filling, particularly when the filling has a shorter baking time or is custard-based. This process helps achieve a crisp and fully cooked crust that doesn't become soggy, undercooked, or overly puffed during the baking process. To use tin foil for blind baking, follow these steps: 1. Prepare your pie crust in the pie pan, making sure it's evenly pressed into the pan and the edges are trimmed and crimped as desired. 2. Cut a piece of tin foil that is slightly larger than the diameter of the pie crust. Gently press the foil onto the pie crust, ensuring that it's snug against the bottom and sides of the crust. You can also use parchment paper as an alternative to tin foil. 3. Fill the pie crust with pie weights, ensuring an even distribution. Pie weights can be ceramic or metal beads specifically designed for blind baking, but you can also use dried beans, rice, lentils, or other pulses as an alternative. 4. Preheat your oven to the temperature recommended by your recipe, typically between 375°F (190°C) and 425°F (220°C). 5. Place the pie pan with the foil-lined pie crust on a baking sheet and bake for the amount of time specified in your recipe, generally around 15-20 minutes. This first stage of baking is focused on setting the crust's shape while allowing it to slightly bake. 6. Carefully remove the pie crust from the oven and lift out the tin foil, along with the pie weights that were used to fill the crust. 7. Return the pie crust to the oven and bake for an additional 5-10 minutes until the crust takes on a golden brown color. This step allows the crust to fully bake without the pie weights. 8. Remove the crust from the oven and let it cool before adding the filling, then proceed with the rest of your pie recipe. In a nutshell, tin foil can be used effectively for blind baking a pie crust, ensuring a well-cooked and crisp crust that's ready to pair perfectly with your chosen filling."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

OPT:  (a). like she's gaining new experiences.  (b). bored and worthless.  (c). bored and stupid. Answer:","output":"Answer: (a). like she's gaining new experiences. Bailey's jungle safari and her encounter with monkeys in the wild would most likely result in her feeling as though she is gaining new experiences. Jungle safaris are adventurous, exciting, and can often be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so it would be natural for Bailey to feel thrilled about witnessing wildlife up close, in their natural habitat. A journey deep into the wilderness, with its rich biodiversity, unique plant life, and thrilling animal sightings, often instills a sense of adventure, wonder, and appreciation of nature in people. In Bailey's case, the sight of monkeys playing freely in their natural habitat will likely enhance her appreciation for the interconnectedness of life on Earth. Furthermore, observing the monkeys' social interactions, behaviors, and ways of adapting to their environment might provide Bailey with valuable insights and an increased understanding of these fascinating creatures. Moreover, a jungle safari is undoubtedly packed with a variety of exciting experiences that make it impossible for one to feel bored. In addition to monkeys, Bailey could have likely observed other exotic flora and fauna, navigated through unexplored trails, and possibly experienced thrilling rides over rugged terrain. These elements of thrill, adventure, and learning contribute to the overall feeling of excitement and happiness that one derives from such an expedition. The feeling of worthlessness or boredom is unlikely to be associated with experiencing wildlife in its natural habitat. Instead, Bailey would most likely return from the jungle safari feeling accomplished, enlightened, and carrying fond memories of her time among the monkeys and other wildlife she encountered. The adventure would likely leave her with a thirst for more such experiences and a newfound curiosity about the world's diverse ecosystems and the creatures that inhabit them."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question given this paragraph:   A monoprotic acid is an acid that contains only one ionizable hydrogen.

One foggy night in Devon, Gail, a working border collie Herding dog, gives birth to a litter of three puppies, cozy in a barn on Borough Farm. As she lies quietly with her newborn litter, her father, Sir Gregory, walks inside, not realizing she had her puppies until she summons his attention and he spots them curled up next to her. She has already named two of them Storm and Drift but she thinks Sir Gregory should name the third. He looks out of the window and names her Mist after the \\"misty\\" night she was born. All the other dogs, Swift, her son Ernie, and Jake, are delighted to meet the puppies at last but Fern doesn't seem to like puppies and is not happy to be their auntie. When the puppies realize they can finally see things, Mist looks out of a nearby window and sees a flock of sheep pass by, but does not exactly know what they are. She points them out to Storm and Drift, but by the time they come to the window, the sheep are gone. They think Mist is making it up, and they playfully tease and wrestle each other around the barn. This soon tires them out, and they slowly fall asleep side by side. Mist seems to like the idea of working the flock more than her brother and sister. Later that day, Sir Gregory talks with Gail about how well Mist is doing compared to Storm and Drift. Gail realises it is finally time to choose which of the puppies will stay on Borough Farm to be trained as a working sheepdog, and which have to leave. One day the puppies are playing in the yard when two different families come to take Storm and Drift away. They are placed in the cars and Gail sadly watches them drive away. Winter arrives at Borough Farm, but Fern has still not warmed up to Mist. One day Mist gets giddy and runs off into the woods; a dark place where she soon gets lost and has to be rescued by the Boss and Sir Gregory. This amuses Fern.

Background: Nicholas John Griffin (born 1 March 1959) is a British politician who represented North West England as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 2009 to 2014. He served as chairman and then president of the far-right British National Party (BNP) from 1999 to 2014, when he was expelled from the party. Born in Barnet, Griffin was educated at Woodbridge School in Suffolk. He joined the National Front at the age of 14 and, following his graduation from the University of Cambridge, became a political worker for the party. Context: Following his graduation, Griffin became a political worker at the National Front headquarters. As a teenager he had accompanied his father to a National Front meeting, and by 1978, he was a national organiser for the party. He helped set up the White Noise Music Club in 1979, and several years later worked with white power skinhead band, Skrewdriver. In 1980, he became a member of the party's governing body, the National Directorate, and in the same year launched Nationalism Today with the aid of Joe Pearce, then editor of the NF youth paper Bulldog. As a National Front member, Griffin contested the seat of Croydon North West twice, in the 1981 by-election and 1983 general election, securing 1.2% and 0.9% of the vote.  Membership of the National Front declined significantly following the election of the Conservatives under Margaret Thatcher. As a result, the party became more radicalised, and a dissatisfied Griffin, along with fellow NF activists Derek Holland and Patrick Harrington, began to embrace the ideals of Italian fascist Roberto Fiore, who had arrived in the UK in 1980. By 1983, the group had broken away to form the NF Political Soldier faction, which advocated a revival of country \\"values\\" and a return to feudalism with the establishment of nationalist communes. Writing for Bulldog in 1985, Griffin praised the black separatist Louis Farrakhan, but his comments were unpopular with some members of the party. He also attempted to form alliances with Libya's Muammar al-Gaddafi and Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini, and praised the efforts of Welsh nationalist movement Meibion Glyndwr.  Following a disagreement with Harrington (who subsequently formed the Third Way), and objections over the direction the party was heading, in 1989, Griffin left the National Front. Along with Holland and Fiore, he helped form the International Third Position (ITP), a development of the Political Soldier movement, but left the organisation in 1990. In the same year, he lost his left eye when a discarded shotgun cartridge exploded in a pile of burning wood, since when he has worn a glass eye. The accident left him unable to work, and owing to other financial problems he subsequently petitioned for bankruptcy (the accident occurred in France, where he later lost money in a failed business project). For several years thereafter, he abstained from politics and was supported financially by his parents. He later stewarded a public Holocaust denial meeting hosted by David Irving.

LoL,\\" she wrote on Twitter Friday. \\"No, seriously ANGEL CHAMPAGNE (ROSE) by MC coming soon!\\"      See Mariah Carey's makeunder            Both George Clooney and Sean Penn mocked Carey's Jan. 6 speech, which she jokingly blamed on Precious director Lee Daniels.      Relive 2009's biggest breakdowns            \\"We were celebrating and having little splashes, and I hadn't eaten, and that's what it was. We were celebrating the movie and all the exciting stuff going on,\\" Carey explained at the People's Choice Awards the next day. \\"There's a time for celebration and a time for not -- but really technically, it's a party atmosphere.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that Carl Grasso invited to the Magic Castle? , can you please find it?   Following the Pixies' breakup, Lovering drummed with several artists, including Nitzer Ebb, but turned down an invitation to join the Foo Fighters. Lovering then joined Santiago's band The Martinis, appearing on their song \\"Free\\" on the soundtrack of Empire Records. However, he soon left the band to become a touring drummer for Cracker. Lovering moved from band to band, drumming with Tanya Donelly's group on 1997's Lovesongs for Underdogs and with Boston band Eeenie Meenie. After facing difficulty finding new work, Lovering gave up the drums and moved into a rented house that banned drumming.Towards the end of the 1990s, Lovering's friend Grant-Lee Phillips took him to a magic convention. Lovering was very impressed by some of the illusions, and later said \\"I had to learn how to do it\\". Mutual friend Carl Grasso invited them to a show at the Magic Castle, a magic-oriented nightclub in Los Angeles. There Lovering met Possum Dixon frontman Rob Zabrecky, and the pair soon became friends. Zabrecky convinced Lovering to apply for a performers' membership to the Magic Castle. After gaining his membership, Lovering reinvented himself as \\"The Scientific Phenomenalist\\". His act combined his electrical engineering knowledge with his stage performance experience. His decision to pursue a career in magic was influenced by the fact that as a musician, he \\"couldn't top the Pixies\\".As the Scientific Phenomentalist, Lovering performs science and physics experiments in a lab coat while on stage. He shuns traditional magic tricks, and prefers \\"things that are more mental, using mental powers\\". He later explained: \\"It's all kind of upbeat, really weird physics experiments that you'll never see. [...] I'd rather have them [the audience] going 'Is it [magic] or isn't it?' rather than 'It's all science' or 'It's all magic'. So I do kinda weird things that other magicians don't do\\".

Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"The most important thing for a salesperson can be analyzed in terms of various skills, qualities, and attributes that are crucial for their success. 1. Communication skills: Clear, concise, and effective communication is crucial for a salesperson. They must inform potential clients about the merits of the product or service they are selling, address their concerns, and negotiate deals in a manner that benefits both parties. 2. Listening skills: A good salesperson must also be a good listener. They need to be able to understand the unique needs and preferences of their clients and tailor their sales pitch accordingly. Actively listening to what the client is saying helps in building trust and rapport with them. 3. Persistence and resilience: Sales is an inherently challenging occupation as rejection is commonplace. A successful salesperson must possess the determination and resilience necessary to endure and thrive under these conditions. Being persistent and keeping a positive attitude even after facing multiple rejections is key to success in sales. 4. Emotional intelligence: A good salesperson must have the ability to empathize with their clients. They must recognize and understand the emotions and triggers that might cause the client to either close a deal or refuse it. Emotional intelligence plays a critical role in building long-lasting relationships with clients. 5. Organization and time management: A successful salesperson must be able to manage their time effectively and prioritize their tasks. They should have a well-structured plan for conducting research, following up with clients, and closing deals. 6. Adaptability: The sales environment can change rapidly. A good salesperson must be prepared to adapt to new technology, selling techniques, and marketplace trends in order to stay relevant and effective. A strong desire to learn and grow is essential for continued success in sales. Regarding Michelin Pilot Sport A/S+ tires, they have received positive reviews for their performance on an Acura TL. The Pilot Sport A/S+ is an ultra-high-performance all-season tire, which provides excellent traction and handling in both wet and dry conditions. Key features include a silica-enhanced tread compound, which offers improved wet and dry grip, as well as optimized contact patch, which evenly distributes pressure across the tire. Additionally, the tire's wide circumferential grooves provide efficient water evacuation, helping to resist hydroplaning. These characteristics make the Michelin Pilot Sport A/S+ a suitable choice for an Acura TL as it offers a balance of performance and all-season capabilities.

The Vikings began their opening home game of the season without Adrian Peterson, who was deactivated after being charged with negligent injury of a child for allegedly beating his four-year-old son with a tree branch. He was replaced in the starting lineup by Matt Asiata, who got the Vikings off to a good start with a 25-yard touchdown reception from Matt Cassel on the game's opening possession. The defense then forced the Patriots into a three-and-out, only for Cassel to throw an interception attempting to find Jarius Wright deep downfield. Devin McCourty returned the ball 60 yards to the Minnesota 1-yard line, and two plays later, Stevan Ridley ran in to tie the scores. A second interception early in the second quarter resulted in another scoring drive for New England, as Tom Brady connected with Julian Edelman on a nine-yard TD catch. As the first half drew to a close, the Vikings drove downfield to give Blair Walsh a 48-yard field goal attempt with 19 seconds on the clock; however, Patriots DE Chandler Jones was able to burst through the Minnesota offensive line and block the kick before scooping up the ball and returning it 58 yards for the Patriots' third TD of the half. After the break, Cassel threw another two interceptions, one in each quarter, with the first resulting in a 47-yard Stephen Gostkowski field goal. The second occurred with six minutes left in the game, and the Patriots were able to hang onto possession until the two-minute warning before turning the ball over on downs at the Minnesota 19-yard line. Aided by two pass interference penalties, Cassel led the Vikings down the field and thought he had managed to cut into the New England lead with a 16-yard pass to Greg Jennings with 41 seconds to play, only for Jennings to be ruled out of bounds before gaining possession of the ball.

News article: New Haven Welcomes a Booming Population of Immigrants, Legal or Not “It stems from a simple central fact that when you’ve got a lot of people living in one place, you have to have certain rules for stability,” Mr. DeStefano said. “You have this population that works hard and lives among us as neighbors; we ought to know who they are. The last thing you want is them not to talk to City Hall because they are afraid of us.” New Haven’s welcoming policies have, in many ways, trickled down from larger cities like New York, Los Angeles and Houston, but stand in sharp contrast to the expanding crackdown on immigrants announced last week in Suffolk County on Long Island. Saying that illegal immigrants were hurting Long Island’s economy and quality of life, Steve Levy, the Suffolk County executive, called for antiloitering legislation to clear day laborers off the streets; vowed to enforce a county law penalizing businesses for hiring illegal immigrants; and welcomed federal immigration officials into the local jail to speed deportation of those who are arrested. At the same time, immigrant groups in New Jersey are working with Hackensack, Paterson and other places to pass resolutions prohibiting the police or other city officials from questioning residents about their immigration status, joining Newark and Trenton in becoming so-called sanctuary cities. As more immigrants have bypassed larger cities in favor of smaller cities and towns on the outer rings of urban areas, local governments are increasingly torn by questions like how building inspectors should handle overcrowded apartments and whether garbage collection and other services can be denied based on immigration status. The issue seems less fraught with tension in New Haven, the home of Yale University and long a hub of liberal social movements. When Mayor DeStefano floated the idea of municipal ID cards here in late 2005, the news ricocheted on conservative talk radio shows, but there were no protests on the steps of City Hall or major outcries from residents. Indeed, the city had been under pressure to formalize a longstanding policy that police officers would not ask for the immigration status of a person who reported a crime. Police and city officials have long worried that immigrants had become targets for robbery because they often get paid in cash and carry large sums of money; some said that immigrants were viewed as “walking A.T.M.’s” because they were easy victims who probably would not report crimes for fear of deportation. Indeed, there were several instances in which robbery victims went to community centers for help rather than risk calling the police. Even if confrontations with the police are isolated exceptions, reports and rumors of them ripple quickly through the immigrant community, which is centered in the Fair Haven neighborhood north of downtown. “It’s simple. There are some police who want to help, who just want to get the criminals, and there are others who want to cause trouble and scare us,” Pedro Martinez, who has lived in Fair Haven for three years, said in Spanish. “We try to tell each other where it’s safe to walk, which are the good officers, but it’s not always right.” Mr. Martinez said that he and his friends knew about the Police Department’s new policy, but that it was too soon to tell how much of a difference it would make. Still, there were signs of reluctance in some quarters. When the Police Department moved to put its longstanding policy into writing, police union officials worried they could be held liable by the federal government. After the city had an immigration lawyer assure them that they were not legally obliged to go after civil law violations, the union said it would back the policy, but some doubters remain. “Everybody is looking at this as if we were just one big happy family or as if we live in ‘Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,’ but that’s not the case,” said Louis Cavalier, the police union president. “These are people who are breaking the law; when they find them they should put them in the car and ship them back home. Instead, you have people calling their relatives and saying, ‘Hey, come here, where it’s safe.’ ” Immigration experts doubt a city’s policies could affect an immigrant’s destination more than, say, where relatives live or jobs can be found, but there is at least tacit acknowledgment here that there is political will to try things in New Haven that would be shunned in more conservative communities. City officials essentially shelved plans for municipal identification cards while Mr. DeStefano was running as the Democratic candidate for governor, though he said he rarely heard complaints about them while campaigning. Late last year, he hired Kica Matos, the former director of Junta for Progressive Action, an immigration advocacy and community center, as community affairs director at City Hall, and Ms. Matos plans to put several immigrant-friendly policies into effect, including the identification cards. Like most states, Connecticut requires proof of legal citizenship or residency for driver’s licenses, making it nearly impossible for most illegal immigrants to have an official identification card to use in banks, bars or when dealing with the police. Though other cities have long distributed identification cards for particular city services, like borrowing books from the library, this would be the first to be issued for general use. There are still several kinks to be ironed out, including how to encourage legal residents to get the card so that it does not become a de facto scarlet letter for those here illegally. But officials are optimistic that children, Yale students and supportive New Haven residents will sign up; they have also considered asking local businesses to offer some kind of discount for those with the card. “We know that there is interest from the immigrant community for something like this and that the need for an ID outweighs the potential nervousness about not wanting anyone to know who you are,” said Michael Wishnie, a law professor at Yale who has lobbied the city for immigrant-friendly policies. For example, Professor Wishnie said, thousands of illegal immigrants have signed up for an individual taxpayer identification number with the Internal Revenue Service, which allows them to pay federal taxes. Many immigrants believe that filing taxes will allow them to prove that they have been working, law-abiding residents if they are eventually considered for citizenship. This year, for the first time, the city used several workers to recruit immigrants to its low-income tax counseling program. Junta, the primary community agency running the program, has had dozens of applicants come through its doors in the last month. Maria, who asked that her last name not be used, was fairly typical of the applicants. She said she had lived in the United States for eight years and had always had a job — sometimes for cash, sometimes for a check. As she sat down with a Junta tax counselor, she pulled out W-2 forms for each of the last five years, detailing how much money she had made in her job at a laundry. “Can I pay for all of these years?” Maria asked, seemingly eager to send the government any money she might owe. When the counselor replied that she would do the 2006 forms first, and then could do the last three years, Maria looked down at the stack of papers. “See, this is what I hope,” she said a few minutes later, motioning to her young son sitting next to her. “That if I pay, I can do what they want me to do and become a citizen like my children.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: New Haven Welcomes Immigrants, Legal or Not.

The city believes that when a lot of people live together, it's important to have rules that help everyone get along. New Haven wants to make it easier for immigrants to get identification cards, so they can open bank accounts or use other services without being afraid. The city also tries to help immigrants with things like finding jobs and paying taxes. Some other cities are doing the same thing, while others are trying to make life harder for immigrants. People have different opinions about this issue, but in New Haven, they're trying to make life better for everyone, no matter where they come from."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:This article: In Victorian London, an unseen criminal begins masterminding his \\"perfect plot on paper\\" which starts with a robbery taking place and three cats stealing a pink diamond. Three constables spot them and give chase, but the cats escape to the rooftops and glide off into the night, giving the stolen diamond to a mysterious horseman. The next day, Dr. Watson rushes to 221B in Baker Street and informs his colleague Sherlock Holmes of the robbery. Holmes then calls his pet mouse Jerry to bring him a copy of the Times. Jerry heads out to buy it while encountering Tom on the way, who also has something for Holmes. Jerry returns to Holmes' flat and hands him the paper or what was left of it after the chase. Reading a letter Tom had given to them for the night, Holmes and Watson decide to go to the Bruce Nigel Theatre where a performer named Red is seen. Holmes is told that she is being blackmailed and Holmes suggests who the perpetrator might be – Professor Moriarty. Holmes deduces that the Star of Punjab, a diamond that is light sensitive to the light of a solar eclipse which was to happen the following day, is to be stolen by the mastermind of the blackmail. At the Punjab Embassy, Spike and Tyke are assigned to guard the Star of Punjab. Spike begins to teach Tyke how to be a good dog guard, but the three cats from the previous night steal the diamond while an unfocused Spike is not looking. The three cats then leave a small button and retreat. They climb out through a hole in Red's home that leads to the tunnel and escape before Holmes, Tom and Jerry arrive. Upon arriving, Jerry tricks Tom into stepping into a broken board and the trio check the tunnel. Finding sawdust, they retreat after hearing Tyke sounding the alarm.

Solve this problem.","output":"To solve the equation -5019*v + 510*v + 15562 = -29528 for the variable v, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation. -5019*v + 510*v = -4509*v, since -5019 + 510 = -4509. So, the equation becomes: -4509*v + 15562 = -29528 Step 2: Isolate the variable term by subtracting 15562 from both sides of the equation. -4509*v + 15562 - 15562 = -29528 - 15562 -4509*v = -45090, since -29528 - 15562 = -45090. Step 3: Now, to find the value of v, divide both sides of the equation by -4509. -4509*v / -4509 = -45090 / -4509 v = 10, since -45090 / -4509 = 10.

As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m), pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed.

Write a title for this article: Pope Francis at his first general audience last month in St. Peterâs Square. So you’re off to Rome and in addition to seeing the Colosseum, you want to see the new pope. But how? Your best bet is to attend a general audience (also known as a papal audience), a weekly gathering that the American Catholic Church in Rome says includes prayers, blessings and a homily. It is not a Mass but, rather, a chance to listen to the pope and mingle with other attendees. (The rocker Patti Smith was among the most recent visitors.) Tours both old and new enable those now flocking to Rome for a glimpse of Pope Francis, who assumed the role last month, to get a seat at an audience. There are weeklong romps through the Eternal City that include tours of ancient Rome and Assisi. There are half-day excursions with transportation to and from your hotel. And there are no-frills affairs for those who simply want to be escorted into the audience from just beyond St. Peter’s Square. Lasting about an hour and a half, audiences draw thousands of people and take place on Wednesday mornings in St. Peter’s Square or in the Pope Paul VI Audience Hall. (During the summer, the general audience may take place outside of Rome at Castel Gandolfo.) Tickets are free and you can get them yourself, but to ensure admission, you should request them weeks in advance (and then pick them up in person in Rome). There are a few ways to do that, according to the American Embassy to the Holy See in Rome. You can contact the American Catholic Church in Rome (Church of Santa Susanna) through the Web site Santasusanna.org, or e-mail the Bishops’ Office for United States Visitors to the Vatican at visitorsoffice@pnac.org; you may also send a fax to (39-06) 679-1448. Another option is to write to the Vatican: go to the Web site Vatican.va, choose your language, click on the “Prefecture of the Papal Household” link and then download the ticket request form, which you must fill out and mail (not e-mail) or fax. If you’d rather pay a tour company to get tickets for you and provide a guide to take you there, you have several options. ItalyVacations, the sister company of Perillo Tours, the family-owned travel company, offers one of the more full-blown tour experiences: a six-day “Meet Pope Francis” package starting at 879 a person (based on double occupancy). The trip — “a great, cultural experience centered around the new pope!” as Perillo’s Web site puts it — includes a seat at the general audience, a tour of the Vatican Museums and a day trip to the cities of Assisi (the birthplace of St. Francis, for whom the pope took his name) and Orvieto. Hotel accommodations, round-trip airport transfers and daily breakfast are also included; airfare is not. A complete itinerary is at Italyvacations.com. Another travel company, Central Holidays, is introducing a six-day “Celebrating the New Pope in Rome” package starting at 709 (based on double occupancy). The tour is not unlike Perillo’s: in addition to attending an audience, it includes guided tours of the Vatican Museums and Sistine Chapel, an excursion to Assisi and Orvieto, hotels, round-trip airport transfers and daily breakfast: Centralholidays.com. For those who want to attend the general audience yet aren’t interested in a weeklong tour, there are day tours that include round-trip transportation between major hotels and the general audience. Gray Line, for instance, will take you by bus past sites like the Piazza della Repubblica, Piazza Barberini, Via Veneto, Villa Borghese, Piazza del Popolo and its Egyptian obelisk, and Castel Sant’Angelo before arriving in Vatican City. About 46 for adults; 37 for children: Grayline.com. City Discovery, another sightseeing company, also charges around 46 for adults; 37 for children. Its “Papal Audience With Pope Francis” half-day bus tour includes stops at the Piazza dell’Esquilino, Republic Square, the Mermaids Fountain, Villa Borghese, Castel Sant’Angelo and St. Peter’s Square: City-discovery.com. Should you be averse to group travel, you can sign up for a program that offers little more than an escort to the general audience. No group bus trip. No lunch. Your guide simply meets you at Vatican City. Viator.com, a site that culls tours and activities from local guides and offers online reviews about them, has such a tour. For 42 you receive a seat at the general audience and commentary from a guide about the history of St. Peter’s Square and the papacy: Viator.com. If you have time and patience, you may want to procure the tickets yourself and go it alone. That said, some tour operators promise guests a seat during the audience (many people end up standing). The companies also take away the hassle: no need to book so far in advance, pick up tickets in Rome or navigate through the throngs of people. Will there be a general audience when you visit Rome? It’s typically a weekly affair but check the Web site of the American Catholic Church in Rome (see above). There may be changes during holidays and in the summer. For the pope’s near-term schedule, there’s — what else? — the Pope App. It’s free and enables you to be reminded of a general audience (“udienza generale,” in Italian, on the app) an hour before it begins, or just as it’s beginning. The app also has news, text of the pope’s previous audiences and other speeches, and a live feed tab. Another way to see Pope Francis is to attend his Sunday Angelus at noon in St. Peter’s Square. You do not need a ticket, though you do need to arrive early. While Pope Francis has chosen to live in the Vatican guesthouse rather than the Apostolic Palace as his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI did, according to news reports, he still delivers his message from the study window of an apartment in the palace.

He is trying to devise a technique that would  be able to control chemical reactions. For that, he conducted two tests. In the first test, he used warmer reactants. He called it reactant A. In the second test, he used cooler reactants. He called it reactant B.  In which reactants the particles would collide with greater force, reactant A or reactant B?  Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. Answer:","output":"In this scenario, the particles would collide with greater force in reactant A, where Rob used warmer reactants. The hint provided explains that at higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy and move faster. This increased energy and movement lead to a higher probability of collisions between particles and a greater force when they collide. As mentioned in the hint, chemical reactions generally occur at a faster rate at higher temperatures, and particles in warmer reactants (reactant A) will have more energy than those in cooler reactants (reactant B). This extra energy translates into faster movement and ultimately more forceful collisions among the particles. This is why food spoilage reactions happen more quickly at higher temperatures, and why we store perishable items in refrigerators or freezers to slow down the rate of spoilage by reducing the temperature and subsequent reaction rates."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

My wife and mother-in-law fared no better.Also, the cutting head keeps comes off for cleaning, but it wouldn't lock in very well for actual use. It kept coming off the unit all the time.Finally, when I bought this thing, I assumed that the wall mount was a charging cradle. It's not. The wall mount is a piece of plastic. If you want to charge the thing, you've got to pull the adapter out of a drawer somewhere and leave it plugged in for a day. Definitely not anywhere near as care free as past can openers I've used that were always on, always available, and always clicked into the can relatively easily.About the only good thing I can say about it is that after you do finally get it charged and locked onto the can, it does actually open the can.Ours went into the trash after about 5 minutes of attempted use.

About a week after the dissolution of the Crooked Creek Company, Harry was riding over from Hetertown, and had nearly reached the creek on his way home, when he met George Purvis.  This was their first meeting since their fight, for George had been away on a visit to some relatives in Richmond.  When Harry saw George riding slowly toward him, he felt very much embarrassed, and very much annoyed because he was embarrassed.  How should he meet George? What should he say; or should he say anything?  He did not want to appear anxious to \\"make up\\" with him, nor did he want to seem as if he bore malice toward him.

Frozen has united young and old, girls and boys with its feelgood tale of sisterly love. And the sold-out Frozen 'Snow Glow' Elsa doll is the most sought-after Christmas present of the year in the UK, changing hands for up to £90 online. The 30-year-old was used to putting on shows for her pre-school children at Elswick House Nursery School in Newcastle. 'I noticed that there was an Elsa costume available to hire and I thought I could do it myself using my childcare experience to enhance it,' Samantha said. 'So I bought a dress and made a Facebook page. What I like about it is that I know that I'm making memories for those families and that it will be a memory that will last a lifetime.' Clocking up almost 400 'likes' and five stars already on the social media site, Samantha wakes up every morning to at least one new Elsa booking request. In a 20-minute routine to transform into Elsa, Samantha backcombs her hair, puts in extensions, does her makeup and places on her turquoise-coloured sparkly dress. Then she spends time with children where they have singalongs, dance and story time.

We have every toy, we have the Frozen film going and the music playing every day. Sam was absolutely amazing. The children were gobsmacked, she looks really, really good. I had to explain to Libby that Elsa had to go report to Santa and that she had to go work on the next film.' Lisa Doyle, 41, from Gateshead said her daughter Isla almost cried when Samantha as Elsa arrived at her seventh birthday party. Elsa came as a surprise during the Frozen-themed party which made Isla happy after she had been unwell with a virus. 'She's such a bubbly character and she's super to do that role,' said Lisa, speaking of Samantha. 'She brought so much happiness and sparkle to the room.

Question: Which conflict had more casualties, the Soviet–Afghan War or the Kashmir conflict? Passage 1:After the conclusion of the Soviet–Afghan War, the fighters of the Sunni Mujahideen and other Islamic militants had successfully removed the Soviet forces from Afghanistan. The military and civil government of Pakistan sought to utilize these militants in the Kashmir conflict against the Indian Armed Forces in accordance with the \\"thousand cuts\\" doctrine so as to \\"bleed India\\", using Pakistan's nuclear arsenal as a shield. In the 1980s cross-border terrorism started in the Kashmir region as armed and well-trained groups of terrorists were infiltrated into India through the border. Pakistan officially maintained that the terrorism in Kashmir was \\"freedom struggle\\" of Kashmiris and Pakistan only provided moral support to them. But this turned out to be inaccurate as Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) stated in the National Assembly of Pakistan that the ISI was sponsoring this support in Kashmir. Pakistan has used the jihadist militias to conduct an asymmetric warfare with India. The militant groups have been used not just as proxies, but predominantly as \\"weapons\\" against India for Pakistan's \\"Bleed India\\" campaign.

He played 48 league and cup games in 1988–89 but broke his leg in a 1–1 draw at Bolton Wanderers on 25 April 1989, and so missed out on the play-off final victory over Bristol Rovers. He managed to recover, but did not re-capture his first team position and in March 1990 was loaned back to Peterborough United, who were then under Mark Lawrenson's stewardship; Peterborough paid £40,000 for his services on a permanent basis the next month.  Passage 3:In 1897, a European exhibitor first screened a selection of silent short films at the Victoria Public Hall in Madras. The films all featured non-fictional subjects; they were mostly photographed records of day-to-day events. In Madras (present-day Chennai), the Electric Theatre was established for the screening of silent films. It was a favourite haunt of the British community in Madras. The theatre was shut down after a few years. This building is now part of a post office complex on Anna Salai (Mount Road). The Lyric Theatre was also built in the Mount Road area. This venue boasted a variety of events, including plays in English, Western classical music concerts, and ballroom dances. Silent films were also screened as an additional attraction. Swamikannu Vincent, an employee of the South Indian Railways in Coimbatore, purchased a film projector and silent films from the Frenchman Du Pont and set up a business as film exhibitor.
