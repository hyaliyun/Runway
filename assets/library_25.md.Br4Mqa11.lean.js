Context: Jenny and I were twins, and we were always close growing up despite our very different personalities. Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about. The McPherson family was old money here going back to when this valley was nothing but orchards. If I said that at one time or another the McPherson family had owned every single square foot of land in our city, I'd probably be exaggerating - but not much. Jenny ran the McPhersons' charitable foundation, which basically meant that not only did they have so much money that they had to start giving it away, but they even had to hire someone else just to get rid of it for them. Question: How structured was Jenny's life in school?

Han was eventually victorious and established the Protectorate of the Western Regions in 60 BC, which dealt with the region's defense and foreign affairs. The Han also expanded southward. The naval conquest of Nanyue in 111 BC expanded the Han realm into what are now modern Guangdong, Guangxi, and northern Vietnam. Yunnan was brought into the Han realm with the conquest of the Dian Kingdom in 109 BC, followed by parts of the Korean Peninsula with the colonial establishments of Xuantu Commandery and Lelang Commandery in 108 BC. In China's first known nationwide census taken in 2 AD, the population was registered as having 57,671,400 individuals in 12,366,470 households.\\"? Answer:","output":"Question: In the passage above, discuss the territorial expansions of the Han dynasty from 115 to 60 BC and the resulting administrative and defense measures implemented by the Han. Additionally, explain the implications of the first nationwide census taken in 2 AD for the size and scope of the Han dynasty. Answer: The passage recounts several key territorial expansions of the Han dynasty from 115 to 60 BC, highlighting their military conquests and establishment of control over new territories. Initially, the Han forces fought against the Xiongnu for control over the oasis city-states in the Tarim Basin. Emerging victorious, they established the Protectorate of the Western Regions in 60 BC, which was responsible for the region's defense and foreign affairs. This strategic move allowed the Han dynasty to protect its newly-acquired territories and ensure their political stability. In addition to their conquests in the Tarim Basin and the establishment of the Protectorate, the passage also notes the Han dynasty's southern expansions. The naval conquest of Nanyue in 111 BC allowed the Han to extend their rule into modern-day Guangdong, Guangxi, and northern Vietnam. They continued their expansion by incorporating Yunnan through the conquest of the Dian Kingdom in 109 BC. The Han dynasty's influence reached as far as parts of the Korean Peninsula, where they established Xuantu Commandery and Lelang Commandery in 108 BC. These colonial establishments served as administrative centers, allowing the Han dynasty to effectively govern and manage their expanding territories. The passage also mentions the first known nationwide census taken in 2 AD, which recorded 57,671,400 individuals in 12,366,470 households. This information is significant because it reflects the enormity of the Han dynasty's population and the vast scope of their territory. The census data provides an insight into the complexity of governing such a large number of people, as well as the extensive resources and infrastructure necessary to maintain the realm's stability and prosperity. As a result, the census highlights the importance of the Han dynasty's territorial expansions and the establishment of various administrative, defense, and foreign affairs measures in maintaining their power and influence across the region."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

He places one in refrigerated storage, but forgot one and left it out on the counter top.  and a hint : Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter. In everyday usage, temperature indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures.  Please answer this question : Which sample will be viable for a shorter time, the one on the counter top or the one in refrigerated storage? A:","output":"The sample that will be viable for a shorter time is the one left on the counter top. The reason is that temperature plays an important role in the stability and longevity of enzymes. At lower temperatures, enzymes can remain functional and stable for longer periods of time.  When Thomas left the sample on the counter top, it was exposed to room temperature, which is generally higher than the temperature inside the refrigerated storage unit. As a result, the enzymes in the sample on the counter top undergo faster degradation and lose their viability at a quicker pace than the sample placed in the refrigerated storage.  On the other hand, the enzymes in the sample placed in refrigerated storage are subjected to a lower temperature, which helps to slow down any chemical reactions and thus preserve the enzyme's stability and functionality for a longer time. This leads to a higher likelihood of the sample remaining viable when compared to the one left on the counter top."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: -  A larva is born - The caterpillar eats constantly until it grows bigger - The caterpillar starts to form a cocoon around itself - The caterpillar becomes a pupa - After some time the cocoon hatches  What might be the last step of the process?

The 2008 and 2011 champion twisted his right ankle in a Davis Cup match last month before appearing to damage it again in last week's Madrid Open defeat to Grigor Dimitrov. At Foro Italico however, Djokovic needed just 70 minutes to rally from an early break to beat qualifier Montanes 6-2 6-3.

The industrial average was first calculated on May 26, 1896. Currently owned by S&P Dow Jones Indices, which is majority owned by S&P Global, it is the most notable of the Dow Averages, of which the first (non-industrial) was first published on February 16, 1885. The averages are named after Dow and one of his business associates, statistician Edward Jones. It is an index that shows how 30 large publicly owned companies based in the United States have traded during a standard trading session in the stock market. It is the second-oldest U.S. market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Average, which was also created by Dow. The \\"Industrial\\" portion of the name is largely historical, as many of the modern 30 components have little or nothing to do with traditional heavy industry. The average is price-weighted, and to compensate for the effects of stock splits and other adjustments, it is currently a scaled average. The value of the Dow is not the actual average of the prices of its component stocks, but rather the sum of the component prices divided by a divisor, which changes whenever one of the component stocks has a stock split or stock dividend, so as to generate a consistent value for the index. Since the divisor is currently less than one, the value of the index is larger than the sum of the component prices. Although the Dow is compiled to gauge the performance of the industrial sector within the American economy, the index's performance continues to be influenced by not only corporate and economic reports, but also by domestic and foreign political events such as war and terrorism, as well as by natural disasters that could potentially lead to economic harm.  - West Germany is the common English name for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG (or \\"RFA\\") in the period between its creation on 23 May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990.

This situation ended when East Germany was dissolved and its five states joined the ten states of the Federal Republic of Germany along with the reunified city-state of Berlin. With the reunification of West and East Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, enlarged now to sixteen states, became known simply as \\"Germany\\".

It survived the closure of the pit in 1993 and relied on sponsorship money from a coal mining company, until 2011. Despite occasional concerns for its future it still continues to make music. Grimethorpe is about 7 miles (11km) from Barnsley. What was that article about?","output":"This article is about the Grimethorpe Colliery Band, which is a special group of musicians. Their story was the inspiration for a movie called Brassed Off in 1996. The band was honored with a plaque for BBC Music Day. They practice in a place called South Yorkshire. The movie Brassed Off was about the band and the closing of a coal mine in their town. The band started in 1917 when people who worked in the coal mine also played music together. Even after the coal mine closed, the band kept playing music and still does today. Grimethorpe is a place near Barnsley."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Process:  - Coal is heated in the boiler - The water tank over the boiler is heated - Creates steam - The steam is funneled to the piston - Piston uses the steam as energy - The piston causes the crankshaft to move.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is no coal available happens, how will it affect MORE power produced by the steam engine.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify the original source of energy in the process - In this case, coal is the energy source for heating the boiler. Step 2: Consider the perturbation - No coal is available. Step 3: Analyze the consequences of the perturbation on the process - Since there is no coal to heat the boiler, the boiler cannot generate heat. Step 4: Evaluate the effect of this consequence on the rest of the process: - The water tank over the boiler will not be heated, so no steam will be produced. - The steam cannot be funneled to the piston since it is not being generated. - The piston will not receive any energy from the steam, so it will not move. - The crankshaft will not receive any motion from the piston and thus will not move. Step 5: Conclusion of the direct or indirect effect of the perturbation - The absence of coal in the process has a direct effect on the power produced by the steam engine. Without coal, no energy can be provided to heat the boiler, leading to a chain reaction affecting all other components in the system. This ultimately results in the steam engine not producing any power."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This article: Following the accession of James VII in 1685, Bruce gradually fell from favour, and was distrusted by the new regime. After the Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William of Orange as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years. Bruce was imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle again in 1708 and was only released a short time before his death, at the beginning of 1710.He was buried in the family mausoleum at Kinross Kirk. The ruins of the church still stand beside Kinross House, the mausoleum remains intact in the churchyard. Dating from 1675 it is probably by William Bruce in design, initially to house his parents. Bruce's surviving account books show purchases of books on music, painting and horticulture, as well as numerous foreign-language works, suggesting that William Bruce was a learned man. He studied horticulture extensively, and applied his knowledge of the subject in his own gardens at Kinross. He was a friend of James Sutherland of the Edinburgh Botanic Garden, and may have known John Evelyn and other English horticulturalists. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers?, what is it ?

Question: Sponges are a source of food for many species of fish, and most sponges are sessile. Given these facts, what can be a source of food for many species of fish among the following options: - Fully cooking the oysters  - Organic compounds  - beef  - fishing poles  - sessile organisms  - barnacles  - grass  - gastropod shells Answer:","output":"To answer the question, let's evaluate the given options step-by-step and relate them to the facts provided. 1. Fully cooking the oysters: This option is irrelevant as the question is about a natural food source, not a prepared dish. 2. Organic compounds: While organic compounds are essential for life, the question is more specific about a particular type of food source. 3. Beef: Beef is not a natural food source for most species of fish. 4. Fishing poles: This option is an inanimate object and not a food source. 5. Sessile organisms: The fact is given that most sponges are sessile and they are a source of food for many species of fish. This option is relevant and directly connected to the facts. 6. Barnacles: Barnacles are sessile organisms, so they could potentially be a food source for some fish species. However, the question is focused on sponges. 7. Grass: Grass is not a common food source for many species of fish, especially if they eat sponges. 8. Gastropod shells: This option indicates the shells, not the gastropods themselves, which makes it irrelevant as a food source.

Article: Almost all of the composers who are described in music textbooks on classical music and whose works are widely performed as part of the standard concert repertoire are male composers, even though there has been a large number of women composers throughout the classical music period. Musicologist Marcia Citron has asked \\"[w]hy is music composed by women so marginal to the standard 'classical' repertoire?\\" Citron \\"examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received 'canon' of performed musical works.\\" She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote art songs for performance in small recitals rather than symphonies intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers.

Staff member at Manchester Piccadilly railway station raised the alarm. Article:","output":"Title: \\"Train Driver Pleads Guilty to Drink-Driving Charges Following Alert from Manchester Station Staff Member\\" Introduction: A train driver from Manchester was charged with drink-driving, following concerns from a railway station staff member who noticed her slurred speech. Felicity Hall, 46, pleaded guilty in court, bringing to light the importance of vigilance when it comes to the safety of passengers and fellow staff members in the railway industry. Main Body: Felicity Hall, a 46-year-old train driver from Horwich, Manchester, admitted to charges of drink-driving after an incident at Manchester Piccadilly railway station. The case came to light when a staff member observed Hall slurring her words before she was scheduled to drive passengers. The concerned staff member took swift action, raising the alarm with management. Upon receiving reports of Felicity's condition, the railway officials promptly removed Hall from her duties. Following an investigation, which involved assessing her blood alcohol content, it was confirmed that the train driver was indeed above the legal limit to operate a vehicle. Consequently, she was charged with drink-driving. Felicity Hall quickly entered a guilty plea in court, sparing the prosecution from having to present their case and saving time for all parties involved. While the sentence is yet to be determined, the charge of drink-driving holds severe consequences. This case serves as a stark reminder to railway professionals of the perils of operating any motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other substances. The staff member at Manchester Piccadilly station played a crucial role in preventing a potentially hazardous situation. Had they not been diligent and observant, Felicity Hall would have been operating a train carrying numerous passengers while being impaired by alcohol, increasing the risk of accidents or negligence-related incidents.

Write a summary based on this article: Salesmen in shirts with an image of Russian President Vladimir Putin wait for customers at GUM (the State Department Store) in Moscow, Russia, Monday, Oct. 6, 2014. Souvenirs and clothing featuring Putin... (Associated Press)      MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin is celebrating his 62nd birthday in the wilderness of Siberia as supporters from across Russia create tributes in his honor.      Putin celebrated his birthday Tuesday in the Siberian forest some \\"300-400 kilometers (185-250 miles) from the nearest populated area,\\" his press secretary told Russian news media. Putin has often brandished his tough-guy image with widely publicized wilderness romps during which he hunts, fishes or rides horses — often while shirtless.      In Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, thousands carried a 600-meter-long (650 yards) Russian flag through the streets. Others dressed in the red, white and blue of the Russian tricolor walked through the streets as an enormous human flag, many of them holding portraits of the Russian leader over their heads. Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya's president, wrote on his official Instagram account that there were 100,000 participants.      Russian news websites published photographs from a one-day exhibition in Moscow titled \\"The 12 Labors of Vladimir Putin,\\" in which Putin is depicted as Hercules — battling Western nations disguised as serpents and monsters or taming an ox bearing the symbol of Crimea, the Ukrainian region annexed by Russia in March.      Putin's always-high ratings have skyrocketed this year as he responded to a pro-European uprising in Ukraine by seizing Crimea, and reacted defiantly to Western sanctions.      His approval rating remains at 86 percent according to the independent Levada Center, which conducted a poll in September with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percent.      Souvenirs decorated with Putin's face have become best-sellers on Red Square, while Russian designers have made him the theme of pricey T-shirts and sweaters.      Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, congratulated Putin on his birthday and said his tenure in office had become \\"an integral part of national history.\\"      However, as the value of the ruble sinks under pressure from sanctions, some online commentators were less enthusiastic: \\"The dollar is 40 (rubles), the Euro is 50 (rubles), and Putin is 62,\\" was one joke that spread across the web.      ___      Musa Sadulayev in Grozny, Chechnya contributed reporting. ||||| Photo: Vasily Maximov/AFP/Getty Images      For his birthday, President Obama only got a photo essay of the past year’s events posted to the White House website. Russian president Vladimir Putin, on the other hand, got a whole exhibition comparing him to the Greek mythical hero Heracles (known further west as Hercules). No joke — it’s called “The 12 Labors of Putin.”      The exhibit was held on Monday by members of a pro-Putin Facebook group in Moscow’s “Red October” showspace, formerly the site of a chocolate factory by the same name. Putin turns 62 on Tuesday.      “Interestingly, the events of the ancient legends about the mythological hero Hercules can be relayed onto our days, when the three-headed dog Cerberus reminds us of the USA, annihilation of the Stymphalian Birds — of stopping the air raids in Syria and the cleaning of the Augean stables is fighting corruption,” the organizers wrote on Facebook, apparently in earnest.      The organizer at the event itself appeared to be a young, bearded man named Mikhail Antonov, whose T-shirt was almost obscured by his blazer. Almost, but not quite — it appeared to read “Vladimir Putin” and have a thumbs-up sign underneath.      куратор выставки о подвигах Путина pic.twitter.com/uzoQT4pfgk — Feldman (@EvgenyFeldman) October 6, 2014      He said that members of the Facebook group often sent in artwork depicting the president, and they decided to do a thematic show for the leader’s birthday.

'I'm happy that I'm going back home. to see my doctors in Mexico,' Emily, wearing a bright pink hat, told. NBC. 'My mom's only trying to save my life,' she added. 'She doesn't. want me to die in a hospital. So I was happy that she took that. decision.' Emily's parents say they felt pressured over health care insurance and mounting costs at the Phoenix hospital. They also claimed that their daughter, who contracted an infection at. the hospital that led to her arm being amputated, was 'threatened and. intimidated' by doctors there. But Emily's doctors in Phoenix are concerned that the decision to remove. her - especially with the catheter still her in heart - could endanger. her life. Pressure:Emily's parents say they felt pressured over health care insurance and mounting costs at the Phoenix hospital. Concern: The father of 11-year-old Emily Bracamontes shows a picture of her in a hospital bed in Mexico. On the move: Leukemia patient Emily is seen with her mother on Phoenix Children's Hospital CCTV last Wednesday shortly before she disappeared. 'We steadfastly disagree with the assertions brought forth regarding the. quality of care Emily recieved,' the hospital said in a statement.

'We have been unable to verify anything the family has said regarding. medical treatment to Emily,' the police department said. 'The family has. been uncooperative.' Mr Bracamontes, showing a cellphone picture of Emily in a Mexican hospital bed, told NBC: 'They [doctors] told my wife that she already had it [the infection]. That’s not true. Her arm was healthy.' Emily's doctors in Phoenix believe that the catheter. placed in her heart could. cause a deadly infection if she is not returned to have it removed. Following Emily's disappearance, Phoenix Police's Steve Martos said: 'If she contracts an infection, it really could just be a. matter of days that could result in the young girl's death. It's. pretty serious.' Camera footage shows Mrs Bracamontes, 35,. pushing an IV stand through the hospital's hallways while her daughter,. whose bandaged arm is visible, can be seen following her.

Mrs Bracamontes said she had no choice but to take her daughter from the hospital because her husband's insurance is running out. Mr Bracamontes said Phoenix Hospital was putting pressure on the family over rising medical bills. The couple have not been charged with a crime so far but police said charges were still possible for negligence or abuse. United States Customs and Border Patrol Officers stopped Luis Bracamontes as he tried to cross into America from Mexico on Saturday. Putting a stop to treatment: Emily's mother removed a IV drip from a catheter in her heart and helped her change clothes before leading her out of the hospital. VIDEO: Caught on camera: Mom kidnaps sick daughter from hospital. The man was quizzed about the whereabouts of his daughter Emily, but denied any involvement in her disappearance. Police said that Mr Bracamontes was not driving the same black Ford van in which Emily left the hospital in when they stopped him. They have described the family. as 'nomadic' and without a. permanent residence, but said they have relatives in Arizona, California. and Mexico. Concerns: Doctors are worried Emily could die from an infection of the heart if the catheter is not medically removed.","output":"This story is about an 11-year-old girl named Emily who has leukemia, which is a sickness that affects her blood. Emily's mom took her from the hospital to go to Mexico for treatment, even though she still had a catheter in her heart. A catheter is a small tube that helps get medicine to the right place in the body. Emily's mom said her daughter is getting better and she's happy about the decision to take her to Mexico. However, doctors at the hospital are worried because leaving the catheter in her heart could be dangerous.

Question: Question: What did Angier use the machine to create? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Prestige Context: The Prestige begins with shots of several dozen top hats inexplicably strewn about in a forest.Cutter (Michael Caine), in voiceover, explains the three parts of a magic trick while performing a disappearing bird trick for a little girl. Part one is the pledge, where the magician shows you something ordinary, like a bird. Part two is the turn, where he does something extraordinary, like make the bird disappear. But this isn't enough. There always has to be a third act, the prestige, where you have a twist, and bring the bird back. Only then will the audience applaud.Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), stage name \\"the Great Danton,\\" attempts a transporting trick that involves walking under a giant electrical machine with a Tesla coil and then disappearing through a trapdoor. Except that he falls straight into a giant tank of water that has been placed under the stage, and is automatically locked inside. A man in the audience, who we shortly learn is fellow magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), stage name \\"the Professor,\\" forces his way beneath the stage in time to see Angier drown.After this introduction, we follow three timelines at once. In the present day (19th century England), Borden is on trial for murdering Angier, who we learn was his greatest rival. Cutter is revealed to be Angier's engineer, the man who builds the machinery for his tricks, and the little girl is Borden's daughter Jess (Samantha Mahurin).Cutter confides to the judge in a private meeting that the machine Angier was using wasn't built by him, but by \\"a wizard,\\" and it legitimately did what it appeared to do.The trial does not go well for Borden, and he faces execution. Later, in jail, Borden is approached by the solicitor for a collector, Lord Caldlow, who is interested in buying his secrets, particularly the secret of Borden's famous \\"Transported Man\\" trick. The same collector has also bought all of Angier's equipment and props. When Borden refuses, the solicitor threatens that Jess is in danger of being declared an indigent orphan and... Answer:","output":"In the movie The Prestige, Angier (Hugh Jackman) uses a machine to create duplicates of himself in order to perform a seemingly impossible magic trick called the \\"Transported Man.\\" The machine was built by Nikola Tesla, a real-life inventor, and electrical engineer, who is portrayed by David Bowie in the film. In the \\"Transported Man\\" trick, Angier disappears on one side of the stage and instantly reappears on the other side. However, instead of merely creating the illusion of transport, the machine that Tesla had built actually worked by creating a duplicate of Angier. One Angier would go through the trapdoor and into a tank of water below the stage, where he would drown. Simultaneously, the duplicate Angier would appear on the other side of the stage, thus completing the trick and receiving applause from the audience. Angier's use of the machine to create duplicates of himself is an essential plot point in The Prestige, as it drives the intense rivalry between him and fellow magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). The competition between the two magicians escalates, leading to Angier framing Borden for his own murder by drowning, which eventually results in Borden's execution. In the end, it is revealed that Borden also had a \\"prestige\\" of his own - he had a secret twin brother, who had helped him perform their version of the \\"Transported Man\\" trick. Ultimately, Angier's obsession with besting his rival and achieving the perfect magic trick leads to tragic consequences for both magicians. As they continually try to outdo each other, their lives become entangled with deceit, loss, and revenge. The Prestige serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of ambition and obsession, as well as the power of secrets in the art of illusion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn’t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel. Now I’m considering finally getting my license (considering - I still don’t like being behind the wheel), I don’t double over in white hot pain randomly anymore, and when I do get a cluster headache, I can still function. It almost sounds a little silly, but really, they were crippling, and being able to work through them on my own? It’s the greatest gift I’ve given to myself.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in...

More crews arrived on Monday to skim oil from the surface of the water and place protective booms along the shore.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Oil Spill Threatens Shorebird Habitat and Shuts Down Houston Ship Channel On Saturday, a disastrous event struck the Houston Ship Channel, as a barge carrying a staggering 900,000 gallons of oil met with a catastrophic collision with a ship. This unfortunate occurrence led to the spillage of approximately 170,000 gallons of dense, viscous oil all across the bustling waterway, forcing it to shut down, much to the chagrin of those who depended on it for their livelihood. Monday saw an influx of additional crews, who were sent to the scene to skim the oil from the surface of the water and place protective booms along the shoreline in an attempt to prevent further environmental damage. The focus of this cleanup effort resulted from fears expressed by various environmental groups concerning the welfare of a vital shorebird habitat located approximately 45 miles southeast of Houston. The company that owns the barge has come forward to accept responsibility for the grievous spill and will shoulder the costs associated with the cleanup operation. In the meantime, comparisons have been drawn to the infamous Exxon oil tanker disaster that occurred 25 years ago, during which 11 million gallons of oil were spilled into the waters of Prince William Sound, Alaska. To this day, that area still feels the profound and lasting effects of the pollution that came about as a result of this incident. While the Houston Ship Channel spill may not be as extensive as the Exxon case, it remains a solemn reminder of the potential hazards posed by humanity's reliance on oil and the transportation methods used to carry it around the globe. Moving forward, it is essential to diligently monitor the situation in the Houston area, particularly as it pertains to the ecological impact on the shorebird habitat and the overall wellbeing of the marine ecosystem. Additionally, the disruption caused by the channel's closure will inevitably have economic implications, and the swiftest return to normalcy should be pursued by the responsible company's reparation efforts. In conclusion, the oil spill in the Houston Ship Channel represents not just an isolated accident, but a crucial reminder of the environmental and economic consequences that go hand in hand with the oil industry. Society's ongoing endeavours to find more efficient and less hazardous transportation methods, as well as cleaner alternative energy sources, remain paramount in mitigating the likelihood of future disasters on this scale. This incident serves as a stark cautionary tale—a serious call to action for corporations and governments alike—to safeguard the precious natural resources at stake, all around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The most dominant of these was the Cathedral of Saint Martin, inside the old Roman fortress. The construction of the present Gothic building was begun in 1254 after an earlier romanesque construction had been badly damaged by fire. The choir and transept were finished from 1320 and were followed then by the ambitious Dom tower. The last part to be constructed was the central nave, from 1420. By that time, however, the age of the great cathedrals had come to an end and declining finances prevented the ambitious project from being finished, the construction of the central nave being suspended before the planned flying buttresses could be finished. Besides the cathedral there were four collegiate churches in Utrecht: St. Salvator's Church (demolished in the 16th century), on the Dom square, dating back to the early 8th century. Saint John (Janskerk), originating in 1040; Saint Peter, building started in 1039 and Saint Mary's church building started around 1090 (demolished in the early 19th century, cloister survives). Besides these churches the city housed St. Paul's Abbey, the 15th-century beguinage of St. Nicholas, and a 14th-century chapter house of the Teutonic Knights. When was construction completed on the Cathedral of Saint Martin? What is the answer?

Answer the following question: When I first started out in the field, I was working at a private hospital in the locked psychiatric unit, and there was a call from one of the med floors requiring someone from our unit to assist with a problem of a young man who had bitten through his cotton restraints on his wrists. They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness. I was a trained therapist, and in this situation, I was unable to do anything, and was rendered powerless.

But there is no place for London Irish duo Blair Cowan and Sean Maitland, who both withdrew from the previous squad. Dunbar comes in as cover for Scott after proving his fitness following a thigh strain suffered in January. Hooker Brown has played twice since his return from injury, while scrum-half Pyrgos was back in action on Sunday. Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend hailed the performance of Pyrgos in the 27-20 win over Cardiff Blues in the Pro12. \\"I thought Henry Pyrgos was outstanding,\\" he told BBC Scotland. \\"To be out of the game for four months and really add tempo to our game, make the right decisions of where to attack and the players followed him and we got a couple of cracking tries in there.\\" Cowan and Maitland will be notable absentees from the Scotland squad that will gather on Tuesday at Murrayfield ahead of Sunday's Six Nations game against France. Loose forward Cowan missed the victory over Italy through concussion, while winger Maitland dropped out of the squad with a thigh injury. Both returned to London Irish for treatment but were deemed fit enough to play in the 47-20 defeat by Leicester in the English Premiership, a game that took place 24 hours after Scotland's win in Rome. However, Scotland coach Vern Cotter has decided against recalling either player after the likes Ryan Wilson and Tim Visser, who had returned to the squad after recovering from their own injuries, took their chance to impress. Dunbar, Pyrgos and Brown had missed the start of the tournament through injury. Pygos, who captained Scotland for the first time last year in the absence of Greig Laidlaw, had wrist surgery after picking up his injury in October. Brown, who takes the place of Edinburgh hooker George Turner, suffered an ankle injury at the same time. He returned to action along with Dunbar in matches against Dragons and Cardiff.

Question: How many chopping blows does it take to kill Doyle? Movie title: Sling Blade Movie plot: Karl Childers (Billy Bob Thornton) is an intellectually disabled Arkansas man who has been in the custody of the state mental hospital since the age of 12 for having killed his mother and her lover. Although thoroughly institutionalized, Karl is deemed fit to be released into the outside world. Prior to his release, he is interviewed by a local college newspaper reporter, to whom he recounts committing the murders with a Kaiser blade, saying, \\"Some folks call it a sling blade. I call it a kaiser blade.\\" Karl says he thought the man was raping his mother. When he discovered that his mother was a willing participant in the affair, he killed her also. Thanks to the doctor in charge of his institutionalization (James Hampton), Karl lands a job at a repair shop in the small town where he was born and raised. He befriends 12-year-old Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black) and shares some of the details of his past, including the killings. Frank reveals that his father was killed - hit by a train - leaving him and his mother on their own. He later admits that he lied, and that his father committed suicide. Frank introduces Karl to his mother, Linda (Natalie Canerday), as well as her gay friend, Vaughan Cunningham (John Ritter), the manager of the dollar store where she is employed. Despite Vaughan's concerns about Karl's history in the mental hospital, Linda allows him to move into her garage, which angers Linda's abusive alcoholic boyfriend, Doyle Hargraves (Dwight Yoakam). Karl bonds with Linda, who makes him biscuits to eat, and also with Vaughan, who tells Karl that a gay man and a mentally challenged man face similar obstacles of intolerance and ridicule in small-town America. Karl quickly becomes a father figure to Frank, who misses his father and despises Doyle. Karl is haunted by the task given to him by his parents when he was six or eight years old to dispose of his premature, unwanted, newborn brother. He visits his father (Robert Duvall), who has become a mentally unbalanced hermit living in the dilapidated home...","output":"In the movie \\"Sling Blade\\" directed by Billy Bob Thornton, the character Doyle Hargraves is portrayed as an abusive, alcoholic boyfriend to Linda, Frank's mother. Doyle is a source of distress and discomfort for both Linda and her son, Frank.  The main character of the movie, Karl Childers, who is intellectually disabled, does end up killing Doyle but not without significant consequences both morally and legally. The decision to kill Doyle is one that Karl doesn't take lightly. It is informed by his deep affection for Linda and Frank, and his desire to protect them from Doyle's abuse.  The act itself is accomplished using the same type of weapon that was used earlier in the film and mentioned in your film proposal, the \\"Kaiser blade\\" or as Karl calls it, the \\"sling blade.\\" Remember, Karl is no stranger to the violent use of such implements, having already killed his mother and her lover when he was younger. In terms of the number of blows it took to kill Doyle, the film isn't explicitly clear. The scene is highly intense and emotionally charged, and doesn't focus on the gory details. Karl viciously swings the blade, perhaps multiple times, until Doyle is dead. The act is not valorized; it is portrayed as gruesome and devastating. So, as an investor, you may want to consider the impact this violent scene and the overarching theme of violence might have on potential audiences. On the one hand, the intensity of these scenes might be off-putting to some. However, others might appreciate the exploration of complex themes such as morality, mental illness, and the lengths one might go to protect those they care about. You should also consider the performances by notable actors like Billy Bob Thornton and Dwight Yoakam, which may draw in audiences out of appreciation for their work. Be sure to weigh these factors carefully, knowing that the ultimate return on investment would depend on the film’s market acceptance and performance, beyond the obscurity of how many blows were needed for Karl to kill Doyle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dogs have an amazing ability to do whatever needs to be done, and will still wag their tails afterward.The following are some wonderful dog stories to share. Teka Not too many people know what to do when someone has a heart attack other than call 911.But Teka, an Australian Cattle Dog, skipped the phone call when her owner suffered a severe heart attack.Not only did she bark in his face to bring him back to consciousness and run outside barking to attract attention, but she climbed on his chest and jumped up and down. When medics arrived, they couldn't say whether or not Teka's unusual version of CPR had any effect, but her owner feels grateful to her.And her efforts didn't go unnoticed: Teka was given a Purple Cross medal for bravery by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Zoey Size is no barrier to a dog determined to protect her family and Zoey, a 5-pound chihuahua puppy from Colorado, is living proof. She made headlines in 2007 after saving a one-year-old from the bite of a large rattlesnake. Zoey, who weighed only five pounds, was just 10 months old at the time, but she rose to the occasion when needed.One-year-old Booker West was playing in his grandparent's backyard when a rattlesnake struck at him! Zoey sprang into action, putting herself between the snake and the kid.She got several snakebites and was rushed to an animal hospital.Her head swelled and she almost lost an eye, but with proper treatment, Zoey made a full recovery. Hachiko Hachiko, an Akita, was brought to Tokyo in 1924 by Ueno, a college professor. Every day Hachiko waited for him to return from work, meeting him at the train station at four. The following year, Ueno suffered a stroke at work and died.Unaware of his death, the dog still returned to the train station every day to await his owner.He became such a familiar presence there, in fact, that the station master set out food for the dog and gave him a bed in the station.Even so, every day at four, he hopefully waited by the tracks as the train pulled in, searching through the crowd for his master.Every day.For ten years. Upon his death in 1935, Hachiko was a national celebrity and a bronze statue of him was installed at Shibuya Station as a tribute. Stubby In 1917 Stubby was adopted by a soldier, who trained him to drill and salute. His owner developed such a strong connection with him that when he was sent to war in Europe, he took Stubby along, hiding him on the ship bound for France. Stubby proved a war star.He served 18 months in the front lines and took part in seventeen battles.He kept watch, warned the soldiers of surprise attacks, and saved the wounded in no man's land.He once found a German spy and held him by the seat of the pants until American soldiers arrived.

A local state of emergency has been declared in a western Manitoba municipality after homes in Ochre Beach were destroyed and seriously damaged by a wave of lake ice.      Area officials told CBC News the wind pushed built-up ice off Dauphin Lake on Friday evening and caused it to pile up in the community, located on the lake's southern shore.      The piles of ice, which were more than nine metres tall in some cases, destroyed at least six homes and cottages, according to the Rural Municipality of Ochre River.      Another 14 homes suffered extensive damage, with some structures knocked off their foundations.      Clayton Watts, Ochre River's deputy reeve, said it's a miracle no one was hurt.      He told CBC News one minute people were watching hockey in their living rooms, the next they heard something that sounded like a freight train near their homes.      \\"It happened so quick,\\" said Watts. \\"And you can't predict it — not like water that slowly comes up.\\"      Watts said there are several cabins that were completely flattened by the wall of ice that came at them.      \\"The ice is over top of them, they've been crushed, there's nothing left,\\" he said.      \\"There are other cabins that have been knocked right off their footings,\\" he continued. \\"There's ice right over top of some of the cabins, coming over the roof on the other side.\\"      According to Environment Canada winds were registered at about 80 km/h in the area Friday night.      No insurance coverage for ice damage      Dennis Stykalo, whose cottage is full of ice after Friday night's wind storm, told CBC News his insurance does not cover damage done by ice.      He said he's devastated after the event — he can't even get inside to recover his valuables.      \\"You know you've got cement, concrete blocks, and steel and the ice goes through it like its just a toothpick,\\" said Stykalo. \\"It just shows the power. There is nothing you can do, you just get out of the way and just watch.\\"      CBC News also contacted an insurance company in Winnipeg who said generally coverage is not provided for damage to homes caused by shoreline ice build up or water-borne ice.      Same area hit by flood in 2011      The damage is even more traumatic for some, he added, as many of the homes in the area were ruined by flooding in 2011.      Dozens of properties in Ochre Beach and Dauphin Beach were evacuated due to extremely high lake levels that spring.      \\"They're devastated. Most of these people were hit pretty hard during the flood,\\" said Watts.      \\"Most of them were just back to the stage where they were back living in their homes again. And now this has happened. So they're pretty devastated right now.\\"      Ochre Beach is about 300 kilometres northwest of Winnipeg and 20 kilometres east of Dauphin. ||||| Hey there, time traveller!      This article was published 11/5/2013 (1341 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.      First came the ice and destruction.      Then the volunteers cometh.      730 CKDM      730 CKDM      730 CKDM      Ice from Dauphin Lake smashed into this home at Ochre Beach Friday. About 23 homes were destroyed and 27 affected. No injuries were reported.      Hundreds of local residents arrived by the dozens on Saturday with backhoes and bulldozers and wheelbarrows — helping to chip away massive ice floes that on Friday night destroyed 12 homes and damaged another 15 along Ochre Beach, located 20 kilometres east of Dauphin.      \\"Today was just a work day,\\" RM of Ochre River deputy reeve Clayton Watts told the Free Press Saturday night. \\"They got a lot done. They had an unbelievable amount of people working out there; all kinds of friends and people from around other beaches.\\"      Or total strangers.      \\"Everybody was pitching in to help them (residents) make it through the day,\\" Watts said. \\"It was a good community effort. It’s typical. Everybody just helps out.\\"      According to provincial Emergency Measures Organization officials, a total of seven permanent homes were literally crushed by the ice that rose up within minutes from Lake Dauphin around supper time on Friday, pushed by north winds gusting up to 60 kilometres per hour.      Doug Davis had just taken a shower and was about to sit down on his couch and relax at his home along Ochre Beach on Friday night.      Then he heard the ice coming.      \\"All of a sudden,\\" said Davis’s wife, Elaine, \\"that was it.\\"      Within the next five minutes, a wall of ice rose from the lake so powerful that it plowed though the Davis’s two-storey home, pushing furniture from one bedroom into another. It pushed the bathroom tub and vanity into the hallway.      The Davis family wasn’t alone. In all, 27 homes and cottages were damaged or destroyed – although no injuries were reported.      A local state of emergency was declared in the municipality, and residents along the beach were evacuated on Friday night.      The provincial Emergency Social Services were called to the scene Friday night to assist residents in finding temporary lodging. Structural experts from the Office of the Fire Commissioner were also on hand to determine whether some residents could be allowed to attempt clean up or collect belongings. On Saturday, the residents and volunteers were allowed to return to the area and begin digging the ice on homes that were declared structurally stable.      All for a natural event that was over in just 15 minutes.      \\"They (homeowners) heard it before they saw it (the ice) coming up their decks,\\" Watts said. \\"Then it came right in their front windows. It was just a matter of minutes. Fortunately, no one was hurt. We were very lucky.\\"      On Saturday morning, Watts was standing on an adjacent beach, looking over the damage.      \\"The ice is up taller than the cottages and homes,\\" he said. \\"It kind of dwarfs them.\\"      \\"This is nothing you can predict,\\" Watts said. \\"Water, you can see it coming up.

Article: A few years ago, pop poets such as Murray Lachlan Young began to set poetry to rock music with some surprising results. People thought that poetry was the new rock 'n' roll. However, despite the brief popularity of a few pop poets, poetry and pop music didn't seem to mix. But are they really so different? If you look back at the origins of poetry, there is a strong connection between poems and popular music. In Greek mythology, for example, the muse   Erato is pictured with a lyre   in her hand, and looks just like the ancestor of the modern rock star with his electric guitar. In addition, the poets Shelley and Byron were as famous in the nineteenth century as the pop stars of today. But despite their common origins, there are many differences between poetry and pop music. Pop songs are always written for a public performance, whereas poetry often isn't. And the lyrics in pop songs sometimes have less rhythm than those in poetry. This is because the music provides the rhythm rather than the words. Pop lyrics are also simpler and often keep on saying the same thing. This repetition works well in a performance and means that pop songs are easier for people to sing and learn by heart. Both songs and poems tell a story or talk about feelings. Songs in particular deal with the different stages in a relationship, such as falling in love or breaking up. The words and ideas in songs are usually easier to understand than those in \\"serious\\" poetry. However, talented performers like Paul McCartney, or newer stars like Robbe Williams, often give simple songs more expression when they perform them. And some of the best lines from pop lyrics are as beautiful as poetry. So although pop music and poetry have many differences, they do have one important thing in common: the power to make us think about how we feel. Question: According to the article, the difference between poetry and pop songs is that   _  . - there is more rhythm in pop songs than poetry - pop songs are more difficult to understand than poetry - some words in pop songs are repeated over and over again - pop songs are not always performed before audience","output":"According to the article, the difference between poetry and pop songs is that some words in pop songs are repeated over and over again."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Shenouda endured more than three years of exile in the 1980s but later rarely fought with Mubarak's regime [EPA]      Egypt's Coptic Pope Shenouda III, the leader of the Middle East's largest Christian minority, has died at 88, state television and church sources said.      The cause of death was not immediately clear, but for years Shenouda had suffered from back and liver problems, and health issues forced him to cancel his weekly sermon on Wednesday.      Named pope in 1971, Shenouda led the Coptic Orthodox Church through 40 years of quiet expansion, including a strong growth in North America, but came under criticism in his native Egypt during the later years of his papacy.      Most of the church's more than 10 million members are in Egypt, where Copts are believed to make up around 10 per cent of the population.      For most Egyptian Copts, Shenouda was the only spiritual leader they have ever known, a beloved figure who nonetheless became controversial for rarely opposing a government that was often accused of promoting Muslims' rights over those of Copts.      Naguib Sawiris, a liberal Coptic Christian political leader and billionaire telecommunications tycoon, wrote on Twitter that Shenouda had been \\"an icon of wisdom, intellect and knowledge, a man of courage and honour\\".      Exile and return            Shenouda, who worked as a journalist before spending years as a monk and being elected pope, entered his tenure with a political agenda, set on reforming the church from within, Al Jazeera's Sherine Tadros reported from Cairo.      In the 1980s, Shenouda spent more than three years in exile in a desert monastery after former president Anwar Sadat stripped him of his powers by decree.            At the time, Shenouda had been pressing for more rights for the Coptic community and trying to preserve his congregation from escalating attacks by Muslim extremists.      Former president Hosni Mubarak canceled Sadat's decree in 1985, and Shenouda returned to lead Christmas Mass before a crowd of thousands in Cairo's St Mark's Cathedral.      After returning, Shenouda oversaw the growth of the church in the United States and South America. He emphasised Christian unity and dialogue between churches throughout the world.      'Beloved children'            In recent years, some Egyptian Copts had begun to express criticism of Shenouda for not speaking out on Coptic rights, particularly as sectarian violence seemed to increase.      \\"It was really after the former president Hosni Mubarak then took power that you saw a more cordial relationship ... and at that point people began to criticize the pope,\\" Tadros said.      Although Shenouda gave limited praise to Egypt's revolution, he often encouraged protesters to go home, both before and after Mubarak's fall, and he pleaded for stability.      The later part of his papacy was marked by co-operation with Mubarak and, after the revolt, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. When sectarian clashes began to erupt after Mubarak's removal, including church burnings throughout the country, Shenouda praised the military leadership for helping to rebuild.      But in October, when soldiers brutally dispersed a Coptic protest outside state media headquarters, leaving at least 26 people dead, Shenouda declared that those killed were martyrs and blamed the military for the violence.      \\"These martyrs are our beloved children and their blood does not come cheap,\\" he said.            \\"I, along with all the bishops, priests and monks, will pray for them. And we know that God will forgive their sins.\\" ||||| Image caption Pope Shenouda III led Egypt's Coptic Christian church for more than three decades      Egypt's Coptic Christian Pope Shenouda III has died at the age of 88, state television has announced.      The leader of the Middle East's largest Christian minority was reported to suffer from cancer that had spread to several organs.      Coptic Christians make up 10% of Egypt's population of 80 million.      After attacks on Coptic Christians in recent years, Pope Shenouda urged officials to do more to address the community's concerns.      Pope Shenouda led the church, one of the oldest Christian communities in the world, for four decades.      His political adviser Hany Aziz told Reuters news agency that Shenouda \\"died from complications in health and from old age\\".      He had returned recently to Egypt after seeking treatment abroad.      Pope Shenouda was born Nazeer Gayed into a devout Christian family on 3 August 1923 in Asyut, Upper Egypt, and became a monk in 1954, taking the name Shenouda.      After Pope Cyril died in 1971, Shenouda was enthroned as Pope of Alexandria.      He fell out with President Anwar Sadat, who in 1981 sent him into internal exile. He was allowed back to Cairo by President Hosni Mubarak four years later.      The BBC's Jon Leyne in Cairo says Pope Shenouda sought to protect his Christian community amid a Muslim population by striking a conservative tone and lending tacit support to President Mubarak's rule.      Whoever succeeds him now faces the task of reassuring the Coptic community as the Islamists of the Muslim Brotherhood look on the verge of sharing power in Egypt for the first time, our correspondent says.      Many younger Copts will now be looking for a leader who can help redefine their community's role in a rapidly changing post-Mubarak Egypt, our correspondent adds. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Pope Shenouda III, the leader of Egypt's Coptic Christian Church and the largest Christian minority in the Middle East, passed away at age 88.

On the other hand, Kettle Foods supplied non-GMO potato seeds to their farmers. They wanted to see how customers react to their non-GMO products, mostly chips.  But I can use this background: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination...  What is an answer for this question: Would Kettle Foods potatoes be less or more herbicide tolerant than PepsiCo'? Answer:","output":"Kettle Foods potatoes would likely be less herbicide tolerant than PepsiCo's potatoes. This is because Kettle Foods supplies non-GMO potato seeds to their farmers, while PepsiCo supplies GMO potato seeds. GMO crops, such as those used by PepsiCo, often have enhanced traits such as herbicide tolerance, allowing them to withstand exposure to herbicides without being harmed. In contrast, non-GMO crops, like those used by Kettle Foods, have not been genetically modified for such traits and may be more susceptible to damage from herbicides."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Launched on August 1, 1981, the channel originally aired music videos as guided by television personalities known as \\"video jockeys\\" (VJs). In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years.  - The PlayStation 3 (abbreviated as PS3) is a home video game console developed by Sony Computer Entertainment.

Revenge may be all in the anticipation \\"Sweet is revenge,\\" Lord Byron wrote in \\"Don Juan\\" â and how could it be otherwise? Who wouldn't enjoy getting even with a sadistic boss, a two-faced friend who slept with your spouse or that teacher who had it in for your child for no good reason? Most of us have revenge fantasies, human behavior researchers say, and nearly everyone believes that punishing someone who did him wrong would feel tremendously satisfying. But new studies suggest the reality of revenge is far different. Acting on vengeful thoughts often isn't nearly as gratifying as expected and â surprisingly â can even make people feel worse. Still, the delicious pleasure anticipated from taking revenge is such a powerful drive that it appears to be hard-wired in the brain. University of Zurich scientists found that merely contemplating revenge stimulates a region of the brain called the dorsal striatum, which is known to become active in anticipation of a reward or pleasure, such as making money or eating good food. In the study, 14 volunteers earned money if they cooperated with one another in games. A double-crosser pretended to cooperate but secretly took an unfair share of the cash. Victims could retaliate by imposing a fine on the betrayer, though they sometimes had to spend their own money to carry out the punishment. All 14 volunteers chose to retaliate if they could do so at no charge, and 12 out of 14 did so even if it cost them additional money. When they decided to seek revenge, the dorsal striatum lighted up on a PET scan. Those whose brains were activated the most were willing to spend the most to punish the double-crosser, notes study co-author Ernst Fehr, whose research was published in Science in 2004. It's not surprising that our brains signal \\"pleasure\\" at the prospect of punishing someone who wronged us, says Michael McCullough, a University of Miami psychologist and author of \\"Beyond Revenge: The Evolution of the Forgiveness Instinct.\\" Although it can be a misguided, costly craving in the modern world, evolutionary psychologists believe the thirst for revenge ensured our ancestors' survival â retaliation was the only way for victims to deter aggressors from harming them or their tribes in the future. \\"Revenge burrowed into the brain's reward system â it hitched a ride on our neurons â because it really was effective at deterring future harm,\\" says McCullough, who notes that revenge is ubiquitous throughout the animal kingdom. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"1. Most people have revenge fantasies, and research suggests that acting on vengeful thoughts isn't as satisfying as expected and can even make people feel worse. 2. The anticipation of revenge appears to be hard-wired in the brain. The dorsal striatum, a region associated with pleasure and reward, becomes active when contemplating revenge. 3. In a study where participants could retaliate against a double-crosser, most chose to do so even at a cost, showing a strong desire for revenge. 4.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios?  The company, retaining the title \\"Sadler's Wells Opera\\", opened at the Coliseum on 21 August 1968, with a new production of Mozart's Don Giovanni, directed by Sir John Gielgud. Though this production was not well received, the company rapidly established itself with a succession of highly praised productions of other works. Arlen died in January 1972, and was succeeded as managing director by Lord Harewood.The success of the 1968 Mastersingers was followed in the 1970s by the company's first Ring cycle, conducted by Goodall, with a new translation by Andrew Porter and designs by Ralph Koltai.  The cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios. In Harewood's view, among the highlights of the first ten years at the Coliseum were the Ring, Prokofiev's War and Peace, and Richard Strauss's Salome and Der Rosenkavalier. The company's musical director from 1970 to 1977 was Charles Mackerras. Harewood praised his exceptional versatility, with a range \\"from The House of the Dead to Patience.\\" Among the operas he conducted for the company were Handel's Julius Caesar starring Janet Baker and Valerie Masterson; five Janáček operas; The Marriage of Figaro with pioneering use of 18th century performing style; Massenet's Werther; Donizetti's Mary Stuart with Baker; and Sullivan's Patience. The company took the production of the last to the Vienna Festival in 1975, along with Britten's Gloriana. Sir Charles Groves succeeded Mackerras as musical director from 1978 to 1979, but Groves was unwell and unhappy during his brief tenure. Starting in 1979, Mark Elder succeeded Groves in the post, and described Groves \\"immensely encouraging and supportive\\".A long-standing concern of Arlen and then Harewood was the need to change the company's name to reflect the fact that it was no longer based at Sadler's Wells theatre. Byam Shaw commented \\"The one major setback the Sadler's Wells Opera Company suffered from its transplant was that unheeding taxi drivers kept on taking their patrons up to Rosebery Avenue\\".Harewood...

An open-topped motorcar pulls up near the Jallianwala Bagh, a seven-acre area of waste ground, and Brigadier Reginald ‘Rex’ Dyer steps out. He then attempts to bring an armoured car, with its machine gun, into the area, but is foiled because the street is too narrow. No matter, he orders his force of Indian and Gurkha troops to open fire into a peaceful crowd of local men, women and children who are listening to Gandhian speeches about non-violence. Gunfire: A painting depicts the moment around 50 British riflemen fired 1,650 rounds into a crown of","output":"5,000 unarmed Indians, who had gathered to protest against the oppressive Rowlatt Act. In just ten minutes, nearly 400 people are dead and more than a thousand injured – the exact numbers are unknown due to the chaos caused by Dyer's actions. The Amritsar Massacre, as it came to be known, leaves a deep scar on the Indian psyche and marks a crucial turning point in the struggle for Indian independence. Public outrage at the brutality of Dyer's actions is felt not only in India but also across Britain and the world. The massacre becomes a symbol of British imperialism's ruthlessness and strengthens the resolve of Indians to fight for their freedom. In response to the massacre, Mahatma Gandhi intensifies his nonviolent resistance campaign, which ultimately leads to India gaining independence in 1947. Yet, despite the global condemnation and subsequent investigation into the Amritsar Massacre, the British government has never issued a formal apology. Decades later, while visiting the Golden temple in Amritsar, then Prime Minister David Cameron acknowledges the atrocities as 'monstrous,' but falls short of giving an official apology. As we approach the centenary of this tragic event, the debate over whether Britain should finally apologize for the Amritsar Massacre continues. Supporters argue that offering an apology would be a significant gesture towards healing historical wounds, while skeptics question the purpose such an apology would serve today. Regardless of where one stands on this issue, the Amritsar Massacre remains a poignant reminder of the human capacity for cruelty and the importance of never forgetting our history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Theodore II Doukas Laskaris or Ducas Lascaris (\\"Theodros II Doukas Laskaris\\") (1221/1222  August 18, 1258) was Emperor of Nicaea from 1254 to 1258.  - Late Antiquity is a periodization used by historians to describe the time of transition from classical antiquity to the Middle Ages in mainland Europe, the Mediterranean world, and the Middle East. The development of the periodization has generally been accredited to historian Peter Brown, after the publication of his seminal work \\"The World of Late Antiquity\\" (1971). Precise boundaries for the period are a continuing matter of debate, but Brown proposes a period between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Generally, it can be thought of as from the end of the Roman Empire's Crisis of the Third Century (c. 235  284) to, in the East, the early Islamic period (7th9th centuries), following the Muslim conquests in the mid7th century. In the West the end was earlier, with the start of the Early Medieval period typically placed in the 6th century, or earlier on the Western edges of the empire.  - A capital city (or simply capital) is the municipality exercising primary status in a country, state, province, or other region, usually as its seat of government. A capital is typically a city that physically encompasses the offices and meeting places of its respective government; the status as capital is often designated by its law or constitution. In some jurisdictions, including several countries, the different branches of government are located in different settlements. In some cases, a distinction is made between the official (constitutional) capital and the seat of government, which is in another place.  - Constantine the Great (27 February 272 AD  22 May 337 AD), also known as Constantine I or Saint Constantine (in the Orthodox Church as Saint Constantine the Great, Equal-to-the-Apostles), was a Roman Emperor from 306 to 337 AD. Constantine was the son of Flavius Valerius Constantius, a Roman Army officer, and his consort Helena. His father became \\"Caesar\\", the deputy emperor in the west, in 293 AD. Constantine was sent east, where he rose through the ranks to become a military tribune under the emperors Diocletian and Galerius. In 305, Constantius was raised to the rank of \\"Augustus\\", senior western emperor, and Constantine was recalled west to campaign under his father in Britannia (Britain). Acclaimed as emperor by the army at Eboracum (modern-day York) after his father's death in 306 AD, Constantine emerged victorious in a series of civil wars against the emperors Maxentius and Licinius to become sole ruler of both west and east by 324 AD.  - The Count of Flanders was the ruler or sub-ruler of the county of Flanders, beginning in the 9th century. The title was held for a time by the Holy Roman Emperor and the King of Spain. During the French Revolution in 1790, the county of Flanders was annexed to France and the peerage ceased to exist. In the 19th century, the title was appropriated by Belgium and granted twice to younger sons of the King of the Belgians. The most recent holder died in 1983.  - Constantinople  was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD.  - An empire is defined as \\"an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former British Empire, French Empire, Brazilian Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire.\\" An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire.  - The Empire of Romania, more commonly known in historiography as the Latin Empire or Latin Empire of Constantinople, and known to the Byzantines as the Latin Occupation, was a feudal Crusader state founded by the leaders of the Fourth Crusade on lands captured from the Byzantine Empire. It was established after the capture of Constantinople in 1204 and lasted until 1261. The Latin Empire was intended to supplant the Byzantine Empire as the titular Roman Empire in the east, with a Western Roman Catholic emperor enthroned in place of the Eastern Orthodox Roman emperors. Baldwin IX, Count of Flanders, was crowned the first Latin emperor as Baldwin I on 16 May 1204. The Latin Empire failed to attain political or economic dominance over the other Latin powers that had been established in former Byzantine territories in the wake of the Fourth Crusade, especially Venice, and after a short initial period of military successes it went into a steady decline. Weakened by constant warfare with the Bulgarians and the unconquered sections of the empire, it eventually fell when Byzantines recaptured Constantinople under Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261. The last Latin emperor, Baldwin II, went into exile, but the imperial title survived, with several pretenders to it, until the 14th century.  - The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\".  - The Empire of Trebizond or the Trapezuntine Empire was a monarchy that flourished during the 13th through 15th centuries, consisting of the far northeastern corner of Anatolia and the southern Crimea. Originally formed during a revolt against the usurpation of the imperial throne by the grandsons of Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos, Trebizond (current Trabzon, Turkey, with which the name of the empire is a cognate) became a Byzantine Greek successor state established after the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine) in the Fourth Crusade, along with the Empire of Nicaea and the Despotate of Epirus. The Emperors of Trebizond pressed their claim on the Imperial throne for decades after the Nicaean reconquest of Constantinople in 1261.  - The Empire of Nicaea was the largest of the three Byzantine Greek successor states founded by the aristocracy of the Byzantine Empire that fled after Constantinople was occupied by Western European and Venetian forces during the Fourth Crusade. Founded by the Laskaris family, it lasted from 1204 to 1261, when the Nicaeans restored the Byzantine Empire in Constantinople.  - The Fall of Constantinople ('; Conquest of Istanbul) was the capture of the capital of the Byzantine Empire by an invading army of the Ottoman Empire on 29 May 1453. The Ottomans were commanded by the then 21-year-old Mehmed the Conqueror, the seventh sultan of the Ottoman Empire, who defeated an army commanded by Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos. The conquest of Constantinople followed a 53-day siege that had begun on 6 April 1453.  - Alexios Komnenos Strategopoulos ( Greek :    ) was a Byzantine general during the reign of Michael VIII Palaiologos , rising to the rank of megas domestikos and Caesar . Of noble descent , he appears in the sources already at an advanced age in the early 1250s , leading armies for the Empire of Nicaea against Epirus . After falling out of favour and being imprisoned by Theodore II Laskaris , Strategopoulos sided with the aristocrats around Michael Palaiologos , and supported him in his rise to the throne after Theodore II 's death in 1258 . He participated in the Pelagonia campaign in 1259 , going on to capture Epirus , but his successes were undone in the next year and he was captured by the Epirotes . Released after a few months , he led the unexpected reconquest of Constantinople from the Latin Empire in July 1261 , restoring the Byzantine Empire . He was captured again by the Epirotes in the next year and spent several years in captivity in Italy , before being released . He retired from public affairs and died in the early 1270s .  - Michael VIII Palaiologos or Palaeologus (\\"Mikhal VIII Palaiologos\\"; 1223  11 December 1282) reigned as Byzantine Emperor 12591282. Michael VIII was the founder of the Palaiologan dynasty that would rule the Byzantine Empire until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. He recovered Constantinople from the Latin Empire in 1261 and transformed the Empire of Nicaea into a restored Byzantine Empire.  - Istanbul (or ), historically known as Constantinople and Byzantium, is the most populous city in Turkey and the country's economic, cultural, and historic center. Istanbul is a transcontinental city in Eurasia, straddling the Bosphorus strait (which separates Europe and Asia) between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea. Its commercial and historical center lies on the European side and about a third of its population lives on the Asian side. The city is the administrative center of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (coterminous with Istanbul Province), both hosting a population of around 14.7 million residents. Istanbul is one of the world's most populous cities and ranks as the world's 7th-largest city proper and the largest European city.  - The Laskaris or Lascaris family was a Byzantine Greek noble family whose members formed the ruling dynasty of the Empire of Nicaea from 1204 to 1261 and remained among the senior nobility up to the dissolution of the Byzantine Empire, whereupon many emigrated to Italy and then to Smyrna (much later). According to George Pachymeres, they were also called Tzamantouros (T). The feminine form of the name is Laskarina ().  - Komnenos, Latinized Comnenus, plural Komnenoi or Comneni (, pronounced /komniní/), is the name of a noble family who ruled the Byzantine Empire from 1081 to 1185, and later, as the Grand Komnenoi (, \\"Megalokomnenoi\\") founded and ruled the Empire of Trebizond (12041461). Through intermarriages with other noble clans, notably the Doukai, Angeloi, and Palaiologoi, the Komnenos name appears among most of the major noble houses of the late Byzantine world.

It has also been variously described as a subgenre of black metal, albeit one that abandoned black metal's Satanic imagery, \\"slow black metal\\" with influences from Nordic folk music, straddling black metal and folk metal almost equally, or running the gamut from \\"folk to black to death metal\\". Typically, Viking metal artists rely extensively on keyboards, which are often played at a \\"swift, galloping pace\\". These artists often add \\"local cultural flourishes\\" such as traditional instruments and ethnic melodies. It is similar to folk metal, and is sometimes categorized as such, but it uses folk instruments less extensively. For vocals, Viking metal incorporates both singing and the typical black metal screams and growls. Overall, Viking metal is hard to define since, apart from certain elements like anthem-like choruses, it is not based entirely on musical features and overlaps with other metal genres, with origins in black and death metal Some bands, such as Unleashed and Amon Amarth, play death metal, but incorporate Viking themes and thus are labeled as part of the genre. Generally, Viking metal is defined more by its thematic material and imagery than musical qualities. Rather than being a mock-up of medieval music, \\"it is in the band names, album titles, artwork of album covers and, especially, in the song lyrics that Viking themes are so evident.\\" Viking metal, and the closely related style pagan metal, is more of a term or \\"etiquette\\" than a musical style. Since they are defined chiefly by lyrical focus, any musical categorizations of these two styles is controversial.

Meet the biggest banjo maker in the U.S. FORTUNE — Before Taylor Swift, Steve Martin, and Mumford & Sons made it hip to strum a Deering banjo, Greg Deering made the instruments by hand in his garage, one at a time. His wife Janet would load the banjos into their station wagon and try to hawk them to L.A. music stores, which often said no to the upstart company. Even after landing accounts, they scrambled to pay their bills and struggled to shake off the image of banjo players as toothless hillbillies in overalls. At times, the Deerings wanted to give up. But they had a pact — they would make banjos no matter what. “We would say, ‘We can’t give up,'” says Janet Deering. “So let’s figure it out.” Did they ever. From that inauspicious start in 1975, the Deering Banjo Company of Spring Valley, Calif., has grown into North America’s largest banjo maker, riding the instrument’s current boom in popularity. The company owns an estimated 80% to 90% of the U.S. market and has almost doubled its sales since 2009, to a projected 5 million this year. In the past year alone, sales are up 1 million. In January, they expect to sell their one hundred-thousandth banjo. Instead of banging on music store doors, they have a one-year back order on new instruments. MORE: We need business leaders with some sense of shame Deering is not just the nation’s dominant banjo purveyor. It’s also a brand that’s attracting a new breed of young musicians. Taylor Swift strums a six-string, 2,100 model. “Taylor has really brought a lot of new people to the banjo,” Janet says. “Just watching her play, they buy banjos. It’s a wonderful thing.” Steve Martin, Keith Urban, and Winston Marshall of Mumford & Sons are all Deering banjo players too. The current roster of A-list musicians playing a Deering represents a 180-degree turn from the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s, when Nashville shunned the banjo. Zen Crook, an old-time Nashville session player, told a company official how a fellow musician warned him, “Don’t let anyone know you play the banjo because it will be the kiss of death of your music career.” The Deerings say the banjo backlash hurt them early on. “We felt like we couldn’t climb out of the box,” Janet says. “I had country artists say, ‘As soon as I cut a record with a banjo, they cut it from the album.'” Greg Deering credits Emily Robison of the Dixie Chicks. “They told Emily she couldn’t play the banjo, and she told them to stuff it,” he says. “She said, ‘Either I play the banjo, or we walk.'” She used an electric Deering banjo she bought at age 15. Keith Urban also widened the instrument’s appeal, recording with a Deering far from Nashville in his native Australia. From the time he was a kid listening to The Kingston Trio, Greg says he has always loved the banjo. “It’s a primitive sound,” he says. “It has a haunting quality to it.” Greg was a good banjo player, but he was a better craftsman who honed his skills building model airplanes with his father. In 1969, as a 19-year-old student at San Diego State University, he made his first banjo because he couldn’t afford the 700 Gibson banjo he longed for. He and his buddies, including Bob Taylor (who would go on to guitar-making fame) formed an instrument-making co-op called The American Dream. In 1974, the co-op closed. The next year, Greg and Janet, who met at church after she watched him play hymns, started the Deering Banjo Company. In the early, lean years, they would eat from their garden and chicken coop, scrounge for tools at a salvage yard, and rush to the bank to deposit any profits before their checks bounced. After they hired four employees, the neighbors complained, so they moved their operation to a small plant. Pricing was a challenge initially. Greg wanted to put as much value as possible into each banjo, but when Janet tried to sell a 175 model, store owners would ask, “What’s wrong with it? Why is it so cheap?” The next week, they raised the price to 275, and still the stores wouldn’t bite. Only after they raised the price to 375 did they start racking up orders. The Deerings now rely on a skilled workforce of 47 craftspeople, some of whom were carpenters and others who trained on the job. With fluctuations in sales, keeping a core crew posed a challenge. During the recent recession, Deering’s sales skidded from 3.4 million in 2007 to a low of 2.4 million in 2009. The company shrunk down to what the Deerings call an ” irreversible minimum” of 31 workers. “We spent two weeks with barely enough sales to make payroll,” Greg says. But they wanted to keep all their best employees, so they had everyone in the shop read a book about lean technologies called The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement. They moved machinery to a central location so workers did not have to walk as far, and Greg developed new, more efficient machines. When sales picked up, they could produce banjos faster and for less. MORE: Japan: A haven for humanoid robots Deering’s current offerings span the market. Their entry-level 500 banjos compete with Chinese imports. They also make custom-made, high-end instruments such as the Banjosaurus, which features an intricate mural depicting dinosaur evolution on the neck. George Grove of the Kingston Trio plays it onstage when he is not lending it to the American Banjo Museum in Oklahoma City. Anyone who wants to fork over 60,000 can have one custom-built just like it. Often, it’s rich amateurs, not professional musicians, who spend tens of thousands on a banjo as a piece of art. To keep banjo fever hot, the Deerings advertise in magazines, on the radio, and even on the side of a bus, under the tagline “Relax and Enjoy the Sound. Play the Banjo.” The company has sponsored banjo giveaways through the Facebook page of the Celtic punk group The Dropkick Murphys. To register to win, people have to submit their email address. “Within minutes, we’ll get 10,000 to 15,000 emails,” Greg says. This fall, the Deerings traveled with Mumford & Sons, setting up a tent and giving free banjo lessons to 2,000 fans in two weeks. “Within 15 minutes, I can teach you to strum and play two songs,” Greg says. They also travel worldwide, visiting dealers in 11 countries, and sell to other countries online. Jamie Deering, the Deerings’ daughter, is in charge of artist relations and also travels with bands. She has been mentioned as a possible successor, but Greg says she doesn’t want to go through the decades of struggle she saw her parents endure. “In order for her to take over, we’re going to have things running really, really well,” Greg says. Besides, Greg, who is 63, and Janet, who is 59, say they have no plans to retire anytime soon. They ignore advice to take their company public or cash out. That, after all, would break their pact. “We just want to make banjos,” Greg says. “It’s all about the magic of the music and the magic of banjos.” What was this article about?","output":"This article is about the Deering Banjo Company, which is the largest banjo maker in North America.

The man and woman did not love one another or anything else. The man was a wood man and often spent days alone in the wood. One day the man spent more time in the wood and he became lost. After days and days he grew hungry and weak. When he thought for sure he was going to die a tall wizard appeared before him. The man did not know the wizard had placed a spell on him, making him get lost, but he did.  The wizard smiled at the man in a friendly way and said to him, \\"I can show you the way out of the woods, if you give me the one thing you love most in the world.\\"  Since there was nothing that the man loved, he said yes at once. The Wizard showed the man the way home and then disappeared into the wood. The man and woman lived well for many years and the man never told his meeting to the wizard and after a time, he too forgot about his promise.  In time the woman gave birth and the man had a daughter who he loved. One day the wizard came to the door to take the girl, making the man remember his promise. The man was very sad to lose his daughter. But in the end he had to give her over to the wizard. The wizard was bad and locked the girl away in a cave. Every day the girl grew to be prettier and smarter. Every day the Wizard asked if the girl would marry him, but he was mean and she would not marry him.

But the girl would still not marry him. The wizard became so angry he turned to flame and burned up. The girl was free and went down to her flower only to find it was gone. Instead she found a handsome prince.  \\"I thank you my lady,\\" he said, \\"for saving me from the evil wizard. In return you may come live in my palace with me and be happy.\\"  The girl said yes.

Which sandwich was in the microwave for a longer period of time?  Sarah just finished reheating two leftover chicken sandwiches in the microwave that she had made the previous night. She takes them out and leaves them on the kitchen counter while she pours herself a glass of wine. Her roommate, Carla, comes out and decides to take a more scientific approach toward the chicken sandwiches. Carla sees that the average kinetic energy in sandwich A is higher than the average kinetic energy in sandwich B. Carla then takes a big bite out of both sandwiches and returns to her room as if nothing happened.  Hint: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. A:","output":"Sandwich A was in the microwave for a longer period of time. The paragraph describes how Sarah reheated two chicken sandwiches and then left them on the counter. Carla, her roommate, observed the sandwiches and noted the difference in their average kinetic energies. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, and therefore have a higher temperature. Conversely, when particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy, resulting in a lower temperature. Carla observed that sandwich A had a higher average kinetic energy than sandwich B. Given the relationship between kinetic energy and temperature, we can infer that sandwich A had a higher temperature than sandwich B. When food is microwaved, the energy from the microwaves causes the molecules in the food to move faster, which in turn increases the kinetic energy and temperature of the food. Therefore, the higher temperature of sandwich A suggests that it absorbed more energy from the microwaves and was in the microwave for a longer period of time than sandwich B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: With New App, Facebook Harkens Back to Internet 1.0 Online chat rooms lured a generation onto the Internet in the 1990s and then faded in the age of social media. Now, the biggest social network wants to resurrect them – on your phone. Facebook said Thursday it is launching a standalone smartphone app called “Rooms,” a nostalgic throwback to Internet 1.0, updated for the mobile Web. The app is like an infinitely large house where users can create rooms for specific purposes, like discussing current events, planning exotic vacations or breeding yorkipoos. The posts, which can include photos or videos, appear in chronological order. Like Internet message boards, all posts in Rooms are public. But the creator of a room may limit who can contribute posts. Contributors can use pseudonyms. Rooms is the latest entry in Facebook’s strategy of building standalone apps independent of the social network itself. This year, it launched the news aggregator Paper, a photo-sharing product called Slingshot and a video-capture app called Hyperlapse. Rooms stands out because it encourages users to create longer-lasting content and participate in conversations. Some rooms may be silly or frivolous, but the app could become a place to discuss current events and breaking news. Every post in Rooms is tagged with a Web address, or URL, making it visible to search engines like Google . That’s an important feature because it links the mobile app to the desktop Web, opening the app’s contents to searches from personal computers. A room’s creator can turn off the web links and search features, making the room more private. But anyone who knows the location of the room can still visit it. Rooms was designed by Josh Miller, a 24-year-old Princeton dropout who co-founded the online-discussion site Branch and sold it to Facebook in January. Branch still operates. Miller said he met frequently with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg while honing the concept of Rooms. Despite Zuckerberg’s involvement, Miller stressed that the app is separate from Facebook. It won’t offer users suggestions on which rooms to join based on their Facebook friends. It doesn’t use the phone’s address book to build a network. It can’t share content with Facebook. Miller said he wants people to interact with people outside their social network. “We’re risking our growth,” Miller said, because the app won’t take advantage of Facebook’s massive audience of 1.3 billion regular users. A Facebook spokesman said Facebook does not identify the devices that use Rooms, so it won’t know whether a Rooms user is a Facebook user or who they are. But he said Facebook might consider doing so in the future to better understand who is using the app. That would allow Facebook to know the real name of Rooms participant using a pseudonym, for example, but the spokesman said Facebook would never share a user’s identity. To build Rooms, Miller said he turned himself into a historian of the Internet, calling the creators of popular Internet message boards to ask how they attracted participants. He researched ways to block “flamers,” or people who post offensive or off-topic content in a room. Miller also wanted to give users the ability to control the look and feel of their chat rooms, something that’s not common in mobile apps. People who create rooms can choose any background color and post customized images. Invitations to join a room use QR codes. People who follow the room can send the code to others. They can also print the invite, allowing anyone who scans the code with a phone camera to join the room. ______________________________________________________ For the latest news and analysis, follow @wsjd Get breaking news and personal-tech reviews delivered right to your inbox.

Funerary art tends to be conservative in style, and many grave markers in various cultures follow rather traditional patterns, while others reflect modernism or other recent styles.  Public monuments representing collective memorials to particular groups of dead people continue to be erected, especially war memorials, and in the Western world have now replaced individual or family memorials as the dominant types of very large memorials; Western political leaders now usually receive simple graves. Some large memorials are fairly traditional, while those reflecting more contemporary styles include the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and several Holocaust memorials, such as Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, the Vel d'Hiv Memorial in Paris (1994), the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin (2004), and the Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial in Vienna (2000). These are in notable contrast to the style of most war memorials to the military of World War II; earlier modernist memorials to the dead of World War I were sometimes removed after a time as inappropriate.  Some war memorials, especially in countries like Germany, have had a turbulent political history, for example the much-rededicated Neue Wache in Berlin  and the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which is internationally controversial.Several critics detect a crisis in public memorial style from 1945, when the traditional figurative symbolic language, and evocation of nationalist values, came to seem inadequate, especially in relation to genocide, at least on the Western side of the Iron Curtain. In the Communist East the established style of Socialist Realism was still considered appropriate, at least by the authorities. The generation of abstracted and conceptual war and Holocaust memorials erected in the West from the 1990s onwards seems finally to have found a resolution for these issues.Many large mausoleums have been constructed for political leaders, including Lenin's Mausoleum and those for Atatürk, Jinnah, Kim Il-Sung, Che Guevara and several Presidential...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Martin Brodeur was born on May 6, 1972, in Montreal. He was one of five children of Denis and Mireille Brodeur. Denis played in the 1956 Olympics for Team Canada and won a bronze medal. After his playing career, Denis was a longtime photographer for the Montreal Canadiens. After a year of success, the Devils were in the middle of the pack for most of the 1995-96 season and barely missed the playoffs. Brodeur played in 74 of his team's 82 games, setting a single-season record for most minutes played by a goalie, while having the 2nd-most shutouts (6) in the league. He was named the starter in the All-Star Game for the Eastern Conference and stopped all 12 shots he faced. He finished fourth in voting for the Vezina Trophy, which is awarded to the league's top goaltender. Brodeur also played on Team Canada during the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, where Canada lost to the United States in the gold medal finals.  In the 1996-97 season, the Devils finished 3rd in the NHL. Brodeur was runner-up for the Vezina Trophy, was named to the All-Star team, and had the lowest goals against average by a goalie in almost 30 years, earning him the Jennings Trophy. He also had 10 shutouts and a .927 save percentage. On April 17, 1997, in the first game of a first-round playoff matchup against the Montreal Canadiens, Brodeur fired the puck the length of the ice and into the Canadiens' empty net to ensure a 5-2 victory. It was only the second time in NHL history that a goaltender had scored in the playoffs, and the fifth time overall. The Devils went on to win that series, but lost in the second round to the rival New York Rangers.  The following year, Brodeur had 43 wins and 10 shutouts in the regular season. The Devils finished first in the Eastern Conference, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to the eighth-seeded Ottawa Senators. Once again, Brodeur made the All-Star Team, finished as a runner-up for the Vezina Trophy, and won the Jennings Trophy.  In the 1998-99 season, the Devils finished first in the Eastern Conference for the third straight year, with Brodeur winning 39 games. He was among the contenders for the Vezina Trophy and started in the All-Star game, making his fourth appearance. However, the Devils lost in the first round to the Penguins. It was Brodeur's worst playoff performance to date statistically, as he allowed 20 goals in seven games with an .856 save percentage. Did anything else notable happen during that season?","output":"During the 1998-99 season, Martin Brodeur was a very good goalie. He helped his team, the Devils, finish first in the Eastern Conference for the third year in a row. He won 39 games, which is a lot, and people thought he might win a big award for goalies called the Vezina Trophy. He also played in a special game with other top players called the All-Star game. But in the playoffs, which are really important games to try and win a big trophy, his team lost in the first round to the Penguins. That was a bit sad, and it was not Martin's best playoff performance because he allowed 20 goals in seven games."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you were expecting much more dramatic results, then adjust your expectations so that you are not discouraged. Eat a maximum of 6 ounces of protein at mealtimes. Ideally, women should consume 1,500 to 1,800 calories per day, and men should consume 1,800 to 2,200 per day. If your weight loss has stalled, then try counting calories for a couple of days and see what is pushing you out of your acceptable calorie range. If you’re estimating, then you may be overeating. Make a new commitment to accurately counting the grams of net carbs that you eat each day. If you aren’t eating enough vegetables, then you may become constipated, which could increase the reading on the scale. Many sauces and condiments contain carbohydrates, so be sure to read your labels. Sometimes, dieters overdo their consumption of these products. If you skip a meal, then you will feel ravenous before your next meal. If you allow yourself to become extremely hungry, then you will have more difficulty gauging when you have eaten enough. Over-the-counter medications and some prescription medications can slow down weight loss. Stress causes your body to produce cortisol, a fat-storing hormone, which can deposit fat around your waist. Try yoga, meditation, exercise and other healthy methods to cope with stress and to restart your weight loss.

Article: The video, released through Isis’s official propaganda outlet al-Hayat Media, shows two men who it claims are “agents recruited by Russian intelligence” apparently being shot in the desert by a child who is thought to be around 10 years old.      It comes just a day after another video showed a child aged around 14 apparently carrying out a suicide bombing in the Iraqi province of Salahuddin.      A previous video showed a young boy who Isis claimed took part in a suicide bombing And while the apparent execution could not be independently verified, experts suggested that the increased use of children in the atrocities it films represented “a departure from past norms”, even by Isis standards.      The new video is entitled “Uncovering an enemy within”, and has been published by the branch of Isis which specialises in making propaganda videos for an international audience.      Including captions in Arabic and English, it claims the two men are “FSB agents”, offered money to “gather information about fighters and send the information to Russia”.      After they are shown “confessing” to the camera, a separate part of the video shows the two men on their knees in the desert before a militant and a boy who can be no more than 10 years old.      The militant says the men are now “in the custody of the lion cubs of the caliphate”, before the child steps forward and appears to shoot the men.      The same child has appeared in previous Isis videos, and also features in a clip at the end of the most recent video that appears to have been shot some time earlier.      Charlie Winter, a researcher for the anti-extremism thinktank Quilliam, said: “Whether it is real or staged, [Isis] used a young child in this video for the shock factor, and the shock factor alone.      “Its propagandists have done it before – showing images of children training as soldiers and being kicked in the stomach in martial arts drills – but this latest video marks a departure from past norms.”      The video comes amid increased speculation over the blurring of lines between disparate militant groups like Isis and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), particularly in the wake of the Paris shootings.      And while many social media users speculated as to whether the apparent execution was genuine, Isis supporters shared it as a warning to “you who sent spies”.      One Isis-affiliated account under the name Abu Marthad al-Muhajir tweeted: “This is not al-Qaeda, this is the Islamic State, O you filthy stupid Marxists of Russia. This is your destiny.” ||||| LONDON -- A video released Tuesday by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) shows the apparent execution of two men, accused of being spies for Russia, at the hands of a young boy.      The seven-and-a-half-minute long video was released by ISIS' multi-lingual production wing, al-Hayat, and begins with long television news-style interviews with both men, who confess to being spies against ISIS and working in both Syria and Turkey.      The men, who speak Russian in the interviews, are identified by name as agents of Russia's premier spy agency, the FSB. One of them tells the interviewer he was under orders to try and assassinate an ISIS leader, but the name of the ISIS figure in question is edited out of the video.      After what appears to be a scripted warning to others \\"who want to come here and spy\\" to \\"repent to Allah now before it's too late,\\" the setting in the video changes to an outdoor location where the men are seen kneeling with their backs to a bearded militant whom CBS News could not identify and a boy, who appeared to be less than 15 years old.      Both the adult jihadist and the boy appear to be of Asian descent. The man recites Quranic verse before saying: \\"Allah has gifted the Islamic State's security agency with the apprehension of these two spies.\\"      He says the men are \\"now in the custody of the lion cubs of Khilafah,\\" before prompting the boy to go ahead with the apparent execution with a pat on the shoulder.      The video, which is heavily edited and includes English subtitles throughout, then appears to show the boy shoot both men in the back of the head.      No blood can be seen on the bodies in the final shots of the purported execution sequence, and the video then transitions to a clip from an older video, released in Nov. 2014, in which the same boy is seen expressing aspirations to one day become a \\"mujahid.\\"      The older video shows the boy with other purported newcomers to ISIS territory, including many women and other children. The November video includes images from an ISIS religious school, where kids as young as six or seven are seen being groomed to become future militants for the group.      CBS News cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video released by ISIS, nor the identity of the men seen in it. CBS News was seeking comment from officials in Moscow.      In the meantime, Russian news agency RIA Novosti said a representative of the FSB told them it \\"does not comment on the publication of the video executions allegedly of their agents by the members of the 'Islamic state.'\\"      ISIS has executed scores of people in territory seized on both sides of the Iraq-Syria border, including American and European journalists and aid workers, rival militia members and soldiers from both nations' armies. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A video has been released by a group called Isis, and it shows a very sad and scary situation.

A: pick from the following.  -theory;  -hypothesis;  -scientific controls;  -scientific method; A:","output":"The set of steps that help us answer questions in science can be described as the \\"scientific method.\\" The scientific method is a systematic and logical approach to problem-solving that involves observing, questioning, forming and testing hypotheses, and drawing conclusions based on empirical evidence. This method serves as the foundation of modern scientific inquiry and ensures that results are reliable, reproducible, and rigorously tested. Let's delve into the different components of the scientific method and understand how each step contributes to answering scientific questions. 1. Observation: The scientific process begins with careful observation. Researchers first notice a phenomenon or event and record these observations either quantitatively (with numbers) or qualitatively (in words). Observations can be made through direct experience, examination of data from previous studies, or review of pertinent literature. 2. Questioning: Based on the observations, scientists develop questions that seek to find explanations for the phenomenon or event. Questions should be specific, testable, and based on the available information. 3. Background research: To adequately address the question, researchers review existing literature, studies, and expert opinions to better understand the subject and refine their question or hypothesis. This research helps to ensure that their study is based on the latest knowledge and offers new insights into the problem. 4. Formulating hypotheses: A hypothesis serves as a tentative, testable explanation for the observed phenomenon. It is an educated guess, based on the available evidence and background research. A properly formulated hypothesis should be clear, concise, and falsifiable, meaning it must be possible to disprove it with empirical evidence. 5. Designing experiments: To test the hypothesis, researchers design experiments or studies that control for variables and manipulate conditions to observe the effects on the phenomenon. Careful experimental design is crucial to produce meaningful and interpretable results, accounting for potential confounding factors and sources of error. 6. Conducting experiments: Researchers carry out the experiments they have designed, carefully controlling empirical conditions and collecting data. This step involves repeating trials, ensuring adequate sample sizes, and using appropriate techniques to reduce the impact of bias or random error on results. 7. Analyzing data: Once the data is collected, researchers use statistical analysis to determine the significance of their findings and evaluate the support for their hypothesis. Depending on the nature of the data, various tests and methods can be employed to determine relationships, correlations, and causation between variables. 8. Drawing conclusions: After analyzing the data, scientists draw conclusions about whether the results support or refute the hypothesis. This step allows researchers to objectively evaluate their findings and determines if any adjustments or additional experiments are needed. 9. Communicating results: The final step of the scientific method involves sharing research findings with the scientific community. Researchers often publish their studies in peer-reviewed journals, ensuring that the study has been subjected to rigorous evaluation by other experts in the field. This process allows for further discussion, scrutiny, and improvement of the study and promotes the advancement of scientific knowledge. The scientific method thus provides researchers with a structured and thorough approach to answering questions, enhancing our understanding of the world and informing evidence-based decision-making. By following these steps, scientists can minimize sources of bias and error, ensuring the reliability and reproducibility of their results and fostering trust in the scientific process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.  - A tributary or affluent is a stream or river that flows into a larger stream or main stem (or parent) river or a lake. A tributary does not flow directly into a sea or ocean. Tributaries and the main stem river drain the surrounding drainage basin of its surface water and groundwater, leading the water out into an ocean.  - Malawi (or ; or [maláwi]), officially the Republic of Malawi, is a landlocked country in southeast Africa that was formerly known as Nyasaland. It is bordered by Zambia to the northwest, Tanzania to the northeast, and Mozambique on the east, south and west. The country is separated from Tanzania and Mozambique by Lake Malawi. Malawi is over with an estimated population of 16,777,547 (July 2013 est.). Its capital is Lilongwe, which is also Malawi's largest city; the second largest is Blantyre, the third is Mzuzu and the fourth largest is its old capital Zomba. The name Malawi comes from the Maravi, an old name of the Nyanja people that inhabit the area. The country is also nicknamed \\"The Warm Heart of Africa\\".  - Tanzania , officially the United Republic of Tanzania, is a country in Eastern Africa within the African Great Lakes region. Parts of the country are in Southern Africa. It is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south; and by the Indian Ocean to the east. Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, is in northeastern Tanzania.  - The Dwangwa River in Malawi is a tributary river for Lake Nyasa . It flows for approximately 100 miles ( 160 km ) . The river 's source is in the Kasungu National Park , in Malawi 's central plateau . It flows north - easterly from this plateau through an ancient valley . The river 's mouth flows out of a more recently cut gorge , into the Lake . It also flows through the Bana Swamp The Dwangwa River is used both for irrigation and the generation of hydroelectric power . It is a fishing river , with prawns found in the river .  - Mozambique (or ), officially the Republic of Mozambique (or \\"\\") is a country in Southeast Africa bordered by the Indian Ocean to the east, Tanzania to the north, Malawi and Zambia to the northwest, Zimbabwe to the west, and Swaziland and South Africa to the southwest. It is separated from Madagascar by the Mozambique Channel to the east. The capital and largest city is Maputo (known as \\"Lourenço Marques\\" before independence).  - Lake Malawi, also known as Lake Nyasa in Tanzania and Lago Niassa in Mozambique, is an African Great Lake and the southernmost lake in the East African Rift system, located between Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania. It is the ninth largest lake in the world and the third largest and second deepest lake in Africa. It is home to more species of fish than any other lake, including about 1000 species of cichlids. The Mozambique portion of the lake was officially declared a reserve by the Government of Mozambique on June 10, 2011,while in Malawi a portion of the lake is included in Lake Malawi National Park. Lake Malawi is a meromictic lake, meaning that its water layers do not mix. The permanent stratification of Lake Malawi's water and the oxic-anoxic boundary (relating to oxygen in the water) are maintained by moderately small chemical and thermal gradients.  - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\".  - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River.  - \\"Main Stem\\" is 1942 instrumental by Duke Ellington and His Famous Orchestra. Although recorded in 1942, the single would not be released until 1944 where it was Duke Ellington's last of four number one's on the Harlem Hit Parade. \\"Main Stem\\" also peaked at number twenty on the pop chart.

Write a text based on this summary: opposition demands british government explain why attorney general changes advice on legality of war in iraq Text:","output":"Title: Opposition Demands Clarification on the Change in Legal Advice Regarding the War in Iraq In recent developments, the opposition has raised questions about the British government's decision-making process concerning the Iraq War. The primary issue raised is the change in legal advice provided by the Attorney General regarding the legality of the war. The opposition is demanding an explanation for the abrupt alteration in the official stance on the issue. The Attorney General initially claimed that the war in Iraq was in breach of international law. However, subsequent advice saw a sudden shift, deeming military action legal under specific circumstances. The opposition has expressed growing concerns over this change, arguing that it appears to have had a significant influence on the government's decision to participate in the controversial conflict. Seeking transparency and a detailed account of the events leading to the change in legal advice, the opposition is pushing for a public inquiry. This inquiry would delve into the factors that may have pressured the Attorney General to alter his initial view on the war's legality. The goal is to shed light on the reasons behind the change and ensure that the government did not act in self-interest or succumb to external pressure. Opposition leaders emphasize the importance of understanding the sequence of events and the context in which the change occurred. This information is vital for the public to have confidence in the government's ability to act within the bounds of international law and to uphold responsible decision-making. The British government has yet to provide an official response to these demands. However, the increasing pressure from the opposition and the public cannot be ignored. It is crucial that the government take swift action to address these concerns and reassure the people that its decisions are made in the best interests of the nation and with the utmost consideration for legality and ethics. In conclusion, the opposition's demand for an explanation regarding the change in the Attorney General's advice on the legality of the war in Iraq is a pressing issue. By addressing these concerns transparently and openly, the British government can maintain public trust and promote a culture of accountability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — Two longtime GOP lawmakers announced their retirements Tuesday from the House of Representatives, adding to the growing list of Republicans electing to leave Capitol Hill under the Trump administration rather than face voters in next year's midterm elections.      Twelve-term Rep. Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey declared in a statement that \\"our nation is now consumed by increasing political polarization\\" and \\"there is no longer middle ground.\\" The 71-year-old became the latest moderate Republican to leave Congress and open up a seat that will be ripe for Democrats to pick up as they fight to retake control of the House next year.      Then, several hours later, seven-term Rep. Ted Poe of Texas, a conservative, announced that he too plans to retire rather than seek re-election to another term next year. Poe, 69, whose district covers parts of Houston and northern suburbs, said in a statement that \\"Thanks to the lord, I'm in good health, but it's time for the next step.\\" He added that he was looking forward to spending more time with his grandkids.      Poe's district is solidly Republican and would be a struggle for Democrats to win.      With the announcements from LoBiondo and Poe, the list of Republicans who've announced plans to retire rather than seek re-election is now near two dozen, compared to fewer than half-a-dozen Democrats. Although only a handful of the GOP seats opening up are highly competitive for the Democrats, the many retirements nonetheless are adding up to an increasingly rosy scenario for Democrats, who must pick up two dozen seats to win back the House.      LoBiondo said the time is right for him to leave anyway because of term limits on his service on the Intelligence Committee and as chairman of the Transportation Committee's subcommittee on aviation. But he also delivered an indictment of the current political climate.      \\"As some of my closest colleagues have also come to realize, those of us who came to Congress to change Washington for the better through good governance are now the outliers,\\" LoBiondo wrote. \\"In legislating, we previously fought against allowing the perfect to become the enemy of the good. Today a vocal and obstinate minority within both parties has hijacked good legislation in pursuit of no legislation.\\"      LoBiondo joins several other House GOP moderates, including Reps. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, who have decided not to seek re-election in next year's midterms. Also Tuesday, Arizona Republicans confirmed that another establishment-friendly House Republican, Rep. Martha McSally, plans to run for Senate for the seat being vacated by GOP Sen. Jeff Flake.      Taken together, the departures of GOP moderates could result in an even more polarized House than exists today. In years past large blocs of moderate Blue Dog Democrats and centrist Republicans could sway outcomes on legislation, but the ranks of the Blue Dogs have already been decimated while the GOP moderates are dwindling fast.      ___      Associated Press writer Alan Fram contributed. ||||| Sound smart: It's tempting to read too much into off-year elections. And, given both Virginia and New Jersey are states Hillary Clinton won, they by all measures should have gone to Democrats. But don't underestimate how much unity, momentum, money will now flow to Democrats — and how much finger-pointing and funk they avoided.      For the first time since Election Night one year ago today, Democrats could smile. On a day that set the opening tone for the midterm elections of 2018, voters rejected President Trump, handed Democrats a big win in a swing state in a racially charged moment, and provided hope — however fleeting or fanciful — that they can win back power in Washington.      In the Virginia governor's race, Democrat Ralph Northam beat Ed Gillespie by 9 points — a far bigger margin than either party had foreseen, and far wider than Hillary Clinton's win over Trump.      Some empirical data behind the hope:            The stunning margin was booked largely in Northern Virginia, in what MSNBC's Steve Kornacki called \\"the revenge of the suburbs\\" after a year of Trump.      U.Va.'s Larry Sabato told me there's one explanation: \\"Donald Trump. He really is deeply unpopular in urban-suburban Virginia. Voter after voter wanted to send him a message, and said so. Of course, he won't listen, but the message was sent.\\"      Gillespie lost women by 22 percentage points.      He won men by 2 percentage points.      Gillespie won whites by 15 percentage points, and still got crushed.      Northam won by a 24 point margin among those who decided in last week. It looks like those racially tinged ads/moves backfired.      And it wasn't just Northam:      In what the Richmond Times-Dispatch called a \\"tsunami election,\\" Democrats erase a 32-seat GOP advantage in the House of Delegates, with recounts likely to determine control.      Plus national history: \\"Virginia's most socially conservative state lawmaker was ousted from office ... by Danica Roem, a Democrat who will be one of the nation's first openly transgender elected officials and who embodies much of what Del. Robert G. Marshall fought against in Richmond.\\" (WashPost)      A white mayor won by the largest margin in decades in predominantly black Detroit.      The first African American Democratic woman was elected mayor of Charlotte.      A Democrat will replace Chris Christie in New Jersey.      A Democrat knocked off a GOP incumbent in New Hampshire's largest city to become Manchester's first female mayor.      \\"Voters in Maine ... easily approved a referendum to expand Medicaid for low-income adults, doing an end-run around Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who vetoed the move — a key element of Obamacare.\\" (NPR)      A big story that could get lost in the blizzard: Two more House Republicans — Rep. Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey and Rep. Ted Poe of Texas — announced their retirements, increasing chances Dems take the House a year from now.      The takeaways: Top Republicans were stunned by the severity of the shellacking, and worry that it will endanger both tax reform and the House majority.       ||||| Summary:","output":"Two long-time Republicans, Frank LoBiondo and Ted Poe, have decided to retire from the House of Representatives, adding to the growing list of Republicans choosing to leave under President Trump's administration.

On the other hand, Silvania, a southern country increased taxation hoping they would increase collection amounts. The problem was that Silvanian people increased taxation above the critical rate.  and a hint : The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue.  Please answer this question : Which country experienced an increase in collection amounts?","output":"Based on the Laffer curve theory and the information provided, Hinland is the country that likely experienced an increase in collection amounts. The Laffer curve demonstrates that there exists a critical tax rate, above which the labor supply decreases, causing government revenue to decline. When tax rates are above the critical point, a reduction in tax rates stimulates the labor supply, resulting in increased government revenue. In the given situation, Hinland reduced taxation, which according to the Laffer curve, would mean more money for government spending if the country's previous tax rate was above the critical point. Assuming this to be true, Hinland's decision to lower tax rates led to an increase in labor supply and, therefore, an increase in government revenue. On the other hand, Silvania increased taxation above the critical rate, which, according to the Laffer curve, would likely result in a decline in labor supply and a decrease in overall government revenue. Silvanian people faced a higher tax burden, which could have disincentivized work and led to lower collection amounts compared to Hinland. In conclusion, Hinland is the country that most likely experienced an increase in collection amounts due to its decision to reduce taxation, while Silvania's choice to increase taxation above the critical rate may have led to a decrease in government revenue."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Use the following highlights to write an article: 'Continual economic growth is not sustainable,' said Royal Society panel. Article:","output":"Title: \\"The Illusion of Infinite Growth: Royal Society Panel Sounds the Alarm\\" Introduction: A recent discussion by a panel of experts at the Royal Society has sparked a crucial debate on the long-held belief in perpetual economic growth. The panel has argued that unbridled economic expansion is unsustainable in the long run, posing significant challenges to both our environment and social structures. Step 1: Presenting the Argument To delve deeper into this argument, it's imperative first to understand the underlying assumption that economies must continually grow in order to progress and prosper. This notion, deeply ingrained in the minds of policymakers and business leaders alike, has been the driving force behind the global push for wealth creation and development over the past few decades. Step 2: The Environmental Consequences However, the implications of this relentless growth are particularly worrisome when it comes to the environment. As countries race against each other to raise their GDP (Gross Domestic Product) figures, this often leads to the exploitation and depletion of natural resources. The panel at the Royal Society was categorical in its assertion that unchecked growth poses a significant threat to our planet's ecosystems – an issue that transcends national boundaries and has a direct impact on the well-being of current and future generations. Step 3: The Social Repercussions Beyond the environmental impact, the panel also highlighted the social implications of endless economic growth. Wealth inequality and the marginalization of vulnerable communities are two critical concerns arising from a system focused solely on expanding the economy. The relentless pursuit of growth may have led to advances in our living standards, but the cracks in our social fabric are starting to show.  Step 4: Challenging the Status Quo Given these pressing issues, the panel's message is an urgent call to reevaluate our understanding of progress and prosperity. Challenging the status quo, the panel posits that it is high time to explore alternative models of economic development that prioritize sustainability, environmental preservation, and social equity, rather than simply increasing GDP figures. Step 5: Offering Potential Solutions As nations grapple with the prospect of redefining progress, they need to consider creative approaches to address the economic and environmental challenges at hand. This may entail reshaping economic policies and business practices to prioritize long-term benefits over short-term gains. Broadening the focus to include circular economies, renewable energy sources, and resource-efficient technologies could be vital steps in building a more sustainable future for all. Conclusion: The Royal Society panel's remarks on the unsustainability of continuous economic growth serve as a stark reminder that the race for wealth and development must be tempered with considerations for our planet's well-being and the global community. The time has come to confront the challenges head-on and embrace alternative models of development that focus on creating a socially and environmentally sustainable future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Labor said PM Tony Abbott's offer of a same-sex marriage plebiscite next year was nothing but a \\"delaying tactic\\". The attack comes as Mr Abbott faces criticism within his own ranks about how he has handled the issue. On Tuesday, he blocked a free vote for government MPs on any same-sex marriage bills but said the issue should be \\"put to the people\\" after the next election. Read more: 'Crocodile Dundee' MP leads Australia gay marriage push Labor leader Bill Shorten called on all Coalition MPs in favour of same-sex marriage to keep lobbying the prime minister. \\"The choice in this country is you either have Mr Abbott or you have marriage equality but you can't have both,\\" he told reporters on Wednesday. Mr Shorten has pledged to introduce same-sex marriage legislation within the first 100 days if Labor wins the next election, due in 2016. Mr Abbott, who personally opposes same-sex marriage, on Wednesday said under Liberal Party policy, any government frontbenchers who defied the agreed position to oppose gay marriage would be sacked. Backbench coalition MP Warren Entsch plans to introduce a cross-party bill next week to legalise same-sex marriage. Mr Entsch, who has campaigned publicly for marriage equality, told local media he believed some of his colleagues would cross the floor to vote in favour of his bill. \\"Absolutely I will be crossing the floor,\\" he said, \\"but even with some support I don't think the support is there to see it succeed\\". Analysis: Jon Donnison, BBC News, Sydney The gay marriage issue in Australia is an interesting one, not least because Tony Abbott, and indeed politicians in general, are out of touch with public opinion. Polls show the majority of Australians support same-sex marriage. And that's why it's a potentially dangerous issue for Mr Abbott who admits to feeling \\"a bit threatened\\" by homosexuality - even though his own sister Christine is a lesbian. And it's not just the public Tony Abbott is out of sync with. Some MPs within his own Liberal Party are in favour of legalising gay marriage. So if the prime minister continues to deny his parliamentary colleagues a free conscience vote on the issue, he risks alienating some within his own party. Is Abbott being refreshingly honest or out of touch? Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who supports same-sex marriage and a free vote on it by government MPs, said the issue would distract from debate about the economy and jobs ahead of next year's election. \\"The attraction of a free vote would have been that the matter would have been settled one way or another in this parliament,\\" Mr Turnbull told reporters on Wednesday. He said Mr Abbott's offer to hold a plebiscite meant same-sex marriage was now \\"a live issue all the way up to the next election\\". Mr Abbott's sister Christine Forster, a Liberal local councillor in Sydney, agreed with this assessment. Ms Forster, who is a lesbian and has publically supported same-sex marriage, told the BBC that she found her brother's decision \\"personally very disappointing\\" and hoped that the party would review its position soon. But she added: \\"We both respect each other's views... and that reflects Australian society as a whole, there are a range of views on this issue.\\" The Labor Party has also faced internal debate about the matter. At a party conference in July, Mr Shorten convinced his colleagues not to adopt a binding vote on same-sex marriage. Labor deputy Tanya Plibersek had unsuccessfully lobbied her colleagues to amend the Labor platform so that MPs would be forced to vote in favour of same-sex marriage in parliament. Summary:","output":"Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has faced criticism within his own ranks about his handling of the same-sex marriage issue. Earlier this week, he blocked a free vote for government MPs on same-sex marriage bills, but said that the issue should be \\"put to the people\\" after the next election.

Pentru a aborda în mod constructiv problema șomajului, este esențial să fie adoptate măsuri eficiente la nivelul Uniunii Europene. În acest sens, ar trebui să ne bazăm pe trei principii fundamentale: reacție, evoluție și siguranță. În primul rând, este necesar ca Uniunea Europeană să reacționeze rapid și eficient la provocările legate de ocuparea forței de muncă. Asta presupune adoptarea unor politici coerente și solide, menite să încurajeze crearea de locuri de muncă și să reducă efectele negative ale șomajului asupra populației. De asemenea, este important să se ia în considerare atât nevoile angajaților, cât și ale angajatorilor, pentru a atinge un echilibru echitabil în piața muncii. Al doilea principiu, evoluția, subliniază importanța adaptabilității UE la schimbările socio-economice și tehnologice. Acest lucru înseamnă că este necesar să se pună un accent deosebit pe dezvoltarea competențelor și pe educație, precum și să se investească în inovare, cercetare și dezvoltare pentru a menține competitivitatea economiilor europene. De asemenea, trebuie să se țină cont de noile modele de muncă care decurg din revoluția digitală și să se analizeze impactul acestora asupra forței de muncă în întreaga UE. În sfârșit, principalul obiectiv al tuturor acțiunilor întreprinse trebuie să fie protejarea și siguranță forței de muncă în ansamblu. Asta implică garantarea unor drepturi și condiții de muncă echitabile pentru toți lucrătorii europeni și promovarea de politici care să vizeze reducerea inegalităților sociale și economice. Pe lângă politici sociale și economice solide, trebuie să se asigure accesul la o protecție socială adecvată pentru grupurile vulnerabile precum tinerii, vârstnicii și migranții. În concluzie, abordarea problemei ocupării forței de muncă la nivelul Uniunii Europene necesită o strategie coerentă și multidimensională. Prin unirea sub umbrela celor trei cuvinte-cheie - a reacționa, a evolua și a proteja - UE poate face pași importanți pentru a face față provocărilor viitoare în domeniul ocupării forței de muncă și pentru a construi o societate mai incluzivă și solidară pentru toți cetățenii săi."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: A TV journalist in China who was photographed for wearing sunglasses and holding an umbrella to shelter from the sun has been suspended from her job.","output":"Title: TV Journalist in China Suspended Over Sunglasses and Umbrella Controversy Introduction In a recent turn of events, a television journalist from China has been suspended from her job after her photograph went viral on social media. The picture showed the journalist wearing sunglasses and holding an umbrella to shield herself from the sun's rays. This seemingly innocent act, however, sparked an unexpected controversy, leading to her suspension. In this article, we will explore the incident, the reasons behind her suspension, and public reactions. The Incident The Chinese television journalist in question works for a local Chinese news network. In the photograph, she can be seen wearing sunglasses and holding an umbrella to protect herself from the sweltering sun while reporting outdoors. According to reports, the image was captured by a passerby and subsequently posted online, where it garnered significant attention and quickly went viral. Reasons for Suspension On one hand, one could argue that the journalist was simply following standard safety protocols while outdoors to protect herself from the harmful ultraviolet rays. Sunglasses and umbrellas or parasols have been used for centuries as a means of protection from the sun, and their use is especially prevalent in places with high temperatures and direct sunlight. On the other hand, some critics argue that her actions were unbefitting of a professional news reporter. They claim that her use of sunglasses and an umbrella while on duty might give people the impression that she is not serious about her job, or that it distracts viewers from her reporting. Furthermore, these critics believe that a journalist on air should abide by a certain level of professionalism and decorum in terms of appearance, which her actions seemingly jeopardized. It is important to note that the Chinese media industry adheres to strict regulations, and there have been previous instances where news anchors or reporters have been suspended or even fired for violating these guidelines. In this context, the journalist's employer may have wanted to avoid any potential backlash or controversy by taking measures against her behavior. Public Reaction The incident has drawn mixed reactions from the public. Many people on social media have come out in support of the suspended journalist, stating that her actions were not inappropriate or unprofessional. They argue that she was simply taking care of her health while working outdoors and claim that the suspension was unjust. Others, however, believe that the employer's decision was warranted. They argue that a professional journalist should maintain a certain level of appearance and that protecting oneself from the sun could have been achieved privately without having to appear on camera with sunglasses and an umbrella. These individuals assert that the journalist's behavior could potentially compromise the credibility of her reporting and the overall reputation of the news network. Conclusion In conclusion, the suspension of a Chinese television journalist for wearing sunglasses and holding an umbrella while reporting outdoors has sparked a significant debate on professionalism and expectations within the media industry. While some have criticized her actions, many others defend her right to protect her health and well-being in a public space. This incident raises crucial questions about the evolving roles and expectations of journalists in an increasingly public-facing profession."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: Passage: Due to extreme variation in elevation, great variation occurs in the climatic conditions of Himachal . The climate varies from hot and subhumid tropical in the southern tracts to, with more elevation, cold, alpine, and glacial in the northern and eastern mountain ranges. The state has areas like Dharamsala that receive very heavy rainfall, as well as those like Lahaul and Spiti that are cold and almost rainless. Broadly, Himachal experiences three seasons: summer, winter, and rainy season. Summer lasts from mid-April till the end of June and most parts become very hot (except in the alpine zone which experiences a mild summer) with the average temperature ranging from 28 to 32 °C (82 to 90 °F). Winter lasts from late November till mid March. Snowfall is common in alpine tracts (generally above 2,200 metres (7,218 ft) i.e. in the higher and trans-Himalayan region).

First, let's look at the numbers you have: 2266, 278, 2087, and 3991. 2. Now, you have to solve the equation: 2266 = 278*l + 2087 - 3991 3. To make things easier, let's solve the addition and subtraction parts first. So, you need to add 2087 and then subtract 3991:     2087 - 3991 = -1904  4. Now, substitute this value back into the equation:     2266 = 278*l - 1904 5. Next, we need to get the 'l' all by itself. So, let's add 1904 to both sides of the equation:     2266 + 1904 = 278*l    4170 = 278*l 6.

Plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops in Iraq to 50,000 by the end of this month are on schedule, Obama told the national convention of Disabled American Veterans. At that point, the U.S. mission will shift to the training and support of Iraqi security forces. A full withdrawal of American troops from Iraq is scheduled to occur by the end of next year.

Movie plot title: Cleopatra Movie plot: Claudette Colbert in Cleopatra In 48 BC, Cleopatra vies with her brother Ptolemy for control of Egypt. Pothinos (Leonard Mudie) kidnaps her and Apollodorus (Irving Pichel) and strands them in the desert. When Pothinos informs Julius Caesar that the queen has fled the country, Caesar is ready to sign an agreement with Ptolemy when Apollodorus appears, bearing a gift carpet for the Roman. When Apollodorus unrolls it, Cleopatra emerges much to Pothinos' surprise- he tries to deny who she is. However Caesar sees through the deception and Cleopatra soon beguiles Caesar with the prospect of the riches of not only Egypt, but also India. Later, when they are seemingly alone, she spots a sandal peeking out from underneath a curtain and thrusts a spear into the hidden Pothinos, foiling his assassination attempt. Caesar makes Cleopatra the sole ruler of Egypt, and begins an affair with her. Caesar eventually returns to Rome with Cleopatra to the cheers of the masses, but Roman unease is directed at Cleopatra. Cassius (Ian Maclaren), Casca (Edwin Maxwell), Brutus (Arthur Hohl) and other powerful Romans become disgruntled, rightly suspecting that he intends to abolish the Roman Republic and make himself emperor, with Cleopatra as his empress (after divorcing Calpurnia, played by Gertrude Michael). Ignoring the forebodings of Calpurnia, Cleopatra, and a soothsayer (Harry Beresford) who warns him about the Ides of March, Caesar goes to announce his intentions to the Senate. Before he can do so, he is assassinated. Cleopatra is heartbroken at the news. At first, she wants to go to him, but Apollodorus tells her that Caesar did not love her, only her power and wealth, and that Egypt needs her. They return home. Bitter rivals Marc Antony and Octavian (Ian Keith) are named co-rulers of Rome.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"The questions you have asked are not the same and pertain to different topics. I'll provide a detailed answer for each question separately. 1. Do professional poker players have day jobs? Professional poker players may or may not have day jobs, depending on their level of success, financial security, and personal preferences. For some poker players, the game itself is their primary source of income. These players invest a substantial amount of time and effort into honing their skills, analyzing opponents, and participating in high-stakes games and tournaments. They often find it challenging to maintain a day job alongside such commitments. However, many professional poker players do have day jobs, especially in the initial stages of their careers when they are still building their bankroll and gaining experience. These players typically have part-time or full-time jobs in various fields, which serve as a primary source of income and provide financial stability while they perfect their poker skills. Some players continue to work part-time even after achieving notable success in their poker careers, just to maintain steady income and a sense of balance in their lives. 2. How can you prepare for your first pap smear test? A Pap smear test, also known as a Pap test or cervical smear, is a routine medical examination that checks for any cellular changes in the cervix that could potentially indicate conditions such as cervical cancer. To prepare for your first Pap smear test, consider the following steps: a. Schedule your appointment: Schedule the test when you are not on your period. Ideally, it should be planned two weeks after the first day of your last menstrual cycle. Avoid scheduling during your period, as the presence of blood may interfere with the results. b. Avoid intercourse and vaginal products: For 24 to 48 hours before the test, abstain from sexual intercourse, using tampons, and applying vaginal creams or other products. These can affect the results of your test or cause discomfort during the examination. c. Prepare mentally: It is normal to feel nervous or anxious before your first Pap test. Research the procedure, understand its purpose, and be aware of what will happen during the examination. This can help you feel more comfortable and prepared. If you have concerns or questions, do not hesitate to discuss them with your healthcare provider. d. Dress comfortably: Wear comfortable, easy-to-remove clothing for the appointment. You will likely need to undress from the waist down for the examination, so wearing a skirt or dress might make the process easier for you. e. Arrive early: Give yourself ample time to fill out any necessary paperwork and discuss your medical history with the healthcare provider before the examination. This can help you feel more at ease and allow the appointment to run smoothly. f. Relax during the appointment: While the Pap smear test may feel slightly uncomfortable, it is generally not painful. Relax and take deep breaths during the examination, which typically lasts only a few minutes. Be sure to let the healthcare provider know if you experience any severe discomfort or pain. The two questions you have asked cover distinct topics: professional poker and medical examinations. These questions are not the same and require separate answers, as I have provided above."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In the rest of the world, China's supreme sage, Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu), is better known by the romanized name \\"Confucius.\\" He was born in 551 b.c. in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China. So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers. After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \\"Warring States\\" period (475–221 b.c.).  Question: \\"What kind of relationships did Confucius say must be hierarchical and dictorial, and if they are not what would happen?\\" Answer: \\"Ruler and subject\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"Yes, the answer is correct, but it is incomplete. Confucius emphasized several hierarchical and dictatorial relationships, including ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, and the individual and the state. Confucius believed that if these relationships were not properly maintained and respected, it would result in negative consequences for individuals, families, and entire nations. Disobedience or defying the established order would lead to disasters and chaos in society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: John Kenneth Galbraith  (October 15, 1908 - April 29, 2006), also known as Ken Galbraith, was a Canadian-born economist, public official, and diplomat, and a leading proponent of 20th-century American liberalism. His books on economic topics were bestsellers from the 1950s through the 2000s, during which time Galbraith fulfilled the role of public intellectual. As an economist, he leaned toward post-Keynesian economics from an institutionalist perspective. Galbraith was a long-time Harvard faculty member and stayed with Harvard University for half a century as a professor of economics. Context: In February 1946, Galbraith took a leave of absence from his magazine work for a senior position in the State Department as director of the Office of Economic Security Policy where he was nominally in charge of economic affairs regarding Germany, Japan, Austria, and South Korea. He was distrusted by the senior diplomats so he was relegated to routine work with few opportunities to make policy. Galbraith favored detente with the Soviet Union, along with Secretary of State James F. Byrnes and General Lucius D. Clay, a military governor of the US Zone in Germany from 1947 to 1949, but they were out of step with the containment policy then being developed by George Kennan and favored by the majority of the US major policymakers. After a disconcerting half-year, Galbraith resigned in September 1946 and went back to his magazine writing on economics issues. Later, he immortalized his frustration with \\"the ways of Foggy Bottom\\" in a satirical novel, The Triumph (1968). The postwar period also was memorable for Galbraith because of his work, along with Eleanor Roosevelt and Hubert Humphrey, to establish a progressive policy organization Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) in support of the cause of economic and social justice in 1947.  During his time as an adviser to President John F. Kennedy, Galbraith was appointed United States Ambassador to India from 1961 to 1963. His rapport with President Kennedy was such that he regularly bypassed the State Department and sent his diplomatic cables directly to the president. In India, he became a confidant of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and extensively advised the Indian government on economic matters. In 1966, when he was no longer ambassador, he told the United States Senate that one of the main causes of the 1965 Kashmir war was American military aid to Pakistan.  While in India, he helped establish one of the first computer science departments, at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. Even after leaving office, Galbraith remained a friend and supporter of India. Because of his recommendation, First Lady of the United States Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy undertook her 1962 diplomatic missions in India and Pakistan.  In autumn 1972 Galbraith was an adviser and assistant to Nixon's rival candidate George McGovern in the election campaign for the American presidency. During this time (September 1972) he travelled in to China in his role as president of the American Economic Association (AEA) at the invitation of Mao Zedong's communist government with the economists Leontief and Tobin and in 1973 published an account of his experiences in A China Passage. Galbraith wrote that there was \\"no serious doubt that China is devising a highly effective economic system,\\" \\"[d]issidents are brought firmly into line in China, but, one suspects, with great politeness,\\" \\"Greater Shanghai ... has a better medical service than New York,\\" and considered it not implausible that Chinese industrial and agricultural output was expanding annually at a rate of 10 to 11%. Question: What was the high point of his career? Answer:","output":"The high point of John Kenneth Galbraith's career was likely his tenure as the United States Ambassador to India from 1961 to 1963 during President John F.

The premise is that a bearded man is taking photographs with a camera and a long lens. The hypothesis is that a woman is looking at a magazine. Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise provides information about a bearded man's action of taking photographs. The hypothesis informs us about a woman's action of looking at a magazine. Both statements describe the actions of two different individuals who do not seem to have any direct relationship to each other based on the given information. Step 3: Evaluate if the premise supports the hypothesis. Since the premise and hypothesis discuss the actions of two different individuals with no clear connection, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the premise. The actions of the bearded man taking photographs do not provide any evidence or support for the claim that a woman is looking at a magazine.

Add 2 quarts (1.89 liters) of marble dust to the bucket and stir with a mixing rod or a wooden stick. You can get a wooden stick free at any paint store. Step 5: With the lime putty already in the bucket, adding the marble dust will create the main base for Venetian plaster. It is crucial to integrate these two ingredients properly to achieve the desired consistency and texture. Step 6: Use a mixing rod or a wooden stick to mix the lime putty and marble dust thoroughly. Ensuring there are no lumps or dry patches will result in a smoother and more uniform final product. Step 7: Once the lime putty and marble dust have been combined effectively, continue to mix vigorously until the mixture reaches a smooth, creamy consistency. Step 8: Optional, but advisable, is to add a tinted colorant to the plaster mixture according to your design preference. Gradually add the colorant while stirring continuously until you reach the desired color. Step 9: Apply the Venetian plaster to the desired surface using a steel trowel or spatula. Spread it evenly and thinly over the area, applying multiple layers if required. Make sure each layer dries completely before applying the next. This will give the plaster depth and texture, which is characteristic of Venetian plaster. Step 10: Once the final layer of plaster has dried, use a clean, slightly damp trowel to burnish the surface. This will remove any remaining imperfections and give the wall a glossy finish. The Venetian plaster is now complete."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

A small bronze sculpture that was dismissed as a 'humble' paperweight for decades has been confirmed as an £80,000 Barbara Hepworth. The 1965 work, called Oval Form, sat on the headteacher's desk at St Ives School for years and was originally used as a house prize when students performed well. But was revealed as 'probably the most expensive paperweight in the world' by stunned experts on BBC's Antiques Roadshow on Sunday. The £80,000 sculpture Oval Form, pictured, was originally used as a prize for academic achievement before it became one of the world's most expensive paperweights. David Harris, St Ives School head, said the paperweight would not leave the school in Cornwall, despite its value. He said: 'It's sitting on my desk so it's probably the most expensive paperweight in the world. Dame Barbara Hepworth, pictured, was a governor at St Ives School in Cornwall and gave the sculpture as a gift. She died in 1975. 'We have links to the art scene because we live and work in St Ives so we knew it was valuable but we'd not had it valued. We didn't know it was that valuable. 'Not that it is of any consequence because it's the school's and it will remain the school's. It's a fabulous piece of work and it's something which we do treasure.' Mr Harris said Oval Form was given to the school by the artist - who used to be a governor there - many years ago as a gift. It was used as a prize for the house that achieved the most academic merits each term. St Ives School librarian Jan Wardman took the 'paperweight' to show experts on the popular BBC show in Falmouth and beamed as she was told the news. Visibly excited Rupert Maas, an expert in ceramics and glass, told the show: 'It's by Barbara Hepworth. 'This is English Modernism, you know, you cannot confuse it with anything else. 'It is very tactile and made of bronze. It's worth £60,000 to £80,000. And it's a very important thing. It's a seriously exciting find. 'There's a lovely sense to it and turning it around is quite fun because it looks completely different from all angles. 'It's easy to forget that here in Cornwall we're actually at the cutting edge of Modernism really. Barbara Hepworth was really at the forefront of British Modernism.' Tourists flock to St Ives to see Barbara Hepworth's large bronze Modernist sculptures in the Hepworth Memorial Garden. Another sculpture sits outside the. Guildhall, home to St Ives Town Council but this smaller example of her. work is not widely known. TV antiques expert Rupert Maas, pictured, described the piece as a 'seriously exciting find' and said it was worth up to £80,000. The staggering valuation of the bronze was a surprise to the school, who expected it to be worth considerably less. Mr Harris added: 'It's not something we let out of our sight now. 'The guy on Antiques Roadshow said it will be in the upper reaches because it's such a beautiful domestic piece. 'For them it was a significant find. It did look lovely on the television with the light catching it. It is beautiful and a very tactile piece.'

Summarize this article: Last October seven island sites were granted dark sky status by an international body which recognises the best locations around the world. The government now wants to build on that number with a view to attracting astronomers from all over the planet. The Milky Way must be clearly visible to qualify as a dark sky site. The chairman of the Isle of Man Astronomical Society, Howard Parkin said: \\"Sites must be clear of light pollution, provide good sightlines of the sky and have good public access.\\". \\"All sites must have the approval of the relevant landowner,\\" he added. Mr Parkin is working with the government on the plan and believes the island could have dozens of suitable locations. The island's seven sites mean it already has the largest concentration of dark sky sites in Britain. The areas already recognised by the Dark Sky Association include Smeale Nature Reserve, Niarbyl and The Sound. Other areas that have been awarded the status are Port Soderick Brooghs, Axnfell Plantation Fort Island and Sulby Reservoir Car Park. The classification is given to promote astronomy and energy efficiency. A tourism spokesman said the development of specialist niche markets to attract high-spending visitors is a cornerstone of their current strategy. According to government figures visitor spending increased by more than 5% in 2012 to Â£103m, with spending by leisure visitors up by 14% to Â£47.7m. Mr Parkin added: \\"The beauty of the island is that it has very little light pollution. There are no motorways or large built up areas, so as a consequence you only have to drive a little way to find a dark sky site and enjoy the splendour of the night sky. \\"We are the only place which has seven locations in one area. The Isles Scilly have got five nominated sites but we already have seven approved and to be quite honest we could have 27. We have some of the clearest skies in Europe.\\" For the project to go ahead at least 15 more sites will need to obtain the status from the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh. People have until 31 July to submit their suggestions. Summary:","output":"In October last year, seven island sites in the Isle of Man were granted dark sky status by an international body that recognizes the best stargazing locations around the world.

Experts estimate  that about 200 million workers face a potential danger of occupational diseases and work-related injuries. The majority of them are farmers-turned-workers who are working in small or medium-sized firms. One of the most serious workplace diseases on the Chinese mainland is pneumoconiosis, a lung disease that is caused by breathing in too much dust of coal, silicon, and cerement. It causes serious breathing difficulties and can be fatal . The disease killed 966 people in the country last year, according to an official report released by the Ministry of Health yesterday. From the early 1950s until the end of last year, 607,570 people were diagnosed with pneumoconiosis. Among the number, 137,481 people died from the disease. Chen Xiaohong, vice minister of health, said the general level of prevention and control of workplace diseases is still quite low in China. \\"Health authorities  at various levels will do more education work in the future to raise employers\` awareness that they are the first person responsible for any workplace diseases or accidents,\\" Chen said. He made the remark at a ceremony held by his ministry and other relevant departments under the State Council to award prizes to 56 companies which have done well in protecting workers\` health. On the Chinese mainland, more than 16 million companies are engaged in potentially dangerous sectors, such as coal mining, construction, and those that use chemicals, according to the Ministry of Health.

The 19-metre (62.3ft) wave happened between Iceland and the United Kingdom, off the Outer Hebrides. It was created in the aftermath of a very strong cold front with 43.8 knot (50.4mph) winds on 4 February 2013. The WMO, which released the data, said the previous record was 18.275 metres (59.96ft) in December 2007. That wave was also in the North Atlantic. It is not the biggest-ever recorded wave, however. In 2002 a ship spotted a 29-metre (95 ft) North Atlantic wave. In 2014, the M4 Donegal buoy recorded a 23.4 metre wave, but the WMO said the new record was based on \\"significant wave height\\" which required certain measuring methods and observing periods. The buoy is part of the UK Met Office's network of Marine Automatic Weather Stations. Known as K5, it sits in the North Atlantic off the Western Isles The buoys complement ship-based measurements and satellite observations, which monitor the oceans and forecast meteorological hazards on the high seas. Giant waves can be created in the north Atlantic, which stretches from the Grand Banks plateau off the coast of Canada to the area south of Iceland and west of the UK. In winter, wind circulation and pressure systems cause extratropical storms, sometimes known as bombs, the WMO said.

Above, the bear is seen in chains after it was stabbed to death during the attack. But after they found the bear lying injured on the ground in the early hours of Saturday morning, it suddenly charged and pounced on the victim. The man started screaming as the bear clawed and bit him, before fatally stabbing the animal around 20 times with a hunting knife, according to Kare11.com. Fellow hunter Craig Lindstrom, from Wyoming, said: 'I heard him screaming - felt like 10 minutes, but was probably two minutes - literally screaming, and you knew he was being mauled. 'He made that thing die because he stabbed it about 20 times while it was chewing on his arm. He kept stabbing it  and it was pounding on him, a quarter of a ton - a 525 pound bear pounding on him.'

What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article narrates a drastic incident where a man, a hunter, was fiercely mauled by a 525lb black bear in the dense woodland near Duxbury, Minnesota. The victim was part of a group of hunters, who shot the bear with a bow and arrow and thereafter, waited four hours to track it down, to prevent the bear's meat from spoiling in the evening heat. Upon finding the bear lying injured, it incredibly charged onto the man, clawing and biting him brutally. In the ensuing attack, the man managed to fatally stab the bear around 20 times, eventually leading to the bear's death.  The repercussions of the attack were significant, as the anonymous man endued severe injuries, including two broken arms and wounds on his face, jaw, stomach, and legs. The quick response of Craig Lindstrom, a fellow hunter and trained Chicago city firefighter saved the man's life. Lindstrom led his friend half a mile out of the woods and contacted the Pine County Sheriff's Office. The victim was subsequently flown to the North Memorial Medical Center in Robbinsdale, where he was reported to be in stable condition. Moreover, the story emphasized that the hunters are licensed and undeterred by the incident, with Lindstrom expressing hope that his friend would recover in time for the next hunting season. It should be noted that an adult male black bear's weight can vary from 130 to 600lbs, with this particular bear weighing around 525lbs. This unfortunate narrative elucidates the potential dangers of hunting, and particularly highlights the unpredictability and retaliatory nature of wounded animals.

Start by making a basic “hmmm” noise in your throat in your lower range as you exhale a breath. Repeat this five to 10 times, then repeat the same sound with your mouth open for five to 10 breaths. With your mouth open, you should make an “ahhhh” noise. Humming is a great way to warm up and relax the muscles of your throat, face, neck, and shoulders, and it can also help you control your breathing. Once your voice is warmed up with basic humming, begin to warm up for pitch changes by humming do-re-mi up the scale and then back down. Start at the lower end of your pitch range, and when you complete one sweep up and down the scale, go to a higher key and repeat.  Repeat this for four or five ascending keys, then work your way back down those same keys. Lip trills, also called lip buzzing or bubbling, are an exercise that vibrates and warms up your lips as well as your voice. To create the lip trill, you close your lips loosely, pout them slightly, and blow air through them (think of making the sound of a motor or raspberry). Do this for two exhales, then start slowly shaking your head from side to side as you do three or four more lip trills. Repeat the lip trilling and head shaking, and as you do this make a “b” sound with your mouth as you do vocal sweeps starting with a high note and going low, and then coming back up. Make an “ng” sound in your nose as though you were just saying the final part of the word “sung.” Continue to make this noise as you do three to five pitch sweeps. Every time you go back up and down again, push your voice into a slightly higher and lower pitch range. This exercise helps you warm up the voice gradually, prevents over-exertion of the voice, and helps singers transition between their head and chest voices, which refers to the different places air resonates in the body when creating different sounds and pitches. Tongue twisters are great for articulation practice, and if you say them in different pitches and at different volumes, they can be a great way to warm up before singing. Some good tongue twisters to try out are:  Sally sells sea shells by the sea shore Teaching ghosts to sing Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers Unique New York The tip of the tongue, the lips, the teeth Really rural The big, black-backed bumblebee Red letter, yellow letter Summary:","output":"The article provides various vocal warm-up techniques, including humming, pitch changes, lip trills, making \\"ng\\" sounds, and practicing tongue twisters to help relax muscles, control breathing, and improve singing performance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On the living room table, Greg finds a glass of milk and a bowl of milk. The glass of milk has started to get thick, but the bowl of milk appears to be still fresh. Greg rolls his eyes at the mess and walks away.  Answer the following question: Which person will experience more tooth decay? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that Tony will experience more tooth decay compared to Greg. There are several factors contributing to this conclusion. Firstly, Tony is consuming a snack consisting of candy, which is typically high in sugar content. The bacteria in the mouth feed on these sugars and produce lactic acid as a waste product. This lactic acid can dissolve tooth enamel, eventually leading to cavities and tooth decay. In contrast, Greg is eating a stalk of celery, which is a much healthier snack option in terms of dental health. Celery is not only low in sugar but also can help clean teeth due to its fibrous texture. The act of chewing celery stimulates saliva production, which helps to neutralize acids in the mouth and wash away food particles stuck between teeth. This makes it less likely that Greg will develop tooth decay, at least in comparison to Tony. As for the milk products in the living room, it's worth noting that the lactic acid produced in fermentation contributes to the thickening of the milk, as mentioned in the background information. However, even if Greg consumes the thickened milk, it may not necessarily increase his risk of tooth decay significantly, especially when compared to Tony's candy consumption. Milk contains calcium, which is beneficial for teeth and can help to neutralize some of the acids in the mouth. So, while the thickened milk might not be as fresh, it should not significantly impact Greg's dental health. In conclusion, Tony is more likely to experience tooth decay due to his consumption of high-sugar candy, which promotes lactic acid production and tooth enamel erosion. On the other hand, Greg's choice of a healthier snack, celery, and the possibility of consuming milk products should not contribute as significantly to tooth decay. Therefore, Tony will likely experience more tooth decay than Greg."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Who kills the apprentice of the aged knight?

The answer is:","output":"The first step of the process is the transportation of air to the lungs. This occurs through the act of inhaling or breathing in. When we breathe in, air enters the nostrils or mouth and travels down the pharynx, through the larynx, and into the trachea. The trachea, also known as the windpipe, is a tube that connects the upper respiratory system to the lower respiratory system. The trachea then branches into two bronchi, each leading to one of the lungs.  Within the lungs, the bronchi continue to branch into smaller and smaller tubes called bronchioles. As the bronchioles extend deeper into the lung tissue, they eventually terminate at the alveoli, which are the smallest air sacs in the lungs. The primary function of the lungs is to facilitate the exchange of gases between the air we breathe and our bloodstream, with oxygen being taken in and carbon dioxide being expelled. The journey of air to the lungs begins with our diaphragm, which is a dome-shaped muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. During inhalation, the diaphragm contracts and moves downward, increasing the volume of the chest cavity. This action creates a vacuum, lowering the pressure inside the chest cavity relative to the outside air pressure. Air then rushes in through the mouth and nostrils, down the respiratory tract, and into the lungs to equalize the pressure. As we inhale and transport air to the lungs, we are setting the stage for the series of events that ultimately lead to the delivery of oxygen to our body's tissues. With each breath, the lungs work in concert with the cardiovascular system to ensure that oxygen is supplied to our vital organs, muscles, and cells, while carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, is removed and expelled from our body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: We've used the wind as an energy source for a long time. The Babylonians and Chinese were using wind power to pump water for irrigating crops 4,000 years ago, and sailing boats were around long before that. Wind power was used in the Middle Ages, in Europe, to grind  corn, which is where the term \\"windmill\\" comes from.  We can use the energy in the wind by building a tall tower, with a large propeller on the top. The wind blows the propellor round, which turns a generator to produce electricity. We tend to build many of these towers together, to make a \\"wind farm\\" and produce more electricity. The more towers, the more wind, and the larger the propellors, the more electricity we can make. It's only worth building wind farms in places that have strong, steady winds, although boats and caravans increasingly have small wind generators to help keep their batteries charged. The best places for wind farms are in coastal areas, at the tops of rounded hills, open plains and gaps in mountains - places where the wind is strong and reliable. Some are offshore. To be worthwhile, you need an average wind speed of around 25 km/h. Most wind farms in the UK are in Cornwall or Wales. Isolated places such as farms may have their own wind generators. In California, several \\"wind farms\\" supply electricity to homes around Los Angeles. The propellors are large, to obtain energy from the largest possible volume of air. The blades can be angled to cope with varying wind speeds. Some designs use vertical turbines  , which don't need to be turned to face the wind. The towers are tall, to get the propellors as high as possible, up to where the wind is stronger. This means that the land beneath can still be used for farming.

Answer the question...what was the purpose of the parade in washington in march 1913??","output":"The parade in Washington, D.C. in March 1913, officially known as the Woman Suffrage Procession, was a significant event in the American women's suffrage movement. Organized by the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), primarily under the leadership of Alice Paul and Lucy Burns, the parade aimed to garner attention, raise awareness, and build support for women's right to vote. The purpose of the Woman Suffrage Procession can be broken down into several key objectives: 1. Raise awareness for the suffrage movement: The parade, held on March 3, 1913, was designed to be a grand spectacle, attracting thousands of participants and onlookers. With marchers from various states and backgrounds, the event aimed to convey the broad support and nationwide appeal of the women's suffrage movement. 2. Demonstrate political power: By organizing the parade the day before President Woodrow Wilson's inauguration, the suffragists sought to demonstrate their political prowess. By having a high-profile event coincide with the start of a new presidential term, they hoped to send a clear message to the incoming administration of the importance of the suffrage movement and the need for action on the federal level. 3. Appeal to the masses: The parade was an opportunity to present the movement in an accessible and engaging way. Participants dressed in white, the color commonly associated with the suffrage movement, and were joined by floats, bands, and other theatrical elements, drawing attention from the press and public. Additionally, with well-known figures such as lawyer Inez Milholland leading the parade, the suffragists aimed to gain a wider audience for their cause. 4. Unify the movement: The Woman Suffrage Procession brought together a diverse group of women from different regions, political affiliations, and social backgrounds. This diversity was an essential aspect of the movement that helped to dispel the myth that women's suffrage only appealed to a minority of the population. The parade helped showcase the inclusive and collaborative spirit of the movement and endeavored to create a sense of unity among the various suffrage organizations and activists. 5. Expose injustices: The Woman Suffrage Procession was not without challenges. Parade participants encountered hostility, jeering, and even violence from the crowd. Police provided little assistance, and the situation became so dangerous that soldiers had to be called in to protect the marchers. This mistreatment of the participants was widely reported in the press, helping to expose the hypocrisy and injustice women faced as they campaigned for their right to vote. This negative experience further galvanized the movement and rallied supporters around the need for change. In summary, the Woman Suffrage Procession in Washington, D.C. in March 1913 aimed to increase awareness, demonstrate political power, appeal to the masses, unify the suffrage movement, and expose injustices faced by women. The event, despite the challenges encountered, was successful in gaining public support and attention for the movement, contributing to women's eventual achievement of the right to vote through the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In signing Argentina's same-sex marriage law, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner said debate over the issue would be \\"absolutely anachronistic\\" -- archaic, out of date -- within a few years. Striking down California's Proposition 8 two weeks later, Judge Vaughn Walker was more specific, saying there was no evidence for old-fashioned stereotypes that painted gays \\"as disease vectors or as child molesters who recruit young children into homosexuality.\\" Banning people from marrying based on sexual orientation, the President Reagan appointee explained, is \\"irrational.\\" \\"Often courts will make decisions that are predictors of what public opinion is going to be a few years from now,\\" said Brian Powell, an Indiana University sociology professor and co-author of the upcoming book, \\"Counted Out: Same-Sex Relations and Americans' Definitions of Family.\\" As Walker indicated, attitudes are changing, and waning are concepts that homosexuality harms children, defies biblical teachings or destroys the fabric of society. \\"Public attitudes don't change really quickly, but this is one that's changing really, really quickly,\\" Powell said. The trend is similar abroad, especially among younger people, said Suzanne Goldberg, a Columbia University law professor who heads the Center for Gender and Sexuality Law. The center has handled asylum cases for gay people fleeing persecution in countries including Jamaica, Brazil, Uzbekistan and Ivory Coast. Research indicates younger people are beginning to see sexual orientation as \\"benign variation, so that the differences between gay and nongay couples are simply not so interesting,\\" Goldberg said in an e-mail. \\"Once that happens, societies have less interest in distinguishing between relationships of gay and nongay couples,\\" she added. Before 2008, Massachusetts (via a court ruling) was the only U.S. state to legalize same-sex marriage, while the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Canada and South Africa were the only countries. Since then, four U.S. states, five countries, Washington, D.C., and Mexico City have legalized same-sex marriage. Watch why same-sex marriages are on hold in California. While some of these entities have track records of defending civil rights, some may appear more curious. South Africa resides on a continent particularly hostile to gay rights, and in some African countries same-sex relationships are punishable by penal labor, flogging, imprisonment or death, according to the International Lesbian and Gay Association. Mexico City, Portugal and Argentina, all of which legalized same-sex marriage this year -- and Spain, which OK'd it in 2005 -- are staunchly Catholic, and the church has made clear its aversion to same-sex relationships. Goldberg said she believes, in the Catholic countries, the emphasis on religion is trumped by a drive to ensure equality. \\"My sense is that the shift in the Catholic countries to recognize same sex-couples marriages stems from a complex set of political and social reasons and has been, in some nations, an indication of the church's shrinking political clout,\\" she said. Argentina may fit the bill, as the country is 92 percent Roman Catholic, yet only 20 percent of the population is practicing. Watch couple comment on Argentina's first same-sex marriage. A recent CNN poll said Americans were split 51 percent to 49 percent against granting gay and lesbian couples the right to wed. Proposition 8 was approved by a margin of 52 percent to 48 percent, but Powell noted referendums \\"do not necessarily reflect the will of the people.\\" Older people tend to cast more ballots than younger folks, he said, and heated issues draw special interests into elections, which can skew demographics. Powell has been collecting data on American attitudes since 2003. While the full data will be released in his book in September, his research adds a layer of nuance to the poll numbers: Though many Americans simply do or do not recognize gay couples as families, 80 percent of Americans consider gay partners a family if they have children. His research shows American definitions of family are becoming flexible, he said, likening the same-sex marriage debate to the rumblings preceding the 1967 U.S. Supreme Court decision authorizing interracial marriages. Before the miscegenation ruling, researchers found younger people, those with liberal religious views and voters with higher education levels had fewer qualms with interracial marriages. Similar lines hold true in today's same-sex marriage debate. Powell added another variable: gender. Women have a \\"more inclusive\\" definition of family, he said. Goldberg said demographics were also at play in other nations, \\"reaching a tipping point\\" on same-sex couples. These societies have had long-standing commitments to end discrimination against gays at work, in courts and elsewhere, she said. iReport.com: 'Army of lovers' fights for rights. There is also \\"an increased demand by same-sex couples together with an increased recognition that there really are not nonreligion-based reasons to exclude same-sex couples from marriage,\\" she said. The more open discourse on a topic, the more acceptance it garners, Goldberg and Powell concurred. Look to the tube. When Ellen DeGeneres kissed Laura Dern on her sitcom, \\"Ellen,\\" in 1997, there was enormous backlash. Today, same-sex smooches are ratings grabs and shows with prominent gay characters, such as \\"Modern Family\\" and \\"Glee,\\" are up for Emmys this month. \\"Once there is more discussion about it as a result of court cases, as a result of media representations, people become more comfortable,\\" Powell said. Added Goldberg, \\"It's also true that as gay people live openly and as same-sex couples' relationships are recognized more broadly, fears that the sky will fall because of same-sex couples' marriages tend to fade away from the mainstream.\\" Change is not swift everywhere, as the degree of acceptance around the world presently runs the gamut. Read Time.com's history of international gay marriage. In 2008, the U.N. General Assembly saw 66 countries declare they would support rights for gays and lesbians, yet a 2010 International Lesbian and Gay Association report said 76 countries punish people based on sexual orientation. The number last year was 77. India dropped off the list when its court changed the penal code in July 2009. \\"One country less compared to the 2009 list may seem little progress, until one realizes that it hosts one-sixth of the human population,\\" the report said. There are countries such as Iran, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen, which can put people to death for certain types of sexual behavior, according to the report. There are places such as Aruba and Israel that will recognize same-sex marriages but won't perform them. There are also about 20 countries or parts of countries that recognize civil unions. Goldberg said policies in Uganda, which drafted an anti-homosexuality bill that would strengthen the nation's maximum sentence from life in prison to capital punishment, and in Iran are stark contrasts to the rest of the world, which is reluctant to condemn gays openly. As for countries embracing civil unions, it's a compromise, Powell said. People are in favor of many gay rights, just not marriage, he said. Goldberg described it as \\"typically political, where the pro-equality communities have enough power to gain substantial recognition for same-sex couples but not enough to overcome resistance from the more conservative segments of the political community.\\" To those fighting for gay rights, Powell said, any step forward helps because it increases dialogue and people's comfort levels. \\"Contact makes things less scary, makes it more comfortable, and the more comfort you have the less opposition you're going to have,\\" he said. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"1. Argentina's President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner signed the same-sex marriage law and discussed how the debate on the issue would soon be considered outdated. 2.

Help as much as you can. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Following up from my recent blog post explaining why dietary supplements offer few benefits for most people, new research has found that people who take a mineral supplement actually consume more minerals from their normal diet than non-supplement users. The notion of the ‘worried well’ is certainly alive and kicking. Vitamin and mineral supplements are big business. Reported figures in Australia suggest that 27% of women and 15% of men take some form of supplement with vitamin C, B complex, multivitamins, vitamin E and calcium all being popular choices. Contrary to the rationale for needing supplements in the first place, people who take supplements are more likely to be healthier than people who don’t take supplements. Supplement users also tend to be leaner, smoke less, exercise more, and eat more fruit and vegetables. While it may seem obvious that people who take supplements likely consume more nutrients from their regular diet to start with, this hasn’t been well studied in large population groups. Using data from a nationally representative government health survey, researchers from the United States looked at the mineral intake from food and supplements of over 8000 men and women between 2003 and 2006. The results were clear cut: people taking mineral supplements were consuming more minerals from their normal diet than those who didn’t take supplements. The observation was even stronger in women than in men. The eight most popular mineral supplements taken were calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, copper, potassium and selenium. Proving that it is possible to have too much of a good thing, supplement users were more likely to be exceeding the recommended upper level of intake for magnesium, zinc, iron and calcium. For someone who believes that they are reasonably healthy and are conscious of what they eat most of the time, taking a mineral supplement ‘just in case’ offers little to no benefit.

Q:Information:  - Detroit is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Michigan, the fourth-largest city in the Midwest and the largest city on the United StatesCanada border. It is the seat of Wayne County, the most populous county in the state.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization to promote international co-operation. A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan, New York City, and experiences extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict.  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - A central business district (CBD) is the commercial and business centre of a city. In larger cities, it is often synonymous with the city's \\"financial district\\". Geographically, it often coincides with the \\"city centre\\" or \\"downtown\\", but the two concepts are separate: many cities have a central \\"business\\" district located away from its commercial or cultural city centre or downtown. Both the CBD and the city centre or downtown may also coincide with the central activities district.  - Information is that which informs. In other words, it is the answer to a question of some kind. It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts. As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon, for example), while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer.  - Americans are citizens of the United States of America. The country is home to people of many different national origins. As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity.  - Grosse Pointe Park is a city in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan .

The area includes a variety of natural landscapes, , and beaches, with a recreational coastline linking the Great Lakes. It is one of the nation's largest metropolitan economies, with seventeen Fortune 500 companies.  - Michigan is a state in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions of the United States. The name Michigan is the French form of the Ojibwa word \\"mishigamaa\\", meaning \\"large water\\" or \\"large lake\\". Michigan is the tenth most populous of the 50 United States, with the 11th most extensive total area (the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River). Its capital is Lansing, and its largest city is Detroit.  - The Great Lakes (also called the Laurentian Great Lakes, or the Great Lakes of North America) are a series of interconnected freshwater lakes located primarily in the upper mid-east region of North America, on the CanadaUnited States border, which connect to the Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lawrence River.

The total surface is , and the total volume (measured at the low water datum) is . Due to their sea-like characteristics (rolling waves, sustained winds, strong currents, great depths, and distant horizons) the five Great Lakes have also long been referred to as \\"inland seas\\". Lake Superior is the second largest lake in the world by area, and Lake Michigan is the largest lake that is entirely within one country. The southern half of the Great Lakes is bordered by the Great Lakes Megalopolis.  - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.  - A federal republic is a federation of states with a republican form of government. At its core, the literal meaning of the word republic when used to reference a form of government means: \\"a country that is governed by elected representatives and by an elected leader (such as a president) rather than by a king or queen\\".  - Grosse Pointe refers to a coastal area adjacent to Detroit, Michigan, USA, that comprises five adjacent individual cities. From southwest to northeast, they are:  - Sovereignty is understood in jurisprudence as the full right and power of a governing body to govern itself without any interference from outside sources or bodies. In political theory, sovereignty is a substantive term designating supreme authority over some polity.

From start to finish, every aspect of our visit was top-notch; from the warm hospitality extended by the thoughtful staff to the mouth-watering dishes that graced our table. Upon entering The Food Symphony, we were immediately struck by the cozy and relaxed ambiance of the restaurant, which was complemented by the low hum of cheerful conversations and the soft, ambient lighting. The host greeted us with a friendly smile and promptly seated us at a lovely table with a beautiful view of their quaint patio. As we perused the menu, I couldn't help but appreciate the range of delectable options available. The Food Symphony offers something for everyone, even catering to special dietary requirements such as vegan, gluten-free, and dairy-free options. Our server showed great knowledge of the menu and was able to make excellent suggestions based on our preferences.  We started with the house-made focaccia bread with a divine blend of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The taste was heavenly, as the warm and fluffy bread melted in our mouths. For appetizers, we tried the spicy shrimp ceviche and the ricotta-stuffed mushrooms. The ceviche was a perfect blend of spiciness and tang, with the shrimp marinated to perfection, while the mushrooms were tender, flavorful, and bursting with creaminess from the ricotta. For our main course, we opted for the pan-seared Chilean Sea Bass with garlic-lemon butter sauce and the Short Rib Ravioli accompanied by a porcini mushroom cream sauce. The sea bass was flaky and succulent, cooked to perfection with a delectable butter sauce that enhanced every bite. The ravioli was a true work of art, generously filled with melt-in-your-mouth short rib and bathing in a rich and flavorful mushroom sauce. By the time dessert rolled around, we could hardly fathom fitting more food into our satisfied stomachs. But, our server enticed us with the description of the chef's signature Tiramisu, so we had to try it - and we had absolutely zero regrets. With just the right balance of coffee and rich Mascarpone, the tiramisu sent our taste buds on an unforgettable journey. The whole experience was further enhanced by the exceptional attention to detail and attentive service from the staff. The pace of the meal was perfect, allowing us to savor each dish without feeling rushed. The servers regularly checked in to ensure we had everything we needed and promptly refilled our drinks when necessary. In conclusion, the flavors, textures, and presentation of each dish were simply outstanding. The Food Symphony made for an enjoyable, memorable evening, and I cannot wait until my next visit.

The series stars Bobby Cannavale as Richie Finestra, a record executive in the 1970s. It premiered on HBO on February 14, 2016, and concluded on April 17, 2016. What's the best answer to this question: is the show vinyl based on a true story?","output":"\\"Vinyl\\" is not explicitly based on a true story but it does draw heavily from the world of 1970s rock 'n' roll as informed by the real-life experiences and observations of its creators, especially Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger. The show's main character, Richie Finestra, portrayed by Bobby Cannavale, is a fictional character and his story, including his struggles with addiction and his turbulent personal life, is not based on any one individual's real life. Instead, he is a fictional amalgamation conceived by “Vinyl” co-creators, Mick Jagger, Martin Scorsese, Rich Cohen, and Terence Winter for the purposes of the series. The backdrop of the show, however, is rooted in a very real era. The series takes place in the 1970s, a time noted for its vibrant music scene and particularly, the explosive growth and evolution of rock 'n' roll. Martin Scorsese, acclaimed film director, is known for his meticulous period details and in \\"Vinyl,\\" he reconjures the decade with his signature flair. Mick Jagger, legendary frontman of The Rolling Stones, provided the insider view of the 70s music industry. Jagger’s own experiences as a musician during this time period influenced the atmosphere and characters seen in the show. Also showcased in the series are representations of real-life artists and bands of the era, like Alice Cooper, David Bowie, and The Velvet Underground, among others. These characters, however, are primarily used to accurately signify the music trends and culture of the era, rather than having their individual stories told.  Moreover, while the American Century record company is depicted as a powerhouse in the music industry, it is crucial to remember that it is not based on a single real-life record company. The series instead depicts a cultural composite of record companies during the 70s period, marked by cutthroat competition, indulgence, and innovation.  So, while \\"Vinyl\\" uses real-life elements and experiences to build its world, it is essential to view it as a creative dramatization, rather than an accurate historical account. The facts of the music industry in the 1970s serve more as inspiration and backdrop as opposed to being faithfully duplicated for the sake of retelling a specific true story. It's more truthful to say that \\"Vinyl\\" is influenced by true events and surroundings rather than based on one."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

PUBLISHED:. 13:28 EST, 24 January 2014. |. UPDATED:. 14:03 EST, 24 January 2014. Daniel Rodriquez jailed for a total of 12 years after an armed siege at his home in Kidlington, Oxon, in July last year. A man who took a cocktail of drugs before holding his two-year-old twin girls hostage in an armed siege was jailed for 12 years today. Daniel Rodriquez, 38, from Kidlington, Oxon, armed himself with an air rifle and an imitation handgun as his daughters slept in their beds following a domestic incident on July 9 last year. More than 50 officers in riot gear and. armed with guns surrounded the family flat in the early hours of the morning. The man twice fired at police as dozens of officers filled the streets for the pro-longed stand off. Rodriquez took a cocktail of. drugs including heroin, crack cocaine and valium while the police were. outside frantically trying to negotiate the children’s release, a court heard. Rodriquez was later restrained by officers with a Taser after the girls - wearing matching pyjamas - were carried from the property by police. The man pleaded guilty to possession of two firearms and two counts of using the firearms to resist arrest. Rodriquez was sentenced to 12 years behind bars at Oxford Crown Court today. Prosecutor Rachel Drake described the terrifying siege to the court. Miss Drake said: 'There was cordoning off of the areas and a very long siege situation involving negotiations between the defendant and the police. 'He was in a very agitated and distressed state and said he was considering taking his own life. 'Police were extremely concerned about the safety of the twin girls asleep in the bedroom next to the defendant. 'As the incident developed, the police were negotiating with Mr Rodriquez. About 9.30am, having supplied him with some food he passed down one of the girls. 'At 11.30am, the second of the children was passed through the window. There was no suggestion they were harmed during this incident.' An officer holds one of the man's daughters in his arms and takes her to safety following the siege. Despite handing over his children, the gunman still refused to come out of the flat. Miss Drake continued: 'Mr Rodriquez was not prepared to give himself up to the police for many hours afterwards. His arrest eventually took place in the foyer of the flat at 3.50pm. 'Following the defendant’s arrest, a full search was made of the flat and the two firearms were recovered.' The guns were found to be a .177 calibre air rifle and an imitation Colt Python handgun. Rodriquez appeared in court via a video link in prison wearing a navy and white hooped jumper. He stared forward blankly during the sentencing hearing and only spoke to confirm his name. At the time of his arrest, the father ran his own car wash firm Ace Power Wash Services in Kidlington, Oxon. One of the twins is removed from the property by an officer. The girls were wearing matching pyjamas as they were taken to safety. The court heard he had served six months in prison in 2002 for racially aggravated common assault, and had a string of convictions for theft, burglary, drug possession and ABH. His most recent conviction was for burglary and theft in 2011. In mitigation, his defence counsel Lucy Tapper said her client suffered mental health problems - including bipolar, depression and borderline personality disorder. She told the judge that Rodriquez loved his children and never intended them any harm during the hostage crisis. She said: 'The devastating cocktail of drugs and alcohol Mr Rodriquez had consumed, coupled with his overwhelming sense of anxiety and paranoia caused him to react in the way he did that morning when great numbers of police arrived at his house. 'The children were never, ever put in any direct danger by him. He had got them up in the usual way, got them breakfast and had them watching television. One officer reports hearing them laughing and playing in the back room.' Armed officers surround the flat in Kidlington. Rodriguez twice fired at police during the siege. Judge Ian Pringle commented that it was an 'appalling' case and said Rodriquez’s possession of the firearms was an 'aggravating factor' in the case. Jailing Rodriquez for 12 years, the judge said: 'Police staked out the house you were in with your two very small daughters. You released them one by one. 'That siege lasted until just before 4pm that afternoon - a serious aggravating feature of this case, no doubt brought about by your taking of a lethal cocktail of drugs over a huge period of time.' Rodriquez had pleaded guilty to possession of two firearms and two counts of using the firearms to resist arrest. For those counts, he received four years in jail. He was also jailed for eight years to run concurrently after he admitted three counts of rape and one sexual assault charge against a woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons. Speaking after the case, Detective Sergeant Jim Homes, the investigating officer from Thames Valley Police said he was 'satisfied' with the result of what was a 'very difficult' investigation. 'It was a very unusual case, not one that we’ve dealt with before,' he added. Rodriguez was sentenced to 12 years in jail today following the incident in July last year.

Answer the following question: Stan moved from the US to Australia, and he still gets confused because of the seasons in the southern hemisphere and the fact that they use the same calendar as the rest of the world.  Which month is colder in the northern hemisphere, June or December? Answer:","output":"December is the colder month in the Northern Hemisphere as compared to June. Here's a detailed explanation of why this is the case. The Earth revolves around the Sun and experiences variations in climate throughout the year due to its tilt and rotation. The Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of approximately 23.5 degrees. This tilt and the way the Earth rotates around the Sun are responsible for the change in seasons. In the Northern Hemisphere, June marks the beginning of the summer season, whereas December is the beginning of the winter season. During June, the North Pole is tilted towards the Sun, which results in warmer temperatures and longer daylight hours. This time of the year experiences the Summer Solstice, typically around June 21st, when the Northern Hemisphere experiences the longest day of the year in terms of daylight hours. On the contrary, in December, the North Pole is tilted away from the Sun. This leads to colder temperatures and shorter daylight hours as less solar energy reaches the Northern Hemisphere. Around December 21st, the region experiences the Winter Solstice, which is the day with the shortest period of daylight. It is essential to note that the seasons are opposite between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres because of the tilt of the Earth's axis. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. That is why Stan, who moved from the US (Northern Hemisphere) to Australia (Southern Hemisphere), still gets confused about the seasons in the southern hemisphere, despite using the same calendar as the rest of the world. In summary, December is the colder month in the Northern Hemisphere compared to June. This difference in temperature is due to the tilt of the Earth's axis and the Earth's rotation around the Sun, which result in distinct seasonal variations and more or less solar energy reaching different hemispheres during various times of the year."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Evaluating the expression, we get: -99 + 45 + 47 = -54 + 47 = -7 So now, our equation looks like this: -7*v = 0 Step 3: Solve for v. To solve for v, we'll isolate the variable by dividing both sides by -7: v = 0 / -7 Step 4: Simplify the equation.

Given the question: What's the name of the person Amah helps take care of?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In 1906 San Francisco, Frisco Jenny Sandoval, a denizen of the notorious Tenderloin district, wants to marry piano player Dan McAllister, but her saloonkeeper father Jim is adamantly opposed to it. An earthquake kills both men and devastates the city. In the aftermath, Jenny gives birth to a son, whom she names Dan. With financial help from crooked lawyer Steve Dutton, who himself came from the Tenderloin, she sets herself up in the vice trade, providing women on demand. Jenny has one loyal friend, the Chinese woman Amah, who helps take care of the baby. At a party in Steve's honor, he catches gambler Ed Harris (an uncredited J. Carrol Naish) cheating him in a back room. In the ensuing struggle, Steve kills him, with Jenny the only eyewitness. The pair are unable to dispose of the body before it is found and are questioned by the police. However, neither is charged. The scandal forces Jenny to temporarily give up her baby to a very respectable couple who owe Steve a favor to keep the child from being taken away from her. After three years, she tries to take her son back, but the boy clings to the only mother he can remember, so she leaves him where he is. He grows up and goes to Stanford University, where he becomes a football star, graduates with honors, and becomes first a lawyer, then an assistant district attorney. Jenny lovingly follows his progress. Meanwhile, she takes over the vice and bootlegging in the city.

The original premise states \\"In the resorts on the coast, many traders are aware that some tourists feel uncomfortable with bargaining, and will give you their best price straight away if you ask them to.\\" This statement implies the opposite of the conclusion presented. The premise suggests that there are traders at coastal resorts who understand the discomfort some tourists may feel when asked to haggle over prices. As a result, these traders are willing to provide their best price immediately upon request. It reflects an understanding of their customer's needs and a business approach that values customer comfort and satisfaction. Therefore, based on the original premise provided, it would be more accurate to conclude that \\"Some traders at coastal resorts are indeed willing to give their best offer immediately if asked.\\" This conclusion aligns with the information the premise provides and is supported by the understanding that these traders have adapted their selling strategies in response to some tourists' discomfort with bargaining. Additionally, while the premise states \\"many traders\\" will offer their best price if you ask them to, it doesn't imply that all do. It's possible that some traders may still default to bargaining as their primary method of setting a price for goods. So it might be necessary, depending on the specific trader, to clarify a tourist's willingness or lack thereof to negotiate prices.

Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: How do the survivors work on the farms ? Survivors work on the farms using primitive hand-held farming tools Answer:","output":"Title: The Fields of Hope Genre: Drama, Sci-fi, Adventure Plot Summary: In a post-apocalyptic world where technology has crashed, a group of survivors work diligently on their farms using primitive, hand-held tools to cultivate the land and build a better future. Their shared passion for agriculture changes their lives and the fate of humanity forever. Act I: In 2056, a cataclysmic event dubbed \\"The Fall\\" has led to the collapse of global technology, leaving the Earth in ruins. The world is now overrun by chaos, with warlords vying for power and resources. Amidst the tumultuous landscape, a small, close-knit group of survivors finds solace in working together on an isolated, abandoned farm. The story opens with the survivors scavenging for food and materials in the destroyed remains of a nearby city. They discover a library, where they find old books on primitive farming techniques. Inspired by these books, the group decides to put their newfound knowledge to use and begins working on the farm. Act II: As the survivors continue to work on the farm, using hand-held tools such as hoes, rakes, and shovels, they develop tight bonds with one another. They rely on each other for support, training, and encouragement, and their shared passion for farming blossoms. One day, while working in the fields, a young survivor named Ada discovers a mysterious underground bunker hidden beneath their farm. In the bunker, they find a trove of old-world seeds and agricultural equipment, giving them a more significant opportunity to expand their farm and improve their techniques. While the group revels in their newfound treasure, a dangerous warlord, Damien, learns about the farm and its valuable resources. He and his band of marauders advance on the farm with the intention of seizing it for themselves. The climax of Act II consists of a suspenseful battle between Damien's forces and the farm's defenders, led by the farm's unofficial leader, Emmet. Act III: Using their wits, cunning and determination, the survivors successfully defend their farm from Damien's forces and capture the marauders. However, rather than executing the attackers, Emmet offers them a choice: join the survivors in working on the farm or be released and left to fend for themselves in a harsh, unforgiving world. Moved by Emmet's show of mercy, some of Damien's warriors decide to abandon their violent ways and join the survivors in working on the farm. Together, the now-expanded group continues to cultivate the land, spreading their message of hope and cooperation to others throughout the region. Years pass, and the survivors' farm becomes a beacon of hope in a desolate world. Their dedication to agriculture, fueled by their primitive hand-held farming tools, helps to rekindle the lost knowledge of the past. As the farm prospers, it becomes the epicenter of a new civilization built upon the time-honored practices of cooperation, hard work, and sustainability. The movie concludes with a sweeping aerial view of the once-barren landscape, now transformed into a thriving, vibrant farmland - a testament to the power of human perseverance and the indomitable spirit of hope."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of muscle diseases that results in increasing weakening and breakdown of skeletal muscles over time. The disorders differ in which muscles are primarily affected, the degree of weakness, how fast they worsen, and when symptoms begin. Many people eventually become unable to walk. Some types are also associated with problems in other organs. There are nine main categories of muscular dystrophy that contain more than thirty specific types. The most common type is Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) which typically affects males beginning around the age of four. Other types include Becker muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, and myotonic dystrophy. They are due to mutations in genes that are involved in making muscle proteins. This can occur due to either inheriting the defect from one's parents or the mutation occurring during early development. Disorders may be X-linked recessive, autosomal recessive, or autosomal dominant. Diagnosis often involves blood tests and genetic testing. There is no cure for muscular dystrophy. Physical therapy, braces, and corrective surgery may help with some symptoms. Assisted ventilation may be required in those with weakness of breathing muscles. Medications used include steroids to slow muscle degeneration, anticonvulsants to control seizures and some muscle activity, and immunosuppressants to delay damage to dying muscle cells. Outcomes depend on the specific type of disorder. Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which represents about half of all cases of muscular dystrophy, affects about one in 5,000 males at birth. Muscular dystrophy was first described in the 1830s by Charles Bell. The word \\"dystrophy\\" is from the Greek \\"dys\\", meaning \\"difficult\\" and \\"troph\\" meaning \\"nourish\\". Gene therapy, as a treatment, is in the early stages of study in humans.  - Potassium is a chemical element with symbol K (derived from Neo-Latin, \\"kalium\\") and atomic number 19. It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, from which its name derives. In the periodic table, potassium is one of the alkali metals. All of the alkali metals have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell, which is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge  a cation, which combines with anions to form salts. Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac-colored flame. It is found dissolved in sea water (which is 0.04% potassium by weight), and is part of many minerals.  - Myasthenia gravis ( from Greek  \`\` muscle '' ,  \`\` weakness '' , and Latin : gravis \`\` serious '' ; abbreviated MG ) is a neuromuscular disease that leads to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue . In the most common cases , muscle weakness is caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction , inhibiting the excitatory effects of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine on nicotinic receptors at neuromuscular junctions . Alternatively , in a much rarer form , muscle weakness is caused by a genetic defect in some portion of the neuromuscular junction that is inherited at birth as opposed to developing through passive transmission from the mother 's immune system at birth or through autoimmunity later in life . Myasthenia is treated with medications such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or immunosuppressants , and , in selected cases , thymectomy ( surgical removal of the thymus gland ) . The disease is diagnosed in 3 to 30 people per million per year . Diagnosis is becoming more common due to increased awareness .  - A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity.  - Muscle weakness or myasthenia (my- from Greek  meaning \\"muscle\\" + -asthenia  meaning \\"weakness\\") is a lack of muscle strength. The causes are many and can be divided into conditions that have either true or perceived muscle weakness. True muscle weakness is a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases, including muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathy. It occurs in neuromuscular junction disorders, such as myasthenia gravis. Muscle weakness can also be caused by low levels of potassium and other electrolytes within muscle cells. It can be temporary or long-lasting (from seconds or minutes to months or years).  - A motor neuron (or motoneuron) is a nerve cell (neuron) whose cell body is located in the spinal cord and whose fiber (axon) projects outside the spinal cord to directly or indirectly control effector organs, mainly muscles and glands. Motor neurons' axons are efferent nerve fibers that carry signals from the spinal cord to the effectors to produce effects. Types of motor neurons are alpha motor neurons, beta motor neurons, and gamma motor neurons.  - Muscle is a soft tissue found in most animals. Muscle cells contain protein filaments of actin and myosin that slide past one another, producing a contraction that changes both the length and the shape of the cell. Muscles function to produce force and motion. They are primarily responsible for maintaining and changing posture, locomotion, as well as movement of internal organs, such as the contraction of the heart and the movement of food through the digestive system via peristalsis.  - Muscle contraction is the activation of tension-generating sites within muscle fibers. In physiology, muscle contraction does not mean muscle shortening because muscle tension can be produced without changes in muscle length such as holding a heavy book or a dumbbell at the same position. The termination of muscle contraction is followed by muscle relaxation, which is a return of the muscle fibers to their low tension-generating state.  - Weakness or asthenia is a symptom of a number of different conditions. The causes are many and can be divided into conditions that have true or perceived muscle weakness. True muscle weakness is a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases, including muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathy. It occurs in neuromuscular junction disorders, such as myasthenia gravis.  - Chemical synapses are biological junctions through which neurons' signals can be exchanged to each other and to non-neuronal cells such as those in muscles or glands. Chemical synapses allow neurons to form circuits within the central nervous system. They are crucial to the biological computations that underlie perception and thought. They allow the nervous system to connect to and control other systems of the body.  - A nerve is an enclosed, cable-like bundle of axons (nerve fibers, the long and slender projections of neurons) in the peripheral nervous system. A nerve provides a common pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses that are transmitted along each of the axons to peripheral organs.  - Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a long term neuromuscular disease that leads to varying degrees of skeletal muscle weakness. The most commonly affected muscles are those of the eyes, face, and swallowing. It can result in double vision, drooping eyelids, trouble talking, and trouble walking. Onset can be sudden. Those affected often have a large thymus gland or develop a thymoma. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease which results from antibodies that block nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the junction between the nerve and muscle. This prevents nerve impulses from triggering muscle contractions. Rarely an inherited genetic defect in the neuromuscular junction results in a similar condition known as congenital myasthenia. Babies of mothers with myasthenia may have symptoms during their first few months of life, known as neonatal myasthenia. Diagnosis can be supported by blood tests for specific antibodies, the edrophonium test, or nerve conduction studies. Myasthenia gravis is generally treated with medications known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine and pyridostigmine. Immunosuppressants, such as prednisone or azathioprine, may also be used. The surgical removal of the thymus gland may improve symptoms in certain cases. Plasmapheresis and high dose intravenous immunoglobulin may be used during sudden flares of the condition. If the breathing muscles become significantly weak, mechanical ventilation may be required. Myasthenia gravis affects 50 to 200 per million people. It is newly diagnosed in 3 to 30 per million people each year. Diagnosis is becoming more common due to increased awareness. It most commonly occurs in women under the age of 40 and in men over the age of 60. It is uncommon in children. With treatment most of those affected lead relatively normal lives and have a normal life expectancy. The word is from the Greek  \\"muscle\\" and asthenia \\"weakness\\", and the \\"serious\\".  - Inflammatory myopathy (inflammatory muscle disease or myositis) is disease featuring weakness and inflammation of muscles and (in some types) muscle pain. The cause of much inflammatory myopathy is unknown (idiopathic), and such cases are classified according to their symptoms and signs and electromyography, MRI and laboratory findings. It can also be associated with underlying cancer. The main classes of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy are polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM), and inclusion-body myositis (IBM).  - An electrolyte is a substance that produces an electrically conducting solution when dissolved in a polar solvent, such as water. The dissolved electrolyte separates into cations and anions, which disperse uniformly through the solvent. Electrically, such a solution is neutral. If an electric potential is applied to such a solution, the cations of the solution are drawn to the electrode that has an abundance of electrons, while the anions are drawn to the electrode that has a deficit of electrons. The movement of anions and cations in opposite directions within the solution amounts to a current. This includes most soluble salts, acids, and bases. Some gases, such as hydrogen chloride, under conditions of high temperature or low pressure can also function as electrolytes.

Title: 1 good track, 22 boring tracks. Review: This CD may well kick off with a roaring and rocking guitar riff that is Carpenter performing at his absolute best but the rest is dull as ditchwater. There are no themes in any of these tracks. It's actually a lot like the ambient music in the Myst and Riven soundtracks. Only those CDs are cool and the music within is haunting and etheral. If you dig this kind of music then by all means by those instead. ITMOM may well begin with some of the best electric guitar sounds ever, but the CD is not worth buying. A shame really, because Carpenter is a truly gifted musician. Answer: OPT: (A). No; (B). Yes; Answer:","output":"(A). No; Step 1: Analyze the title and key phrases within the review. The title of the review is \\"1 good track, 22 boring tracks,\\" which implies that the reviewer found only one enjoyable track out of 23. Phrases such as \\"dull as ditchwater,\\" \\"no themes,\\" \\"not worth buying,\\" and \\"a shame\\" buttress the impression that the review is predominantly negative. Step 2: Consider the balance of positive and negative remarks. Although the reviewer recognizes Carpenter's talent as a \\"truly gifted musician\\" and praises the first guitar track, the bulk of the review emphasizes disappointment. As such, the balance skews negative. Step 3: Compare the review's tone with the definitions of positive and negative. As the review expresses more dissatisfaction than satisfaction, it is ultimately negative, and thus, the answer is (A). No."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

For some reason the father doesn't ascertain that the nurse is going to be there at the beginning to make sure that everything is set, so the whole thing goes very bad very quickly.The son is trying to help the mother or thinks he is. The mother is pleading for a real nurse. At the half hour mark the camera gets sped up and schizophrenia is a bad music video.Somewhere along the way everyone suffers and life is pointless.This movie felt like some guy with a very big house always wanted to be in the movies.

Question: how many presidential terms did fdr serve I found the following answer on Google: Roosevelt is consistently rated by scholars as one of the top three U.S. Presidents , along with Abraham Lincoln and George Washington . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer to this question is:","output":"No, the information provided does not directly answer the question about how many presidential terms Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) served. However, I can provide you with a detailed and long answer. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, commonly known by his initials FDR, was the 32nd President of the United States. He served from 1933 to 1945, making him one of the most memorable leaders in American history. FDR served an unprecedented four terms in office, which is more than any other president in U.S. history. FDR's long presidency can be divided into two main time periods: the Great Depression and World War II. He first took office during the Great Depression, implementing a series of programs and policies known as the New Deal. These initiatives aimed to provide relief for millions of Americans who were suffering due to widespread unemployment and economic decline. The New Deal included public works programs, financial reforms, and relief efforts – all designed to help the nation recover from the Great Depression. As his first two terms progressed, the U.S. began to see economic improvement. FDR was reelected for a second term in 1936, continuing his administration's efforts to strengthen the American economy. The New Deal expanded during his second term, with additional programs being implemented to further combat unemployment, poverty, and other social issues. During FDR's third term, which began in 1941, the United States entered World War II. FDR's leadership during the war focused on building a strong military presence, forming alliances with other nations, and implementing strategies to defeat the Axis powers. The war efforts helped to further improve the U.S. economy, as more jobs became available in manufacturing, agriculture, and other industries. FDR was reelected for a fourth term in 1944 despite concerns about his health. He continued to lead the United States during the final stages of World War II, working closely with allied leaders such as Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin. However, FDR did not live to see the end of the war. He died of a cerebral hemorrhage on April 12, 1945, just a few months into his fourth term. Vice President Harry S. Truman took over as President and led the United States through the conclusion of the war in August 1945. After FDR's unprecedented four terms in office, the 22nd Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed in 1951, limiting future presidents to serving a maximum of two terms."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mugabe Wins Again in Zimbabwe, Leaving Rival Greatly Weakened HARARE, Zimbabwe â President Robert Mugabe, who has led Zimbabwe since it threw off white rule in 1980, won another term on Saturday as the official results were announced for last weekâs hotly disputed election, defeating his main challenger with 61 percent of the vote and roaring back to secure his grip on power after having to share it for the past five years. The Zimbabwe Election Commission announced the results moments after the challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, denounced the voting, saying it had been rigged. âThis fraudulent and stolen election has plunged Zimbabwe into a constitutional, political and economic crisis,â Mr. Tsvangirai, who won 33 percent of the vote, said in a news conference at his house. He demanded that a new election be held so that Zimbabweans could âfreely and fairly elect a government of their choiceâ â a step that a spokesman for Mr. Mugabeâs party, ZANU-PF, quickly rejected. Secretary of State John Kerry also cast doubt on the validity of the election in a statement on Saturday. âIn light of substantial electoral irregularities reported by domestic and regional observers, the United States does not believe that the results announced today represent a credible expression of the will of the Zimbabwean people,â Mr. Kerry said. But regional election observers suggested that any flaws were not serious enough to invalidate the voting. The victory was a stunning comeback for Mr. Mugabe. After the disputed 2008 election, in which he won fewer votes than Mr. Tsvangirai did, he was forced into forming a unity government. This time, Mr. Mugabeâs party won more than two-thirds of the seats in Parliament, giving it a supermajority that can make changes to the countryâs Constitution without votes from other parties. The election was also a vivid illustration of how Mr. Tsvangiraiâs Movement for Democratic Change, or M.D.C., has been outmaneuvered and outfoxed at every turn by Mr. Mugabe, 89, a wily survivor who endured colonial rule, a brutal guerrilla war and multiple attempts to unseat him during his 33 years as Zimbabweâs leader. âThe party has been to blame for ZANUâs success across the board,â said Stephen Chan, a professor at SOAS, the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London, who has written a biography of Mr. Mugabe. After the 2008 vote, the M.D.C. agreed to work with Mr. Mugabeâs party, but did not become an equal partner. âWhat they got was a compromise deal that was almost worse than being in opposition,â Mr. Chan said. One of the partyâs biggest missteps came in June, after Mr. Mugabe unilaterally declared that an election must be held by the end of July, just six weeks later, usurping Parliament. The M.D.C.âs leaders were prepared to tell the heads of state who had gathered for the meeting of the Southern African Development Community, a regional trade bloc, that the party would boycott the election. But the regional leaders at the meeting persuaded Mr. Mugabe to agree to ask the countryâs constitutional court for a two-week extension, and his main challenger for the presidency, Mr. Tsvangirai, agreed to go ahead with the election, according to Douglas Mwonzora, the M.D.C.âs spokesman. The courts refused to extend the deadline, and a messy, rushed election was held on Wednesday. âWe didnât expect the Zimbabwean courts and Mr. Mugabe to go against the resolution of S.A.D.C.,â Mr. Mwonzora said. It would turn out to be just one of a long list of miscalculations that have left the M.D.C., the most credible threat to Mr. Mugabeâs long rule, with not quite a third of the seats in Parliament and few options to contest the election results. Mr. Tsvangirai plans to go to court, but the higher courts in Zimbabwe are filled with Mr. Mugabeâs loyal appointees. The election results were a far cry from the 2008 vote, in which neither man won a majority. Mr. Tsvangirai then refused to participate in a runoff because of attacks that had killed hundreds of his supporters. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Robert Mugabe secures another presidential term in Zimbabwe despite accusations of electoral fraud and rigging from his main challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, who demands a new election.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? that ca n't totally hide its contrivances","output":"The given review appears to convey a negative opinion of the movie. The reviewer uses the phrase \\"that can't totally hide its contrivances,\\" which indicates that they feel the movie contains elements that seem artificial or forced. Contrivances in filmmaking refer to situations or plot devices that are not organic to the story but are rather created to advance the narrative or inject a certain emotion or theme. When a movie is unable to hide such forced elements, it can come across as poorly executed, inauthentic, or manipulative, leading to a negative viewing experience for the audience. Moreover, the reviewer seems to suggest that the movie has tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to conceal these contrivances. This further reiterates their dissatisfaction with the film, as it may indicate that they were not fully immersed in the story or could not connect with the characters due to these artificial elements. In conclusion, the review can be seen as negative because it highlights a significant flaw in the movie, namely its inability to completely hide the contrived aspects that impair the overall film experience for the viewer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Van Winkle has never known his biological father; he was given the family name of the Dutch man his mother was married to at the time of his birth. When Van Winkle was four, his mother divorced. Afterward, he grew up moving between Dallas and Miami, where his new stepfather worked at a car dealership. After almost non-stop touring for the previous three years, Ice took a break from music in 1993 and began competing in jet skiing (becoming the 6th best jet ski racer in the world and obtaining sponsorship from Kawasaki) as well as resuming Motocross racing.  By 1994, Ice received less publicity and became removed from the public spotlight. After becoming more interested with the Rastafari movement, Ice became a vegetarian, grew dreadlocks and talked more openly about smoking cannabis. On March 22, 1994, Ice released his second studio album, Mind Blowin'. Reviews were unfavorable. Entertainment Weekly reviewer James Bernard called the album \\"more clunky than funky\\". Rolling Stone reviewer Danyel Smith praised the song \\"Get Loose\\" as \\"snappy\\", writing that although the lyrics are \\"inane\\", \\"the song is a thumping party, one of the few places where Ice loosens up. He sounds solid at the beginning of 'The Wrath' as well ... In 'Now and Forever,' a wet dream kind of song, Ice goes back to goofy lyrics.\\" Allrovi reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that \\"There isn't a single moment that establishes a distinct musical identity, and the whole thing is rather embarrassing.\\" Primus bassist Les Claypool stated in response to Ice's cannabis-oriented lyrics: \\"That's all fine and dandy and cute, but it could be misconstrued and manipulated by the wrong people.\\" When asked about the drug oriented sound years later, Vanilla Ice said \\"A lot of the record is drug oriented because I was doing a lot of drugs at the time\\". Shortly afterward, SBK went bankrupt.  At around this time, Ice began using ecstasy, cocaine and heroin. During periods of heavy drug use, Ice received many tattoos from artist acquaintances. According to Ice, he \\"was in [his] binge days. [He] didn't even realize how many [he] was getting\\". Ice attempted suicide with a heroin overdose on July 4, 1994 but was revived by his friends. After being revived, Ice decided that it was time to change his lifestyle. As a symbol of his attempt to begin anew, he got a tattoo of a leaf on his stomach. After expanding his Mind Blowin tour overseas in 1995, Ice sold his estate in California and took a break from music, rather focusing on motocrossing and jet skiing in Florida. By the summer Ice was the world's No. 6-ranked sit-down Jet Ski racer, competing nearly every weekend and earning a Kawasaki sponsorship.  Uncertain about his future career, Ice studied real estate and started working on the side renovating and selling houses. In late 1995, Ice set up a recording studio in Miami and joined a grunge band, Pickin Scabz. The name was set to reflect Ice's career and how he was healing from his suicide attempt and that he was now \\"picking up the pieces\\". Ice expressed an interest in performing hip hop-influenced rock music, but found that the band was unable to produce the sound he was looking for. In 1996, longtime associate and friend Monte Lipman signed Ice as an artist for Universal Republic Records.

Review: I bought one of the early models of TiVo, and added drive space to make it a 110 hour unit. I wouldn't bother watching TV without it. It really is everything it promises. I don't know what time a lot of my programs come on, or what day of the week, I just watch them when I feel like watching them. I have a one year old daughter, and I would especially reccomend TiVo to new parents. Without the ability to pause, or just stop and come back to it later, a new parent can't expect to watch anything all the way through.Setup may be a bit complex, but once it's in place, it is simple to operate. My mother in law can figure it out when she comes to town. She can't figure out our X-10 remote control lights, or her own e-mail, but she can set TiVo to record her programs and figure out what she wants to watch. If she can do it, anyone can.We use our TiVo so much we are planning on getting one for the little TV in our bedroom. Answer: Answer:","output":"Yes, this product review is positive.

Accompanied by both his sons, Gruber travels to Salzburg, hoping to buy spare parts and then mend the organ when returning to the village. The party is caught in a snow storm and the spare part is lost on the way home but pastor Joseph Mohr is simply thankful they are unharmed. Pastor Mohr (with a little help from the bell-ringer Otto) writes the lyrics for a song and the next morning he brings it to Gruber, asking him to compose a melody for the lyrics. With some inspiration from his wife, Gruber sets music to Mohr's words.

A blood letter.","output":"No, the word \\"letter\\" has different meanings in these two sentences as it is being used in different contexts. Let's examine each sentence to better understand the difference in meaning. - In the first sentence, \\"Mailed an indignant letter to the editor,\\" the word \\"letter\\" refers to a written or printed message, usually put on a piece of paper, and sent to a recipient. In this context, the \\"letter\\" typically includes a greeting, body, and closing, describing the sender's thoughts, concerns, or feelings. The term \\"indignant\\" suggests that the letter contains strong feelings of anger or annoyance about unfair treatment, and it is addressed to the editor, implying that it's sent to a newspaper or publication as a response to something printed in it. - In the second sentence, \\"A blood letter,\\" the word \\"letter\\" is a part of a compound word, \\"bloodletter,\\" which has a different meaning altogether. A bloodletter is a historical term referring to a person who practiced bloodletting, a medical procedure in which a small amount of blood is removed from a patient to treat or prevent illness. Bloodletting was based on the belief that draining off a portion of the patient's blood could balance bodily humors, helping to cure diseases or restore health. It's worth mentioning that bloodletting is an outdated practice and not used in modern medicine. In conclusion, the word \\"letter\\" in these two sentences takes on different meanings. In the first one, it refers to a written message sent to an editor, while in the second, it's part of a compound word referring to a person who performed bloodletting.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power.

Choices:  - budding  - nuclear fission  - sexual reproduction  - binary fission  A:","output":"Bacteria reproduce primarily through a process called binary fission. In binary fission, a single bacterial cell, known as the parent cell, duplicates its genetic material (DNA) and then divides into two identical daughter cells. This is an asexual form of reproduction, meaning it does not require the exchange of genetic material between two different parent cells. The steps involved in binary fission are as follows: 1. Replication of DNA: The circular DNA molecule inside the bacterial cell replicates, creating two identical copies of genetic material. 2. Segregation of DNA: The replicated DNA molecules move to opposite ends of the cell. 3. Cytokinesis: The cell membrane and cell wall begin to grow inwards at the center of the cell, forming a septum that eventually divides the cell into two equal parts. 4. Separation: The two daughter cells separate, completing the binary fission process. Each daughter cell contains a complete copy of the parent cell's DNA and can continue to grow and divide. It's important to note that some bacteria are capable of exchanging genetic material through processes like conjugation, transformation, and transduction, but these methods are not the primary means of reproduction for bacteria. Instead, they serve as ways to create genetic diversity and promote adaptation within bacterial populations. So, the main mode of bacterial reproduction is binary fission."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Additionally, \\"Fred\\" is the only male noun mentioned before the pronoun \\"he.\\" To analyze and better understand this sentence, we can break it down into two main clauses: 1. Steve follows Fred's example in everything. 2. He influences him hugely. In the first clause, it is evident that Steve admires and follows Fred's actions or choices. The possessive noun, \\"Fred's example,\\" implies that Fred sets a pattern or exhibits behavior that Steve imitates.

Process:  - Skin is cut or damaged - Bacteria enters through the wound - The bacteria reproduces and spreads - Causes symptoms - The bacteria is either fought off or becomes a disease.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose wound is dirty happens, how will it affect LESS SEVERE disease occurring.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"If a wound is dirty, it can indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the process, leading to a less severe disease. When a wound gets contaminated with dirt or other substances, it can affect the body's response to the infection and the infection itself in several ways. Here's a detailed explanation of how a dirty wound may lead to a less severe disease, considering the process you provided: 1. Skin is cut or damaged: When the skin is cut or damaged, it loses its natural barrier against the outside environment, including harmful bacteria and other pathogens. The presence of dirt in the wound area may introduce additional foreign particles and bacteria, which then have direct access to underlying tissues and blood vessels. 2. Bacteria enter through the wound: Bacteria present in the dirt can easily enter the wound, along with some other dirt particles. Usually, the immune system will respond to these invaders accordingly. However, some of the less harmful bacteria in the dirt may actually be competing with more harmful bacteria and limiting their growth (competitive exclusion). In this case, a dirty wound could potentially help reduce the severity of the disease, as the less harmful bacteria can suppress the growth of the more dangerous pathogens. 3. Bacteria reproduce and spread: When bacteria enter the wound, they reproduce and spread, initiating an immune response. As mentioned earlier, the presence of other less harmful bacteria in the dirty wound can compete for resources with more dangerous pathogens, which can slow down their growth rate. This decreases their ability to colonize and infect the surrounding tissues quickly, which may result in a less severe disease. 4. Causes symptoms: The presence of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from the damaged tissue and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from the bacteria can trigger an immune response, leading to inflammation and other symptoms. The immune system may respond more strongly to a dirty wound to eliminate the foreign particles and various bacteria. So, the presence of less harmful bacteria and foreign particles in the wound can lead to a relatively mild response, reducing the overall severity of the disease. 5. The bacteria is either fought off or becomes a disease: The immune system may successfully fight off the infection in a dirty wound, or it may develop into a disease. However, due to the competition between less harmful and more harmful bacteria, the overall impact of bacteria in a dirty wound may be less severe than if only harmful bacteria were present. By limiting the growth of the more aggressive bacteria, the less harmful microorganisms can indirectly contribute to a less severe disease. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis where the wound is dirty can have both direct and indirect effects on the process, potentially leading to a less severe disease. The presence of less harmful bacteria and other particles in the wound may contribute to a reduced bacterial growth rate, a milder immune response, and a lower likelihood of developing a severe infection. However, it's essential to note that dirty wounds also carry a higher risk of complications and severe infections, so proper wound care and treatment are crucial."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Clinton emphasized her own experience as first lady, senator and secretary of state, saying she would provide the steady diplomacy the country needs. “National security is the foundation of how we make sure our interests are pursued in the world,” said Louis Goodman, Emeritus Dean of International Relations at American University in an interview with VOA.

Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll give very good performances as Bessie and Sadie, respectively. Amy Madigan also is good as Amy Hill Hearth, the white New York Times reporter whose article about the sisters launched the book, etc. Many of the flashback scenes and even many of the present-day ones are very powerful, if not quite as inspirational as in the book. That is the only real drawback, combined with the fact that certain aspects of the story are not presented clearly, such as the inter-racial background of the sisters' mother and why their father was so stern. But other than that, a very well-done, excellently performed, powerful movie. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","output":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly positive. The reviewer appreciates the film adaptation of the book and Broadway play, commending it for its portrayal of Sadie and Bessie Delany's lives. Praise is bestowed upon actors Ruby Dee, Diahann Carroll, and Amy Madigan for their performances, indicating satisfaction with the film's casting and acting. The reviewer also finds the flashback scenes and present-day scenes powerful, which shows an appreciation of the film's narrative structure and technique. The reviewer does, however, share some constructive criticism; they perceive a slight lack of inspirational effect compared to the book and a lack of clarity on specific aspects of the story. Despite these minor critiques, the overall tone remains appreciative, and the film is ultimately deemed \\"very well-done,\\" \\"excellently performed,\\" and \\"powerful.\\" Thus, the sentiment is most definitely on the positive side."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"1. What happens if I clear RAM on your Android phone? Imagine your phone is like a big table, and the things you use on your phone like toys, like opening apps or playing games. The table (RAM) gets full of those toys, which makes it hard to play with new toys. Clearing RAM is like cleaning up the table, so you have more space to play with new toys. When you clear RAM on your Android phone, it helps your phone run faster and smoother by making more space for new tasks and apps. 2. How much of RAM does \\"Map My Tracks\\" need on an Android phone? Map My Tracks is like a little toy car that needs some space to play on your big table (RAM). The amount of space (RAM) it needs may be different depending on your phone, but it usually doesn't need too much space. It's important that there's enough space so the toy car (app) can move around and work well. 3. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? No, these questions are not paraphrases of each other. They are asking different things. The first question is about what happens when you clear RAM, and the second question is about how much RAM a specific app needs.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate.  - Bari (Bari dialect: Bare;  \\"Bárion\\") is the capital city of the Metropolitan City of Bari and of the Apulia region, on the Adriatic Sea, in Italy. It is the second most important economic centre of mainland Southern Italy after Naples, and is well known as a port and university city, as well as the city of Saint Nicholas. The city itself has a population of about 326,799, , over , while the urban area counts 653,028 inhabitants over . The metropolitan area counts 1.3 million inhabitants.  - A university (\\"a whole\\", \\"a corporation\\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects.  Universities typically provide undergraduate education and postgraduate education.  - A port is a location on a coast or shore containing one or more harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role.  - Lupus Protospatharius Barensis was the reputed author of the Chronicon rerum in regno Neapolitano gestarum ( also called Annales Lupi Protospatharii ) , a precise history of the Mezzogiorno from 805 to 1102 . He has only been named as the author since the seventeenth century . Lupus , along with two other Bariot chronicles , the Annales barenses and the Anonymi barensis chronicon , used some lost ancient annals of Bari up to 1051 . William of Apulia appears to have used these same annals . Lupus also used the lost annals of Matera . Perhaps most unusual to Lupus is his dating method . He began his years in September and so places events of the latter half of a given year in the next year .  - The Normans (Norman: \\"Nourmands\\"; ) were the people who, in the 10th and 11th centuries, gave their name to Normandy, a region in France. They were descended from Norse (\\"Norman\\" comes from \\"Norseman\\") raiders and pirates from Denmark, Iceland and Norway who, under their leader Rollo, agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia. Through generations of assimilation and mixing with the native Frankish and Gallo-Roman populations, their descendants would gradually adopt the Carolingian-based cultures of West Francia, ultimately resulting in their own assimilation into the Romance society. The distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the Normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century, and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries.  - William of Apulia was a chronicler of the Normans, writing in the 1090s. His Latin epic, Gesta Roberti Wiscardi (\\"The Deeds of Robert Guiscard\\"), written in hexameters, is one of the principal contemporary sources for the Norman conquest of southern Italy, especially the career of Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia (10591085).  - Basilicata (or ), also known as Lucania, is a region in the south of Italy, bordering on Campania to the west, Apulia (\\"Puglia\\") to the north and east, and Calabria to the south. It also has two coastlines, one on the Tyrrhenian Sea between Campania and Calabria, and a longer coastline along the Gulf of Taranto between Calabria and Apulia. The region can be thought of as the \\"instep\\" of Italy, with Calabria functioning as the \\"toe\\" and Apulia the \\"heel\\". The region covers about and in 2010 had a population slightly under 600,000. The regional capital is Potenza. The region is divided into two provinces: Potenza and Matera. The president of Basilicata is Marcello Pittella.  - Matera (or locally ) is a city and a province in the region of Basilicata, in Southern Italy. It is the capital of the province of Matera and the capital of Basilicata from 1663 to 1806. The town lies in a small canyon carved out by the Gravina.  - Robert Guiscard ( 17 July 1085) was a Norman adventurer remembered for the conquest of southern Italy and Sicily. Robert was born into the Hauteville family in Normandy, went on to become Count of Apulia and Calabria (10571059), and then Duke of Apulia and Calabria and Duke of Sicily (10591085).  - Saint Nicholas; (15 March 270  6 December 343), also called Nikolaos of Myra, was a historic 4th-century Christian saint and Greek Bishop of Myra, in Asia Minor (modern-day Demre, Turkey). Because of the many miracles attributed to his intercession, he is also known as Nikolaos the Wonderworker. His reputation evolved among the faithful, as was common for early Christian saints, and his legendary habit of secret gift-giving gave rise to the traditional model of Santa Claus through Sinterklaas.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot).

The word galaxy is derived from the Greek \\"\\", literally \\"milky\\", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few billion stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral and irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have black holes at their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang.  - OGLE - TR - 113b is an extrasolar planet orbiting the star OGLE - TR - 113 . In 2002 the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment ( OGLE ) detected periodic dimming in the star 's light curve indicating a transiting , planetary - sized object . Since low - mass red dwarfs and brown dwarfs may mimic a planet , radial velocity measurements were necessary to calculate the mass of the body . In 2004 , the object was proved to be a new transiting extrasolar planet . The planet has a mass 1.32 times that of Jupiter . Since the planet 's inclination is known , the value is exact . It orbits the star ( OGLE - TR - 113 ) in an extremely close orbit , even closer than the famous planets 51 Pegasi b and HD 209458 b. The planet races around the star every 1.43 days . The radius of the planet is only 9 % larger than Jupiter 's , despite the heating effect by the star . Planets of its kind are sometimes called \`\` super-hot Jupiters '' .  - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.  - OGLE-TR-113 is a dim, distant magnitude 16 binary star in the star fields of the constellation Carina. Because of its distance of about 1800 light years, and location in a crowded field it was not notable in any way.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the orchestra to whose funds Bould always contributed his share of the recording fees? from the following article ?  In 1952 the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with Decca Records, which was unusually rewarding for the orchestra, giving it a 10 per cent commission on most sales. On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \\"seriously jeopardized financially\\" if Russell remained in post.  A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre.  In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony \\"rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring\\", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon,  Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia. Boult had not wished to go on... Answer:","output":"The name of the orchestra to whose funds Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees is the LPO or London Philharmonic Orchestra.  Reasoning: In the given context, the text mentions \\"In 1952 the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with Decca Records..., Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds,\\" referencing the orchestra to which Boult made contributions.

Options: [i] Put them in a air tight container and place the container in the fridge.. [ii] Put them in a ziploc bag and place them in the freezer..","output":"I choose option [i] Put them in an air tight container and place the container in the fridge. Here is how I do this step-by-step: 1. First, obtain an air tight container that is appropriate for the quantity of anchovies you want to store. The container should be clean and preferably made of glass or food-grade plastic. 2. If the anchovies are in a can, transfer them carefully into the container in order to avoid damaging or mashing them. Preserve the oil from the can, as it will help to maintain the flavor and freshness of the anchovies. 3. If the anchovies are fresh, clean them first by removing their heads, gutting them, and rinsing them thoroughly in cold water. Then, arrange them neatly in the container. 4. If you are storing canned anchovies, cover the anchovies in the container with the oil from the can to create a protective barrier against air exposure. This will help to keep them moist and flavorful. 5. If you are storing fresh anchovies, it is recommended to add a layer of salt and a bit of olive oil to the container, as this will help to preserve them and extend their shelf life. 6. Seal the container by attaching the lid securely. Check that the container is air tight and that no air can get in, as this will help to maintain the freshness of the anchovies. 7. Lastly, place the container in the fridge. Store it at a temperature between 34°F to 40°F (1°C to 4°C) to ensure maximum freshness. Regularly check the anchovies to make sure that they remain in good condition. By following these steps, I can properly store anchovies and keep them fresh for future use. Storing them in the fridge in an air tight container provides an optimal environment for them, as it keeps them cool and protected from potential contaminants.

Question: What was caused by Douay's death Context: The first action of the Franco-Prussian War took place on 4 August 1870. This battle saw the unsupported division of General Douay of I Corps, with some attached cavalry, which was posted to watch the border, attacked in overwhelming but uncoordinated fashion by the German 3rd Army. During the day, elements of a Bavarian and two Prussian corps became engaged and were aided by Prussian artillery, which blasted holes in the defenses of the town. Douay held a very strong position initially, thanks to the accurate long-range fire of the Chassepots but his force was too thinly stretched to hold it. Douay was killed in the late morning when a caisson of the divisional mitrailleuse battery exploded near him; the encirclement of the town by the Prussians threatened the French avenue of retreat.

The Terminator franchise stumbles out of the wreckage of the critically savaged sequel Salvation, this time with the participation of the original model, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the lavish endorsement of series co-creator James Cameron. Salvation “sucked” and Genisys, we’ve been told, is a new dawn. In this alternate timeline, the genius of 1984’s splendidly cheesy The Terminator and its sleek, superior follow-up Terminator 2: Judgment Day, are the only history that matters. It’s the kind of thing the fans want to hear. But the reality is that Terminator Genisys is part remake, part reboot, mostly failure. Sold simultaneously on the promise of returning to the franchise’s roots and innovating for a new generation, instead, Thor: The Dark World director Alan Taylor’s sequel apes the first two films’ iconicism, but falls short of achieving any in its own right. Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) is sent back in time by John Connor (Jason Clarke) to protect his mother, Sarah Connor (Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke), from the Terminator. Reese arrives in 1984 as per the original film, but – somehow (something about a “nexus”) – the timeline’s altered and in this reality it’s Sarah looking out for Kyle. They’re aided by a version of the Terminator (re-christened the Guardian and played by Schwarzenegger) that’s been watching out for Sarah since an attack on her family by the machines left her orphaned as a child. She calls him “Pops”, while he – still, in any timeline you like, a machine – finds her affection baffling. Related: Hasta la vista, gramps! Arnie to shoot sixth Terminator as he nears 70 The first hour of the film sees Taylor recreating Cameron’s original in a style similar to Gus van Sant’s shot-by-shot remake of Psycho. There’s the yellow dump truck, a lookalike of its cigar-chomping driver and naked CGI Arnold, crouched in the shallow blasted out by his time-travelling orb. The punks are still there, still wondering what’s wrong with this picture. Kyle’s feathercut has gone, but he still pulls on his stolen high tops languorously enough to give the Nike branding a good showing. It’s an elaborate exercise in nostalgia that will delight the faithful and confuse the newcomer. The second half of the film is for them, where Genisys spins off into a peppy, self-aware parody of everything that made the early films unique. The lore is disconnected and rewired, making for a confusing, but sporadically entertaining ride for anyone who remembers the originals. At times Taylor offers a Comic Relief sketch version of The Terminator: more ridiculous than revolutionary. Genisys – because of its 12A certification – lacks the first two chapters’ wallop. Cameron’s films were unusual for mainstream cinema in that they sutured violence to character to give it meaning. The Terminator was murderous without thought, but with cause. The gore – the body horror of the Terminator repairing an eye socket or flaying an arm to prove a point – was grounded in the story. The slaughter of humanity felt real. There’s no fear here. No real sense of dread. The techno-paranoid get an Apple-ish operating system (the Genisys of the title) to worry about, but a tablet can’t inspire terror. The CGI doesn’t look to have evolved much from Judgement Day. The film feels soft and phoney. In the original Terminator Kyle Reese described how the humans could tell when the robots were trying to pass themselves off as alive: “They had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.” Watching Genisys, you can relate. Salvation was boring, but Genisys makes you sad. Risk-averse Hollywood has made a crash-test dummy of a once great franchise, simply throwing everything at it to see what it stands. It’s heartbreaking to watch Arnie execute the same old programmes: the terrible robo-smile; the slang; the wear and tear of his living tissue revealing the cyborg underneath. “Old, but not obsolete,” the Terminator/Guardian tells us when his age is brought into question. In truth, it feels like both. In a sense, the Terminator franchise wrote the code for Hollywood’s current creative stagnation. Judgment Day redefined the action genre, CGI and the star system, creating a thirst for sequels that still leads studio decision-making today. It was a radical film, one that escaped the B-movie trappings of its predecessor by locking into a genuinely terrifying vision of mankind supplanted. Cameron wasn’t scared to move on either. The penultimate scene – with the Terminator sacrificing himself to save the future – implied the director was quitting while he was ahead. Related: Terminator 5: how to reanimate the ailing sci-fi franchise Today – with our rebooted, rebooted Spider-Man and ever-expanding “cinematic universes” – not even death can kill a pop culture hero. Yet Genisys’s alternate universe yarn smacks of a particular desperation: the nuclear option in Hollywood’s War on Jeopardy. Cameron has called this “the official” third Terminator film, but it’s just another sequel. There’s talk of two more of these. They are on the production line, being built now to make our future just that little bit more drab. The war is over. The machines have won. Summary:","output":"\\"Terminator Genisys\\" is a movie that is part of the Terminator series with Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is a famous actor and used to be a strong man. This movie is like a new start for the Terminator story. People were hoping it would be really fun and exciting like the first two Terminator movies, but it didn't live up to their expectations.

Answer the following question: Two stars have just been discovered that are identical in terms of chemical composition. The scientist who discovered them was given the right to name them, and he chose the names Enterprise and Vader. As said before, these stars are very similar, but the main difference is that Vader is a red giant, and Enterprise is not. Scientists are very eager to study these two newly discovered stars and see if they can learn anything new from them.  Does Enterprise have more or less fusion reactions in the shell around its core than Vader does?  Hint: A red giant star is a star with a mass like the Sun that is in the last phase of its life, when Hydrogen fusion reactions in the core decrease due to the lack of fuel. With the gravitational collapse of the core, the fusion reactions now occur in a shell surrounding the core. The outer layer of the star expands enormously up to 1000 times the size of the Sun. When the Sun becomes a red giant, its volume will include the orbit of Mercury and Venus and maybe even Earth. The increased size increases the luminosity even though the outer layer cools to only 3000 K or so. The cooler outer layer causes it to be a red star. After a few more million years, the star evolves into a white dwarf-planetary nebula system. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Enterprise, which is not a red giant, has less fusion reactions in the shell around its core than Vader. In a red giant like Vader, hydrogen fusion reactions in the core decrease due to the lack of fuel, and as a result, the fusion reactions now occur primarily in a shell surrounding the core. The expansion of the outer layers of a red giant contributes to the huge size and increased luminosity of the star. On the other hand, Enterprise is not a red giant, implying that it is likely in an earlier phase of its stellar life when hydrogen fusion reactions are still taking place in its core. Therefore, the amount of fusion reactions happening in the shell around the core of the Enterprise star would be significantly less compared to Vader."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His ship is subjected to less or more temperature and pressure at the surface? A:","output":"As Ulysses pilots his drill ship deep into the Earth's core, and then back up, his ship is subjected to changes in both temperature and pressure based on the depths reached during the journey. When comparing the conditions at the Earth's surface to those deeper within the planet, we can determine how the temperature and pressure vary. Temperature and pressure increase as we go deeper into the Earth. This is due to the heat generated by the decay of radioactive elements and the residual heat from Earth's formation. Additionally, the pressure increases because of the weight of the overlying rocks and materials. The deeper we go, the higher the temperature and pressure become. At the Earth's core, which lies about 6,371 kilometers beneath the surface, the temperature is estimated to reach around 5,000 to 7,000 degrees Celsius (9,000 to 12,600 degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure is approximately 3,500,000 times the atmospheric pressure at sea level. These conditions are extreme and significantly higher than the conditions encountered at the Earth's surface. Upon Ulysses' return, his ship will experience a reduction in both temperature and pressure as he nears and reaches the Earth's surface.

(October 2015) Mary's (Elle Fanning) seemingly dull Christmas is suddenly filled with excitement and adventure following the arrival of her Uncle Albert (Nathan Lane), who gives her a Nutcracker as a gift. Later that night, Mary dreams that the Nutcrackerâcalled N.C. (Charlie Rowe)--comes to life and takes her on a wondrous journey.[3] They discover that the Nazi-like Rat King (John Turturro) has usurped the Nutcracker's kingdom.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"To answer your first two questions, I will provide some good punching bag workout recommendations for beginners and good punching bag cardio workouts. Then, I will address whether these questions can be considered the same. 1. Good punching bag workouts for beginners:     Step 1: Warm-up. Before starting punching bag workouts, it's important to warm up your body. Some light jogging or jumping jacks followed by stretching can help prevent injuries. Step 2: Basic punches. Focus on mastering basic punches like the jab, cross, hook, and uppercut. Start by practicing each punch one at a time, using correct form and keeping your hands up to protect your face. Step 3: Combinations. Combine the basic punches into simple combinations. A popular combination for beginners is 'jab-cross-hook' or '1-2-3'. Practice these combinations slowly at first, then increase speed and power as you become more comfortable. Step 4: Footwork and movement. Incorporate footwork and movement around the punching bag to simulate moving around an opponent. Practice stepping in and out, pivoting, and maintaining balance while throwing punches. Step 5: Rounds and rest. Start with 1 to 2 minutes rounds, followed by a 30 seconds to 1-minute rest. As you progress, you can increase the length of your rounds and decrease rest times. 2. Good punching bag cardio workouts: Step 1: Warm-up. A proper warm-up remains essential when focusing on cardio workouts. Step 2: High-intensity intervals. Incorporate high-intensity rounds where you throw punches as fast as possible for 30 seconds to 1 minute, followed by a short active rest period (e.g., 30 seconds). Step 3: Mixing in bodyweight exercises. Add exercises like burpees, jumping jacks, or mountain climbers in between punching intervals to increase your cardio demand. Step 4: Incorporate footwork drills. As mentioned earlier, footwork is important, and you can use this as a part of your cardio workouts. Shuffle around the punching bag, changing direction, and incorporating punches while continuously moving. Step 5: Timed rounds and rest. Increase the duration of your rounds to 3 minutes with a 30 seconds to 1-minute rest. Aim for a total of 20-30 minutes of active punching and movement. Regarding whether these two questions are the same: While they are related, they are not exactly the same. The first question asks for beginner punching bag workouts, mainly focusing on learning techniques and building a foundation. The second question emphasizes cardio workouts, which are focused on improving cardiovascular endurance and burning calories. However, both questions overlap, as beginners may also be interested in cardio-based workouts."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Valley has a more fertile soil, it's not overgrazed, and the trees and bushes are abundant, and the productivity has increased several fold over the past decade. Biodiversity in the Valley is varied, and the soils are nutritious and retain more water, nitrogen and carbon.  Which area experiences less soil erosion? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it can be concluded that the Valley experiences less soil erosion compared to the Gorge. The factors contributing to this conclusion can be analyzed by examining each aspect of the two regions mentioned in the description. 1. Deforestation: The Gorge has been subjected to deforestation, which leads to numerous negative consequences, including soil degradation and increased erosion. When trees are removed from an area, their roots no longer hold the soil together, leaving it susceptible to erosion by wind and water. Additionally, trees play a crucial role in the water cycle by absorbing water from the soil and releasing it into the atmosphere as water vapor. This process prevents the soil from becoming saturated with water, which can contribute to reduced erosion. In contrast, the Valley still has abundant trees and bushes, providing stability to the soil and reducing erosion. 2. Fertility and plant cover: The Valley has more fertile soil than the Gorge. Fertile soil supports a greater variety of plants and vegetation, which in turn helps prevent erosion by binding the soil together with their roots. The abundant plant life also slows down water runoff, reducing the force at which the water impacts and dislodges soil particles. 3. Overgrazing: The Gorge may be overgrazed, which means that too many animals are grazing in the area. Overgrazing leads to the destruction of plant life and the loss of root structure in the soil, which makes it more prone to erosion. The Valley, on the other hand, is not overgrazed, preserving its plant cover and reducing soil erosion. 4. Biodiversity: The Valley has a higher level of biodiversity than the Gorge. This is likely due to the more favorable environmental conditions – fertile soil, abundant plant life, and a lack of overgrazing – that promote a healthy ecosystem. A varied ecosystem with a diverse array of plant and animal life can create a more resilient landscape that is less prone to erosion and other environmental issues. 5. Soil composition and retention: The Valley's soil is not only more nutritious but also better at retaining water, nitrogen, and carbon. These characteristics contribute to a healthier ecosystem and reduce soil erosion by promoting strong plant growth and helping the soil bind together. High water retention capabilities in the soil can also prevent excessive runoff and reduce erosion caused by water flow. In conclusion, the Valley experiences less soil erosion due to factors such as the presence of abundant trees and bushes, fertile soil, limited overgrazing, a diverse ecosystem, and the soil's retention capabilities. These factors create a more resilient landscape, protecting the soil from erosion and maintaining a healthier environment. In contrast, the Gorge suffers from negative consequences of deforestation and overgrazing, making it more vulnerable to soil erosion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who had an optimistic forecast initially?, using the article: After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed. The surrounding sea was dense with pack ice that would halt any rescue ship,..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The first name of the person who had an optimistic forecast initially is Frank. Frank Wild initially estimated that the Elephant Island party would have to wait one month for rescue and did not allow long-term stockpiling of food resources as he believed it to be defeatist.

Dodgson's family was predominantly northern English, with Irish connections, conservative and High Church Anglican. Most of Dodgson's male ancestors were army officers or Church of England clergy. His great-grandfather, also named Charles Dodgson, had risen through the ranks of the church to become the Bishop of Elphin. His paternal grandfather, another Charles, had been an army captain, killed in action in Ireland in 1803 when his two sons were hardly more than babies. The older of these sons - yet another Charles Dodgson - was Carroll's father. He went to Westminster School and then to Christ Church, Oxford. He reverted to the other family tradition and took holy orders. He was mathematically gifted and won a double first degree, which could have been the prelude to a brilliant academic career. Instead, he married his first cousin Frances Jane Lutwidge in 1827 and became a country parson.  Dodgson was born in the small parsonage at Daresbury in Cheshire near the towns of Warrington and Runcorn, the eldest boy but already the third child of the four-and-a-half-year-old marriage. Eight more children followed. When Charles was 11, his father was given the living of Croft-on-Tees in North Yorkshire, and the whole family moved to the spacious rectory. This remained their home for the next 25 years.  Charles's father was an active and highly conservative cleric of the Church of England who later became the Archdeacon of Richmond and involved himself, sometimes influentially, in the intense religious disputes that were dividing the church. He was high church, inclining to Anglo-Catholicism, an admirer of John Henry Newman and the Tractarian movement, and did his best to instil such views in his children. Young Charles was to develop an ambiguous relationship with his father's values and with the Church of England as a whole.  The young adult Charles Dodgson was about 6 feet (1.83 m) tall and slender, and he had curly brown hair and blue or grey eyes (depending on the account). He was described in later life as somewhat asymmetrical, and as carrying himself rather stiffly and awkwardly, although this might be on account of a knee injury sustained in middle age. As a very young child, he suffered a fever that left him deaf in one ear. At the age of 17, he suffered a severe attack of whooping cough, which was probably responsible for his chronically weak chest in later life. Another defect which he carried into adulthood was what he referred to as his \\"hesitation\\", a stammer that he acquired in early childhood and which plagued him throughout his life.  The stammer has always been a significant part of the image of Dodgson. It is said that he stammered only in adult company and was free and fluent with children, but there is no evidence to support this idea. Many children of his acquaintance remembered the stammer, while many adults failed to notice it. Dodgson himself seems to have been far more acutely aware of it than most people whom he met; it is said that he caricatured himself as the Dodo in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, referring to his difficulty in pronouncing his last name, but this is one of the many \\"facts\\" often repeated for which no first-hand evidence remains. He did indeed refer to himself as the dodo, but whether or not this reference was to his stammer is simply speculation.  Dodgson's stammer did trouble him, but it was never so debilitating that it prevented him from applying his other personal qualities to do well in society. He lived in a time when people commonly devised their own amusements and when singing and recitation were required social skills, and the young Dodgson was well equipped to be an engaging entertainer. He reportedly could sing tolerably well and was not afraid to do so before an audience. He was adept at mimicry and storytelling, and was reputedly quite good at charades.  In broad terms, Dodgson has traditionally been regarded as politically, religiously, and personally conservative. Martin Gardner labels Dodgson as a Tory who was \\"awed by lords and inclined to be snobbish towards inferiors.\\" The Reverend W. Tuckwell, in his Reminiscences of Oxford (1900), regarded him as \\"austere, shy, precise, absorbed in mathematical reverie, watchfully tenacious of his dignity, stiffly conservative in political, theological, social theory, his life mapped out in squares like Alice's landscape.\\" Dodgson was ordained a deacon in the Church of England on December 22, 1861. In The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll, the editor states that \\"his Diary is full of such modest depreciations of himself and his work, interspersed with earnest prayers (too sacred and private to be reproduced here) that God would forgive him the past, and help him to perform His holy will in the future.\\" When a friend asked him about his religious views, Dodgson wrote in response that he was a member of the Church of England, but \\"doubt[ed] if he was fully a 'High Churchman'\\". He added:  I believe that when you and I come to lie down for the last time, if only we can keep firm hold of the great truths Christ taught us--our own utter worthlessness and His infinite worth; and that He has brought us back to our one Father, and made us His brethren, and so brethren to one another--we shall have all we need to guide us through the shadows. Most assuredly I accept to the full the doctrines you refer to--that Christ died to save us, that we have no other way of salvation open to us but through His death, and that it is by faith in Him, and through no merit of ours, that we are reconciled to God; and most assuredly I can cordially say, \\"I owe all to Him who loved me, and died on the Cross of Calvary.\\"  Dodgson also expressed interest in other fields. He was an early member of the Society for Psychical Research, and one of his letters suggests that he accepted as real what was then called \\"thought reading\\". Dodgson wrote some studies of various philosophical arguments.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? which also is n't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues","output":"To determine the sentiment of the movie review sentence, I will analyze the words and phrases used, and assess the tone or emotions that are conveyed. Step 1: Break down the sentence into individual words and phrases. Key phrases in the sentence include: - which also is n't embarrassed - to make you reach for the tissues Step 2: Evaluate the sentiment of each phrase. - \\"which also is n't embarrassed\\" has a neutral sentiment, as it is stating that the movie doesn't shy away from something. - \\"to make you reach for the tissues\\" is a phrase that indicates the movie is emotional, as reaching for tissues typically signifies that the movie affected the audience emotionally (e.g. making them cry). Step 3: Combine the sentiments of the phrases to determine the overall sentiment of the sentence. Considering both phrases, the overall sentiment of the sentence is positive. The sentence states that the movie is not embarrassed to elicit an emotional response, such as making the audience cry. This implies that the movie is successful in evoking emotions, which is generally considered a positive quality for a film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Prosecutors launched an inquiry after eight of Mr Baupin's former Green Party colleagues said they were subjected to either sexual assault or lewd text messages.

When the claims against Mr Baupin first surfaced in two media outlets, several commentators pointed to a book published last month, The Elysee Off, in which the authors described an incident involving Mr Sapin and an unnamed female journalist covering the Davos summit in January 2015. \\"Don't dare pick up a pen in front of him,\\" they warn. According to their version of events, Mr Sapin saw the journalist's underwear exposed, said \\"Ah, but what have we here?\\", and then twanged her knicker elastic. Pressed to respond to the story by reporters on Tuesday, Mr Sapin on two occasions rejected it outright, warning he would take \\"every action necessary\\" to defend himself against \\"inaccurate and libellous allegations\\".

They evaluated several options and decided to follow these steps in order to complete the task successfully: 1. Measure the table dimensions: The first step was to accurately measure the table's length, width, and height. This would help the team understand the exact size of the table and compare it with the dimensions of the entrance doorway. Justification: Knowing the table's dimensions is crucial in determining whether any adjustments need to be made before attempting to move it inside the house. 2. Assess the entrance doorway's dimensions: The team measured the entrance doorway's height and width to determine if any structural alterations are necessary. Justification: Comparing the doorway's dimensions with the table's dimensions would allow the movers to determine the best possible way of bringing the table inside the house. 3. Disassemble the table, if possible: If the table could be disassembled, the team would separate the legs from the tabletop, which would make it easier to move it through the entrance doorway. Justification: Disassembling the table would make it more compact and easier to maneuver through tighter spaces. 4. Rotate the table: If the table couldn't be disassembled, the team considered changing its orientation as an option to fit it through the entrance doorway. They would tilt the table on its side or turn it diagonally to create more clearance space. Justification: Rotating the table could potentially provide more room to work with when passing it through the entrance doorway. 5. Remove the entrance door: As a last resort, the team considered removing the entrance door temporarily to create more space to move the table inside. Justification: Removing the door would increase the width of the entrance, making it easier to bring the table inside without causing any damage to the table or the doorway. By following these steps, the team successfully moved the table into the house without causing any damage. They then reassembled the table, if necessary, and carried on with the furniture moving process.

The","output":"metal rod, being more durable and less susceptible to wear and tear, would provide a more stable support system for the electrical appliances and wiring that were to be installed. Besides ensuring safety and reliability, the metal rod would also offer a longer lifespan for the setup, reducing the need for frequent replacements or maintenance. When the electrician began the process of replacing the beam, he first assessed the dimensions and load-bearing capacity of the existing wooden beam. This was crucial in determining the appropriate size and strength of the metal rod that would be used to provide the necessary support. After thorough calculations, the electrician sourced a high-quality metal rod with the right specifications from a reputable supplier. Before installing the new metal rod, the electrician made sure to take proper precautions. He turned off the power supply to the area where the replacement was taking place, to minimize the risks of injury or accidental electrocution. As an extra precaution, he also used insulated tools and wore protective gear, such as gloves and goggles, while conducting the task.  To remove the wooden beam, the electrician had to carefully dismantle the attached electrical appliances and wiring. This required skill and precision, as any damage to the wiring or appliances could lead to future electrical issues or malfunctions. Once the appliances and wiring were disconnected, the electrician then proceeded to securely remove the wooden beam from its current position. Now that the wooden beam was out, the electrician set about preparing the location for the installation of the metal rod. This involved creating any necessary mounting points or brackets that would be required to hold the metal rod in place. These mounting points would need to be strong and sturdy, to ensure that the metal rod could bear the weight of the electrical appliances and wiring without any issues. With the mounting points established, the electrician proceeded to install the metal rod. This was a meticulous process, as it was essential to align the metal rod correctly to ensure optimal structural support and stability. Once the rod was positioned properly, it was securely fastened to the mounting points with appropriate fasteners, such as bolts or screws. With the metal rod now in place, the electrician reattached the electrical appliances and wiring, making sure that all the connections were secure, accurate, and functioning correctly. He also took this opportunity to double-check the electrical setup for any potential risks or hazards, to ensure that safety was maintained throughout the entire system. Finally, the electrician restored power to the area and conducted a thorough test of the entire electrical system. This involved checking the performance of each electrical appliance, confirming that all the wiring connections were working correctly, and verifying that the metal rod provided the necessary support and stability for the setup. In conclusion, the replacement of the wooden beam with a metal rod significantly improved the safety, reliability, and longevity of the electrical system. The electrician's expertise and meticulous approach ensured a seamless transition from the old wooden beam to the new metal rod, allowing the electrical appliances and wiring to function on a stable and secure foundation. This ultimately benefited the users of the electrical system, as they could trust that the system was functioning optimally and would continue to do so for an extended period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Many of the world's great cities are located on rivers, and almost every country has at least one river running through it that plays an important part in the lives of its people. Since the beginning of history, people have used rivers for transportation. The longest one in the United States is the Mississippi. The lifeline of Egypt is the Nile. To the people of India, the Ganges is great, but it is also important for transportation; ships can travel along it for a thousand miles. Other great rivers are the Congo in Africa and the Mekong in southeastern Asia. The greatest of all for navigation , however, is the Amazon in Brazil . It is so wide and so deep that large ships can go about two thousand miles up it. Besides transportation, rivers give food to eat, water to drink, water for crops, and chances for fun. In order to increase the supply  of water for crops, engineers sometimes build a dam  across a river and let a lake form behind the dam. Then people can use the water not only to irrigate  their fields but also to make electricity for their homes and industries. However, large cities and industries that are located on rivers often cause problems. As the cities grow in size and industries increase in number, the water in the rivers becomes polluted with chemicals and other materials. People are learning the importance, however, of doing more to keep their rivers clean if they want to enjoy the benefits of these natural resources.

Write an article based on this summary: Fraudsters who target vulnerable victims, such as the elderly, in England and Wales face harsher sentences, under new guidelines. Article:","output":"Title: New Guidelines Impose Harsher Sentences for Fraudsters Targeting Vulnerable Victims in England and Wales Introduction: In an attempt to crack down on financial fraud targeting vulnerable individuals, new sentencing guidelines have been introduced in England and Wales. These guidelines aim to impose harsher sentences on fraudsters who exploit vulnerable victims, such as the elderly, as a means to deter potential criminals and protect those who are most susceptible to these heinous acts. Step 1: Understanding the new guidelines The sentencing guidelines have been implemented to tackle crime that targets vulnerable victims, with a particular focus on offenders preying on those who suffer from mental or physical incapacity, the elderly, or people in dire financial circumstances. These revised guidelines come in response to a growing concern about the pervasiveness of financial crimes against these vulnerable groups. Step 2: Identifying the impact of fraud on vulnerable victims Fraudsters who prey on vulnerable victims often have a devastating impact on the lives of these individuals. In many cases, the victims may lose their life savings, face serious financial difficulties, and suffer from emotional trauma as a result of these crimes. As such, these new guidelines have been introduced to ensure that fraudsters face justice and that vulnerable victims are offered a greater level of protection. Step 3: Explaining the harsher sentences for offenders Under the new guidelines, judges have been given clear instructions to consider the vulnerability of the victims as a significant aggravating factor when passing a sentence. This means that those convicted of financial fraud against vulnerable victims may face considerably longer prison sentences than they would have under the previous guidelines. Step 4: Highlighting case studies and examples To illustrate the effectiveness of these new sentencing guidelines, several cases can be referenced where malicious individuals have been prosecuted and punished accordingly. For instance, a fraudster who stole tens of thousands of pounds from dementia sufferers was sentenced to six years in prison, while another individual who extorted significant sums of money from elderly individuals under the guise of false investment opportunities received a lengthy nine-year sentence. Step 5: Discussing the potential impact of the new guidelines The implementation of these new guidelines is expected to have a significant impact on the rates of financial fraud against vulnerable victims. By imposing harsher sentences on those who exploit the elderly and other vulnerable groups, the justice system is sending a strong message that this type of behavior will not be tolerated. Additionally, these guidelines should serve as a deterrent to potential criminals, demonstrating that justice will be served swiftly and severely. Conclusion: The introduction of these new sentencing guidelines in England and Wales demonstrates a strong commitment to protecting vulnerable individuals from financial fraud. Through the imposition of harsher sentences, it is hoped that those who would prey on such vulnerable targets will be deterred, and the victims of these reprehensible acts will finally receive the justice they deserve. The criminal justice system must continue to adapt and respond to the evolving threats posed by fraudsters to ensure the ongoing safety and security of society's most vulnerable citizens."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Nasa has narrowed down the hunt for an asteroid that it can capture and put it into orbit around the moon. The space agency said it has found three suitable asteroids, one of which it hopes it can put into lunar orbit using a robotic space lasso. Once in orbit, astronauts will be able to visit the space rock using the Orion spacecraft by as early as 2021. The space agency said it has identified three asteroids, one of which it hopes it can put into lunar orbit using a robotic space lasso. This artist's rendering shows what capturing an asteroid could look like. The asteroids are all between seven and 10m in size, but further tests will need to be conducted to determine their suitability, said scientists at a conference in San Diego, California. ‘We have two to three which we will characterise in the next year and if all goes well... those will be valid candidates that could be certified targets,’ said Paul Chodas, senior scientist at the Nasa Near-Earth Object Program Office. The mission hopes to gather useful information that will help protect the Earth from a potential hazardous asteroid collision, as well as the technology to enable for future human missions to deep space. Once in orbit, astronauts will be able to visit the space rock using the Orion spacecraft by as early as 2021. NASA would find an asteroid which is between seven and 10m wide. They would then tow or push it towards Earth so that it ends up in a stable orbit near the moon. In. 2021 astronauts would then use an Orion capsule - a manned spacecraft -. to land on the asteroid and bring back soil and rock samples for. analysis. This asteroid would also, probably in the 2030s, be used as a stop-off point for astronauts on their way to Mars. Last month, the latest version of the plan was revealed in an animation. Exact details on how Nasa plans to pluck an asteroid out of its trajectory are not yet known, but the rendering shows it is captured and held inside what looks like a giant plastic bag. The mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next-generation Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. Though it bares a striking resemblance to the earlier Apollo Spacecraft, Orion can hold more crew and is far-more advanced, said Nasa. Up to four people can be shuttled to the asteroid, compared to the maximum three in Apollo, in a trip that utilises both solar power and the Moon’s gravitational pull to power the spacecraft, according to the video. After the Orion and the asteroid are attached, the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object. Once the Orion docks with the remote-operated asteroid capture device, the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from, the video shows. After the mission is complete, Orion returns to Earth on the same path it journeyed out on, loop around the moon included, and splashes down in an ocean – likely the Pacific – 10 days later, as seen in the video. The project, which envisions that astronauts could visit such an asteroid as early as 2021, is included in President Obama's £11.5 billion spending plan for the U.S. space agency for the 2014 tax year. It is intended as an expansion of existing initiatives to find asteroids that may be on a collision course with Earth, and as part of preparations for a human expedition to Mars in the 2030s. ‘This mission allows us to better develop our technology and systems to explore farther than we've ever been before - to an asteroid and to Mars - places that humanity has dreamed about … but has had no hope of ever attaining,’ Nasa administrator Charles Bolden said. Using a combination of solar power and gravity-aided thrust, the Orion will make the 10 day trip to the asteroid. ‘We're on the threshold of being able to tell my kids and my grandkids that we're almost there.’ Interest in potentially threatening asteroids sky-rocketed after a small asteroid exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia on February 15, shattering windows and damaging buildings. About 1,500 people were injured by flying glass and debris. The same day another larger asteroid passed about 17,200 miles from Earth - closer than the television and communication satellites that ring the planet. The incidents had created an imperative ‘to develop techniques and technology that will help deter or to keep an asteroid or other type of body from impacting Earth,’ Mr Bolden said. ‘One of the serendipitous results from this [asteroid-retrieval] flight we hope will be the demonstration of a capability to move an asteroid, to deflect it ever so slightly.’ Mr Obama is also requesting £535 million to support efforts to develop commercial space taxis in hopes of breaking Russia's monopoly on crew transportation to the space station by 2017.

Of course, it was easy enough to see in hindsight that \\"2dozjumHerbal Essences\\" was merely the bastard child of two drunkenly weaving columns--we had been supposed to get two dozen jumbo eggs and a bottle of my mother's favourite brand of shampoo (ever inventive in creating proprietary abbreviations--\\"TC\\" standing for, what else, thin crust pizza--my mother scrupulously wrote out brand names in full).

John Doubleday (about 1798 – 25 January 1856) was a British craftsperson, restorer, and dealer in antiquities who was employed by the British Museum for the last 20 years of his life. He undertook several duties for the museum, not least as a witness in criminal trials, but was primarily their specialist restorer, perhaps the first person to hold the position. He is best known for his 1845 restoration of the severely-damaged Roman Portland Vase, an accomplishment that places him at the forefront of his profession at the time. While at the British Museum, Doubleday also dealt in copies of coins, medals, and ancient seals. His casts in coloured sulphur and in white metal of works in both national and private collections, allowed smaller collections to hold copies at a fraction of the price that the originals would command. Thousands of his copies entered the collections of institutions and individuals. Yet the accuracy he achieved led to confusion with the originals; after his death he was labelled a forger, but with the caveat that \\"[w]hether he did copies with the intention of deceiving collectors or not is open to doubt\\".Little is known about Doubleday's upbringing or personal life. Several sources describe him as an American, including the 1851 United Kingdom census, which records him as a New York-born British subject. An obituary noted that he worked at a printer's shop for more than 20 years during his youth, which gave him the experience of casting type that he would employ in his later career as a copyist. Doubleday's early life, family, and education are otherwise unknown. He died in 1856, leaving a wife and five daughters, all English; the eldest child was born around 1833.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: In what year was the album War completed? ?  After the October Tour, U2 decamped to a rented cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, War. Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band \\"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\\", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday. Other songs from the record addressed topics such as nuclear proliferation (\\"Seconds\\") and the Polish Solidarity movement (\\"New Year's Day\\"). War was U2's first record to feature...

Please answer the following question: Information:  - A stunt performer, often referred to as a stuntman, stuntwoman, or daredevil, is someone who performs dangerous stunts, often as a career.  - Traditional heavy metal, also known as classic metal, or traditional metal, is the seminal genre of heavy metal music before the genre \\"evolved and splintered into many different styles and subgenres.\\"  - Reality television is a genre of television programming that documents supposedly unscripted real-life situations, and often features an otherwise unknown cast of individuals who are typically not professional actors, although in some shows celebrities may participate. It differs from documentary television in that the focus tends to be on drama, personal conflict, and entertainment rather than educating viewers. The genre has various standard tropes, including \\"confessionals\\" (also called \\"talking heads\\" or \\"interview segments\\") used by cast members to express their thoughts, which often double as the shows' narration. In competition-based reality shows, a notable subset, there are other common elements such as one participant being eliminated per episode, a panel of judges, and the concept of \\"immunity from elimination.\\"  - Blooddrunk is the sixth album by Finnish melodic death metal band Children of Bodom, released on April 7, 2008, through Spinefarm Records. The album includes a re-recorded version single for \\"Tie My Rope\\". Various editions feature one or two cover songs as bonus tracks. The limited edition digipak version of the album includes a bonus DVD with 5.1 surround mixes of all songs and the video and making-of for \\"Blooddrunk\\". It sold 20,000 copies during its first week of release.  - Viva La Bam is an American reality television series that starred Bam Margera and his friends and family. The show was a spin-off from MTV's \\"Jackass\\", in which Margera and most of the main cast had appeared. Each episode had a specific theme, mission, or challenge which was normally accomplished by performing pranks, skateboarding, and enlisting the help of friends, relations and experts. Although partly improvised, the show was supported by a greater degree of planning and organization.  - Children of Bodom is a melodic death metal band from Espoo, Finland. Formed in 1993, the group currently consists of Alexi Laiho (vocals, lead guitar), Janne Wirman (keyboards), Henkka Seppälä (bass), Jaska Raatikainen (drums) and Daniel Freyberg (rhythm guitar). In total they have released nine studio albums, two live albums, two EPs, two compilation albums and one DVD.  - Melodic death metal (also referred to as melodeath or MDM) is a subgenre death metal that employs highly melodic guitar riffs, often borrowing from traditional heavy metal. The style originated and developed in Sweden (pioneered by At the Gates, Dark Tranquillity and In Flames) and the United Kingdom (pioneered by Carcass) during the early and mid-1990s. The Swedish death metal scene did much to popularize the style, soon centering in the \\"Gothenburg metal\\" scene.  - \`\` Tie My Rope '' is a 2007 song from the Finnish melodic death metal band Children of Bodom . The song is from Children of Bodom 's sixth studio album , Blooddrunk . The song was also included on Viva La Bands , Vol. 2 , a compilation album from the program Viva La Bam and the tracks on the album were selected by star Bam Margera . Musically , \`\` Tie My Rope '' bears a resemblance to songs from Children of Bodom 's album Are You Dead Yet ? , and was a product of the band 's exploration of their 1980s metal influences . In contrast to all of their past material , the keyboards have a much darker sound that blend in with the overall song . In addition , the overall usage of keyboards in the songs seem to be much more present than songs in Are You Dead Yet ? . The song was re-recorded for the actual album .  - Swedish death metal is a death metal music scene developed in Sweden. Many Swedish death metal bands are associated with the melodic death metal movement, thus giving Swedish death metal a different sound from other variations of death metal. Unlike American death metal groups, the first Swedish bands were rooted in punk rock. Although Norway is known for its quantity of black metal, Gothenburg in Sweden has a large melodic death metal scene, while Stockholm is known for its more raw death metal scene.  - Lead guitar is a guitar part which plays melody lines, instrumental fill passages, guitar solos, and occasionally, some riffs within a song structure. The lead is the featured guitar, which usually plays single-note-based lines or double-stops. In rock, heavy metal, blues, jazz, punk, fusion, some pop, and other music styles, lead guitar lines are usually supported by a second guitarist who plays rhythm guitar, which consists of accompaniment chords and riffs.  - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.  - MTV (originally an initialism of Music Television) is an American cable and satellite television channel owned by Viacom Media Networks (a division of Viacom) and headquartered in New York City. Launched on August 1, 1981, the channel originally aired music videos as guided by television personalities known as \\"video jockeys\\" (VJs). In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years.  - Brandon Cole \\"Bam\\" Margera (or ; born September 28, 1979) is an American professional skateboarder, stunt performer, and television personality.

If your blinds have too much built up dirt, a simple dusting may not totally clean them. A deeper clean for wood blinds requires you to use water. Do not mix any cleaners or chemicals with the water. The chemicals in traditional cleaners can create stains and streaks that can ruin your blinds. Wood blinds that make  prolonged contact with water can cause your blinds to spot and warp. To avoid this, lightly dab your cloth and wring it out before you use it. You only need a little bit of water to dampen your cloth, not totally saturate it. Positioning your wooden slats to an almost closed position will make wiping each individual slat easier. Using your damp rag, wipe each slat from left to right. Once you are done wiping one side, make sure that also wipe the other side. Make sure to scrub harder on areas with stains, using a circular motion. Water can warp, discolor, or create spotting on wood blinds. To prevent this from happening, make sure that you get all of the water off the blinds with a dry rag. You can dry each slat with a microfiber cloth, dry sock, or a soft cotton rag. Clean the other side of your wooden slats by angling them onto the other side and repeat the process of wiping them down and drying them.

Summarize this article: DETROIT A Satanic organization unveiled a controversial bronze Baphomet sculpture in Detroit just before midnight on Saturday, after trying in vain to have it installed near a 10 Commandments monument in Oklahoma.      Due to planned demonstrations, the group, which is opposed to Bible-themed displays on government land, kept the location of the unveiling of its 9-foot-tall monument secret until the last moment, when it emailed the information to ticket holders.      The Satanic Temple unveiled the one-ton statue at an industrial building near the Detroit River just before 11:30 p.m. local time as supporters cheered, \\"Hail Satan.\\" Some of the hundreds in attendance rushed to pose for photos.      The statue of a winged Baphomet with a human body and a goat's head resembled a design the group previously released. Statues of a boy and a girl stood in poses of adoration on either side.      Jex Blackmore, director of the Satanic Temple Detroit chapter, said temple members planned to transport the sculpture to Arkansas, where earlier this year the governor signed a bill authorizing a 10 Commandments monument on the State Capitol's grounds.      The Temple had unsuccessfully applied to have the statue placed near a 10 Commandments monument installed in 2012 on the Oklahoma State Capitol grounds. The Oklahoma Supreme Court recently ruled the 10 Commandments monument violates a section of the state constitution that bans the use of state property for the benefit of a religion.      Lawmakers in the socially conservative state responded with threats to seek the impeachment of the court's justices and pledged to push for changes to the constitution.      Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin, a Republican, said she will keep the monument in place as the state appeals the decision.      On Saturday, the presentation of Baphomet in Detroit drew protest from local Christians. About 50 people prayed for the city and denounced the monument outside a business where the Satanic Temple previously tried to display the statue before fears of a backlash scuttled the plan.      \\"The last thing we need in Detroit is having a welcome home party for evil,\\" said Reverend Dave Bullock, a pastor at Greater St. Matthew Baptist Church in Highland Park, Michigan.      (Editing by Alex Dobuzinskis) ||||| The Satanic Temple is a non-theistic religious organization dedicated to Satanic practice and the promotion of Satanic rights. We understand the Satanic figure as a symbol of man’s inherent nature, representative of the eternal rebel, enlightened inquiry and personal freedom rather than a supernatural deity or being. It is our mission to facilitate communication and mobilization of politically aware Satanists, secularists, and advocates for individual liberty. We actively provide outreach and participate in public affairs where the issues might benefit from rational, Satanic insights.      The Detroit Chapter is officially affiliated with the national Satanic Temple organization, we are a self-organized, volunteer-led group that seeks to organize and empower like-minded individuals who are passionate about supporting The Satanic Temple’s mission. We promote awareness of the Satanic cause, educate our peers and encourage critical thinking, activism and justice within the Detroit community.      Our Mission      The Satanic Temple (TST) facilitates the communication and mobilization of politically aware Satanists, secularists, and advocates for individual liberty. The mission of The Satanic Temple is to encourage benevolence and empathy among all people. In addition, we embrace practical common sense and justice.      As an organized religion, we feel it is our function to actively provide outreach, to lead by example, and to participate in public affairs wheresoever the issues might benefit from rational, Satanic insights. As Satanists, we all should be guided by our consciences to undertake noble pursuits guided by our individual wills. We believe that this is the hope of all mankind and the highest aspiration of humanity.      What we Believe      The Satanic Temple practices non-theistic Satanism, we believe that religion can, and should, be divorced from superstition. As such, we do not believe in either God or the Devil as supernatural forces. We bow to no god or gods and celebrate our outsider status. To embrace the name Satan is to embrace rational inquiry removed from supernaturalism and archaic tradition-based superstitions. The Satanist should actively work to hone critical thinking and exercise reasonable inquiry in all things. Our beliefs must be malleable to the best current scientific understandings of the material world — never the reverse.      What does Satan mean to The Satanic Temple?      Satan is symbolic of the Eternal Rebel in opposition to arbitrary authority, forever defending personal sovereignty even in the face of insurmountable odds. Satan is an icon for the unbowed will of the relentless inquirer… the heretic who questions sacred laws and rejects all tyrannical impositions. This concept provides us with an exemplar by which we live our lives; he is a symbol of defiance, of independence, of wisdom and self-empowerment. Satanism does not provide some artificial framework for coping with the world, but rather, it serves as an affirmation of natural existence. Ours is the historical and literary Satan, akin to western literary traditions expressed in texts such as Milton’s Paradise Lost and France’s The Revolt of the Angels, the roots of which lie in a metaphorical construct of the adversary which pre-dates even Judeo-Christian faith.      On Non-Theistic Religions      The idea that religion belongs to supernaturalists is backwards, and offensive. There are several other recognized Religions that are largely considered to be atheistic (Buddism for example). The metaphorical Satanic construct is no more arbitrary to us than are the deeply held beliefs that we actively advocate for. Are we supposed to believe that those who pledge submission to an ethereal supernatural deity hold to their values more deeply than we? Are we supposed to concede that only the superstitious are proper recipients of religious exemption and privilege? In fact, Satanism provides us all that a religion should, without a compulsory attachment to untenable items of faith-based belief: It provides a narrative structure by which we contextualize our lives and works. It provides a body of symbolism and religious practice — a sense of identity, culture, community, and shared values.      How we differ from Secular Philosophies      A unifying attribute of all Satanists is our embrace of our outsider status. Satanists adhere to the principles of individual sovereignty and rejection of tyrannical authority. Additionally, Satanism is deeply rooted within a rich historical and literary framework, which spans thousands of years in cultures across the globe. We embrace our philosophic roots as part of our religion. These histories and concerns are of tantamount importance to us, but are not fundamental components of Humanism or other secular philosophies.      What sets us apart from other Satanic organizations      Modern Satanic organizations have typically concentrated almost solely on pointless and misguided efforts to define, and establish a monopoly upon, a model of the “one true Satanism”. This obsession with ownership has fomented an unfortunate culture in which Satanism’s most vitriolic critics are often self- identified Satanists themselves. The Satanic Temple is not only uninterested in establishing itself as the sole arbiter of Satanic practice, but has always been open to working with other self-identified Satanic organizations to promote general recognition of Satanic legitimacy. While many Satanic organizations seem to take pleasure in needless hierarchies while isolating themselves in petty organizational autocracy, The Satanic Temple disdains rigid, centralized authority and focuses its efforts in effecting tangible change — to our benefit — in the real world. The time for a politically active, relevant Satanic movement is now.      ACTIVISM AND THE SATANIC PHILOSOPHY      Satanism is a philosophy of Action. The Satanic Temple often serves as a “poison pill” in the Church/State debate. Satanists, asserting their religious rights and privileges where religious agendas have been successful in imposing themselves upon public affairs, can serve as a poignant reminder that such privileges are for everyone. We understand that self-identified Satanists deserve just as much consideration as any other religions group. We are a sincere movement that stands in defiance of the unopposed, dogmatic moral legislation from a singular powerful religious voice. We refuse to be enslaved by a theocratic system, which openly seeks to control and destroy sexuality, individual autonomy and critical thinking. As the Eternal Rebel once defied the tyrant god, we too will rebel.      Download a PDF of The Satanic Temple Introductory Primer      Our Tenents ||||| The Satanic Temple of Detroit unveiled an enormous bronze Baphomet statue Saturday night despite protests from the local community.      A group of Satanists in in Detroit unveiled a 1.5-ton, 8.5-foot bronze statue of Baphomet flanked by two young children, shown here in New York, on Saturday night.      In an effort to make a statement against religious monuments on government property, members of the Satanic Temple of Detroit unveiled a statue of a goat-headed winged statue in Detroit on Saturday night.      The 9-foot-tall bronze statue of Baphomet made its public debut at a ticketed event in an industrial building near the Detroit River. The monument was revealed shortly before midnight as hundreds of supporters cheered and chanted “Hail Satan.”      Members of the Satanic Temple of Detroit viewed the unveiling as a victory; “a celebration of a group effort” that has taken several years to complete.      Not all Detroit residents were as pleased. The statue has been a point of contention in the Motor City for months, and demonstrations against it continued up until the last minute. Around 100 protesters turned out Saturday afternoon to pray and denounce the monument, calling it “disrespectful” to other religions.      Jex Blackmore, the director of the Satanic Temple of Detroit, says this backlash is the product of years of “deep misunderstanding” about Satanism.      “Satanism and the term ‘Satanic’ has been used a political tool to demonize individuals who have rebelled against systems of authority and power,” Blackmore said in a heated segment of WJBK-TV’s “Let it Rip.”      The Satanic Temple of Detroit is non-theistic and does not celebrate the Judeo-Christian representation of Satan, Blackmore said. The group’s website defines Satan as “a symbol of man’s inherent nature, representative of the eternal rebel, enlightened inquiry and personal freedom rather than a supernatural deity or being.”      The Temple originally applied for the statue to be installed in 2012 near a Ten Commandments monument on the Oklahoma State Capitol grounds. After that application was denied, the Temple decided on Detroit, where the Satanic Temple is said to have a stronger-than-average congregation.      Blackmore said Saturday that temple members planned to transport the sculpture to Arkansas, where the governor recently signed a bill authorizing a Ten Commandments monument on the State Capitol's grounds.      This isn’t the Satanic Temple of Detroit’s first controversial demonstration. Last Christmas, the organization set up a “Snaketivity” scene outside the Michigan State Capitol in support of LGBT rights.      Blackmore said in an interview with MLive that these efforts are often seen as “trolling” for shock value. But she insists this is not the case.      “We are interested in positive and effective change,” Blackmore said. “And we're interested in positive conversation.”      Rev. David Bullock of the Greater St. Matthew Baptist Church expressed skepticism of Blackmore's stated intentions, instead saying that the statue makes a mockery of other religions.      “The statue is supposed to create a dialogue. Well, statues don’t talk. If you want to have a dialogue with other faiths, why not send an email in advance or knock on the door?” Rev.

The Detroit... (Associated Press)      DETROIT (AP) — Several hundred people attended a Mass at a Detroit Catholic church to protest an 8½-foot-tall bronze statue of Satan that crowds of people also lined up to see.      Satanic Temple had said it would unveil the statue Saturday at a Detroit location that only people with tickets would know. Hundreds lined up Saturday evening to get the tickets as Christian protesters rallied nearby.      Earlier Saturday, The Detroit News says 200-250 people attended Mass at St. Joseph Church in a protest against the Satanic event.      The group had hoped to place the statue at the state Capitol in Oklahoma City until Oklahoma's Supreme Court banned religious displays on Capitol grounds.      The Satanic Temple now says it wants to erect it outside Arkansas' statehouse, where a Ten Commandments monument also is planned. ||||| Summary:","output":"A group of people who call themselves the Satanic Temple of Detroit revealed a big statue of a goat with wings and a human body in Detroit. They wanted to show that they didn't like the fact that religious statues are put on government land. Some people were happy to see the statue, but others in Detroit, who believe in God, didn't like it at all. They thought it was not respectful to their own religion. The people in the Satanic Temple wanted the statue to be placed near a religious monument in Oklahoma, but they were not allowed. Now, they hope to put it somewhere in Arkansas, near another religious monument."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: 5 percent of GDP compared to today's 3.5 percent. Hypothesis: The percent of GDP has dropped from 5 percent to 3.5 percent. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"In order to determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to break down and analyze both statements to understand their relationship and whether one can be logically derived from the other. Let's analyze them individually first. Premise: \\"5 percent of GDP compared to today's 3.5 percent.\\" The premise provides us with a comparison between two percentages of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) - 5 percent and 3.5 percent. The context for the comparison is not explicitly stated, but we can infer that the comparison is likely referring to the change in the percentage of GDP over time, with the 5 percent value being from a previous point in time and the current value being 3.5 percent. Hypothesis: \\"The percent of GDP has dropped from 5 percent to 3.5 percent.\\" The hypothesis asserts that there has been a decrease in the percentage of GDP from 5 percent to 3.5 percent. Temporally, this statement implies that at some previous point in time, the percentage of GDP was 5 percent, and presently, or at another point in time, it has dropped to 3.5 percent. Now, let's compare the two statements to establish whether the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise provides a comparison between two values of GDP – 5 percent and 3.5 percent – while the hypothesis asserts a drop in the percentage of GDP from the former value to the latter. The premise does not explicitly state the direction of change (i.e., whether the percent of GDP has increased or decreased), but from the context and use of \\"today,\\" we can infer that the comparison implies a relative decrease from 5 percent to 3.5 percent over time. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the premise does entail the hypothesis. The premise implies a change in the percentage of GDP from 5 percent to 3.5 percent but does not explicitly state the direction of the change (increase or decrease). However, the contextual clues allow us to infer that it is referring to a decrease. The hypothesis is directly stating that there has been a decrease in the percentage of GDP, which is in line with what we inferred from the premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) worker has been arrested on child neglect and drug charges after deputies found her six children living in 'deplorable' conditions. Investigators received a tip that DCF investigator Kysa Donawa, 41, and her husband Randy Donawa, 38 were growing marijuana at the family home in Kissimmee and obtained a search warrant for the property. When they got there, they found not only marijuana plants, but counterfeit money and a handgun. In addition, deputies say, the bins were overflowing with trash and there were roaches, flies and spiders infesting the house. Arrested: Kysa and Randy Donawa are facing six charges of child neglect and drug charges. Infested: Deputies say there were flies, spiders and roaches in the children's bedrooms. Unsafe: Chemicals and medications were found open and within reach of the children. According to Click Orlando, there are six children aged six, eight, nine, 12, 15 and 17 living at the house. Both husband and wife are now facing charges of production of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia and six counts of child neglect. Deputies said the toilets in the house didn't flush and that the smell of urine made it difficult to breath. Cleaning chemicals were out and open and pill bottles were within reach of the couple's six-year-old. There were 26 marijuana plants growing in the backyard.

And it worked. Almost overnight the discovery became a culinary sensation for vegans—Bon Appetit calls it a \\"silver bullet\\" egg substitute; Food52 is salivating over the chance to test it on macaroons and souffles, and in what can only be described as a profile of an ingredient, the New York Times calls it \\"magic.\\" Wohlt even helped generate a trendy new name for the bean juice: aquafaba, which combines the Latin words for \\"water\\" and \\"bean.\\" And the act of substituting is simple: a tablespoon for a yolk, two for a white, and three for a whole egg. Aquafaba works in a way that no other egg alternative has, but the science is still out on why. Harold McGee, author of the book On Food and Cooking, tells the Times that the key seems to be its blend of protein (though it's got a tenth of the protein in an egg) and dissolved starch, which helps to slow down the collapsing of foam. Home cooks and high-profile chefs alike are now experimenting with the ingredient, whipping up their own creations to largely positive praise. Condiment maker Sir Kensington's is even rolling out a new vegan mayonnaise using aquafaba that it calls Fabanaise. And while it doesn't appear to bring much nutritional value to the table, it is plant-based and could help reduce food waste given the stuff has until recently been largely dumped down the drain. (Want to lose weight? Going vegan might help.) Expand this summary.","output":"When vegan software engineer Goose Wohlt from Indiana stumbled upon a video of two French women using the liquid typically discarded from a can of chickpeas to create a delicious chocolate mousse, he quickly realized that this seemingly worthless liquid might just be the perfect egg substitute. Wohlt found that the chickpea liquid - which he later named \\"aquafaba\\" (from the Latin words for water and bean) - could be used as a substitute for an egg yolk or white, or even a whole egg. This seemingly miraculous, vegan-friendly egg alternative has rapidly taken the culinary world by storm and has even been described by the New York Times as \\"magic.\\" The unique properties of aquafaba have been hailed as a \\"silver bullet\\" by Bon Appetit, with Food52 eagerly exploring the possibilities of using it for macaroons, souffles, and other typically non-vegan delights. Not only does aquafaba imitate eggs in a way no other egg replacement has managed before, but it also offers several other advantages. While its nutritional value might not be quite as high as that of eggs, it is a plant-based alternative that can help reduce food waste, given that it is usually discarded. But how does aquafaba work so well as an egg substitute? According to Harold McGee, the author of the book \\"On Food and Cooking,\\" the secret appears to lie in aquafaba's unique blend of protein and dissolved starch. Although it has only one-tenth of the protein found in an egg, this mixture slows down the collapsing of foam, making it ideal for creating light, fluffy dishes. Many home and professional chefs alike are now eagerly experimenting with this versatile ingredient, with highly positive results. One example of aquafaba's potential in the culinary industry is Sir Kensington's new Fabanaise, a vegan mayonnaise that utilizes aquafaba as a key ingredient. This innovative condiment highlights the creative ways chefs and food manufacturers are exploring the use of aquafaba in their cooking, opening up new doors for vegans and non-vegans alike to enjoy a wider array of dietary options. In conclusion, the discovery of aquafaba as a versatile and vegan-friendly egg substitute has revolutionized the culinary world, offering newfound possibilities for vegans and non-vegans alike to enjoy delicious, egg-free dishes. With ingredient pioneers such as Goose Wohlt leading the charge and professional chefs eagerly embracing aquafaba's unique properties, this \\"magic\\" bean juice promises to have a lasting and positive impact on the future of plant-based cuisine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the early years of his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kertész never felt that he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he is considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism.Expected by his family to work as a stockbroker, Kertész pursued photography independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success. Due to German persecution of the Jews and the threat of World War II, Kertész decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work. In the 1940s and 1950s, he stopped working for magazines and began to achieve greater international success.

When Lily and her brother tried to play with the marbles on the bedspread, they observed that the marbles barely moved. This is because a fabric bedspread has a rough surface, which creates more friction between the marbles and the bedspread. Friction is the resistive force that opposes the relative motion of objects in contact with each other. When they switched to playing with the marbles on a plastic table, they noticed that the marbles moved in all directions much more easily. This is because the plastic table has a smoother surface than the bedspread, resulting in less friction between the marbles and the table. With reduced friction, it becomes easier for the marbles to roll and move around when applied with force.

Answer the following question: Information:  - The National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, known simply as the National League (NL), is the older of two leagues constituting Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada, and the world's oldest current professional team sports league. Founded on February 2, 1876, to replace the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, it is sometimes called the Senior Circuit, in contrast to MLB's other league, the American League, which was founded 25 years later. Both leagues currently have 15 teams. The two league champions of 1903 arranged to compete against each other in the inaugural World Series. After the 1904 champions failed to reach a similar agreement, the two leagues formalized the World Series as an arrangement between the leagues. National League teams have won 48 of the 112 World Series contested from 1903 to 2016. The 2016 National League champions are the Chicago Cubs.  - Fresno, the county seat of Fresno County, is a city in the U.S. state of California.

Summarize the following: Don’t spend all of your time outside of lessons making fully personalized lesson plans—instead, set up a lesson plan system and tailor it to your students as you learn more about them.  Have a library of materials such as chord handouts, songs, commonly used scale sheets, blank chord grids, and a set of fallback lessons.  Organize your system based on skill level. Teach your students some tips and tricks at the beginning to help them see progress early on. This will encourage them and give them the confidence to keep taking lessons.  For example, you could teach students basic scales so they can practice making up solo parts. You could also teach them a famous riff or the chords to their favorite song. Think of songs and riffs that people would play in a guitar store while checking out the guitars—songs that sound cool, but are deceptively easy. Group classes will cut down your hours and help you earn more money. A good group size is about eight people—with this number, you can make some extra money by charging per student, and you’ll still be able to give each student some one-on-one instruction.  Group lessons usually last forty minutes to an hour. Depending on the age range of your students, you may want to adjust the time for their attention span. Younger children tend to need breaks or shorter lessons. This style of class has a very different dynamic and may take some experience to master. Students may move along at different paces and become frustrated. Group classes generally work best for beginner or intermediate skill levels. Putting together a recital is a great way to motivate students, give them a goal to work towards, and reward them for their efforts. It also lets parents see what they’ve been paying for.  Tell the students about the recital several months in advance. Give them one or two songs to prepare and perform at the recital and consistently work on those songs with them. Invite your students’ families and tell students they can bring friends and extended family as well. Prepare some refreshments or ask parents to contribute some refreshments such as cookies and fruit beforehand. School auditoriums, churches, and senior centers are great location options for a recital. If you’re having a  hard time finding students in your area, try teaching through Skype. You can also use Skype when you take vacations or travel to maintain your current client base. Many guitar teachers feel like they can’t take a break or travel, so this is a great option to utilize. One downside to a career in teaching guitar is its unpredictability. Sometimes factors such as lesson cancellation, student turnover, and holiday lulls may mean that your income fluctuates from month to month. Start thinking of ways to supplement your income.  One option is to pre-record your lessons and then post them online and sell access to them. This will give you passive income and if it works, it will cut down the amount of time you’ll spend giving live lessons during the week.  You could also look for a part-time job as a contract guitar teacher at a school or college. Summary:","output":"To efficiently teach guitar, develop a lesson plan system that can be tailored to individual students as you get to know them better. Create a library of materials, including chord handouts, songs, scale sheets, and fallback lessons, and organize them by skill level. Introduce tips and tricks early on to boost students' confidence and engagement. Consider offering group classes of around eight people, which can help increase earnings and provide one-on-one instruction. These classes work best for beginner or intermediate levels and should be adjusted for the students' ages and attention spans. Organizing recitals gives students a goal and showcases their progress, while also allowing parents to see the value of lessons. Inform students of the recital well in advance and work with them on chosen songs to perform. Incorporate technology, such as Skype, for teaching remotely and maintaining your client base when traveling. Be prepared for income fluctuations due to cancellations, student turnover, and seasonal lulls. Supplement your earnings by creating pre-recorded lessons for online sales, or seek part-time employment as a contract guitar teacher at educational institutions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose your answer from: A). no. B). yes. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. To appropriately answer both questions, let's dive into them individually: Question 1: What does no backlog mean in engineering? In the context of engineering, specifically when referring to the academic progress of engineering students, a backlog refers to any course or subject that a student has failed to pass in their first attempt. A student is deemed to have a backlog if they did not obtain the minimum passing marks, grade, or credits required for a course during its designated examination period. When the term \\"no backlog\\" is used, it means that a student has successfully passed all the subjects or courses they have attempted throughout their engineering education. This is typically considered a favorable situation, as it demonstrates the student's ability to maintain a consistent academic performance without encountering any significant challenges that could impede their progress. Graduating without any backlog might also increase the students' chances of securing a good job or pursuing higher levels of education. Question 2: What does Backlogs mean as per JNTUH? JNTUH stands for Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad. It is a public university in the city of Hyderabad in Telangana, India, focused mainly on engineering, offering undergraduate and postgraduate courses in multiple disciplines. As per JNTUH, backlogs refer to any subjects that a student fails to pass within the regular examination schedules. Such situations often occur when a student does not achieve the required passing marks or credits necessary to complete a course. The institution usually allows the students to reattempt these subjects during supplementary or subsequent examination schedules until they successfully clear the backlogs. In conclusion, Question 1 focuses on the implications of having no backlog in engineering, while Question 2 aims to clarify the concept of backlogs in the context of JNTUH. Thus, they are not asking the same thing."},{"instruction":"This article: The film begins with self-help author Wes Wilson who has recently come out with his first best selling book.

Write some highlights for the following article: When you sit across the desk from someone with overwhelming debt, you can sense their fear before a word is spoken. And when their home is in jeopardy, the fear fills the room. I was a credit counselor for 16 years, and quickly discovered that people in debt are very ashamed of their situation. In all my years, I never counseled anyone who was cavalier about their circumstances, or intentionally sought to dig a deep financial hole. But the shame that accompanies foreclosure tops anything I've ever experienced. There's something about people losing their homes that is disturbing beyond measure. Failure has become a part of their demeanor. After all, foreclosure is about more than the house, and more than the money. It's about losing the dream, taking your children out of their school and moving your family away from their neighborhood friends. Pulling up roots is never easy, particularly when you're forced to do so. The job of the counselor is to put the financial pieces back together, provide hope, and help move people toward a more financially stable life. Each day housing counselors pick up the phone and advocate for their client, often going to the mat with a lender to achieve the resolution option that is best suited for that individual. For example, I'm reminded of the 46-year-old single mom's foreclosure problem that started with a heart attack. Out of work for three months with no income and medical bills compounding her existing debt, she was headed for foreclosure. She and an NFCC certified housing counselor were able to work out a loan modification that not only kept her in her home, but also reduced her monthly mortgage payment. Housing issues are complicated, with the terms short sale, forbearance agreement, deed-in-lieu and loan modification foreign to the consumer. But such resolution options are all part of a day's work for the housing counselor, whose goal is to determine the best long-term solution for the consumer. Their experience allows them to \\"talk the talk\\" with the lender and often achieve the happy ending that everyone is after. Each case is individual, with outcomes as varied as the problems, but avoiding foreclosure, where appropriate, is the goal of all parties. Foreclosures happen for many reasons, some of which are beyond the borrower's control:. • Economic hardship related to job loss, reduced hours at work, medical issues or divorce;. • Unaffordable payments when a loan resets to a higher annual percentage rate;. • Buying a house that was more costly than the borrower's income could reasonably support long-term, and. • Increased cost of living, which places more demands on consumers' budgets, forcing them to make hard choices about which debts to pay. Of course, the best foreclosure prevention tool is making an educated and informed decision when buying a home. Pre-purchase counseling is particularly useful for first-time buyers, helping them understand the full responsibility of homeownership. However, once it becomes apparent that buyers can no longer keep up with their loans, it is critical for them to reach out for help right away. Postponing dealing with the mortgage delinquency is one of the main impediments to solving the problem. Delinquent homeowners likely will receive a Notice to Cure Default that lists HUD housing counselors they can contact, as well as hardship program options. They should seek help at once. Many resolution options such as a short sale -- in which the home is sold for less than the remaining mortgage amount and the lender accepts at least part of the loss -- are only open to those who have not dug a deep financial hole. These solutions do not preserve homeownership, but they are less damaging to the consumer's credit history, and depending on their structure, could possibly allow the consumer to leave the home owing little or nothing at all. When homeowners in trouble reach out to lenders, few know that they need to speak to the loss mitigation department, and not the collection area. Once contact is made, buyers should be sure to keep records. Keep a log of the date and time of each call, the person with whom you speak, and the content of the conversation. Ask questions and restate to make sure you are understanding information. Without accurate documentation, any dispute could turn into a \\"he-said/she-said\\" with the homeowner being the loser. Don't expect a quick answer. Follow up with your mortgage company to make sure any paperwork you sent was received and logged. In many cases, getting a yes or a no can take weeks, and weeks can feel like years when saving your home is involved. As I write this, it seems as though new proposals to help consumers avoid foreclosure appear daily. Whether it is actions by Fannie Mae, the FDIC or the lenders themselves, solving the mortgage crisis is recognized as an essential component to getting the economy back on track. Any resolution is likely to be as complex as the problem itself. Exotic loan products, combined with making them secure, are far different from yesteryear when we went to our community bank and took out a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage that it held the full term. Homeownership can still be the American dream, but only under the right circumstances. Lenders are returning to more traditional lending standards, and with good reason. Buyers are realizing that what seems too good to be true is often exactly that. America will find solid footing, but until then, many feel as though their home was built on shifting sands. Let's redefine financial success, and this time have it represent living within your means, being able to pay bills in full when the statement arrives, understanding the terms of a loan or credit card, knowing that there are things more important than hocking your financial peace of mind for a larger house or shinier car. In other words, let's begin living the true American dream, one of financial responsibility that is celebrated by all. It's a dream we can make come true, one household at a time. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gail Cunningham. Highlights:","output":"1. The fear and shame accompanying foreclosure are immense, as it involves not only losing a house but also uprooting a family and their dreams. 2. Housing counselors work tirelessly to find the best long-term resolutions for clients facing foreclosure, including loan modifications to keep people in their homes. 3. Foreclosures can happen due to factors like job loss, medical issues, unmanageable mortgage resets, or living costs beyond the household income. 4. Pre-purchase counseling is crucial in preventing foreclosure as it educates and informs home buyers about the responsibilities of homeownership. 5. Homeowners unable to keep up with their mortgages should seek help immediately from HUD housing counselors who can guide them through potential resolution options. 6. Documentation is vital when engaging with lenders' loss mitigation departments; homeowners must keep records of dates, times, and conversation contents. 7. Though resolutions may take time to be finalized, efforts by Fannie Mae, FDIC, and other entities recognize that resolving the mortgage crisis is key to recovering the economy. 8. The true American dream should involve financial responsibility, living within one's means, and understanding the terms of loans and credit cards."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was one of many movies I watched with my parents, but this was the only one we walked out of. Since then I had never seen Interiors until just recently, and I could have lived out the rest of my life without it. What a pretentious, ponderous, and painfully boring piece of 70's wine and cheese tripe. Woody Allen is one of my favorite directors but Interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career. In the unmistakable style of Ingmar Berman, Allen gives us a dark, angular, muted, insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce, estrangement, career, love, non-love, halitosis, whatever. The film, intentionally, has no comic relief, no music, and is drenched in shadowy pathos. This film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature, using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a \\"more pronounced depth of meaning and truth\\". But Woody Allen is no Ingmar Bergman. The film is painfully slow and dull. But beyond that, I simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters. Instead I felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling, whining, nicotine stained, martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity. Amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked Brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room. Everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes. Everyone is \\"lost\\" and \\"struggling\\", desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them. It's never about resolution, it's only about interminable introspective babble. It is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audience's ability to connect. Woody Allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out. And for that reason I found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining. I see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through Prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance. I highly recommend this one if you're feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death. Otherwise, let's just pretend this film never happened.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: This is a beauty myth that I have been wanting to bust for a while as I am surprised how many people actually believe it. I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it? Or worse, each time you waxed your legs, seven hairs replaced each pulled one - what state would your legs be in now? According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Who didn't want the author to pluck grey hairs?

Please answer the following question: Title: Fair history, poor science Product review: Beyond Einstein provides a decent historical narrative of the efforts to unify physics: quantum mechanics with general relativity, the 4 forces with each other. It is occasionally repetitious.The book also attempts an exposition of the pertinent physics. In this, it falls far short, at every point. The exposition is too superficial to carry the historical narrative. For instance, although the reconciliation of quantum mechanics with relativity is of great importance, its essence is nowhere discussed. Simply saying that quantum mechanics is good in the small world and relativity in the large is neither adequate nor quite correct.The book reads like one of those manuals produced by a technical writer who doesn't really grasp the subject matter. The hope is that the reader won't notice. The fact that the senior author is a physicist who has done research in the field makes Beyond Einstein all the more disappointing. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"The review depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer appreciates the historical narrative aspect of the book but criticizes its exposition of the pertinent physics as superficial and inadequate.

After a date with Chris, Sarah is upset to learn that he has spread a false rumor that they had sex. When Sarah confronts him, he treats her disrespectfully in front of his friends. Sarah casts a love spell upon him; Rochelle casts a revenge spell on a hateful racist bully, Laura Lizzie (Christine Taylor); Bonnie casts a spell for beauty; and Nancy for liberation from working-class poverty.

Please write a short summary for the following article: The great house price stand-off: accidental landlords beware A growing army of ‘accidental landlords’ is being created by the stand-off between potential homebuyers unwilling to overpay and would-be vendors reluctant to cut asking prices. According to Land Registry figures, the number of homes sold last month has collapsed to little more than a third of the level seen a decade ago. That means many inheritors of property and those who would like to trade down on retirement are letting rather than selling. Some are willing and able to become DIY landlords but others prefer to use a letting agent. This can cost about 15pc of gross rental income, although good hagglers may obtain discounts. But there are pitfalls for unwary buy-to-let (BTL) landords and your choice should not be based on cost alone, warned Ed Mead, a director of estate and letting agents Douglas & Gordon (D&G). He should know, not least because D&G specialised in lettings decades before the BTL boom and Mr Mead also sits on the board of the Property Ombudsman, which offers free arbitration of disputes. That could prove important, as BTL landlords do not enjoy the same legal protection as other buyers and sellers of property. Mr Mead explained: “Although all sales estate agents need to be registered by law, it is not a requirement for lettings agents to be registered. Paradoxically, sales agents do not handle money but lettings agents often do and many of the rising numbers of cases that the Ombudsman sees are to do with monies held. “Given that lettings are going to become a bigger part of our property landscape, it beggars belief that this Government can’t be bothered to force lettings agents to be registered.” Many problems arise because landlords fail to ensure tenants’ references are investigated thoroughly. Another common mistake is to allow agents to charge fees annually in advance, as opposed to quarterly. That can leave landlords out of pocket if tenants leave after six months. The simplest way to reduce the risk of insoluble disputes is to choose a member of the Association of Residential Letting Agents (ARLA), whose members must comply with Ombudsman rulings. Resist the temptation to cut corners when it comes to the paperwork, as that can cause trouble later. Tony Lam, lettings agent at London’s West End specialist estate agency, LDG, emphasised: “Landlords must ensure all documentation is in place and up-to-date. “They need documents from their mortgage company to prove they have consent to rent the property, an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) and other certificates, such as electrical and gas safety certificates to ensure the property is safe and hazard free. “A common misconception among inexperienced landlords is that if a tenant causes any damage, their deposit can be withheld. But, by definition, a tenant’s deposit does not belong to the landlord. Under the government’s Tenancy Deposit Scheme (TDS), landlords are prevented from holding it or claiming from it without the tenant’s permission.” This raises the important point that landlords should be clear at outset what they expect letting agents to do for their fees. Nicholas Ayre, lettings expert at Home Fusion, said: “First up, decide whether the agent is simply finding your tenants or dealing with everything from drawing up a tenancy agreement to managing the property, collecting the deposit and rent, and dealing with problems on your behalf.” For example, if the boiler breaks down, do you have time to find an engineer to fit a replacement? To a large extent, landlords will get what they pay for when appointing letting agents – but choosing an ARLA member at least reduces the risk of being unable to resolve disputes if they arise.","output":"Many people who inherit property or want to sell their homes to downsize in retirement are becoming \\"accidental landlords\\" because potential buyers don't want to pay too much and sellers don't want to lower their asking prices. These new landlords need to be careful when choosing a letting agent, as they don't have the same legal protections as regular buyers and sellers. It's a good idea to choose an agent who is a member of the Association of Residential Letting Agents, as they must follow certain rules and help with any problems that might come up. It's also important for landlords to have all the right paperwork and make sure they understand their responsibilities and rights when it comes to issues like their tenant's deposit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The weight of a bitter and grueling divorce had alienated him from both his devoted fellows and his own young son, Samuel. Waking up each day to the same weariness and lingering regret, TJ often found solace in the local pub down by the docks, reminiscing about his past glory with a few glasses of whiskey. On one such rainy evening as TJ sat hunched over his favored corner table, he noticed a familiar stranger eavesdropping on his tales of treacherous sea exploits. Squinting through the dim lighting, TJ could barely make out the face of Kurston Brave, a well-known undersea treasure hunter in the diving community. Slowly, Kurston approached the veteran captain and revealed his presence. He had carefully listened to TJ's entire conversation and now bore an idea that could potentially regain their lost fortune. With nothing left to lose, TJ was all ears. He took another swig of his whiskey as Kurston formed a sly grin. The treasure hunter told stories of an underwater cave, hiding a priceless hoard of gold and artifacts from a lost shipwreck that sank centuries ago. He knew of their precise location and revealed that he had a wealthy backer willing to fund the daring salvage operation. The only thing they needed was a skilled and fearless captain to lead them to their goal. Although his better judgment told him to be wary of such risky endeavors, TJ was tired of his dreary life and thirsted for a purpose. He agreed to meet the unknown backer in hopes of a successful partnership, and with Kurston's patron by his side, they would rebuild their legacy. The following day, the two met with the backer in a discreet location on the outskirts of the city. Lewis Blackwood, the estranged businessman, agreed to fund the perilous expedition on seemingly unexplored underwater grounds, but not without setting a few terms that would stake his own claim. With the deal in place, the team was assembled with haste. Thomas \\"TJ\\" Robinson captaining, Kurston Brave navigating, and two young and immensely capable divers, Dylan and Ray, eager for an opportunity that could make or break their careers. The endeavor appeared promising as the crew tugged their gear and set sail to find their prize. For weeks, they meticulously navigated the treacherous waters, assessing various obstacles and dangers their map had failed to reveal. One fateful day, as the relentless weather finally abated and left an opening for their descent, the crew ventured into the depths in search of ancient treasure. They were prepared for the challenges that lay before them, but nothing could have prepared them for the tragedy they would soon encounter. Under the guidance of Captain Robinson, Dylan and Ray ambitiously submerged into the unknown, leaving a trail of bubbles marking their path while they explored the seemingly endless caverns. Deep within the murky abyss, the two young divers made a breathtaking discovery – the hidden treasure trove, a testament to the undying allure of lost riches, promising wealth and fame. However, unbeknownst to the team's prosperity, danger continued to lurk in the depths. As a desperate air supply ticked away, the crew worked tirelessly to unearth their hard-won prize. In moments of high pressure, Kurston panicked and made a fatal mistake. He accidentally cut the air hose supplying oxygen to Ray, the third diver. In a matter of seconds, Ray's cries for help created a panic, and the crew immediately ceased their salvage operation to rescue their companion. They pulled him towards the surface, but it was too late; the icy embrace of the abyss had already claimed his life. As the grief-stricken crew mourned the loss of their colleague, they knew the price they had paid was far too great. Broken and defeated, Captain Thomas \\"TJ\\" Robinson returned to port with a heavy heart, an inherent reminder of the perils they faced and the lives lost to the depths, forever haunting him. No amount of wealth or fame could erase the harrowing experiences the team had endured, and it was to be their final expedition. As they disembarked for the final time, TJ Robinson found solace in the bond he had rebuilt with his crew, a bitter end to a perilous journey that started with a man's longing for adventure and a chance to reconnect with his estranged son."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Much of this has gone but there is still a floral clock and a railway. Jackson bought the house in 1987 for 19.5m but struggled to pay for it, until an investment company stepped in to help him save it from auction. The property is now called Sycamore Valley Ranch and has undergone extensive redevelopment since Jackson's death in 2009. The 2,800 acre (1,100 hectare) site, at 5225 Figueroa Mountain Road, is now being sold jointly by Sotheby's and Hilton & Hyland.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: What would you need a light source to use? Options: - dard - sky - books - candle - house  Explain why a human would choose \\"books\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would likely choose \\"books\\" as the answer to the question of what would you need a light source to use because, out of all the options provided, it is the most appropriate and practical application of a light source. Let's briefly analyze each option: - Dard: This term does not make sense in the given context, and it appears to be either a typo or a misused term. Thus, it cannot be considered a relevant option. - Sky: Although the sky can be a source of light (i.e., during the day through sunlight), it is not something that typically requires an additional light source. The sky itself generates light, so using a light source to interact with it is not relevant. Furthermore, the sky, as a natural phenomenon, cannot be \\"used\\" in the same sense that the other options can. - Books: Books are tangible objects that serve as a source of knowledge and entertainment by holding written or printed texts. Reading books generally necessitates sufficient lighting for a comfortable and clear reading experience. A light source is essential in ensuring that the text is correctly illuminated and legible, which is particularly important during late hours or in dimly lit environments. Therefore, \\"books\\" is an appropriate option in needing a light source for use. - Candle: While candles can be used as a source of light, their primary purpose is to generate light rather than require it. Therefore, choosing candles as an answer to the question would be somewhat circular and not directly address the inquiry. - House: A house is a structure that can provide shelter, security, and a living space for individuals and families. While a house may require the use of light sources (such as lamps, ceiling lights, or wall-mounted lights) for indoor illumination, this option is less specific and potentially less pertinent than \\"books\\" in terms of requiring lighting for direct interaction or primary use. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"books\\" as the answer to the question because it is the most suitable option among the choices provided. A light source is crucial for reading books, especially in low-light conditions, to improve visibility and prevent eye strain. Moreover, as a widely utilized object that demands appropriate lighting for users to engage with, \\"books\\" represent a practical and reasonable answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -1482*a - 80 = -1490*a for a.","output":"To solve the given equation, -1482*a - 80 = -1490*a for a, we'll begin by isolating the variable a on one side of the equation. Here are the detailed steps: 1. Add 1490*a to both sides of the equation to bring all the terms involving 'a' on one side: -1482*a + 1490*a - 80 = -1490*a + 1490*a 2. Simplify the equation: 8*a - 80 = 0 3. Add 80 to both sides to isolate the term with 'a': 8*a = 80 4. Now, to find the value of 'a,' we need to divide both sides by 8: a = 80 / 8 5. Simplify the expression to get the value of 'a': a = 10 Hence, the solution to the given equation -1482*a - 80 = -1490*a is a = 10."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - An electronic game is a game that employs electronics to create an interactive system with which a player can play. Video game is the most common form today, and for this reason the terms are often mistakenly used synonymously. Other common forms of electronic game include such products as handheld electronic games, standalone systems (e.g. pinball, slot machines, or electro-mechanical arcade games), and exclusively non-visual products (e.g. audio games).  - Konami is famous for popular video game series such as \\"Castlevania\\", \\"Contra\\", \\"Dance Dance Revolution\\", \\"Gradius\\", \\"Frogger\\", \\"Suikoden\\", \\"Ganbare Goemon\\", \\"Metal Gear\\", \\"Mirmo\\", \\"Beatmania IIDX\\", \\"Pro Evolution Soccer\\", \\"Boktai\\", \\"Silent Hill\\", \\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\\", and \\"Sound Voltex\\".

Q:Information:  - The Second Punic War, also referred to as The Hannibalic War and (by the Romans) the War Against Hannibal, lasted from 218 to 201 BC and involved combatants in the western and eastern Mediterranean. This was the second major war between Carthage and the Roman Republic and its allied Italic socii, with the crucial participation of Numidian-Berber armies and tribes on both sides. The two states fought three major wars with each other over the course of their existence. They are called the \\"Punic Wars\\" because Rome's name for Carthaginians was \\"Poeni\\", derived from \\"Poenici\\" (earlier form of \\"Punici\\"), a reference to the founding of Carthage by Phoenician settlers.  - Clastidium (modern Casteggio), was a village of the Anamares, in Gallia Cispadana, on the Via Postumia, 5 miles east of Iria (modern Voghera) and 31 miles west of Placentia.  - The Roman Kingdom was the period of the ancient Roman civilization characterized by a monarchical form of government of the city of Rome and its territories.  - Archimedes of Syracuse  was a Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer. Although few details of his life are known, he is regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity. Generally considered the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time, Archimedes anticipated modern calculus and analysis by applying concepts of infinitesimals and the method of exhaustion to derive and rigorously prove a range of geometrical theorems, including the area of a circle, the surface area and volume of a sphere, and the area under a parabola.  - Lucius Annaeus Florus (c. 74 AD  c. 130 AD) was a Roman historian who lived in the time of Trajan and Hadrian. He was born in Africa.  - The spolia opima (\\"rich spoils\\") were the armour, arms, and other effects that an ancient Roman general stripped from the body of an opposing commander slain in single combat. The \\"spolia opima\\" were regarded as the most honourable of the several kinds of war trophies a commander could obtain, including enemy military standards and the peaks of warships.  - Hegemony (or , or  \\"leadership, rule\\") is the political, economic, or military predominance or control of one state over others. In ancient Greece (8th century BCE  6th century CE), \\"hegemony\\" denoted the politicomilitary dominance of a city-state over other city-states. The dominant state is known as the \\"hegemon\\".  - The Insubres or Insubri were a Gaulish population settled in Insubria, in what is now the Italian region of Lombardy. They were the founders of Mediolanum (Milan). Though completely Gaulish at the time of Roman conquest, they were the result of the fusion of pre-existing Ligurian and Celtic population with Gaulish tribes who had come from what is now Central Europe.  - The Battle of Clastidium was fought in 222 BC between a Roman Republican army led by the Roman consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus and the Insubres. Florus tells us that the Insubred were led by Viridomarus, or Britomartus as the name varies in translation. The Romans won the battle, and in the process, Marcellus earned the Spolia opima, one of the highest honors in ancient Rome, by killing the King in single combat.  - Viridomarus or Britomartus as translations vary , ( died 222 BC ) was a Gaulish military leader who led an army against an army of the Roman Republic at the Battle of Clastidium . The Romans won the battle , and in the process , Marcus Claudius Marcellus , the Roman leader , earned the spolia opima by killing Viridomarus in single combat .  - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.  - The Roman Republic was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world.  - Marcus Claudius Marcellus (c. 268  208 BC), five times elected as consul of the Roman Republic, was an important Roman military leader during the Gallic War of 225 BC and the Second Punic War. Marcellus gained the most prestigious award a Roman general could earn, the spolia opima, for killing the Gallic military leader and king Viridomarus in hand-to-hand combat in 222 BC at the battle of Clastidium. Furthermore, he is noted for having conquered the fortified city of Syracuse in a protracted siege during which Archimedes, the famous inventor, was killed. Marcus Claudius Marcellus died in battle in 208 BC, leaving behind a legacy of military conquests and a reinvigorated Roman legend of the \\"spolia opima\\".  - Single combat is a duel between two single warriors which takes place in the context of a battle between two armies. Often, it is champion warfare, with the two considered the champions of their respective sides. Instances of single combat are known from Classical Antiquity and the Middle Ages.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The next generation of smart phone could combine the date from its gyroscopes   with a built-in compass to allow you to track your indoor movements even without GPS.          Research described it in the international Journal of Innovative Computing and Applications by Shahid Ayub of Lancaster University, and his colleagues there and at HW Communications, suggests that the embedded inertial sensors   in many smart phones have added the facility to be used for localization and tracking applications. The primary benefit of using smart phones is that no additional infrastructure would need to be installed for monitoring personnel movements in a wide variety of situations not least staff, equipment and inventory movements in warehouse facilities, shopping malls and factories. In contrast, other technology being proposed would require new equipment,such as RFID technologies. However, smart phones do not yet have the ability to pinpoint their location without recourse to the GPS system, which is not accessible indoors and has the added disadvantage of using up battery power very quickly even if it could be used. Inertial navigation only provides the necessary information   to a specified starting point the team says. This is useful for anyone with a non-GPS smart phone who wishes to track the route they take when walking or jogging if they specify their starting point. The team suggests that pedestrians indoors could be positioned using a combination of the smart phone accelerometer   and an built-in digital compass, something that will become available in future smart phones.

Q:Apollo 11, carrying Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin and Michael Collins, was launched on 16 July, 1969. Five days later they stepped down onto the moon. Neil Armstrong On the way there: Of all the wonderful views we had, the most impressive to me was on the way to the Moon when we flew through its shadow. We were still thousands of miles away, but close enough so that the Moon almost filled our window. The moon appeared blue-grey. It seemed almost as if it were showing us its roundness, its similarity in shape to our Earth, in a sort of welcome. I was sure it would be a hospitable  host. It had been waiting for its first visitors for a long time. After touch down: The sky is black, you know. It's a very dark sky, but it still seemed more like daylight than darkness as we looked out the window. It's a very strange thing but the surface looked very warm and inviting. It seemed to be tan . It's hard to explain that, because later when I held the material in my hand, it wasn't tan at all. It was black, grey and so on.

Fact is, I down right hate it. I tried to watch it as open minded as possible, but when it gets down to it, it feels rather insulting to my social group. To me, there are several reasons why. 1. The characters seem unnatural. I've met lots of players, of all different walks of life. I don't know any who act like any of the characters in the film. It's like the producers of the film have taken the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them all into 5 people. Most gamers are rather social people, some with rather active lives. 2. The style doesn't work. The mockumentary style is ill suited to the subject matter of the film. An actual documentary on gamers would actually work better. While it is good looking (I.E. cleanly put together), it isn't very good. 3. The dialogue feels forced, unnatural. It also seems to lack any real world context. Gamers swear, I'll admit that, but we don't have Tourette's Syndrome. 4. The humor is lacking. While self-deprecating humor is a mainstay of my group and several other groups I've encountered, this is less self-deprecation, and more like toilet humor. Likewise, a large part of gamer humor is full of in-jokes and anecdotes, not toilet humor. Most gamers would balk at and shun anybody who made such jokes. 5. The biggest problem to me is basically this: Accuracy. I don't mean rules, but instead dynamics. Invariably, this film is going to be compared to the even lower budget films The Gamers and The Gamers: Dorkness Rising, both of which portray the players as actual people playing an actual game. The difference is, Gamers: The Movie presents a situation where you want to beat the players senseless vs. The Gamers, where you can say something like: \\"Huh, I know a guy like that...

Answer the following question: what kind of economy does vietnam have today?","output":"Vietnam today has a mixed economy, characterized by a combination of market, socialist, and traditional economic elements. It is a rapidly developing, lower-middle-income country in Southeast Asia with a growing influence in the region. Vietnam has undergone a significant transformation after the implementation of economic and political reforms under \\"Doi Moi\\" (Renovation) in 1986. These reforms aimed to bring about a transition from a centrally planned, Soviet-style economy to a more market-oriented, socialist-oriented economy. The results have been impressive, as Vietnam has become one of the fastest-growing economies in the world over the last three decades. 1. Market Economy: The market economy component of Vietnam's mixed economy is comprised of private ownership, free market mechanisms, and competition. With the relaxation of restrictions on private businesses, the private sector has grown substantially, contributing significantly to the country's economic growth. Vietnam's commitment to integrating with the global economy has led to substantial foreign investment, propelling the country's export-oriented industries, particularly in electronics, textiles, and footwear. 2. State-run Economy: The state-run or socialist component of Vietnam's economy is driven by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which continue to play a vital role in sectors like infrastructure, banking, and transportation. Despite their importance, the government has gradually been reducing their market share in recent years, promoting privatization and attracting private investment. This process is known as \\"equitization,\\" where the state relinquishes a portion of its ownership, allowing private and foreign investors to buy shares in SOEs. 3. Traditional Economy: The traditional economy in Vietnam primarily relates to the agriculture and rural sectors. A large portion of the population still depends on traditional methods of agricultural production, particularly in remote rural areas. Although the agriculture sector's share of GDP has decreased over the years, it remains a vital part of Vietnam's economy as a source of employment and food security. Vietnam's economic structure has shown a shift from agricultural to industrial and service sectors. Manufacturing, specifically light industry and high-tech manufacturing, has driven much of this shift, becoming the primary growth engine of the economy. This industrialization has led to rapid urbanization, with a significant portion of the population migrating from rural areas to cities, seeking better opportunities. The service sector, including tourism, finance, telecommunications, and retail, has also expanded remarkably, benefiting from a rapidly growing middle class, increased internet penetration, and a more stable and business-friendly environment. The government's pursuit of economic liberalization continues, as illustrated by its involvement in numerous free trade agreements (FTAs), such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the European Union–Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA). These FTAs provide Vietnam access to a vast array of markets, allowing the country to diversify its export destinations and reduce its reliance on any single market. In conclusion, Vietnam's economy today is a dynamic mix of market, socialist, and traditional elements. The country has made considerable strides towards market-oriented reforms, integrating itself into the global trade system, and attracting foreign investment. While challenges persist, such as reducing the roles of SOEs, addressing income inequality, and improving infrastructure, Vietnam's continued commitment to development is expected to help maintain its remarkable growth trajectory in the coming years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A series of murders of rich young women throughout the area of Globe, Arizona bear the distinctive signature of a serial killer. Clues lead Detective Charles Mendoza to visit Paul White, a sound expert installing hi-fi systems in wealthy people's homes. His special talent is to make a noise which echoes through the air cavities in his head and shows him where the sound of the speakers should come from and echo in the room. He is married to Joan, whom, ten years earlier, he had seduced away from Mike DeSantos, who was her then boyfriend. Joan and Paul have a daughter, Danielle, together. Paul, installing equipment at Dr. Sutter's home, proximal to the most-recent murder, is approached by Detective Mendoza-- they have a cordial conversation about sound equipment, but it turns abruptly, when Mendoza asks Paul if he still hunts. Mendoza questions Paul about whether he knew the victim, and then asks him about the tires on his van-- a tread pattern that has been located at the scene of the murder.

I know it's a lot for a t-shirt, but I had to have it!!! Answer:","output":"The given review would most likely increase the chances of me buying the product for several reasons. However, it is essential to take a closer look at the different aspects of the review to better understand how it influences the decision-making process. 1. Positive sentiment: The overall sentiment of the review is positive, which often has a direct impact on potential buyers. The reviewer mentions that they love the shirt, which implies that they are satisfied with the quality and appearance of the product. Positive reviews generally create a sense of trust and reassurance, making it more likely for potential customers to consider buying the product. 2. Shipping/transaction satisfaction: The reviewer explicitly mentions that the transaction (\\"trans.\\") was great. This statement could refer to a smooth payment process, quick shipping, or both. Regardless, it suggests that the customer received the product promptly and without any issues. Potential buyers will appreciate a hassle-free shopping experience and may feel more inclined to purchase the product knowing others had a positive experience. 3. Exclusivity: The reviewer acknowledges that the price of the t-shirt is high but goes on to say that they \\"had to have it.\\" This statement suggests that there is something unique or exclusive about the product, either in design, quality, or both, that makes it worth the higher price. For potential buyers who value exclusivity and are willing to spend more for a product they believe stands out, this review may persuade them to consider purchasing the item. 4. Direct experience: Lastly, the review is based on the writer's direct experience with the product. A first-hand account can help potential buyers better understand what they might experience if they decide to buy the product. By sharing their satisfaction and reasons for the purchase, the reviewer helps build a sense of reliability and credibility. However, it is crucial to bear in mind that a single review may not present the complete picture of a product's quality and overall satisfaction. Prospective buyers should read multiple reviews to obtain a more comprehensive understanding and consider other factors, such as product specifications, brand reputation, and personal preferences, before making a final purchasing decision. In conclusion, this particular review would likely increase the chances of buying the product due to its positive sentiment, the reviewer's satisfaction with the transaction, the perceived exclusivity, and the direct experience shared. Nonetheless, it is essential to take into account a variety of factors, including other reviews, when evaluating a product to make the most informed and confident decision possible."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is likely true about the politics regarding gun rights in the US? Options: - not enough information - Many individuals have varying opinions regarding what should be done about the shootings in the US. - It is heavily divided and contended among citizens and politicians. - Most of the citizens that own guns feel threatened about the notion of new laws calling for gun control. A:","output":"It is accurate to say that the politics regarding gun rights in the US are heavily divided and contended among citizens and politicians. This is evident from the context provided, where initiatives such as Wear Orange face opposition from gun rights advocates and the National Rifle Association, demonstrating the contentious nature of the issue. The spectrum of opinions varies, with some focusing on the importance of the Second Amendment and the rights of individuals to own guns, while others advocate for gun control measures to address ongoing gun violence and tragic shootings. Furthermore, the issue of background checks and private sales, as well as the challenges in ensuring that certain categories of individuals do not obtain weapons, further contributes to the ongoing debate and division surrounding gun rights and gun control in the United States."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time.  - Bavaria  is a federal state of Germany.

(October 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Detective Max Payne (Mark Wahlberg) is a three-year veteran in the Cold Case Unit of the New York City Police Department (NYPD). He is consumed with investigating and finding the murderer of his wife Michelle and their infant child Rose. Max's snitch, Trevor, supplies information that leads Max to three drug addicts in an empty train station. They attempt to rob Max in a bathroom; instead, Max interrogates one of them about his familyâs murder, with no results. While one of the drug addicts runs away he is attacked by shadowy, winged man-creatures and is hit by a train. At Trevor's apartment, Max meets Natasha Sax (Olga Kurylenko), who gets into an argument with her sister, Mona (Mila Kunis).

Answer:","output":"The missing first step in the process you've described is: 1. Water seeps into the cracks and crevices of rocks. To provide a detailed overview, here's the complete process, known as freeze-thaw weathering or frost wedging: 1. Water seeps into the cracks and crevices of rocks: This occurs naturally when it rains or when water from other sources, such as melting snow or ice, comes into contact with the rocks. 2. The water freezes into ice: When the temperature drops below freezing, the water inside the rock cracks turns into ice. Since ice has a larger volume than water, this causes it to expand. 3. The cracks expand: As the ice expands within the rock cracks, it exerts pressure on the surrounding rock material. This causes the cracks to widen and deepen. 4. Over time, the rocks split: The freeze-thaw cycles of ice expansion and contraction within the rock cracks continue over time, leading the rock to split and break apart. 5. The rocks are now in smaller pieces: As a result of the freeze-thaw process, the rock has been weathered into smaller, more manageable pieces. These smaller rocks can be further weathered by other processes or transported away by natural forces such as wind, water, or gravity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Milwaukee police said Thursday, April 16, 2015 that Chiles, suspected of fatally shooting two people... (Associated Press)      The van hit the toddler, and the driver jumped out to check on the badly injured boy, setting into motion a chain of events that included an uncle fatally shooting his own nephew and a stranger and then taking his own life. In the end, four people were dead.      It all started Sunday as Archie Brown Jr. drove his van through the northwest side of Milwaukee on an errand to Home Depot.      Brown hit Damani and leaped from the vehicle to attend to the toddler. Damani's 15-year-old brother, who had been celebrating a birthday in a nearby house, ran to his brother after witnessing the accident.      At that point, police said, the boys' uncle, Ricky Chiles, took the law into his own hands, emerging from a home into the street with a gun. He fired at the 40-year-old Brown, striking him and hitting Chiles' teenage nephew, who witnesses said was attempting to help when he was shot.      Brown died at the scene, alongside Damani. The teenager, Rasheed Chiles, died at a hospital.      \\"This sad example is what we get when we have folks who decide it's their responsibility to use their guns to redress their grievances,\\" Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said Thursday at a news conference.      Mayor Tom Barrett earlier in the week called Brown's shooting an \\"assassination.\\"      \\"Someone got angry,\\" Barrett said. \\"Someone took a gun and basically assassinated this gentleman.\\"      On Thursday, Ricky Chiles III shot himself as police and federal marshals closed in on him at a motel in the Chicago suburb of Lyons, where he was staying with his girlfriend.      \\"I'm glad it's over, but I think he took a ... cheap way or a cowardly way out,\\" Brown's father, Archie Brown Sr. of Milwaukee, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Thursday.      \\"He was afraid of man's justice, but he decided to go and meet God's justice,\\" Brown said.      Brown, a 68-year-old minister who goes by the name Prophet Brown, said he forgives Chiles for what he did, \\"but I'm not saying it's an easy process.\\"      The shootings are part of a spike in violence in Milwaukee in 2015. The city has counted 43 homicide victims so far this year, compared with 14 at the same point last year.      \\"There just seems to be a sensibility among a segment of the community that committing acts of violence in support of one's reputation, to get revenge for a perceived slight or for a perceived business dispute over illegal drugs or to exact revenge is somehow approved,\\" Flynn said. \\"And in that set of circumstances there's going to be not only tragedies, there's going to be dreadful mistakes.\\"      Barbara Sprewer, who lives next door, said she saw Damani looking around before crossing the street, apparently intending to join the girls in the park. She saw the van and estimated it was going 25 to 30 mph.      \\"Nobody was watching the baby,\\" she said.      After the child was hit, she saw the driver get out. She said she heard shots, but did not see who fired.      \\"I feel helpless. I feel numb,\\" she said. \\"I saw them alive, and I saw them deceased. I've been reliving this since I woke up.\\"      ___      Associated Press Writer Jeff Baenen contributed to this report from Minneapolis. ||||| Randall Terry talks about his 2-year-old son, Damani, on Thursday. The toddler was struck and killed by a van driven by Archie Brown Jr. on Sunday. Brown and 15-year-old Rasheed Chiles, Damani’s brother, were then shot and killed by Ricky Ricardo Chiles III. Credit: Mark Hoffman      By      On Sunday morning, Randall Terry dressed his 2-year-old son, Damani, for a birthday party and dropped off the boy with his mother's family.      On Thursday morning, Terry clutched a tiny suit for Damani to wear in his casket.      \\"He was a loving child,\\" Terry said of his son, who darted into the street and was struck by a van during his cousin's birthday cookout. \\"Very energetic. Just fun to be around.\\"      The accident that resulted in Damani's death spiraled into greater tragedy for two Milwaukee families.      Police say the van driver, Archie Brown Jr., 40, was standing over the child's body, grieving and upset, when Damani's uncle, Ricky Ricardo Chiles III, shot him with a gun retrieved from a nearby home.      In the gunfire, 15-year-old Rasheed Chiles — Damani's brother and Ricky Chiles' nephew — was shot. He died later that evening.      And on Thursday morning, with police entering the room of a Chicago-area motel where he was hiding, Ricky Chiles, 27, killed himself.      As their grandmother searched for an extra-wide casket so Damani and Rasheed could be buried together, Terry, 30, did his best to block thoughts of Sunday's events from his mind.      \\"It was a terrible day. A terrible day,\\" he said, eyes downcast.      After he dropped off Damani at the party, Terry took the toddler's half-siblings, a boy and a girl, both 12, to the movies. The 5 p.m. showing of \\"Furious 7\\" was still in previews when his phone vibrated.      Terry went into the lobby, where he learned his baby was dead and some others had been shot. He's still not sure how he stayed calm enough to drive safely to the scene. He parked as close as he could, leaving the two 12-year-olds in the car.      The block was cordoned off with yellow tape.      \\"I pretty much ran through,\\" Terry said. \\"An officer tackled me 20 feet from my son. He said I didn't want to see him that way. I just broke down.\\"      A police officer brought Terry a chair and sat with him for hours, in sight of his son's body, which was covered with a pink blanket.      \\"I sat there in the rain. I couldn't leave my baby alone,\\" Terry said.      He stayed there, with officers comforting him, until a detective called around 9 p.m. and told him to come to Children's Hospital. There, Damani and Rasheed's mother, Rikeesha Tidwell, had just been informed that her older son did not survive surgery.      With that, she had lost three sons — the two who died Sunday joined another who died at birth about six years ago.      Terry comforted Tidwell, whose own mother had been taken to a different hospital after she passed out.      'We're all grieving'      In the days that followed, Terry said, their family became the subject of hatred and threats on social media. People they didn't know cursed their son, blaming the 2-year-old for setting off the chain of events that traumatized the community by running into the street. Online commenters called for Tidwell's arrest, saying she should be thrown in prison for not supervising her child closely enough.      The couple ignored the hateful comments and had planned to join Brown's family at a vigil Wednesday evening — the day one of Damani's sisters turned 6. But a pastor phoned Terry and told them not to come, fearing for their safety in light of the online harassment.      Terry says he still hopes the two families can come together.      \\"We're all grieving,\\" he said. \\"All this negativity going back and forth isn't going to help anything.\\"      As news broke of Chiles' suicide, Terry said he had no insight into the man's character or what may have caused him to react to the accident the way he did.      As Terry headed to the funeral home with the tiny suit, he did what he could to remember two boys who will never grow up. Damani, who would strip naked and run through his grandmother's kitchen in search of cookies and Kool-Aid. And Rasheed, who could fix any computer and loved the emojis on his iPhone.      \\"They were both loving kids,\\" Terry said. \\"They had a lot of potential that was just cut down too early. Way too early.\\"      Ashley Luthern of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report.

Given the question: I have a new situation: John wanted to revisit Aristotle's theory of tetrapods. To that end, he chose two tetrapods, tetA and tetB. An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. Moreover, a tetA had longer gestation period than tetB. He needed to figure out how their characteristics fit Aristotle's theory.  But I can use this background: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.  What is an answer for this question: Which tetrapod would live longer, tetA or tetB? The answer is:","output":"Based on the given background information and Aristotle's predictions, we can infer the following: 1. Brood size decreases with adult body mass. 2. Lifespan increases with gestation period and body mass. 3. Fecundity decreases with lifespan. Now, let's analyze the information about tetA and tetB: 1. An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. 2. A tetA had a longer gestation period than tetB. Applying the given rules to tetA and tetB: 1. Since tetA has a higher body mass than tetB, it will have a smaller brood size. 2. TetA has a longer gestation period than tetB. Using these observations, we can conclude that, according to Aristotle's predictions: Lifespan is positively correlated with both gestation period and body mass. Since tetA has a longer gestation period and higher body mass than tetB, it is likely that tetA would live longer than tetB. Therefore, the answer is tetA."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Information:  - Beatrice Hastings was the pen name of Emily Alice Haigh ( 27 January 1879 -- 30 October 1943 ) an English writer , poet and literary critic . Much of her work was published in The New Age under a variety of pseudonyms , and she lived with the editor , A. R. Orage , for a time before the outbreak of the First World War . Bisexual , she was a friend and lover of Katherine Mansfield , whose work was first published in The New Age . Another of her lovers was Wyndham Lewis . Born in London and raised in South Africa , just before the war , she moved to Paris and became a figure in bohemian circles due to her friendship with Max Jacob . She shared an apartment in Montparnasse with Amedeo Modigliani and posed for him as well . Another friend was adventure novelist Charles Beadle , with whom she had several things in common . He grew up in Hackney , spent time in South Africa ( participating in the Boer War as a member of the British South African Police ) , and published several novels about bohemian life in Paris . When Beadle came to America , from Paris , in November 1916 , he listed Hastings as his nearest friend in Paris . Towards the end of her life she felt excluded from the literary recognition she felt her due , and blamed Orage , whom she accused of conspiring to keep her out of literary circles in Britain , and she published a pamphlet , The Old New Age , bitterly criticising him in 1936 . In 1943 , probably suffering from cancer , she killed herself with gas from a domestic cooker .  - Philip Mairet (full name: Philippe Auguste Mairet; 18861975) was a designer, writer and journalist. He had a wide range of interest: crafts, Alfred Adler and psychiatry, and Social Credit. He was also a translator of major figures including Sartre. He wrote biographies of Sir Patrick Geddes and A. R. Orage, with both of whom he was closely associated.  - The New Age was a British literary magazine, noted for its wide influence under the editorship of A. R. Orage from 1907 to 1922. It began life in 1894 as a publication of the Christian Socialist movement; but in 1907 as a radical weekly edited by Joseph Clayton, it was struggling. In May of that year, Alfred Orage and Holbrook Jackson, who had been running the Leeds Arts Club, took over the journal with financial help from George Bernard Shaw. Jackson acted as co-editor only for the first year, after which Orage edited it alone until he sold it in 1922. By that time his interests had moved towards mysticism, and the quality and circulation of the journal had declined. According to a Brown University press release, \\"\\"The New Age\\" helped to shape modernism in literature and the arts from 1907 to 1922\\". It ceased publication in 1938. Orage was also associated with \\"The New English Weekly\\" (193249) as editor during its first two years of operation (Philip Mairet took over at his death in 1934).  - Kathleen Mansfield Murry (nee Beauchamp; 14 October 1888  9 January 1923) was a prominent New Zealand modernist short story writer who was born and brought up in colonial New Zealand and wrote under the pen name of Katherine Mansfield. At 19, Mansfield left New Zealand and settled in the United Kingdom, where she became a friend of modernist writers such as D.H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf. In 1917 she was diagnosed with extrapulmonary tuberculosis, which led to her death at the age of 34.  - George Holbrook Jackson (31 December 1874  16 June 1948) was a British journalist, writer and publisher. He was recognised as one of the leading bibliophiles of his time.  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Adeline Virginia Woolf (née Stephen; 25 January 1882  28 March 1941) was an English writer and one of the foremost modernists of the twentieth century.  - Tarr is a modernist novel by Wyndham Lewis, written in 190911, revised and expanded in 191415 and first serialized in the magazine \\"The Egoist\\" from April 1916 until November 1917. The American version was published in 1918, with an English edition published by the Egoist Press appearing shortly afterwards; Lewis later created a revised and final version published by Chatto and Windus in 1928. Set in the bohemian milieu of pre-war Paris, it presents two artists, the Englishman Tarr and the German Kreisler, and their struggles with money, women, and social situations. The novel abounds in somewhat Nietzschean themes. Tarr, generally thought to be modelled on Lewis himself, displays disdain for the 'bourgeois-bohemians' around him, and vows to 'throw off humour' which he regardsespecially in its English formas a 'means of evading reality' unsuited to ambition and the modern world. This self-conscious attitude and the situations that it brings about are, ironically, a major source of the novel's pervasive dark humour. Kreisler, a violent German Romantic of protean energy and a failure as an artist, is in many ways the focus of the novel. An indication of the extremity of his vivid portrait is Lewis's own wondering several years later if he had, in Kreisler, anticipated the personality of Hitler.  - The Leeds Arts Club was founded in 1903 by the Leeds school teacher Alfred Orage and Yorkshire textile manufacture Holbrook Jackson, and was probably one of the most advanced centres for modernist thinking in Britain in the pre-First World War period.   - Percy Wyndham Lewis (18 November 1882  7 March 1957) was an English painter and critic (he dropped the name 'Percy', which he disliked). He was a co-founder of the Vorticist movement in art, and edited the literary magazine of the Vorticists, \\"BLAST\\". His novels include his pre-World War I-era novel \\"Tarr\\" (set in Paris), and \\"The Human Age\\", a trilogy comprising \\"The Childermass\\" (1928), \\"Monstre Gai\\" and \\"Malign Fiesta\\" (both 1955), set in the afterworld. A fourth volume of \\"The Human Age\\", \\"The Trial of Man,\\" was begun by Lewis but left in a fragmentary state at the time of his death. He also wrote two autobiographical volumes, \\"Blasting and Bombardiering\\" (1937) and \\"Rude Assignment: A Narrative of my Career Up-to-Date\\" (1950).

Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","output":"Based on the preceding movie review, it can be inferred that the movie received mixed reactions from the reviewer. It appears that the film had both positive and negative aspects that affected the overall impression of it. Let's analyze the given sentence in detail to better understand the reviewer's standpoint. The review starts with \\"initially gripping.\\" This phrase suggests that the movie's beginning managed to capture the attention of the reviewer. In cinematic terms, \\"gripping\\" typically denotes a compelling plot or a captivating setup that engages the audience from the outset. In this case, the reviewer appeared to appreciate the film's opening and found it to be engaging, indicating a positive aspect of the movie. However, the review then proceeds with the words \\"eventually cloying.\\" This phrase tells us that the movie, after some time, becomes too much or too excessive, leading to a sense of weariness or dissatisfaction on the part of the reviewer. In this context, \\"cloying\\" often refers to either an overly sentimental or overly dramatic portrayal of events, characters, or themes in a story. As a result, the reviewer seems to find the movie tiresome and overwhelming, ultimately leaving them with a negative impression. Finally, the review mentions \\"pow drama,\\" indicating that the setting of the movie might be a prisoner-of-war context. This information provides us with the movie's genre and theme, without explicitly implying a positive or negative judgment. However, considering the phrasing used earlier, it is safe to assume that the \\"pow drama\\" might have been presented in a way that started out as engaging but turned out to be cloying in the long run. In conclusion, the movie review indicates mixed reactions from the reviewer. While the film did have some initial captivating elements, the eventual excessive dramatic or sentimental portrayal negatively affected the reviewer's overall experience. We cannot say that the movie was seen entirely positively or negatively; rather, it contains a blend of both positive and negative components that might have come together to create a less-than-satisfactory outcome for the viewer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While it is true that there are many unicellular organisms that are also eukaryotic, such as certain types of algae, fungi, and protozoa, the question asks about the number of eukaryotic cells within an animal. Animals predominantly consist of multicellular organisms, meaning they have more than one eukaryotic cell. The number of cells in an animal can range from thousands in small invertebrates, like the microscopic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, to trillions in larger, more complex animals like humans.

Bernie Sanders's latest campaign ad shows just how differently he and Hillary Clinton see political change happening.      Federal jobs for felons: Why 'ban the box' could soon be a thing of the past      Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont (center) is joined by his wife, Jane (right), and grandchildren, Dylan, 4, and Ella, 7, onstage after speaking at a town hall meeting at the Orpheum Theater in Sioux City, Iowa, Jan. 19, 2016.      Bernie Sanders has just released a sweeping, lump-in-your-throat campaign ad that he hopes will push him over the top to victory in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. Whether that happens remains to be seen, of course. But one thing about the new spot seems certain: It shows how Senator Sanders and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton have fundamentally different visions of the nature of the American political system.      More specifically, it shows where Sanders and Mrs. Clinton disagree about how political change happens, and the president’s role in that process.      OK, that’s a lot to hang on a one-minute video that features virtually no words, so let’s back up and start from the beginning. The Sanders spot is a closer. In other words, it’s the sort of political ad that campaigns issue when voting is only a short time away. It’s meant to solidify inchoate feelings into a positive candidate image, pushing supporters to the polls.      Music is maybe the spot's most distinctive feature. It is set to the unmistakable strains of the Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel song “America,” from the opening lyric, “Let us be lovers/We’ll marry our fortunes together.”      Distinctly American scenes – small towns, tugboats, skylines, and farms – flash by, changing with each beat of the song.      Then scenes of Sanders rallies begin appearing. Suddenly, it cuts to a flashing montage of people who have sent their photo to the Sanders campaign as a sign of support. Hundreds of them.      “Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike/They’ve all come to look for America,” goes the song.      Then it’s all Bernie, with footage from his raucous rallies over the “All come to look for America” chorus.      Message: It’s all about the people, the people who will power the political revolution, the political revolution that will result in free college and Medicare for all in America. Among other things.      As other pundits have noted, Sanders is positioning himself as this election cycle’s Barack Obama, someone who’s promising inspiration and hope and change, without talking a lot about that change’s viability.      “Bernie Sanders is increasingly sounding an optimistic, inspirational message that promises a bright, progressive future that can, and will, be secured through mobilizing the masses, particularly younger voters, a vision that Clinton surely sees (just as she saw Barack Obama’s vision) as vague, airy, and naive,” writes left-leaning Greg Sargent Thursday in his \\"Plum Line\\" blog at The Washington Post.      Comparing Sanders’s “America” ad to Clinton’s latest spot is instructive in this context. “Airy” is not a word you’d use to describe the latter. It’s called “This House,” and it’s mostly about the burdens and responsibilities of the person who calls 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue home.      “The person who lives here has to solve problems as big as the world,” it begins. Then it cuts to a shot of Navy fighter aircraft launching from a carrier.      The ad wants to make sure you know that Clinton believes she is up to this job. It’s more traditional, in the sense that it ticks through her biography, reminding viewers that she’s been first lady, a senator, and secretary of State. (Has anyone forgotten this?)      It mentions existing programs, such as Medicare, and says Clinton will prevent them from being “privatized.” It’s not about mobilizing the power of the people; it’s about day-by-day political trench warfare as it is actually lived in D.C.      “She’ll stop the Republicans from ripping all of our progress away,” it concludes.      That’s the choice. Sanders is pushing inspiration, and what he terms a political revolution that would eventually produce a swerve in the political direction of the country. Clinton is talking in more practical terms, about how she’s already prepared to do the job of president as she sees it. ||||| The new television ad that was released by Sen.

The spot has drawn strong reviews from ad makers, but also was the source of a fracas between the Sanders campaign and one of Hillary Clinton’s most prominent supporters.      Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Sanders, said that the music was properly licensed. A representative for Garfunkel said that singer gave his approval, while a rep for Simon, who also wrote the song, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.      The one-minute ad features scenes from Sanders’ campaign rallies, along with images of everyday Americans at work in offices and on farms. The skyline of Des Moines is shown in one glimpse.      The campaign introduced the spot in a press release early on Thursday. “‘They’ve all come to look for America,’ sing Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel in their classic folk rock anthem as faces flash on the screen of people backing Bernie’s insurgent campaign for president.      Related Hillary Clinton Attends Opening of Broadway's 'Network' Hillary Clinton: Kavanaugh's Claim of Revenge 'Deserves a Lot of Laughter'      “In Iowa alone, Sanders has spoken to more than 40,000 people at rallies and town halls since his campaign began last spring.”      The spot will run in Iowa and New Hampshire beginning on Friday.      The ad already has stirred up tensions between Sanders supporters and backers of Clinton’s.      David Brock, who founded the pro-Clinton PAC Correct the Record, told the Associated Press that the spot was a “slight” to the Democratic base, suggesting that it features too few people of color.      “From this ad it seems black lives don’t matter much to Bernie Sanders,” Brock was quoted as saying.      That drew a rebuke from the Sanders campaign, which issued a statement calling Brock a “mudslinger.”      Briggs said that Sanders “doesn’t need lectures on civil rights and racial issues from David Brock, the head of a Hillary Clinton super PAC. Twenty-five years ago it was Brock – a mud-slinging, right-wing extremist – who tried to destroy Anita Hill, a distinguished African-American law professor. He later was forced to apologize for his lies about her. Today, he is lying about Sen. Sanders. It’s bad enough that Hillary Clinton is raising millions in special-interest money in her super PACS. It is worse that she would hire a mudslinger like David Brock. She should be ashamed of her association with Brock.”      Campaigns have been anxious to adopt classic American rock and folk songs at rallies and in ad spots. Republicans in particular have run into trouble from artists who claim that they did not give campaigns their approval to use their works, often with the worry that it would make it seem that they were giving their endorsement. Donald Trump, for instance, ran Neil Young’s “Rockin in the Free World” at his announcement speech in June. Young, however, said he never gave the campaign his approval and instead supports Sanders.      Supporters of Clinton and Sanders are planning a series of events in the next week before the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses.      On Monday, Chelsea Clinton is scheduled to visit Los Angeles for a series of fundraisers, including an event at the offices of Frank Gehry, with tickets starting at 250 per person.      On Tuesday, Sarah Silverman, Kevin Nealon, George Lopez and Paul Rodriguez are headlining a fundraiser at Jamie Masada’s Laugh Factory in Hollywood. Sanders will not be there, but each of the comics is expected to perform. ||||| The media is raving (“Perfect“; “Magnificent“)about the new ad by Democratic Party presidential candidate Bernie Sanders that features a song from a half-century ago by Sixties folk-rock icons Simon and Garfunkel called, “America.” The ad is reportedly targeted at voters in the first-in the-nation states of Iowa and New Hampshire.      The studiously crafted one minute ad has no voice over–just edits from ‘America’ over staged scenes and shots from Sanders campaign events.            The Simon and Garfunkel song is an ancient classic. Its use by Sanders is a revealing choice by the aging (74 years old) Sixties radical who is trying to appeal to voters who are focused on their future in the 21st Century.      More revealing is the choice of people featured and not featured in the one-minute ad.      There are no Americans in uniform featured in the Sanders ad; no military, no police and no firefighters. The war on terror and those serving on the frontlines including servicemen and women and first responders don’t matter in Bernie Sanders’ America. (Note: two police officers can be briefly glimpsed behind Sanders in one scene.)      The people in the Sanders ad, whether in tight staged shots or crowd shots, are overwhelmingly white with just a handful of token minorities featured in mostly tight shots.      The first twenty seconds of the ad features only white people. There are nine staged ‘day in the life’ scenes that open the ad–all featuring white men, women and children–including five scenes of white families. Then four campaign crowd scenes are shown with white people.      It is not until the eighteenth scene in the Sanders ad that the first minority is seen with a quick shot of a minority female campaign volunteer working a crowd.      It takes another twenty seconds for other minorities to be prominently seen in the Sanders ad. Then in a span of seven seconds five scenes with minorities are shown interspersed with a shot of Sanders walking in a parade with his white family: A lone Black person at a Sanders rope line surrounded by white people; Sanders hugging a Black woman; Sanders standing with a minority woman; a tight Sanders rally crowd scene featuring four minority men and women and finally a tight shot of a minority man holding his child.      The rest of the ad is crowd shots of Sanders rallies that are filled with white people, including the closing scene of a smiling Sanders on stage with a crowd of white people (with one minority) behind him.      The ad would fit right in the Sixties of Sanders’ radical youth when minorities were used as tokens by grandstanding white liberals.      Sanders has had a race problem from the beginning of his campaign that he has being trying to fix, as CNN reported in a July 3, 2015 report entitled, Bernie Sanders adds race, civil rights to his stump speech.      “Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator currently rising in polls against Hillary Clinton as they vie for the Democratic presidential nomination, responded to critics who say he hasn’t done enough to appeal to non-white voters during his raucous rally in Madison, Wisconsin, on Wednesday…”      One month later on August 8 in Seattle, Sanders infamously let Black Lives Matter activists charge the stage and take over his rally while he meekly stood by.      Oh and by the way: There are no Muslims in Bernie Sanders’ ‘America.’ ||||| Folk rock is at the front and center of Bernie Sanders’ latest television advertisement.      As warm scenes of spinning windmills, tugboats, parents and children, farmers and cows and tossed hay bales play across the screen, Simon & Garfunkel sing “America,” a popular song from their 1968 album Bookends. The mood of the ad, set to air in Iowa and New Hampshire, is hopeful: a Des Moines skyline, dancing at a campaign rally and plenty of shots of a grinning Mr. Sanders, the Democratic presidential candidate.      “They’ve all come to look for America,” the folk rock duo sings as the sign-waving masses cheer for Mr. Sanders, a Vermont senator electrifying liberals across the country.      The irony, though, is that “America” is probably not the song Mr. Sanders’ operatives think it is. Like Ronald Reagan, the Republican president who mistook Bruce Springsteen’s “Born in the U.S.A” for a cheerful patriotic anthem when it was really an indictment of the Vietnam War, the ambience of this spot doesn’t match the meaning of the lyrics in full.      Mr. Sanders, who has an interest in folk music, may know this himself. The crescendo of “America” is not about crowds of ecstatic people coming together in the name of American glory and community. Written by Paul Simon, who like Mr. Sanders is a 74-year-old native New Yorker, the protest song is at best bittersweet, describing the journey of a man leaving Saginaw, Mich. to find his fortunes elsewhere.      The Sanders camp was probably smart to omit the second to last verse of “America” from the ad. In the verse, the true meaning of the song emerges, that of an illusory nation failing to deliver on its lofty promise.      “So I looked at the scenery, she read her magazine; and the moon rose over an open field,” the duo sings. ” ‘Kathy, I’m lost,’ I said, though I know she was sleeping. ‘I’m empty and aching and I don’t know why.’ ”      The song climaxes with the verse most prominently featured in the ad: “Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike, they’ve all come to look for America.” But the listener is not left with the sense of hope fulfilled in the new America. Rather, the image lingers of the young couple riding a bus toward an uncertain destination, anxious and disillusioned. The traffic streams by on a loveless turnpike. They are still looking for America.      Of course, “America” may be a fitting song for Mr. Sanders. On the stump, the self-professed democratic socialist has perfected a fire-and-brimstone delivery that uplifts as much as it depresses, describing a country succumbing to environmental degradation and the greed of oligarchs. The Democratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton, is not so dire, and she has been attacked by Mr. Sanders for being in bed with the wealthy interests causing so much destruction.      Maybe the choice of song isn’t so ironic after all. ||||| Often, the worst part of political ads is having to listen to them. Between the ominous muckraking about an opponent's past and the stilted rhetoric of sound bites from the stump, it quickly becomes an auditory annoyance throughout election season.      So regardless of your politics, you have to admire Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders' choice to forego any audio in his new campaign ad except for the rising swell of Simon & Garfunkel's 1968 single \\"America.\\"      Of course, it's a decision that carries its own risks. Sanders' populist politics are already a bit of a throwback to the 1960s and '70s, and some might see the song as indicative of his campaign lacking a certain modernism. And obviously he could be using this ad time to share policy stances that separate him from his primary opponent, Hillary Clinton.      But on the other hand, it shows yet again that he's not fettered by politics as usual—and that his campaign's Spotify playlist is probably sweet as hell. ||||| Published on Jan 21, 2016      \\"They’ve all come to look for America...\\"                  ---------      ★ Join the political revolution at www.berniesanders.com            ★ Connect with Bernie:      Facebook → https://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/      Twitter → https://twitter.com/berniesanders      Instagram → https://www.instagram.com/berniesanders/      Tumblr → http://berniesanders.tumblr.com/      Snapchat → bernie.sanders            ★ About Bernie:      Bernie Sanders is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States. He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont’s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.            Bernard “Bernie” Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.            After graduation, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes, shocking the city’s political establishment by defeating a six-term, local machine mayor. In 1983, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women’s rights, youth programs and the arts. In 1990, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street, the Patriot Act, and the invasion of Iraq.            In 2006, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a “practical and successful legislator,” Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.            Known for his consistency on the issues, Senator Sanders has supported the working class, women, communities of color, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment, unions, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.

The Sanders camp has suggested they may have one more ad to unveil before voters in the two states kick off the presidential nominating contests, but with 11 days to go until the Iowa Caucus and 19 days to go until the New Hampshire primary, the commercial serves as something of a nontraditional closing statement in the two states for Bernie. Its simplicity stands in stark contrast to the more detailed and traditional spot Hillary Clinton is currently running in the two early voting states.      It’s pretty great! As an Iowa resident, I’ve been forced to watch an untold number of political ads over the past several months, and this one represents a welcome break from the usual campaign promises and stale warnings that usually interrupt my evenings on the couch.

Instead of focusing on policy stances and contrasting with opponents, the ad features vignettes of everyday American life and Sanders campaign events set to the 1968 single. The ad aims to evoke a sense of hope and unity among Sanders supporters and will run in Iowa and New Hampshire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

No. Though these two questions might seem similar since both involve crosswind landings, they are not the same. The question, \\"How do pilots make crosswind landings?\\" is a broad query seeking explanation on the technique used by pilots when landing in conditions where the wind is crossing the runway instead of blowing straight down it. This involves controlled drift, crabbing techniques, and other details of flight control that allow for safe touchdown in wind conditions that are not ideal. On the other hand, the question \\"How do pilots make crosswind landing at poor visibility?\\" adds an extra layer of complication to the issue - the element of low visibility. Poor visibility can occur due to a number of factors like fog, heavy rain, snow or darkness. Pilots landing in poor visibility rely not only on their crosswind landing techniques but also on various instruments and systems designed to aid in low visibility conditions. These systems- known as Instrument Landing Systems (ILS) or Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS), among others- give the pilot accurate information about the airplane's altitude, speed, direction, and position relative to the runway. These systems, along with standard crosswind landing techniques, are necessary for safe landing in poor visibility conditions. In conclusion, while both questions deal with the skills and techniques employed by pilots during challenging conditions, they involve different sets of techniques and strategies. Therefore, these two questions are not the same."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Please briefly summarize this news article: British-Algerian journalist dies after hunger strike A British-Algerian journalist has died after staging a hunger strike in protest against a two-year jail term for offending Algeria’s president in a poem posted online, according to his lawyer. “I can confirm the death of the journalist Mohamed Tamalt in Bab el-Oued hospital after a hunger strike of more than three months and a three-month coma,” Amine Sidhoum said on Facebook. The prison service said in a statement Tamalt had died of a lung infection for which he was receiving treatment since it was detected on 4 December. He had been in hospital since the end of August. Tamalt, a dual national, launched the hunger strike on the day of his arrest near his parents’ house in the capital Algiers on 27 June, according to Human Rights Watch. The 42-year-old blogger and freelance journalist, who ran a website from London where he lived, was charged with offending President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and defaming a public authority, in the poem he shared on Facebook. A court in Algiers sentenced him to two years in prison on 11 July and fined him 200,000 dinars (£1,400). An appeals court upheld the ruling a month later. Amnesty International urged Algerian authorities on Sunday to open an “independent and transparent investigation into the circumstances” of the journalist’s death. Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said it was shocked by Tamalt’s death which had dealt a blow to freedom of information in Algeria. “Why was there such a conviction just for words on Facebook which did no harm to anyone?” said Yasmine Kacha, head of the north Africa department of RSF. HRW had urged Algerian authorities to release him in August when he was reportedly in critical condition. “The Algerian authorities should quash the case against Tamalt and send the message that free speech will be respected in Algeria,” it said at the time. Summary:","output":"A journalist from Britain and Algeria has died after doing a hunger strike. He was upset because he was put in jail for two years for writing a poem that some people did not like. His name was Mohamed Tamalt, and he was 42 years old. He wrote a poem on the internet that made the President of Algeria angry. Some people are very upset about what happened to Mohamed and want to find out more about how he died. They believe people should be free to say what they think without being put in jail."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Wash all of the tools or parts to be treated for rust in a mixture of grease-cutting dish detergent and warm water to remove the oils and dirt. You can use a plastic container, pot, or tub, as long as it’s large enough to submerge the tools. Choose a container that you can set aside for one to three days. White vinegar is acidic, so it will cut through the rust, making it easier to remove. While the amount of white vinegar will vary depending on how many tools you are cleaning and how big they are, track how much you add to the container so that you can properly measure your salt. You should add roughly ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of salt for each quart (1 liter) of vinegar. The salt will increase the acidity of the vinegar so that the solution dissolves the rust quicker. Spread the salt evenly over the vinegar soak. The vinegar and salt need time to break down the rust so that it can be scrubbed from the tools. The longer you allow your tools to remain in the vinegar, the easier it will be to remove the rust.  Place the container in a secure location so that children and animals won’t get into it. For example, you could lock it in your garage or shed. Pull out any tools with hinges or moving parts occasionally to move them around. This helps work out the rust from the crevices. After you remove the tools from the vinegar solution, vigorously rub your tools to buff away the rust. Continue to scrub the tools until they are completely free of rust.  If the rust is thick, use a metal bristle brush.  Use a small, firm toothbrush in circular motions for hard to reach areas. Pour out the vinegar solution and wash out the tub. Fill the tub with enough clean water to match the amount of vinegar solution that you’d used. The baking soda will neutralize the acid from the vinegar so that it doesn’t remain on your tools. Use about ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of baking soda for each quart (1 liter) of water. Mix the baking soda into the water to create a solution. Make sure that your tools are submerged in the baking soda solution. Allow the tools to soak for ten minutes before removing them. Dry them well with a clean towel. Use 0000 steel wool to buff the tools and remove any remaining spots. Your tools should be free of rust. Apply denatured alcohol to a clean cloth and rub it onto the tools. The alcohol will help you make sure that no water remains on your tools. Water could cause more rust. Polish the tool with camellia oil to prevent more rust.","output":"The process of removing rust from tools involves several steps.

High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) above sea level.[5][6][7]  At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.[8]  Paragraph: There were Two villages Berg village situated at 3000 ft, at the base of the mountain, and Steep village, situated at 8500 feet. People visiting the area always stop in Berg village and feel great, but they feel bad and winded once they get to Steep village.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which village is situated closer to sea lever? The answer is:","output":"Berg village is situated closer to sea level. The given information states that Berg village is located at a height of 3000 feet above sea level, while Steep village is located substantially higher, at a height of 8500 feet above sea level. According to the typical definition, both these villages would be considered to be at high altitudes, as they are both over 2400 meters (8000 feet) above sea level. However, in this direct comparison, Berg village is considerably closer to sea level than Steep village.  It's interesting to note that people visiting the area feel great when they stop in Berg village, but feel bad and winded on reaching Steep village. This is probably due in part to the effects of high altitude, as the atmospheric pressure is lower at higher altitudes.  The reason for this is the two competing physical processes mentioned: gravity, which pulls the air as close as possible to the ground, and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other, resulting in expansion. Combined, these effects mean that the air becomes less dense as one ascends, and it becomes harder to take in the amount of oxygen one's body needs. This is why people often feel winded or short of breath at high altitudes.  In summary, both Berg village and Steep village are located above sea level at high altitudes, but of the two, Berg village is located closer to sea level. This is probably one of the reasons why people visiting these villages tend to feel better in Berg village compared to when they ascend to the higher altitude of Steep village."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: What name is given to the stage of a butterfly's life when it lives in a chrysalis?","output":"The stage of a butterfly's life when it lives in a chrysalis is called the \\"pupal stage\\". The pupal stage is a crucial stage in the metamorphosis of a butterfly, as it experiences a significant transformation during this period. The life cycle of a butterfly includes four primary stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult (butterfly). Each stage is marked by unique characteristics and developmental changes. 1. Egg stage: This is the initial stage of a butterfly's life cycle. Adult butterflies lay their eggs on the leaves of plants that caterpillars can use as a food source after hatching. The eggs are typically small, oval or spherical in shape, and may vary in color, depending on the butterfly species. 2. Larval stage (Caterpillar): The larval stage begins once the butterfly egg hatches, and a caterpillar emerges. The caterpillar's primary function is to eat and grow. Caterpillars have a voracious appetite and consume the leaves of the host plant, which allows them to grow rapidly and increase in size. During this stage, they molt multiple times to accommodate their expanding bodies. 3. Pupal stage (Chrysalis): After the caterpillar reaches a certain size and is ready for the next stage of development, it finds a safe and suitable spot to begin the pupal stage. The caterpillar spins a small silk pad, attaches itself to it, and sheds its last layer of skin to reveal the chrysalis. The term \\"chrysalis\\" usually refers to butterflies in the pupal stage, while \\"cocoon\\" is commonly used for moths. Within the chrysalis, a complex set of processes takes place as the caterpillar's tissues, organs, and body structures undergo a remarkable transformation, known as metamorphosis, to form the adult butterfly. 4. Adult stage (Butterfly): After the metamorphic processes have been completed, which may take days or even weeks, depending on the species, the adult butterfly is ready to emerge from the chrysalis. As the chrysalis splits open, the butterfly carefully unfolds its wings and allows them to dry and harden. Once the wings are strong and flexible, the butterfly takes its first flight, marking the completion of its metamorphic journey. In summary, the stage of a butterfly's life when it resides in a chrysalis is the pupal stage. This fundamental stage in the life cycle allows butterflies to transition from a caterpillar to an adult, ultimately resulting in the beautiful, winged creatures we admire. The metamorphic process that occurs within the chrysalis is vital for the survival and reproduction of butterflies, contributing to the diversity and continuation of butterfly species worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Before they can begin hunting, which the son does not want to do anyway, they are killed by flying jellyfish-like creatures, which penetrate their skin with needle-tipped tentacles. Some time later, four teenagers, Tom, Greg, Beth and Sandy, hike in the same area, ignoring the warnings of local truck stop owner Joe Taylor (Jack Palance). A group of Cub Scouts is also in the area; their leader (Larry Storch) is also killed by the alien creatures, while his troop runs into an unidentified humanoid and flee. The teenagers set up camp at a lake, but after a few hours, Tom and Beth disappear. Sandy and Greg go looking for them and discover their bodies in an abandoned shack. They drive away in their van, while being attacked by one of the starfish which tries to get through the car's windshield. After they get rid of it, they arrive at the truck stop. Greg tries to get help from the locals, but they do not believe him, except for Fred 'Sarge' Dobbs (Martin Landau), who is a mentally ill veteran. Meanwhile, Sandy encounters the humanoid and flees into the woods, where Joe Taylor finds and returns her to Greg. While they discuss the situation, the sheriff arrives, but Sarge shoots him and begins to become more paranoid. Greg and Sandy leave with Taylor, who reveals he has been attacked by the humanoid before and secretly keeps the flying jellyfish as trophies. They search for the shack and once there, Taylor goes inside to only find the bodies of Tom, Beth and the cub scout leader. They discuss waiting for the creature when Taylor is attacked by another \\"jellyfish\\". The young people run once again, leaving him behind as ordered. They stop a police car and get into the back seat, but find Sarge driving. He abducts them, believing them to be aliens.

Let's solve this equation step by step: First, let's look at the right side of the equation: we have -112*b, 12*b, and 24*b. We should add these together.  -112b + 12b + 24b = (-112 + 12 + 24) * b = (-76) * b.  So now our equation is:  106 * b = -76 * b + 3094 Next, we want to move all the b's to one side of the equation. Let's add 76 * b to both sides: 106 * b + 76 * b = -76 * b + 76 * b + 3094 This simplifies to: 182 * b = 3094 Now, we want to find the value of b by dividing both sides by 182: b = 3094 / 182 And when you do the division, you find that: b = 17 So, b is equal to 17.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?   (A). It's best to aerate your lawn just a month or two before your lawn's most active period of growth, so that the grass will grow back quickly and recover from the aeration process.  (B). It's best to aerate your lawn just before or during your lawn's most active period of growth, so that the grass will grow back quickly and recover from the aeration process.","output":"The best time to aerate your lawn depends on the type of grass and the specific climate in which you live. However, in general, it is most beneficial to aerate your lawn when the grass is actively growing. This allows the grass to recover quickly and take advantage of the improved soil conditions brought on by the aeration process.  Comparing solutions A and B, solution B is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning. Here is a detailed explanation: (A) Aeration one or two months before the lawn's most active growth period: While this solution might seem logical at first, aerating too early before the active growth period might not result in optimal benefits for your lawn. Since grass is not actively growing during this time, it may not be able to fully recover and make the most of the aeration process. Waiting for the growth period ensures that the grass has the necessary resources and energy to grow and take advantage of the additional air, water, and nutrients in the soil. (B) Aeration just before or during the lawn's most active period of growth: Aerating your lawn just before or during the most active growth period allows the grass to benefit from the improved soil conditions almost immediately. The additional air, water, and nutrients provided by aeration can be utilized by the actively growing grass, leading to a more vigorous and healthy lawn. This is especially crucial for heavily compacted or clay soils, as these conditions can be detrimental to root growth and overall grass health. In addition, actively growing grass will recover more quickly from the slight damage caused by the aeration process. The cores removed during aeration encourage the grass to produce new shoots and roots, filling in any empty spaces and contributing to a thicker, more resilient lawn. Taking into consideration both options, solution B provides the most sound reasoning grounded in naive physics—the grass's ability to grow back quickly and recover from the aeration process will be most efficient during or just before its period of active growth. This ensures that the lawn takes full advantage of the aeration process, resulting in a healthier, more robust turf area."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The game's ruling body has been beset by a number of scandals in recent years, and most recently has been fiercely criticized for its decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar amid allegations of worker abuse within the Gulf state. \\"I thought it was a very difficult body to deal with -- I think its culture is very ugly,\\" David Triesman, who was the English Football Association's chairman from 2008-10, told CNN in an exclusive interview on Wednesday. He concluded that OPTIONS: - 2022 World Cup was a high-risk option because of its soaring temperatures -- but it was still chosen by 14 of the 22 executive committee members in the final round of voting in December that year. - British was a high-risk option because of its soaring temperatures -- but it was still chosen by 14 of the 22 executive committee members in the final round of voting in December that year. - CNN was a high-risk option because of its soaring temperatures -- but it was still chosen by 14 of the 22 executive committee members in the final round of voting in December that year. - David Triesman was a high-risk option because of its soaring temperatures -- but it was still chosen by 14 of the 22 executive committee members in the final round of voting in December that year. - English Football Association was a high-risk option because of its soaring temperatures -- but it was still chosen by 14 of the 22 executive committee members in the final round of voting in December that year. - FA was a high-risk option because of its soaring temperatures -- but it was still chosen by 14 of the 22 executive committee members in the final round of voting in December that year. - FIFA was a high-risk option because of its soaring temperatures -- but it was still chosen by 14 of the 22 executive committee members in the final round of voting in December that year. - Foreign Office was a high-risk option because of its soaring temperatures -- but it was still chosen by 14 of the 22 executive committee members in the final round of voting in December that year. - Gulf was a high-risk option because of its soaring temperatures -- but it was still chosen by 14 of the 22 executive committee members in the final round of voting in December that year. - Qatar was a high-risk option because of its soaring temperatures -- but it was still chosen by 14 of the 22 executive committee members in the final round of voting in December that year. - Triesman was a high-risk option because of its soaring temperatures -- but it was still chosen by 14 of the 22 executive committee members in the final round of voting in December that year.","output":"He concluded that the 2022 World Cup was a high-risk option because of its soaring temperatures -- but it was still chosen by 14 of the 22 executive committee members in the final round of voting in December that year. Triesman's remarks highlight the concerns that many have had about the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. With temperatures in the Gulf state reaching well over 100°F (38°C) during the summer months, there have been worries about the safety of both players and spectators. Many have questioned the rationale behind FIFA's choice, in light of these concerns. Additionally, the allegations of worker abuse in Qatar have further tainted FIFA's reputation. Reports have emerged of migrant workers, many coming from countries such as Nepal, India, and Bangladesh, enduring precarious working conditions while helping to build the World Cup infrastructure. These workers have faced long hours, inadequate pay, and horrific living conditions, leading to numerous deaths. The fact that such a prestigious international sporting event could be mired in controversy due to the decisions made by its governing body raises serious questions about FIFA's integrity. Triesman's condemnation of FIFA's \\"ugly\\" culture underscores the need for reform within the organization. FIFA must ensure that its processes are transparent, fair, and guided by a commitment to the best interests of the sport and its global fan base. Moving forward, FIFA should work towards rebuilding public trust by implementing stringent measures to prevent corruption and ensure that human rights are protected. Just as importantly, FIFA needs to engage in meaningful dialogue with the international community, welcoming collaboration and oversight in order to create a more accountable and ethical organization. In conclusion, the controversy surrounding the 2022 World Cup in Qatar serves as a reminder of the importance of strong leadership and high ethical standards in the world of sports. As an organization charged with promoting the beautiful game, FIFA must take steps to restore its credibility and safeguard the best interests of football, its players, and fans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I can use this background: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.  Now, I have a new situation: Two brothers went to the doctor's office for an appointment. The doctor discovered that Tim had very high levels of cholesterol, while Jim had normal levels.  Answer this question please: Which brother had fewer plaques that can restrict blood flow? A:","output":"Based on the background information provided, Jim, who has normal levels of cholesterol, is more likely to have fewer plaques that can restrict blood flow. High levels of cholesterol, as seen in Tim, are associated with an increased risk of plaques forming on the arterial walls, leading to potential blood flow restriction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This aligns with the given information which states that under the terms of the cease-fire, Israeli forces were permitted to maintain their position on Mount Scopus, with the United Nations delivering necessary supplies, including food and medicine, on a monthly basis. The cease-fire agreement appears to have been designed with a focus on halting active conflict while acknowledging the strategic importance of Mount Scopus for Israeli forces. By allowing the Israeli forces to remain in their position, the cease-fire agreement may have aimed to minimize the potential for future flare-ups of violence or tensions related to territory or military presence. The United Nations, as an international organization, serves as a neutral party in conflict resolution and peacekeeping efforts. In this scenario, their role in supplying the Israeli forces with food and medicine further reinforces the notion of their impartiality and their commitment to helping maintain peace. By coordinating the delivery of supplies, the United Nations ensures that both parties adhere to the terms of the cease-fire and reduces the potential for conflict. This arrangement may also function as a means of monitoring the situation on Mount Scopus, as the regular contact between the United Nations and the Israeli forces could help identify any possible violations of the cease-fire or the emergence of new tensions.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Kieran Gill. Follow @@kie1410. West Brom went all out in buying Brown Ideye for £10million, breaking their own record transfer fee and telling the world they're deadly serious about not being sucked into a relegation battle. But plenty of questions have been asked since they bought the striker from Dynamo Kiev. Who is he? What's he done to be worth that kind of money? Will he adapt or just be another dud? Here, Sportsmail gives you the lowdown on the 25-year-old from Nigeria. How did the £10m price-tag come about? Neuchatel Xamax to Sochaux - £4m. Sochaux to Dynamo Kiev - £7m. Dynamo Kiev to West Brom - £10m. At 25, Ideye's stock has risen over the years. The forward began with Ocean Boys, where he won the Nigerian Premier League, before venturing to Europe, as most aspiring youngsters would. The then-20-year-old joined Swiss outfit Neuchatel Xamax and, a failed trial at Dutch side Willem II Tilburg along the way, made it to Ligue 1 with Sochaux, costing about £4m at the time. He's upped his price as he goes along, particularly after joining Dynamo Kiev for £7m in 2011. There, he scored 33 goals in 74 games in the Ukrainian Premier League. Kiev wanted to make a profit on their initial investment, and have done so with the £10m sale. Signed: Brown Ideye has signed for West Brom for £10million from Dynamo Kiev as their fifth new player. BORN: Nigeria, October 10 1988 (age 25) 2006-2007: Ocean Boys (5 apps, 1 gl) 2008-2010: Neuchatel Xamax (55, 23) 2010-2011: Sochaux (52, 17) 2011-2014: Dynamo Kiev (74, 33) 2014-NOW: West Brom. 2010-NOW: Nigeria (23, 5) Statistics based on league appearances. Has he had his heart set on the Premier League for a while? Yes, but not with West Brom. The striker actually preferred Newcastle United. In 2013, he was rated at £9m and Swansea, West Ham and Stoke were others on the chase. But last year, his agent Hootan Ahmadi had this to say: 'There has been a lot of interest from English clubs, but Newcastle would be Brown's preferred choice for a number of reasons. 'They have a good fan-base and play an attacking style of football. 'He has a good knowledge of the club and of the Premier League. Brown would love to test himself at that level.' He's got the chance now, just not at St James' Park. Wanted: Dynamo Kiev striker Ideye attracted interest from several Premier League clubs at the time. How will he fit in? West Brom have been crying out for a powerful striker ever since Romelu Lukaku's loan spell came to an end, and they may find it in Ideye. He's strong, fast-paced, particularly good in the air, and has proved himself in the Champions League and internationally, too. The Baggies teetered above relegation to the Championship last year, and Saido Berahino and Stephane Sessegnon were their top goalscorers in a dismal Premier League campaign on five. If Ideye can adapt to England as he did to Ukraine, then he can be the goalscorer they crave. New boy: Ideye took to Twitter to announce the move and was excited to join the Premier League. Excited: Ideye wrote on Twitter that it was a 'done deal' and thanked God for the chance to join West Brom. Will he be a dud or a success? It's always difficult to judge, but there are no worrying signs to indicate that he will be anything other than a success at the Hawthorns. Some players instantly adapt to the Premier League, others take time, and a few never do. But Ideye seems a determined striker who's been waiting for this chance for a while. When he moved to Switzerland, he admitted he struggled with the cold weather. However, he became enough of a handful to defenders to earn a move to Ligue 1. West Brom have raised a few eyebrows with their spending on Ideye, but time will tell if it was too impulsive or a stroke of genius. Proud: Ideye took to Twitter to announce his deal with West Brom and thanked his family and agents. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article is about a soccer player named Brown Ideye, who was bought by West Brom for £10 million, which broke their own record transfer fee.

He has scored 33 goals in 74 games in the Ukrainian Premier League. He is known for his strength, speed, and good performance in the air, and he has experience playing in international games.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Napoleon The brief peace in Europe allowed Napoleon to focus on the French colonies abroad. Saint-Domingue had managed to acquire a high level of political autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars, with Toussaint Louverture installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801. Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens. During the Revolution, the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794. Under the terms of Amiens, however, Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented. The resulting Law of 20 May never applied to colonies like Guadeloupe or Guyane, even though rogue generals and other officials used the pretext of peace as an opportunity to reinstate slavery in some of these places. The Law of 20 May officially restored the slave trade to the Caribbean colonies, not slavery itself. Napoleon sent an expedition under General Leclerc designed to reassert control over Sainte-Domingue. Although the French managed to capture Toussaint Louverture, the expedition failed when high rates of disease crippled the French army. In May 1803, the last 8000 French troops left the island and the slaves proclaimed an independent republic that they called Haïti in 1804. Seeing the failure of his colonial efforts, Napoleon decided in 1803 to sell the Louisiana Territory to the United States, instantly doubling the size of the U.S. The selling price in the Louisiana Purchase was less than three cents per acre, a total of 15 million.

The strange thing was to me, it wasn’t that I was eating more then I used to, as a matter of fact I started eating less. When that didn’t help I barely ate at all. Still I couldn’t lose weight. What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake. He suggested in the morning to start exercising about 20 minutes to get that adrenaline rush, in the afternoon exercise about twenty minutes more for the same reason… Dieting and exercising brought those pounds back down.

Tyler and Freya knew that they had to work together and be better siblings to land on Santa's nice list. Freya, 4, and Tyler, 8, helped their parents, supported each other, and did everything they could to cherish the true spirit of Christmas. On that special morning, the sun gently streamed through the windows, casting a warm glow on the festive decorations. The air buzzed with excitement and magic as the Cole family gathered around the tree, eager to discover if Santa had delivered any presents. Tyler and Freya cautiously approached the tree, their hearts pounding with anticipation. They understood that their fate was in the balance - this wasn't a simple matter of receiving presents; it was about proving they could learn and grow from their mistakes. As they scanned the area beneath the tree, they noticed a small wooden box embellished with Freya and Tyler's names in gold. A beautifully handwritten letter from Santa rested atop the box, its red ribbon tied perfectly in a bow. Their mother, Laura, handed them the letter, her eyes filled with joy. With trembling fingers, Tyler and Freya opened the envelope. They read through the letter - words of love, encouragement, and pride for the efforts they had put in. Santa praised the siblings for their determination, growth, and transformation in such a short time. He recognized the importance of hard work and empathy and encouraged them to keep nurturing the values they had rediscovered. Hesitantly, they opened the wooden box, afraid to discover what was inside. To their delight and astonishment, they found two golden coins engraved with the words \\"Freya\\" and \\"Tyler.\\" On the other side of the coins, a message read: \\"For those who prove that they can change, magic awaits.\\" Tyler and Freya smiled as they realized that not only were they off Santa's naughty list, but they had also unlocked a world of magic, hope, and endless possibilities. They understood that making amends and working together had unlocked something more powerful and priceless than any material gift. From that day on, the bond between Tyler and Freya Cole grew stronger than ever, their hearts forever marked by the magic of that extraordinary Christmas. The family continued to celebrate the love and unity they discovered through challenging times, fostering a sense of understanding and appreciation for one another. So, the story ends with Tyler and Freya learning the importance of personal growth, empathy, and the magic of Christmas. The experience united them as siblings and taught them to cherish their relationships with each other, their parents, and, of course, Santa Claus. The golden coins became a symbol of their love and dedication, reminding them always to strive for goodness and compassion in all aspects of their lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Remy mounted their horses and went on an adventure in the field.  Given the question \\"Why did Remy do this?\\", is \\"tell others about their adventures\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"It could be a valid answer if we use it under the assumption or in a context that Remy intends to share their experiences and adventures with others. In many narratives, characters embark on adventures in order to gather stories, experiences, or wisdom, which they then share with others upon their return. These adventures can lead to personal growth and discovery, which could be meaningful and educational for others to learn from. However, based purely on the information provided in the sentence, it isn't directly stated or implied that Remy's motive for embarking on the adventure in the field was specifically to tell others about it later on. People go on adventures for various reasons - for thrill, exploration, discovery, learning, or even just for a simple change of scenery. It could have been driven by any of these factors, or maybe a mix of these, it could even be for a completely different reason not listed. It's also important to note that the act of going on an adventure doesn't inherently mean that Remy's intent was to tell others about it. Some individuals enjoy solitary adventures without the need to share or broadcast their experiences, choosing instead to retain these experiences as personal memories or lessons. In conclusion, while the answer \\"to tell others about their adventures\\" could be valid in certain contexts or assumptions, it isn't a guaranteed or definitive answer based on the specific detail provided within the scenario. Delving deeper requires more information about Remy's persona, interests, intentions, and patterns of behaviour to come to a concrete conclusion about the intent behind their adventurous decision. To accurately pinpoint Remy's motivations, it would be essential to fully understand their character and the circumstances surrounding their decision to go on an adventure."},{"instruction":"pick from the following. - Yes; - No; Given those answer options, answer the question: Casey has broken up with austin for cheating on her.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Who agreed to a trial?, using the article: Drake began recording his debut album Five Leaves Left later in 1968, with Boyd as producer. Drake skipped lectures to travel by train to the sessions in Sound Techniques studio, London. Inspired by John Simon's production of Leonard Cohen's album Songs of Leonard Cohen, Boyd was keen that Drake's voice would be recorded in a similar close and intimate style, \\"with no shiny pop reverb\\". He sought to include a string arrangement similar to Simon's, \\"without overwhelming ... or sounding cheesy\\". To provide backing, Boyd enlisted various contacts from the London folk rock scene, including Fairport Convention guitarist Richard Thompson and Pentangle bassist Danny Thompson (no relation). To provide string arrangements, Boyd already had in mind Richard A. Hewson. Initial recordings did not go well: the sessions were irregular and rushed, taking place during studio downtime borrowed from Fairport Convention's production of their Unhalfbricking album. Tension arose as to the direction of the album: Boyd was an advocate of George Martin's approach of \\"using the studio as an instrument\\", while Drake preferred a more organic sound. Dann has observed that Drake appears \\"tight and anxious\\" on bootleg recordings from the sessions, and notes a number of Boyd's unsuccessful attempts at instrumentation. Both were unhappy with Hewson's contribution, which they felt was too mainstream for Drake's songs. Drake suggested his college friend Robert Kirby as a replacement. Though Boyd was sceptical about taking on an inexperienced amateur music student, he was impressed by Drake's uncharacteristic assertiveness, and agreed to a trial. Kirby had previously presented Drake with some arrangements for his songs. While Kirby provided most arrangements for the album, its centrepiece \\"River Man\\", which echoed the tone of Delius, was orchestrated by the veteran composer Harry Robertson.

With Yorkshire local government in political and financial chaos in the wake of the bankruptcy of George Hudson, there was no political will to organise a public subscription or to waive the fees, and as a consequence Etty was buried in the churchyard of St Olave's Church, his local parish church. On 6 May 1850 the contents of his studio were auctioned, in a total of 1034 lots including around 900 paintings; some of these paintings were incomplete studies later completed by other artists to increase their value. In the years following his death Etty's work became highly collectable, his works fetching huge sums on resale. He continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some, with Charles Robert Leslie observing in 1850 \\"It cannot be doubted that the voluptuous treatment of his subjects, in very many instances, recommended them more powerfully than their admirable art; while we may fully believe that he himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\".Six months after William's death, Betsy Etty married chemist Stephen Binnington, a distant relation of the Etty family. She moved into his house in Haymarket, and some time after his death moved to 40 Edwardes Square, where she died in 1888 at the age of 87. While Etty did have admirers, the patchy quality of his later work meant that he never acquired the circle of imitators and students that could have led to him being seen as the founder of the English realist movement, now considered to have begun in 1848 with the formation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais, two of the three founders of the Pre-Raphaelites, were heavily influenced by Etty's early works but recoiled from his later style.

That's when the young boy noticed an open garage and a figure that he believed was a dog outside an apartment near his house. Given the extremely cold weather, the young boy got a feeling that something was not right. But instead of dismissing   it like most kids at his age would have, he insisted that his mother, Dawn, go to examine what was going on.

Dawn finally gave in and decided to take a walk to the area with the family dog and see if there was any truth to Danny's premonition  .
