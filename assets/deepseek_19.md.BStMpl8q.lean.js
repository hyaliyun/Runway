Bellefonte, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- For the first week of Jerry Sandusky's child sex trial, eight young men held jurors spellbound with testimony about a sports hero they say groped them in the car, soaped them in the shower and sexually assaulted them on a basement waterbed.

How do you come back from something like that? Sandusky's defense attorneys, Joe Amendola and Karl Rominger, responded this week with rapid-fire rounds of testimony; 29 witnesses took the stand in little more than two days -- including 11 character witnesses in a single hour. The defense also chipped away at the character and motives of the alleged victims, sparing no one: not the young accusers, not their families and certainly not the cops. As the trial proceeded, the prosecution rebutted the defense's claims by bringing forward additional witnesses and evidence, including a forensic psychiatrist who testified about the psychological impact of sexual abuse on the victims. Prosecutors also presented emails and text messages between Sandusky and the alleged victims, further corroborating their claims of abuse. In the midst of these emotionally charged testimonies, the jury heard from several individuals who worked closely with Sandusky at Penn State, including assistant coaches and staff, who described his behavior around young boys as \\"suspicious\\" and \\"inappropriate.\\" These testimonies cast a shadow over Sandusky's reputation and questioned the suitability of his role as a mentor and youth sports coach. As the trial reached its conclusion, both the defense and prosecution delivered their closing arguments. Amendola and Rominger focused on highlighting inconsistencies in the testimonies of the alleged victims, accusing the police of investigative misconduct and harassment, and questioning the financial motives behind the accusers' claims. The prosecution, on the other hand, painted a disturbing picture of Sandusky as a predator who used his prestigious position at Penn State to exploit vulnerable young boys. They urged the jury to consider the overwhelming evidence against Sandusky and the compelling testimonies of the eight young men who had the courage to come forward. After days of deliberation, the jury found Jerry Sandusky guilty on numerous counts of child sexual abuse. Sandusky, who remained stoic as the verdict was read, was immediately remanded into custody to begin serving his sentence. The verdict brought a sense of closure to the victims and their families, while sparking a broader conversation about the importance of vigilance against child sexual abuse and the need for institutions like Penn State to prioritize the well-being of children over their interests or reputation. In the wake of the trial, Penn State faced criticism for their handling of the allegations against Sandusky, leading to the firing of numerous top-level administrators, including the university's president and the legendary football coach, Joe Paterno. The trial also led to renewed interest in legislation supporting victims of child sexual abuse and extending the statute of limitations for such cases, with the hope that other victims would find the strength to share their experiences and seek justice. As the dust settled on this harrowing case, the community of Bellefonte and Penn State University were left grappling with the dark side of a celebrated sports hero and the legacy of a man who championed the welfare of children, but was ultimately revealed to be their worst nightmare."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what happens when the wire touches the battery?\\" is \\"the battery glows\\", given that  electricity flows when the wire touches the battery? Options are: (A). Yes; (B). No; The answer is:","output":"(B). No; The answer \\"the battery glows\\" is not the right answer to the question \\"what happens when the wire touches the battery?\\". While it is true that electricity flows when the wire touches the battery, this phenomenon will not cause the battery itself to glow. Rather, what happens is that an electrical circuit is created when the wire connects to the battery terminals. A battery stores electrical energy in the form of chemical energy, which converts into electrical energy when connected to an electrical circuit through the terminals. The battery has two terminals – the positive one being the anode and the negative one being the cathode. When a wire or a conducting material establishes a connection with these two terminals, the flow of electrons from the cathode to the anode is generated. This flow of electrons is known as electric current. Depending on the resistance of the wire and the load (if any) connected to the wire, the energy transfer between the battery and the wire could manifest in different ways: 1. When a load is connected within the circuit, such as a light bulb, the energy flowing through the wire transfers to the bulb, making it glow. This happens because the electrical energy is converted into light and heat energy within the filament of the bulb. 2. If the wire itself has a significant amount of resistance, some of the electrical energy may be converted into heat energy within the wire. Consequently, this may cause the wire to heat up, but the battery will not glow. 3. If a wire with low resistance is connected to the battery in a direct short circuit, the flow of the current will be very high. In such a case, there's a risk of overheating, potential damage to the battery, and even the possibility of a fire or explosion. In summary, while electricity does flow when the wire touches the battery, the right answer to the question is not \\"the battery glows\\". Instead, the answer depends on factors such as the presence of a load within the circuit or the characteristics of the wire. It's essential to practice safety precautions when working with batteries to avoid any potential hazards."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Passage:In 1944, Argentia served as one of the two stopover bases for the refuelling, maintenance, and crew changes of the six United States Navy (USN) K-class blimps that made the first transatlantic crossings of non-rigid airships. Blimps K-123 and K-130 from USN Blimp Squadron 14 (also known as ZP-14, Blimpron 14, or \\"The Africa Squadron\\") left South Weymouth Naval Air Station in Massachusetts on 28 May 1944 and landed at Argentia about 16 hours later. The two K-ships then flew for approximately 22 hours to Lages Field on Terceira Island in the Azores, the second stopover base for the transatlantic flights. The last leg was a ~20-hour flight to the squadron's final destination with Fleet Air Wing (FAW) 15 at Port Lyautey, French Morocco (now Kenitra, Morocco). Blimps K-123 and K-130 were followed by K-109 and K-134 then K-112 and K-101 which left South Weymouth on 11 and 27 June, respectively, in 1944. These six blimps initially conducted nighttime anti-submarine warfare operations to complement the daytime missions flown by FAW-15 aircraft (PBYs and PB4Y-2) using magnetic anomaly detection to locate U-boats in the relatively shallow waters around the Strait of Gibraltar. Later, ZP-14 K-ships conducted minespotting and minesweeping operations in key Mediterranean ports and various escort missions including that of the convoy carrying Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill to the Yalta Conference in early 1945. In late April 1945, K-89 and K-114 left NAS Weeksville (now Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City) in North Carolina and flew a southern route to NAS Bermuda, the Azores, and Port Lyautey, where they arrived on 1 May 1945.

While there, he is attacked and bitten by a creature later revealed to be a werewolf, although he succeeds in acquiring a specimen of the mariphasa. Once back home in London he is approached by a fellow botanist, Dr. Yogami, who claims to have met him in Tibet while also seeking the mariphasa. Yogami warns Glendon that the bite of a werewolf would cause him to become a werewolf as well, adding that the mariphasa is a temporary antidote for the disease. Glendon does not believe the mysterious Yogami. That is, not until he begins to experience the first pangs of lycanthropy, first when his hand grows fur beneath the rays of his moon lamp (which he is using in an effort to entice the mariphasa to bloom), and later that night during the first full moon.

While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general. An adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development. Adolescence is a sensitive period in the development process, and exposure to the wrong things at that time can have a major effect on future decisions. While children that grow up in nice suburban communities are not exposed to bad environments they are more likely to participate in activities that can benefit their identity and contribute to a more successful identity development. Q: Is an inner city or crime-driven neighborhood more or less likely to be detrimental to one's development?","output":"An inner city or crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be detrimental to one's development. The environment in which an adolescent grows up significantly impacts their social and psychological development. Often, inner cities or crime-driven neighborhoods are characterized by numerous socio-economic challenges such as poverty, low education levels, crime, and limited access to resources and opportunities. All these factors can negatively impact the overall adolescent development process. In specific terms, high crime rates can induce a constant stress and fear which may interfere with cognitive and emotional development in adolescents. Constant exposure to violence and crime can normalize such behaviors, leading youth down a similar path, negatively impacting the behavior patterns they develop. Moreover, poverty and low education levels, which are often prevalent in these areas, can restrict access to quality education or extracurricular activities that nurture talents, interests and provide opportunities for identity exploration. This can inhibit intellectual growth and limit prospects for future educational and career advancement. Furthermore, limited resources and support programs impede the provision of constructive recreational activities that can help teenagers stay positively engaged and out of trouble. The lack of a supportive network and positive role models can hinder adolescents from developing necessary social skills or establishing beneficial peer relationships. Poor housing conditions and financial stress associated with poverty can also affect the physical health of an adolescent, as they may not have access to sufficient healthcare or nutrition, which are important for their physical development. Additionally, the presence of substance abuse and addiction is often higher in high-crime neighborhoods which exposes adolescents to such detrimental behaviors at an early age. This can lead to tendencies towards substance misuse and addiction, further complicating their adolescence growth phase. It's important to note, however, that each individual's experience differs and not everyone from these neighborhoods undergoes the same hardships or consequences. Resiliency can be found in these hard environments, with many adolescents overcoming their difficult circumstances and succeeding in life. However, generally, an inner city or a crime-driven environment presents more obstacles to healthy development in adolescence compared to a more privileged upbringing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Scientists create new robotic Terminator-style muscle 1,000 times stronger than humans      By Travis Gettys      Thursday, December 26, 2013 11:25 EDT      Researchers have developed a tiny robotic muscle that’s 1,000 time stronger than a human muscle.      The team of researchers at the University of California-Berkeley found that vanadium dioxide changes from an insulator to a conductive metal at about 152 degrees, which produced a huge amount of strength during the transition.      The scientists used the material to demonstrate a microchip-sized, twisting robotic motor that could catapult objects 50 times heavier than itself over a distance five times longer than itself faster than the blink of an eye – within 60 milliseconds.      The team fabricated the micro-muscle from a long V-shaped ribbon made of chromium and vanadium dioxide, which is already prized for its ability to change size, shape and physical identity, and heated it with a tiny pad or by electrical current.      When the dual coil formed by the ribbon is heated, said physicist Junqiao Wu, who led the team, it turns into either a tiny catapult or a proximity sensor, which causes a rapid change in the muscle’s resistance and shape that pushes away nearby objects.      “Multiple micro-muscles can be assembled into a micro-robotic system that simulates an active neuromuscular system,” Wu said. “The naturally combined functions of proximity sensing and torsional motion allow the device to remotely detect a target and respond by reconfiguring itself to a different shape. This simulates living bodies where neurons sense and deliver stimuli to the muscles and the muscles provide motion.”      The team found the micro-muscles could twist and turn more than 1 million times without degradation, and they showed far greater movement abilities than current robotic motors.      Vanadium dioxide can also absorb light and convert it to heat, which will allow the micro-muscle to be triggered optothermally.      The technology could eventually be used to build a complex organism that simulates an active neuromuscular system, perhaps in prosthetic limbs or surgical procedures.      “With its combination of power and multi-functionality, our micro-muscle shows great potential for applications that require a high level of functionality integration in a small space,” Wu said. ||||| December 19, 2013      News Release      Vanadium dioxide is poised to join the pantheon of superstars in the materials world. Already prized for its extraordinary ability to change size, shape and physical identity, vanadium dioxide can now add muscle power to its attributes. A team of researchers with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) has demonstrated a micro-sized robotic torsional muscle/motor made from vanadium dioxide that for its size is a thousand times more powerful than a human muscle, able to catapult objects 50 times heavier than itself over a distance five times its length within 60 milliseconds – faster than the blink of an eye.      “We’ve created a micro-bimorph dual coil that functions as a powerful torsional muscle, driven thermally or electro-thermally by the phase transition of vanadium dioxide,” says the leader of this work, Junqiao Wu, a physicist who holds joint appointments with Berkeley Lab’s Materials Sciences Division and the University of California-Berkeley’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering. “Using a simple design and inorganic materials, we achieve superior performance in power density and speed over the motors and actuators now used in integrated micro-systems.”      Wu is the corresponding author of a paper describing this research in the journal Advanced Materials. The paper is titled “Powerful, Multifunctional Torsional Micro Muscles Activated by Phase Transition.” Co-authors are Kai Liu, Chun Cheng, Joonki Suh, Robert Tang-Kong, Deyi Fu, Sangwook Lee, Jian Zhou and Leon Chua.      What makes vanadium dioxide highly coveted by the electronics industry is that it is one of the few known materials that’s an insulator at low temperatures but abruptly becomes a conductor at 67 degrees Celsius. This temperature-driven phase transition from insulator-to-metal is expected to one day yield faster, more energy efficient electronic and optical devices. However, vanadium dioxide crystals also undergo a temperature-driven structural phase transition whereby when warmed they rapidly contract along one dimension while expanding along the other two. This makes vanadium dioxide an ideal candidate material for creating miniaturized, multi-functional motors and artificial muscles.      “Miniaturizing rotary motors is important for integrated micro-systems and has been intensively pursued over the past decades,” Wu says. “The power density of our micro-muscle in combination with its multi-functionality distinguishes it from all current macro- or micro-torsional actuators/motors.”      Wu and his colleagues fabricated their micro-muscle on a silicon substrate from a long “V-shaped” bimorph ribbon comprised of chromium and vanadium dioxide. When the V-shaped ribbon is released from the substrate it forms a helix consisting of a dual coil that is connected at either end to chromium electrode pads. Heating the dual coil actuates it, turning it into either a micro-catapult, in which an object held in the coil is hurled when the coil is actuated, or a proximity sensor, in which the remote sensing of an object (meaning without touching it) causes a “micro-explosion,” a rapid change in the micro-muscle’s resistance and shape that pushes the object away.      “Multiple micro-muscles can be assembled into a micro-robotic system that simulates an active neuromuscular system,” Wu says. “The naturally combined functions of proximity sensing and torsional motion allow the device to remotely detect a target and respond by reconfiguring itself to a different shape. This simulates living bodies where neurons sense and deliver stimuli to the muscles and the muscles provide motion.”      The vanadium dioxide micro-muscles demonstrated reversible torsional motion over one million cycles with no degradation. They also showed a rotational speed of up to approximately 200,000 rpm, amplitude of 500 to 2,000 degrees per millimeters in length, and an energy power density up to approximately 39 kilowatts/kilogram.      “These metrics are all orders of magnitudes higher than existing torsional motors based on electrostatics, magnetics, carbon nanotubes or piezoelectrics,” Wu says.      The heating of the vanadium dioxide micro-muscle to actuate it can be done either globally with a tiny heating pad, or with an electrical current applied to the dual coil. Wu says heating with the electric current is the better way to go because it allows for the selective heating of individual micro-muscles and the heating and cooling process is much faster. In addition, as vanadium dioxide absorbs light and coverts it into heat, the coil can also be triggered optothermally.      “With its combination of power and multi-functionality, our micro-muscle shows great potential for applications that require a high level of functionality integration in a small space,” Wu says.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? To play baseball,","output":"Playing baseball requires a combination of physical skills, mental strategies, and an understanding of the game rules. Baseball is a popular sport that dates back to the 19th century and is commonly referred to as America's pastime. It consists of two teams taking turns to play offense (batting) and defense (pitching and fielding). To get started on the journey to play baseball, follow these steps: 1. Learn the basic rules and terminology:  Before you start playing, it is essential to familiarize yourself with the basic rules and terms used in baseball. Know the positions of the players, the various equipment used, and how the game is played. You can watch baseball games, read books or articles, or join online baseball discussion groups to further your knowledge. 2. Obtain the necessary equipment: To play baseball, you'll need some essential equipment like a baseball, a bat, gloves, helmets, cleats, and uniforms. You can purchase these items online or at a sports store. Make sure the equipment is the right size and fit for you, as this is important to play comfortably and safely. 3. Develop physical skills: Start by working on your physical skills as they are crucial to perform well in the game. Focus on improving your agility, speed, strength, and hand-eye coordination. You can do this through regular exercise, agility drills, and strength training. Additionally, running and practicing sprints can help you develop the speed and stamina needed for base running and fielding. 4. Join a team or baseball league: Find a local recreational or competitive baseball league or a team where you can regularly practice and improve your skills. Associating with like-minded individuals who share the same passion for baseball will foster camaraderie and create a supportive environment. 5. Practice throwing and catching: One of the most fundamental skills in baseball is throwing and catching. Begin by practicing catching grounders and fly balls at short and long distances. As you become comfortable catching, shift your focus to throwing. Start with short distances and gradually increase the distance. Try different throwing techniques like the overhand, sidearm, or underhand to see which works best for you. 6. Practice hitting: Batting is an essential component of baseball, so spend time developing your swing. Focus on your grip and stance when holding the bat and practice making contact with the ball. Work on timing and controlling your swing to increase the chances of hitting the ball. 7. Work on base running: Base running is an integral part of the game that requires good speed and awareness. Learn the techniques of sliding and when to use them. Practice how to lead off, steal a base, and pick up signals from the base coaches to know when to advance. 8. Understand your position: Each position on the field has specific responsibilities that contribute to the team's overall performance. Be familiar with your role and focus on your individual skills and techniques necessary for that position. 9. Attend baseball camps or clinics: Consider enrolling in a baseball camp or clinic, where you'll receive expert coaching and guidance tailored to your skill level. These camps provide an excellent opportunity to refine your skills, work on specific aspects of the game, and receive valuable insights from experienced instructors. 10. Stay persistent and committed: Improvement in any sport, including baseball, comes with time, practice, and dedication. It's essential to stay committed to the game and practice consistently. Learning from your mistakes and seeking guidance from experienced players or coaches will help expedite your progress. By following these steps and committing to regular practice, you will develop the foundation and skills necessary to play baseball confidently and proficiently. Remember that progress takes time, so remain patient and focused on continuous improvement as you pursue your passion for the game."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Over Export Subsidies HONG KONG — The Obama administration announced on Wednesday morning that it was filing a broad trade case against China at the World Trade Organization, accusing Beijing of providing illegal export subsidies in seven different industries. The trade case comes as the White House is trying to persuade Congress that it is taking a tough stand in trade negotiations. The administration wants Congress to give it the power to negotiate a Trans-Pacific Partnership lowering trade barriers and adding a range of measures protecting patents and other forms of intellectual property across a dozen Pacific nations, and to be able to submit the agreement to Congress for a yes-or-no vote with no amendments allowed. The reported Chinese subsidies affect American industries with powerful political constituencies on Capitol Hill, and with links to fence-sitters in Congress whose support the administration needs to win the trade negotiating authority it seeks. These industries include textiles, apparel, agriculture, chemicals, medical equipment and certain metals like titanium and specialty steels. The administration accused China of providing at least 1 billion in illegal subsidies over three years by providing so-called common service platforms to help exporters. The administration is also contending that China set up 179 “demonstration bases” for exporters in these industries, providing at least 635,000 at each of some of the bases. If the administration wins its cases, China would need to halt the subsidies. W.T.O. rules ban virtually all export subsidies so as to discourage member nations from trying to buying market share for their companies in other countries. The administration’s announcement came late at night in China, and there was no immediate reaction from Beijing. China’s commerce ministry sometimes waits a day or two to issue a public response to W.T.O. cases, preferring to have teams of lawyers study them before saying anything. Wednesday’s announcement came the morning after President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China spoke on the phone and agreed that President Xi would visit Washington in September. According to a White House statement, the two presidents discussed climate change, Iran’s nuclear program and China’s currency policy. The statement made no mention of trade. Asked whether President Obama personally warned Mr. Xi of the coming trade case, an American trade official responded only that “the Chinese were notified ahead of time through senior channels.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic sensitivities involved. The specific legal measure taken by the administration on Wednesday is a formal request to China for consultations at the W.T.O. Unless those consultations produce a mutually acceptable agreement — and such talks seldom do — the next step for the United States would be to request that a dispute resolution panel be convened at the W.T.O. in Geneva to rule on which country is right. The scale of the alleged subsidies is small compared with China’s overall exports of goods to the United States, which reached 466.7 billion last year. American exports to China, by comparison, totaled 124 billion last year, the Commerce Department announced on Feb. 5. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"Alright kiddo, here's what's going on in this news article. The people who help the president of the United States, called the Obama administration, are saying that China, a big country in Asia, is doing something that's not fair when it comes to selling things to other countries. They believe China is giving some of their businesses extra help so they can sell their products cheaper, making it harder for businesses in other countries to compete. The United States wants an organization called the World Trade Organization to find out if China is really doing this. If it's true, then China will have to stop helping those businesses in an unfair way. This is important because people are talking a lot about whether different countries should be allowed to buy and sell things more easily with each other. Some people think that if China has to stop giving extra help to their businesses, it might make it easier for countries to agree on better rules for buying and selling things together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Annabelle, the new head girl of St. Trinian's, bartered for Â£100,000 from the man when he called back, but he refused and then proceeded to threaten them. Afterwards, the girls ask the headmistress, Camilla Fritton, about why the ring might be so valuable. She tells them a story about Pirate Fritton, her ancestor, who supposedly hid a great treasure somewhere in the world. He had two rings made, which when fitted together would reveal the location of the treasure. The man on the telephone who wanted the ring is Sir Piers Pomfrey, a member of a secret society, and descendant of a man robbed by Pirate Fritton in 1589. Sir Piers manages to steal the ring from headmistress Camilla. The girls decide to search for the second ring, and find a clue left by another ancestor of the Frittons, who found the first ring (left in the library) and believed he knew where to look for the second. After a difficult deciphering of the clue, a midnight hunt in a graveyard, dealing with demonic possession, and disguising themselves as boys to infiltrate another school, the girls find the elusive second ring at last.

Article: Electricity, like clean water, is a resource that's often taken for granted. But last summer, when blackouts struck much of the northeastern US, Ontario and Rome, consumers on two continents were given a painful reminder of just how easily broken electricity supplies can be. The massive disorder stranded  commuters, stopped freezers, shut down businesses and refocused attention on where most of the planet's power comes from:oil-and-gas-fired generators and nuclear plants, These sources not only pollute the environment but also make many consumers feel unacceptable health risks. Companies are trying to offer an alternative, clean energy from renewable resources that's plentiful and portable. Lifton's Medis Technologies, as well as companies like Hydrogenics and Nanosys, is tapping into fuel cells and dolor panels to give people power whenever and wherever they want it, free from dependence on local grids . The search for alternative energy is nothing new, but the current trend of innovators is focusing on the goal of making clean and sustainable power a mainstream commodity. For example, the fuel cell, which produces electricity from the chemical reaction between oxygen and hydrogen, has been around for about 150 years, though its commercial development did not begin until the 1960s and then only as part of NASA spacecraft. Today this technology is coming down to Earth in places like Tokyo; in nine European cities, from Stockholm to Porto, each operating three hydrogen-fuel-cell buses; and in Iceland, which is trying to create the first fuel free hydrogen economy by 2030. When hydrogen and oxygen molecules combine, the reaction produces heat and water. Fuel cells use this reaction to generate electricity. With the cell phone and gadget market in mind, Medis has developed a fuel cell with cheap components that produces little heat and effortlessly reduces waste water without turning to energy consuming pumps. Question: Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage? Options: A: Lifton's Medis Technologies is tapping into fuel cells and solar panels. B: The fuel cell has been around for about 150 years. C: The fuel cell's commercial development did not begin until the 1960s.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I will never own a Chanel suit. It is unlikely that I will ever own a (genuine) Chanel handbag. However, a Chanel nail polish was definitely attainable. Whilst they are ridiculously expensive compared with most other nail polishes (AU39), they are still much more affordable than the AU1,000,000,000 a handbag costs (or so I estimate as I have never actually priced one). After seeing swatches of Peridot online, I knew that baby would one day be mine. The other two polishes in the collection - Quartz and Graphite - did not excite me the way Peridot did. That was until I read this review of Graphite on the Polish Police. Suddenly, Graphite was on my radar. It was stuck in my head like an ear worm; another baby, soon to be adopted. I argued with myself for about a month on whether to get these polishes or not. Could I really spend nearly 80 on nail polish. It did seem rather excessive to me. Then, Myers sent me a 10 voucher for my birthday and I got a 30 voucher for doing a survey so the decision was made. For 38 of my own money (less than the cost of two OPI's!) I became the proud owner of Peridot and Graphite. Here is my review of Graphite. Graphite is the most stunningly intriguing nail polish I have ever owned. In the bottle it looks a little bit dull and boring - grey and bland. But on the nail it is completely different. In some lights it is silvery, others a more gun metal grey, and in others it has almost a goldish tone to it. It is super sparkly, yet is not a glitter polish - though in saying that it appears more glitter than shimmer. It is quite opaque. Two coats and you can't see the nail line. In the photos below I have actually applied three coats (plus an addition two top coats of clear) because I was going to a wedding and I wanted it to be perfect. But ordinarily two would be sufficient. Question: How long did the writer argue with herself about whether to buy the Chanel nail polishes?

Consequently, the three universities never received my letters, resulting in dire consequences for my applications as the deadlines had passed with no communication from my end. This unforeseen obstacle was due to a combination of factors impacting the postal service during that time. Major staff shortages, reduced working hours, and inadequate infrastructure to accommodate the sudden increase in online shopping and other deliveries led to an overwhelming amount of parcels and letters awaiting dispatch. In addition, there had been a series of natural disasters, including storms and floods, that significantly affected the logistics and transport routes used by the postal system. Considering the exigent circumstances, I decided to take proactive measures to rectify the situation. I contacted the admission offices of the three universities via email, explaining the unfortunate delay of my letters and providing them with digital copies of the documents as proof. I also reached out to the postal service to inquire about the possibility of tracking and retrieving the original letters, although I knew the chances of success were slim. While waiting for a response from both the universities and the postal service, I meticulously reviewed my applications and gathered any additional documentation and references I could provide to bolster my case. I was determined to showcase my commitment and genuine interest in gaining admission to these academic institutions, despite the challenges I faced. Eventually, I received replies from the university admission offices. Two of them were understanding of the circumstances and appreciated the efforts I had taken. They agreed to accept the digital copies of my documents and waived the requirement of receiving the physical letters. However, they also noted that my application would be subject to further review and that a final decision would only be made after considering the overall availability of seats and other candidates' qualifications. The third university, unfortunately, had a strict policy regarding the submission of applications, and despite acknowledging the situation, they were unable to process my application further due to the missed deadline. I was disappointed, but I respected their decision and appreciated the feedback they provided. With the support and guidance of my family and friends, I decided to focus my energy on the remaining two universities, preparing myself for the possibility of interviews or additional assessments. I continued my efforts to track the lost letters through the postal service, hoping that they may eventually reach their destinations and serve as a testament to my resilience in the face of adversity. In the end, the valuable lessons I learned from this experience—adaptability, persistence, and proactive problem-solving—have shaped me into a stronger and more determined individual, fully prepared for the challenges I may face in my academic journey and beyond."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Laura took a deep breath and placed a comforting hand on Patricia's shoulder, who was standing close to her mother's casket, tears streaming freely down her cheeks. \\"Patricia, I can't even begin to express how truly sorry I am for the loss of your dear mother. She was a remarkable woman, full of grace, kindness, and warmth. We all feel the void that such a great soul has left behind,\\" Laura whispered, her voice filled with sincerity. Patricia gazed back at Laura, her eyes brimming with gratitude and sorrow as she responded, \\"Thank you, Laura. Your words mean so much to me. My mother always spoke highly of you, and I know that she considered you as part of our family.\\" As they stood there, immersed in the emotional ceremony, Laura remembered the time she had first met Patricia's mother. It was a sunny summer day when the two young girls – Laura and Patricia – had organized a lemonade stand. Patricia's mother came out, her radiant smile lighting up her face as she encouraged the girls and offered them homemade cookies to sell alongside the lemonade. That was when their friendship had truly blossomed, and Laura realized that Patricia's mother had a heart of gold. Years passed, and Laura and Patricia remained closest friends, as did their families. They shared many memories and supported each other through every challenge that life threw at them. Patricia's mother had been there for Laura when she lost her grandmother, a constant source of love and wisdom that guided her through one of the darkest periods of her life. As the priest continued the eulogy, Laura couldn't help but think about all the love and lessons that Patricia's mother had imparted to them. She knew that her spirit would continue to live on within every person's heart that she had touched over the years. Once the service ended, Laura and Patricia stood by the graveside, locked in a tight embrace as they watched the casket being lowered into the damp earth. The skies remained grey and overcast, as if heaven itself was grieving the loss. Patricia's father held onto his daughter, attempting to remain the pillar of strength for the family whilst tears betrayed his feelings, flowing silently down his face. Over the next few weeks, Laura made a point to visit Patricia often, offering her ongoing support as her friend navigated through this profound loss. They spent evenings reminiscing about Patricia's mother, sharing stories, and chuckling through their tears as they remembered her beautiful quirks and endless love. Through their shared grief, Laura and Patricia's bond deepened, becoming an unshakeable connection forged by the love of the remarkable woman they had both lost. As they continued to heal, they understood that Patricia's mother would always be a part of their lives, her spirit forever interwoven with their own. And so, the story of Laura, Patricia, and the love of an extraordinary woman went on – for love, they learned, was truly eternal, transcending even the boundaries of time and death to keep them connected and guiding them in the most difficult times, always and forever."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Die Gewährung von Exportkreditgarantien stellt eine wichtige Rolle im internationalen Handel dar, indem sie dazu beiträgt, Risiken bei grenzüberschreitenden Geschäften zu mindern und Exporteure in die Lage versetzt, ihre Geschäfte in volatilen Wirtschaftsräumen abzusichern. Das G8-Treffen in Köln im Jahr 1999 rief dazu auf, dass die Organisation für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (OECD) einen Prozess einleitet, um gemeinsame Standards für die Vergabe dieser Kredite zu entwickeln. Diese Standards sollen dazu beitragen, den internationalen Handel zu fördern und gleichzeitig nachhaltige Entwicklungsziele zu unterstützen. Im Kontext des Ilisu-Staudamms in der Türkei hat die Frage der Exportkreditgarantien eine besondere Dimension angenommen. Der Bau dieses Staudamms ist sowohl politisch als auch ökologisch umstritten und hat erhebliche Auswirkungen auf die Umwelt und die lokale Bevölkerung. Die Finanzierung des Projekts hängt unter anderem von der Bereitschaft der Industrieländer ab, Exportkreditgarantien für die am Bau beteiligten Unternehmen bereitzustellen. Ein solches Vorgehen wirft jedoch verschiedene Fragen auf, unter anderem in Bezug auf die Umweltverträglichkeit des Projekts, die Respektierung der Rechte der von Umsiedlungen betroffenen Menschen und die Einhaltung internationaler Standards für große Staudammprojekte.

In her grief, she and Samuel travel by train to visit Rachel's sister, which takes them into the city of Philadelphia. Samuel is amazed by the sights in the big city. While waiting for a connecting train at the 30th Street Station, Samuel goes into the men's room and witnesses two men attack and murder a third (Carhart), narrowly escaping detection as he hides in the bathroom stalls. Detective John Book (Ford) is assigned to the case and he and his partner, Sergeant Elton Carter (Jennings), question Samuel. It turns out the victim was an undercover police officer. Samuel is unable to identify the lone perpetrator whose face he saw in the bathroom from a number of mug shots or a police lineup. However, as Samuel walks around the police station, he notices a newspaper clipping in a display case in which narcotics officer James McFee (Glover) is honored for his exemplary service in the line of duty. Book sees Samuel point to the picture and quickly covers over his hand. John remembers that McFee was previously responsible for a drug raid on expensive chemicals used to make amphetamines, but the evidence had mysteriously disappeared. John confides his suspicions to his superior officer, Chief Paul Schaeffer (Sommer), who advises John to keep the case secret so they can work out how to move forward. But John is later ambushed in a parking garage and badly wounded by McFee. Since only Schaeffer knew of John's suspicions, John realizes Schaeffer must have tipped McFee off, and is also corrupt. John calls Carter and orders him to remove the Lapp file from the records. He then hides his car and uses his sister's car to return Rachel and Samuel to Lancaster County. While attempting to return to the city, John passes out in the vehicle in front of their farm. Rachel argues that taking John to a hospital would allow the corrupt police officers...

Given the following context:  Michael Joseph Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana, near Chicago, on August 29, 1958. He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah's Witness. His father, Joseph Walter \\"Joe\\" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income. His father's great-grandfather, July \\"Jack\\" Gale, was a Native American medicine man and US Army scout. Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy). A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael; Michael said his father told him he had a \\"fat nose\\", and regularly physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to physically punish any mistakes. Katherine Jackson stated that although whipping is considered abuse in more modern times, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon have said that their father was not abusive and that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 1993, Jackson said that his youth had been lonely and isolating.In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine.

Turkish state TV channel TRT reported the deaths and several injuries on its website, and blamed the attack on terrorists. One of those killed was a passerby. It was unclear if the attack caused more casualties. Many ambulances were sent to the scene in central Tunceli, the semiofficial Anatolia news agency reported. An official with the Tunceli governor's office, who was not identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media, told CNN that the office was not yet able to confirm the number of dead or injured. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. However, suspicion within Turkey is likely to fall on Kurdish militants. Tunceli province is a predominantly Kurdish region where frequent clashes have occurred between the Turkish military and fighters from the militant Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK. The International Crisis Group said in a report last week that Turkey's long-simmering war with the Kurdish insurgency had escalated, raising casualties to a level not seen in more than a decade. More than 700 people have been killed in the past 14 months, according to the conflict resolution organization that has extensively researched Turkey's war with the PKK.

At this point, we are unsure why this action could not be carried out. 2. \\"because *it*\\" — Here, the pronoun \\"it\\" is introduced as a substitute for a noun mentioned earlier in the sentence. In this context, the pronoun \\"it\\" helps us understand the reason why the action was not possible. 3. \\"was too high\\" — This portion of the sentence provides an explanation for the failed action. The shelf is at a height that makes it difficult or impossible to place the pot on it.

Context: Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend blog will know that I suffer from an extremely sensitive scalp which can be really itchy, and I have to be very careful what shampoo I use. I know that I’m sensitive to shampoos containing sodium laureth sulfate (also known as SLS, it’s the ingredient that makes shampoos, shower gels and soaps lather) but I’m also sensitive to some other ingredients in shampoos too – mainly fragrances. I had previously been using Rainforest Balance Shampoo and Conditioner from The Body Shop®, but I found the conditioner a bit too rich and my hair didn’t always feel totally clean after using it. So I started doing a bit of research into recommended natural shampoos – and this Sensitive Shampoo from Lavera kept coming up again and again! Several of the reviews I read said that this was the best shampoo for sensitive scalps and that it left hair feeling really clean and soft, so I decided to try it. The shampoo is a translucent peach-coloured gel that contains organic witch hazel and organic almond milk. It has quite a strong scent, but it’s a nice one so it doesn’t put me off. The shampoo feels creamy when you rub it together in your hands, but I did need quite a lot of it to get a good lather on my first application – the second application lathers a lot more easily. I definitely agree that this makes hair feel a lot cleaner than a lot of the other SLS-free shampoos that I’ve tried, my hair feels clean and full and soft when I’ve used it – the same way it would do if I were using a regular shampoo. I think it also helps my hair to dry more quickly and makes it easier to straighten too. But where this shampoo is outstanding is the way it makes my scalp feel – my scalp feels soothed and calm and there’s no hint of itching. I’ve been using Lavera Sensitive Shampoo for over a year now and I wouldn’t change it for the world, it’s definitely one of the best shampoos for a sensitive itchy scalp.

For casual music listening, a pair of bookshelf speakers would be more than enough. Those who desire a more intensive experience can upgrade to standing speakers. Surround sound systems are also a high-end option.  Subwoofers are additional speakers that add depth to bass, which is low tone. They’re good for movies and music with lower range such as rock and metal.  For adding general depth to TV and movies, a soundbar or soundbase is an option. These take up less space, require less wiring, and can be combined with a subwoofer. Wireless and wall-mounted speakers benefit from portability and offer new sound angles in your room. For gaming, small specialized speakers usually offer enough sound. These are placed on a desktop near the computer and have magnetic shielding. Different surfaces affect sound quality. Hard, flat surfaces reflect sound and soft or varying surfaces absorb sound. Sound is also easier to hear in a small room. To get a sense of the room, stand in the center and clap. The less the sound carries, the more powerful the speakers you’ll need. A small room such as a bedroom is fine with bookshelf speakers, but a large carpeted and furnished room benefits from bigger speakers. While bookshelf speakers will fit in a small bedroom, you wouldn’t want to try to fit wide standing speakers in there. The sound can overwhelm a small room even if it has lots of absorbent furnishings. On the other hand, if you want a surround sound system for your television, the speakers need space away from the wall and surround you.  Where you’ll put the speakers matters. Speakers inside a cabinet, for instance, can get muffled, but so do speakers in room corners since the sound is distorted by the walls. Speakers benefit from being three to four feet away from the sound source. This helps them project sound into the room. Try to keep your speakers around ear-level. At that level, the sound will be clearest to you. It’s very easy to fall into a price tag trap. You’ll see bigger and better-looking speakers or a salesperson will refer you to them even though quality isn’t completely related to price. A cheaper speaker may work better for you than a more expensive one. Stick to your budget as much as possible. Once you’ve decided on the type of speaker you need, go online or shop around in stores to compare prices. Determine how much you’re willing to pay for the kind of speaker that seems right for you.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Continue reading the main story Related Stories      UK scientists have detected a huge dome of fresh water that is developing in the western Arctic Ocean.      The bulge is some 8,000 cubic km in size and has risen by about 15cm since 2002.      The team thinks it may be the result of strong winds whipping up a great clockwise current in the northern polar region called the Beaufort Gyre.      This would force the water together, raising sea surface height, the group tells the journal Nature Geoscience.      \\"In the western Arctic, the Beaufort Gyre is driven by a permanent anti-cyclonic wind circulation. It drives the water, forcing it to pile up in the centre of the gyre, and this domes the sea surface,\\" explained lead author Dr Katharine Giles from the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM) at University College London.      Arctic summers have seen a decline in both ice extent and thickness      \\"In our data, we see the trend being biggest in the centre of the gyre and less around the edges,\\" she told BBC News.      Dr Giles and colleagues made their discovery using radar satellites belonging to the European Space Agency (Esa).      These spacecraft can measure sea-surface height even when there is widespread ice cover because they are adept at picking out the cracks, or leads, that frequently appear in the frozen floes.      The data (1995-2010) indicates a significant swelling of water in the Beaufort Gyre, particularly since the early part of the 2000s. The rising trend has been running at 2cm per year.      Model prediction      A lot of research from buoys and other in-situ sampling had already indicated that water in this region of the Arctic had been freshening.      This fresh water is coming in large part from the rivers running off the Eurasian (Russian) side of the Arctic basin.      Winds and currents have transported this fresh water around the ocean until it has been pulled into the gyre. The volume currently held in the circulation probably represents about 10% of all the fresh water in the Arctic.      Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.      Of interest to future observations is what might happen if the anticyclonic winds, which have been whipping up the bulge, change behaviour.      \\"What we have seen occurring is precisely what the climate models had predicted,\\" said Dr Giles.      \\"When you have clockwise rotation - the fresh water is stored. If the wind goes the other way - and that has happened in the past - then the fresh water can be pushed to the margins of the Arctic Ocean.      \\"If the spin-up starts to spin down, the fresh water could be released. It could go to the rest of the Arctic Ocean or even leave the Arctic Ocean.\\"      If the fresh water were to enter the North Atlantic in large volumes, the concern would be that it might disturb the currents that have such a great influence on European weather patterns. These currents draw warm waters up from the tropics, maintaining milder temperatures in winter than would ordinarily be expected at northern European latitudes.      Cracks, or leads, in the ice provide vertical surfaces against which the wind can push      The creation of the Beaufort Gyre bulge is not a continuous development throughout the 15-year data-set, and only becomes a dominant feature in the latter half of the study period.      This may indicate a change in the relationship between the wind and the ocean in the Arctic brought about by the recent rapid decline in sea-ice cover, the CPOM team argues in its Nature Geoscience paper.      It is possible that the wind is now imparting momentum to the water in ways that were not possible when the sea-ice was thicker and more extensive.      \\"The ice is now much freer to move around,\\" said Dr Giles.      Cryosat-2: Esa's newest radar satellite is dedicated to studying the polar regions      \\"So, as the wind acts on the ice, it's able to pull the water around with it. Depending on how ridged the surface of ice is or how smooth the bottom of the ice is - this will all affect the drag on the water. If you have more leads, this also might provide more vertical ice surfaces for the wind to blow against.\\"      One consequence of less sea-ice in the region is the possibility that winds could now initiate greater mixing of the different layers in the Arctic Ocean.      Scientists are aware that there is a lot of warm water at depth.      At present, this deep water's energy is unable to influence the sea-ice because of a buffer of colder, less dense water lying between it and the floes above.      But if this warm water were made to well up because of wind-driven changes at the surface, it could further accelerate the loss of seasonal ice cover.      The CPOM team is now investigating the likelihood of this happening with Cryosat-2, Esa's first radar satellite dedicated to the study of the polar regions.      \\"We now have the means to measure not only the ice thickness but also to monitor how the ocean under the ice is changing,\\" says Dr Seymour Laxon, director of CPOM and co-author of the study, \\"and with CryoSat-2, we can now do so over the entire Arctic Ocean.\\"      Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter ||||| SHARE: Adjust text size:            Sea surface in a particular area of the Arctic Ocean has increased by as much as 15 centimeters (6 inches) over the past 15 years, leading to the formation of a large bulge of freshwater. It is estimated that this region of the ocean contains as much as 8,000 cubic kilometers (1,919 cubic miles) of water.            According to the results of a new study, which appears in the latest online issue of the top journal Nature Geoscience, it would appear that the bulge is being caused by an acceleration of the Beaufort Gyre, an oceanic circulation pattern driven by Arctic winds.            What this implies is that a change in this wind could allow this dome to fall apart, and all the freshwater it contains to spill in the northern sectors of the Atlantic Ocean. This is where the North Atlantic Drift – one of the five major oceanic currents – releases heat from the water            That heat is then moved eastwards by prevailing winds, heating up the majority of the European continent.

It is believed that this increase might be due to strong winds causing a clockwise current in the northern polar region called the Beaufort Gyre. The researchers think that this is driving the water, forcing it to pile up in the gyre's center, which domes the sea surface. The findings were made using radar satellites from the European Space Agency (ESA), and scientists warn that if the anticyclonic winds (which have caused the bulge) change behavior, the fresh water could be released, possibly to the rest of the Arctic Ocean or could even leave the Arctic Ocean entirely. This could potentially disturb currents influencing European weather patterns and could accelerate the loss of seasonal ice cover."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A: Possible answers: a). molecular spectrum; b). radio spectrum; c). phenomena spectrum; d). electromagnetic spectrum; Answer:","output":"d). Electromagnetic spectrum. Visible light is the narrow segment of the electromagnetic spectrum to which the normal human eye responds. The electromagnetic spectrum is a continuum of different types of electromagnetic radiation, which includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. These forms of electromagnetic radiation differ in their wavelengths, frequencies, and energy levels. Visible light, specifically, falls in the wavelength range of approximately 380 nanometers (nm) to 750 nm. Within this narrow range, the human eye can perceive a range of colors, with the shorter wavelengths corresponding to violet and the longer wavelengths corresponding to red. The visible light spectrum is responsible for allowing us to perceive the world in color and forms the basis for our sense of sight. The electromagnetic spectrum is a foundational concept in physics and underlies many aspects of modern technology. For instance, radio waves are used for wireless communication, microwaves for cooking, infrared for thermal imaging, ultraviolet for sterilization, X-rays for medical imaging, and gamma rays for cancer treatment. Each type of electromagnetic radiation has unique properties and applications based on its specific wavelength, frequency, and energy level. It is important to note that the human eye is sensitive only to a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum - the visible light segment. Other organisms may perceive light differently, with some animals being able to see additional types of radiation, such as ultraviolet or infrared. However, for humans, visible light provides essential information about the world around us, facilitating countless aspects of our daily life, communication, and survival."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"Nuns, who are the female members of religious orders within the Catholic Church, have a diverse range of duties and roles that they are allowed to perform. These duties vary depending on the specific religious order they belong to and their individual skills, talents, and interests. Here are some of the primary duties and areas of involvement for nuns: 1. Prayer and worship: Nuns devote a significant portion of their day to communal and personal prayers, meditation, and worship. They often follow a structured daily schedule, known as the Liturgy of the Hours, which includes regular prayers throughout the day. 2. Education: Many nuns work as teachers in Catholic schools, providing religious and general education to students of all ages. They might also be involved in adult education and faith formation, teaching catechism classes, or leading Bible studies. 3. Healthcare: Nuns may serve as nurses, doctors, or other healthcare professionals in hospitals, nursing homes, and clinics, often providing medical care to underserved communities or in developing countries. 4. Social work and charitable activities: Nuns often work with the poor, homeless, and marginalized members of society, providing food, shelter, clothing, and other necessities. They may also work with refugees, orphans, and vulnerable populations, offering counseling, spiritual guidance, and advocacy. 5. Administration: Nuns can hold leadership positions within their religious order, managing the day-to-day operations, finances, and resources. They might also be responsible for coordinating and organizing community events, retreats, and outreach programs. 6. Pastoral care: Some nuns act as spiritual directors, offering guidance and support to individuals seeking to deepen their faith or discern their vocation. They may also provide emotional and spiritual support to the sick, elderly, or those in prison, visiting them regularly and offering prayers and companionship. 7. Missionary work: Many religious orders have an international focus, sending nuns to serve in different countries, often in remote and challenging conditions. These missionaries can be involved in evangelization, education, healthcare, social work, or other forms of service to the local community.

Earth-imaging satellites the size of vans have long circled the globe, but those cost millions of dollars each to build and launch, in part because of their weight and specialized hardware. The new satellites, with some of the same off-the-shelf miniaturized technology that has made smartphones and laptops so powerful, will be far less expensive. The view from high up is rich in untapped data, said Paul Saffo, a forecaster and essayist. He expects the new satellite services to find many customers. Insurance companies, for example, could use the satellitesâ âbeforeâ and âafterâ views to monitor insured property and validate claims after a disaster. Businesses that update online maps for geologists, city planners or disaster relief officials could be customers, too. The images could also be used to monitor problems like deforestation, melting icecaps and overfishing. And food companies and commodities traders could use the images to keep track of crops and agricultural yields all over the planet, Mr. Saffo predicted. But the images are also likely to be viewed as the latest mixed blessing by people already apprehensive of Big Brother-like surveillance in their lives. First into space in the microsatellite business will be the San Francisco company Planet Labs, which plans to launch a fleet of 28 small satellites at the end of the year that will photograph the planet around the clock, with frequent updates. The company has already sent up two trial satellites for test runs, and will dispatch the entire set, called Flock-1, in December, said Will Marshall, a co-founder of the company and a former NASA scientist. The Planet Labsâ satellites wonât be able to distinguish your face or read your license plate â the cameras donât have that level of resolution. But the frequency with which images can be updated could raise privacy questions, said Timothy Edgar, a visiting fellow at the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University and a former director of privacy and civil liberties in the Obama administration. Mr. Edgar contrasted the satellite images with those provided by Google Earth â the ones that people zoom in on to see, for example, an aerial view of their homes.âThatâs just an image of your house that was probably taken a few years ago,â he said. âIt may feel like you are being watched, but you arenât. Itâs just a static picture thatâs most likely several years old.â But a satellite that regularly passes over your cabin deep in the woods and photographs a car that is sometimes parked there â and sometimes not â has different ramifications. âIt can show a pattern, for example, when you appear to be at home and when youâre away,â he said. Planet Labsâ technology, like that at other microsatellite companies such as Skybox Imaging, are benefiting from the progressive miniaturization of consumer electronic components, along with a federal effort to commercialize space. âWhat we are seeing are smaller satellites that have similar capabilities to much larger, traditional satellites,â said Glenn Lightsey, a professor at the University of Texas who founded and directs the Texas Spacecraft Lab there. âSince putting a satellite in orbit is a function of its size, these new satellites are able to get into orbit at a much lower cost,â he said. The lightweight satellites have another advantage: the companies donât have to spend millions of dollars for a rocket to get them into space. Instead, they can hitch a ride as a secondary payload on a rocket already making the trip. Planet Labs will send its satellites on an Antares rocket when it heads out on a cargo transportation flight to the International Space Station. Investors have flocked to the new satellite companies, though neither Planet Labs nor Skybox Imaging has disclosed what it will charge customers. Planet Labs has obtained 13.1 million in funding, led by Steve Jurvetson, managing director of Draper Fisher Jurvetson. Other backers include OâReilly AlphaTech Ventures, Data Collective and First Round Capital. Five ground stations will receive the Planet Labs imagery as the satellites pass overhead. Dr. Marshall would not disclose how often the satellites would pass the same spot. âThe point is that by putting up lots of satellites, we can image the whole Earth on a much more frequent basis,â he said. Skybox Imaging, in Mountain View, Calif., aims to provide sharply detailed images as well as high-definition video with its satellites. The company, which has raised about 91 million, expects to put its SkySat-1 and SkySat-2 satellites into orbit later this year, said Dan Berkenstock, a co-founder, and then follow with a group totaling 24 satellites. Customers will be able to buy images or an appliance to download information directly from the satellite. âThey can log onto our satellite and ask it to take pictures,â he said. Â Japan Space Imaging, a subsidiary of the Mitsubishi Corporation, recently signed a contract with Skybox allowing it to directly downlink imagery for agricultural and maritime monitoring as well as for disaster response. Microsatellite services promise a new, accessible way to monitor global changes such as crop growth, said Anthony Janetos, director of Boston Universityâs Pardee Center for the Study of the Longer-Range Future. âYou canât understand these forces if you canât measure them,â he said. âThese services will be useful in gathering those measurements.â The new satellites are yet another stage in the expansion of the human view aided by powerful cameras and digital communication, said Mitchell Stephens, a journalism professor at New York University and author of âThe Rise of the Image, the Fall of the Word.â This change has pluses and minuses, he observed. People who try to build a private hideaway in the woods might come to realize that it isnât so private. But such images could also spot illegal logging in remote spots. âNow we can have a Godlike view, looking down from the heavens,â he said. âI can understand why people would be nervous. But the cameras can make the world more transparent and open. Iâm for that.â Title:","output":"\\"Revolutionizing Earth Observation: Affordable Microsatellites and Their Wide-Ranging Applications\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

CLOSE President Donald Trump said Monday a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will happen \\"in the not too distant future.\\" He also said he will meet Thursday with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to determine \\"what's going on.\\" (Sept. 24) AP      President Donald Trump speaks during a signing ceremony for the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement at the Lotte New York Palace hotel during the United Nations General Assembly, Monday, Sept. 24, 2018, in New York. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) ORG XMIT: NYEV130 (Photo: AP)      NEW YORK – President Donald Trump blamed Iranian leaders for sowing \\"chaos, death and destruction\\" in a steely speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday that heavily emphasized the president's support of national sovereignty over globalism.      Touting his meeting this year with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and blasting Iran for spreading mayhem in the Middle East, Trump offered an impassioned defense of a foreign policy doctrine he said would allow countries to shrug off \\"global governance.\\"      \\"We reject the ideology of globalism, and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism,\\" Trump said. \\"We will never surrender America’s sovereignty to an unelected, unaccountable, global bureaucracy.\\"      Lobbing criticism at a bevy of international institutions, Trump called the U.N. human rights council \\"a grave embarrassment to this institution\\" and said the International Criminal Court \\"has no jurisdiction, no legitimacy and no authority.\\" He celebrated some of his most divisive foreign policy decisions, including his crackdown on immigration and his recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.      The \\"America first\\" remarks drew on a similar speech he delivered at the United Nations last year but included more detailed examples of how that vision informs his policies on trade, immigration and the world's hot spots.      Though Trump reserved his harshest language for Iran, he did not shy away from condemning other countries by name. He jabbed China for what he said were unfair trade policies. And he announced sanctions against Venezuelan leaders and blasted the government of its president, Nicolas Maduro, saying his socialist policies have \\"bankrupted the oil-rich nation and driven its people into abject poverty.\\"      Trump suggested he would sharply curtail U.S. foreign aid, saying he ordered a review by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of whether countries that receive American assistance are allies with shared values.      \\"We are only going to give foreign aid to those who respect us and, frankly, are our friends,\\" Trump said. \\"And we expect other countries to pay their fair share for the cost of their defense.\\"      In an awkward moment, minutes into his speech, the delegates in the chamber laughed at a regular talking point from the president. Trump said his administration had accomplished more than any other in U.S. history, prompting the reaction from the General Assembly hall.      More: Trump's boast at the United Nations prompts laughter from world leaders and ridicule on Twitter      “So true,” Trump said. “I didn’t expect that reaction, but that’s OK.”      Trump’s boast drew ridicule from his critics on Twitter. “Preposterous,” tweeted Nicholas Burns, a longtime diplomat who served in the Bush and Clinton administrations.      Trump's remarks were buffeted by warnings from other world leaders that America's pullback from international institutions was ill-conceived and even dangerous.      French President Emmanuel Macron delivered a passionate defense of multilateralism, saying it was the only way to stave off instability and conflict across the globe. He rebuked Trump’s message, suggesting that “brandishing sovereignty” was a way of attacking others.      In the absence of a strong American commitment to preserving the international order, Macron suggested, France and other European countries could step into the void, leading the charge against urgent global threats, such as climate change, poverty and inequality.      “Do not accept the erosion of multilateralism. Don’t accept our history unraveling,\\" Macron said to a receptive audience.      Macron focused on climate change as an issue that demanded “global mobilization” from other developed countries after Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, which aims to curb global warming by gradually reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.      “The Paris agreement has stayed intact, and that is because we have decided to stay unified in spite of the U.S. decision to withdraw. This is power,” Macron said. “Let’s stop signing trade agreements with those who don’t comply with the Paris agreement,” he added, outlining a strategy that would isolate the United States.      Macron had company in offering a sharp contrast to Trump's address. Speaking before Trump arrived at the podium, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres lamented the rise of populism and a fraying of international cooperation – trends the U.S. president has fueled.      “Multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most,” Guterres declared.

Divisions in our Security Council are stark.”      Guterres said the world risks consequences if leaders do not act quickly on the problem of climate change.      \\"There is no way forward but collective, common-sense action for the common good,\\" he said.

He insisted his focus on American \\"sovereignty\\" has paid off, helping to foster both peace and prosperity.      \\"The United States will not tell you how to live or work or worship,\\" Trump told the international assembly. \\"We only ask that you honor our sovereignty in return.\\"      Tensions with North Korea have eased since last year's General Assembly, when Trump called North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \\"rocket man\\" and threatened to \\"totally destroy\\" the country if it threatened the U.S. or its allies.      On Tuesday, Trump touted \\"tremendous progress\\" in his negotiations with Kim, even though the North Korean leader has so far taken few concrete steps to eliminate his country's illicit nuclear program.      While the president's approach to North Korea has softened, his attitude toward Iran has not.      \\"Iran's leaders sow chaos, death and destruction,\\" Trump said. \\"They do not respect their neighbors or borders or the sovereign rights of nations.\\"      Since withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, the U.S. has reimposed sanctions on the regime, and Trump is urging reluctant partners to do the same.      \\"We ask all nations to isolate Iran's regime as long as its aggression continues,\\" Trump said. \\"And we ask all nations to support Iran's people as they struggle to reclaim their religious and righteous destiny.\\"      Other countries have been hesitant to join Trump in abandoning the nuclear deal, noting that Iran continues to abide by the terms of the agreement.      Iran's behavior will also be a major focus Wednesday when Trump leads a meeting of the U.N. Security Council.      Trump defended his aggressive use of tariffs, against not only China but also close allies like Canada and the European Union.      \\"We believe that trade must be fair and reciprocal,\\" Trump said. \\"We will not allow our workers to be victimized, our companies to be cheated, and our wealth to be plundered and transferred.\\"      The international community has reacted warily to the president who seems determined to unwind the world order that his predecessors spent decades building.      \\"We reject the ideology of globalism,\\" Trump said. \\"And we embrace the doctrine of patriotism.\\"      He has bucked international convention by relocating the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, slashing aid to the Palestinians, and dramatically reducing the number of refugees the U.S. admits from other countries.      \\"Ultimately, the only long-term solution to the migration crisis is to help people build more hopeful futures in their home countries,\\" Trump said.      The president blasted OPEC for high oil prices, announced new sanctions against Venezuela, and warned the U.S. will withhold aid from countries that challenge his agenda.      \\"Moving forward, we are only going to give foreign aid to those who respect us and frankly, are our friends,\\" Trump said. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"President Trump addressed the United Nations General Assembly on September 25th, pushing his \\"America first\\" policy and emphasizing his support for national sovereignty over global institutions.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: I learned about life from an ant farm. When I was seven years old, my family created one. First, we put clean sand in a thin glass box and put the ants into it. Soon they got to work making tunnels. I was amazed that each one knew exactly what to do. With my mom's help, I kept a record of what happened each day and named the ants. One day when I had put my face close to the structure (building), accidentally I knocked it over, and all the tunnels fell in. Although the ants survived their earthquake, one by one they began to die. I was frightened as I watched them give up their tunnel-building to carry the bodies to a corner of the farm. My mother reported that the ants were dying of \\"frustration  \\". They simply could not stand the reality that their tunnels had been destroyed. Although much time has passed, I still think of that ant farm. Over the years, I came to realize the ants have the spirit of teamwork. Working together, they were able to create an amazing world for themselves. I also learned that they should be admired for their hard work. Day in and day out, each worked at their task. The ant farm showed that teamwork and perseverance   are indeed the keys to success. But there was an even larger lesson that I did not realize until recently --Adversity   is a natural part of life, and must be accepted. Unlike the ants, humans cannot give up when they face disappointment. So I try to live my life like those hardworking ants. But, unlike them, I try not to let frustration defeat   me. I will have to keep building my tunnels. Question: Which of the following is NOT the lesson from the ant farm? Options: A: The ants have the spirit of teamwork.

Turning a Miniature Into a Lightweight Samsung's Q1 might seem like an impressive piece of laptop engineering -- it weighs just under two pounds, light enough to carry around full-time. But the company had to sacrifice a few things to reach that weight: a keyboard. A CD or DVD drive. A screen big enough to display everyday Windows programs properly. Acceptable battery life. And, as a result, any justification for this device's existence. The 1,100 Q1 is the first product designed to Microsoft's \\"Ultra-Mobile PC\\" template ( http://www.microsoft.com/umpc ); it's also been called an \\"Origami\\" device, after the code name Microsoft used before its unveiling in March. The concept represents Microsoft's attempt to solve two long-standing problems: the weight and size of most laptop computers and the irrelevance of the company's Windows XP Tablet PC Edition to most consumers. An Ultra-Mobile PC such as the Samsung Q1 runs on the Tablet software, which replaces a mouse with a touch-sensitive display and lets you enter text by writing on that screen. It includes WiFi wireless networking and Bluetooth wireless connections to peripherals such as printers and handheld devices. It has a screen no bigger than seven inches across and should weigh two pounds or less. The Q1 weighs in at just 1 pound, 11 ounces -- although its power brick and the padded carrying case to protect its exposed screen add about another pound. It's about the size of a hardcover novel, with a seven-inch widescreen LCD framed by a handful of buttons and, on the review unit, a bright orange sticker with the excitable motto: \\"Always Being Connected!!!\\" There is no keyboard (although its two USB ports and Bluetooth wireless can accept an external model). Instead, text is entered using various touch-based methods. One on-screen keyboard requires tapping keys with a stylus but \\"only\\" blocks the bottom fourth of the screen. Another has keys big enough to hit with your thumbs but it covers most of each side of the screen. Or you can write letters and numbers into an input palette that occupies as much real estate as the first keyboard but, in my experience, worked slower. In Microsoft's Windows Journal note-taking program, you can write anywhere on the screen -- but your handwriting isn't converted to text automatically, making these files impractical to share with other people. You're also liable to scramble your input every time you brush the screen with the knuckles of your stylus-wielding hand. The tested Q1 arrived with almost no third-party software; a copy of Microsoft Office and last year's version of Norton AntiVirus were the only notable additions. The copy of Windows Media Player included an extra \\"skin\\" for that program, with large buttons meant to be selected with a thumb (should you want to employ something the size of two Walkmen duct-taped together as an MP3 player). Adding to that set of programs will be difficult, as the Q1 lacks a CD or DVD drive. You'll have to buy an external model or use another computer to copy the contents of an installer CD to a flash memory card. (Samsung chose that format even though its cameras and camcorders -- along with most other vendors' devices -- use smaller secure digital memory cards.) Either way, the review unit's almost 36-gigabyte hard drive, smaller than that of many MP3 players and quickly eaten away by the basic Microsoft programs that make the device run, doesn't offer much room to install extra software. The Q1's screen represents an even greater impediment to using this thing as an everyday Windows machine. Not only is it far smaller than almost every other laptop's display, its low resolution -- a scant 800 by 480 pixels -- leaves most programs painfully cramped. Web pages required constant scrolling, Microsoft Outlook could only display 14 lines of an e-mail message, and buttons in most dialog boxes were either partially cut off by the bottom of the screen or hidden entirely. A button to the left of the screen can simulate a higher resolution, but at the cost of making text and images look unfocused and blurry. And even then, many Web pages assume a taller display.

He is tended by a nurse, Julie Benson, and they have fallen in love. Corey's military pal, Steve Connolly, arrives in early November to discuss plans for the ranch in Scottsdale, Arizona, they plan to purchase and operate together once Corey is out of the hospital. The two men pool their G.I. benefits (totaling 40,000) to do so. Corey's final surgery is in mid-December, but Connolly does not appear at the hospital afterward to see his friend. By Christmas, Corey is still in recovery but Connolly still remains absent. One night, as Corey lies semi-conscious in bed after being administered a sleeping drug, a woman with a Swedish accent appears at his  bedside. She says Connolly has been in a horrible accident; his spine is shattered and he wants to die, but she has refused to help him commit suicide. The woman asks Corey what to do, and he advises her to do nothing to harm Steve, and just to wait. Corey slips into unconsciousness, and the woman disappears. After New Year's Day, Corey is released from the hospital. He is immediately stopped by police detectives and then questioned by Captain Garcia of the Los Angeles Police, who tells him that Connolly is wanted for the murder of Solly Blayne, a local high-stakes gambler and racketeer murdered at his home in Los Feliz.

The incident occurred Sunday night. Deputies responded to a home in Thousand Oaks, CA ... someone reported domestic violence.      During the arrest she allegedly became combative and attacked a cop. As a result, she was also arrested on 3 counts of misdemeanor battery on an officer.      According to the 911 call, Heather's brother came to her home and saw Heather and her boyfriend fighting. The brother called 911. We're told cops observed that the boyfriend had a visible mark.      Law enforcement sources tell us when cops tried putting Heather in custody she became combative, flailing, kicking and struck 3 deputies. Heather was cuffed and taken to the hospital for evaluation.      The 56-year-old has had troubles in the past with substance abuse ... she has been arrested for DUI and had issues with prescription drugs.      Heather has had domestic violence issues in the past. In 2011, the LAPD was dispatched to Jack Wagner's home -- her then-boyfriend -- after the 2 allegedly got physical with each other during a heated argument. At the time a law enforcement source told us, \\"She lost it on him and he retaliated.\\" Neither wanted to press charges against the other.      Cops aren't saying who she allegedly attacked in the home.      Locklear is in the process of posting bail. ||||| Heather Locklear’s life took a soap-opera turn right out of “Melrose Place” over the weekend when she brawled with cops — kicking one in the groin and calling another a “c–t” — as they came to arrest her for “practically” biting off part of her beau’s nose, officials and reports said Monday.      The 56-year-old actress allegedly chomped on boyfriend Chris Heisser during a dust-up Sunday at her home in Thousand Oaks, Calif., the Daily Mail reported.      When officers spotted a mark on Heisser’s body, they decided to arrest her on domestic-violence charges, Ventura County Sheriff’s Office Capt. Garo Kuredjian told The Post.      “She claimed to be injured, but we didn’t see any sign of that,” he said. “We determined she had battered her boyfriend.”      But when four officers tried to cuff Locklear, who played a cop on the ’80s TV series “T.J. Hooker,” she flipped out and attacked them while screaming, “F–king a–holes,” a police source told the Mail.      Locklear punched two officers, called a female cop a “c- -t” and kicked a male officer in the groin — all in front of her 20-year-old daughter, Ava, the Mail reported.      “She was uncooperative and combative,” Kuredjian said.      Locklear was charged with a felony count of domestic violence and three counts of misdemeanor battery on a peace officer, according to police.      Less than an hour later, Heisser was arrested on a DUI charge, according to TMZ.      Heisser was pulled over for driving too slowly on Highway 101 and allegedly had a 0.20 blood alcohol level, TMZ reported.      She later posted 20,000 bail.      Locklear has struggled with substance abuse in the past, most recently returning to rehab for the fifth time last year.      She was previously married to Tommy Lee and Richie Sambora, with whom she shares one daughter. She also was romantically linked to David Spade, Mark Harmon and Scott Baio. ||||| The actress was booked into the Ventura County jail.      Heather Locklear was arrested Sunday night on suspicion of domestic violence and assault on an officer, Capt. Dean Cook of the Thousand Oaks Police Department told The Hollywood Reporter.      Few details were available, but Cook said the one count of domestic violence was a felony and the three counts of battery of emergency personnel were misdemeanors.      Locklear was booked into the Ventura County jail. She is no longer in custody, Cook said.      A rep for the Melrose Place star did not immediately return a request for comment. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Actress Heather Locklear was arrested on Sunday night for felony domestic violence and battery on a police officer.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: You can set better goals for your child if you have an idea of what they are facing. Check out books and websites supported by recognized medical organizations. Talk to your child’s doctor about the typical symptoms of CP, and ask how those symptoms might evolve as your child gets older. Common symptoms include:  Excessively stiff or loose muscles. Tremors. Lack of coordination. Involuntary movements, or movements that are too slow or too fast. Difficulty with gross motor skills (such as crawling or walking) and fine motor skills (such as picking up and manipulating small objects). Delays in motor development. Difficulty with speaking and eating. Seizures. Some children may experience additional neurological problems, such as intellectual disabilities, vision or hearing impairments, or mental health disorders. Depending on the type and severity of your child’s symptoms, they may be at risk for developing a variety of secondary conditions. Ask your child’s doctor about possible complications, and discuss ways to manage or prevent them. Some of the more common complications of CP include:  Problems with skeletal development (including joint deformities, dislocations, and osteoarthritis) due to excessively stiff muscles. Some people with CP are also especially prone to bone fractures. Malnutrition resulting from difficulties with eating or swallowing. Mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, related to the stress of dealing with CP symptoms. Lung diseases and breathing disorders. Imbalances in the eye muscles, leading to vision problems. You know your child better than anyone. Pay attention to what they struggle with and which therapies and coping strategies seem to work best for them. Take these insights into doctor’s appointments and meetings with other members of your child’s care team. For example, you might tell your child’s doctor, “I’ve noticed that Micah walks more easily when he’s listening to music, because he can time his steps with the beat. Can you refer me to someone who does music therapy for kids with CP?”","output":"To help your child with their goals, try to learn about what they are going through. Read books and look at websites that doctors say are good. Talk to your child's doctor about what usually happens to kids with CP and how it might change when they grow up. Some things that might happen are: having muscles that are too tight or too loose, shaking, not being able to move well, having a hard time with big movements (like crawling) and small movements (like picking up things), being slow to learn motor skills, having trouble talking and eating, and having seizures. Some kids might also have other problems with their brain, like trouble seeing or hearing, or feeling sad or worried. There can also be other problems caused by CP, like bones growing the wrong way, breaking easily, or not getting enough food because it’s hard to eat. Kids might also feel sad, have trouble breathing, or have problems with their eyes. You know your child best, so watch what they have a hard time with and what helps them. Tell their doctor and other helpers about these things. Maybe they can use music or other things to help your child get better."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  R.E.M. recorded the Chronic Town EP with Mitch Easter in October 1981, and planned to release it on a new indie label named Dasht Hopes. However, I.R.S. Records acquired a demo of the band's first recording session with Easter that had been circulating for months. The band turned down the advances of major label RCA Records in favor of I.R.S., with whom it signed a contract in May 1982. I.R.S. released Chronic Town that August as its first American release. A positive review of the EP by NME praised the songs' auras of mystery, and concluded, \\"R.E.M. ring true, and it's great to hear something as unforced and cunning as this.\\"I.R.S. first paired R.E.M. with producer Stephen Hague to record its debut album. Hague's emphasis on technical perfection left the band unsatisfied, and the band members asked the label to let them record with Easter. I.R.S. agreed to a \\"tryout\\" session, allowing the band to return to North Carolina and record the song \\"Pilgrimage\\" with Easter and producing partner Don Dixon. After hearing the track, I.R.S. permitted the group to record the album with Dixon and Easter. Because of its bad experience with Hague, the band recorded the album via a process of negation, refusing to incorporate rock music clichés such as guitar solos or then-popular synthesizers, in order to give its music a timeless feel. The completed album, Murmur, was greeted with critical acclaim upon its release in 1983, with Rolling Stone listing the album as its record of the year. The album reached number 36 on the Billboard album chart. A re-recorded version of \\"Radio Free Europe\\" was the album's lead single and reached number 78 on the Billboard singles chart in 1983. Despite the acclaim awarded the album, Murmur sold only about 200,000 copies, which I.R.S.'s Jay Boberg felt was below expectations.R.E.M. made its first national television appearance on Late Night with David Letterman in October 1983, during which the group performed a new, unnamed song. The piece, eventually titled \\"So.

As I mentioned in my previous post on Sacré-Coeur, one of the other places I didn’t get a chance to see when I was in Paris last summer was the catacombs so I wanted to be sure to fit in a visit this time around. Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€.

Although the Boston Center air traffic controller realized at an early stage that there was something wrong with American 11, he did not immediately interpret the plane's failure to respond as a sign that it had been hijacked. At 8:14, when the flight failed to heed his instruction to climb to 35,000 feet, the controller repeatedly tried to raise the flight. He reached out to the pilot on the emergency frequency. Though there was no response, he kept trying to contact the aircraft. At 8:21, American 11 turned off its transponder, immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft. The controller told his supervisor that he thought something was seriously wrong with the plane, although neither suspected a hijacking. The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a \\"no radio\\" aircraft. The controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American 11. He became even more concerned as its route changed, moving into another sector's airspace. Controllers immediately began to move aircraft out of its path, and asked other aircraft in the vicinity to look for American 11.

A Decepticon force, led by Soundwave, Starscream, and Shockwave, intercepts them during the evacuation, and Optimus sends Autobot scout B-127 to Earth on an escape pod in order to set up a base of operations where the Autobots can regroup. B-127 reaches Earth alone, crash-landing in California and disrupting a training exercise by Sector 7, a secret government agency that monitors extraterrestrial activity on Earth. Colonel Jack Burns presumes B-127 to be a hostile invader and pursues him. B-127 scans a Willys MB jeep and flees to a mine, where Blitzwing, a Decepticon Seeker, ambushes him. When B-127 refuses to reveal Optimus's whereabouts, Blitzwing tears out his voice box and damages his memory core; despite this, B-127 stabs and kills him with one of his own missiles. Before collapsing from his injuries, B-127 scans a nearby 1967 Volkswagen Beetle and transforms into a yellow one.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Nanjing: In the 1960s, the first Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was completed, and served as the only bridge crossing over the Lower Yangtze in eastern China at that time. The bridge was a source of pride and an important symbol of modern China, having been built and designed by the Chinese themselves following failed surveys by other nations and the reliance on and then rejection of Soviet expertise. Begun in 1960 and opened to traffic in 1968, the bridge is a two-tiered road and rail design spanning 4,600 metres on the upper deck, with approximately 1,580 metres spanning the river itself. Since then four more bridges and two tunnels have been built. Going in the downstream direction, the Yangtze crossings in Nanjing are: Dashengguan Bridge, Line 10 Metro Tunnel, Third Bridge, Nanjing Yangtze River Tunnel, First Bridge, Second Bridge and Fourth Bridge. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". What was the symbolism of the bridge?","output":"The symbolism of the first Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was that it served as an important symbol of modern China, representing national pride and self-reliance. It signified China's ability to build and design such a monumental structure by themselves, without relying on foreign expertise, following failed surveys by other nations and the rejection of Soviet assistance.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the question below:   The Moon has more or less effect on the tides than Mars?    Assuming that:  The Moon has a greater effect on the tides because, although it is much smaller than the Sun, it is much closer. A:","output":"A: The Moon has a greater effect on Earth's tides than Mars due to its relatively larger size, mass, and closer proximity to our planet compared to Mars. Tides on Earth are primarily governed by the gravitational pull from the Moon and the Sun. The Moon has a more significant impact on the tides because of its closeness to Earth, even though the Sun is much more massive. The gravitational pull that an object exerts is directly proportional to its mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two objects. Mars, as a planet in our solar system, also has a gravitational force. However, its effect on Earth's tides is negligible compared to the Moon and the Sun. Mars is smaller and less massive than the Moon and further away from Earth than the Moon is. The average distance from the Earth to the Moon is about 384,400 km (239,000 miles), while Mars is far more distant, varying from around 54.6 million km (34 million miles) at its closest, to 401 million km (249 million miles) at its furthest. Its smaller mass and much greater distance result in a much smaller gravitational pull on Earth, making Mars' impact on our tides practically insignificant compared to the Moon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Before her first fight, Frankie leaves Maggie with a random manager in his gym, much to her dismay; upon being told by Scrap that said manager deliberately put her up against his best girl (coaching the novice to lose) to give her an easy win, Frankie rejoins Maggie in the middle of the bout and coaches her instead to an unforeseen victory.

Q:Question: \\"What does taking refuge in the Three Jewels reveal?\\"  Context: \\"Buddhist schools vary on the exact nature of the path to liberation, the importance and canonicity of various teachings and scriptures, and especially their respective practices. Buddhism denies a creator deity and posits that mundane deities such as Mahabrahma are misperceived to be a creator. The foundations of Buddhist tradition and practice are the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma (the teachings), and the Sangha (the community). Taking \\"refuge in the triple gem\\" has traditionally been a declaration and commitment to being on the Buddhist path, and in general distinguishes a Buddhist from a non-Buddhist. Other practices are Ten Meritorious Deeds including, giving charity to reduce the greediness; following ethical precepts; renouncing conventional living and becoming a monastic; the development of mindfulness and practice of meditation; cultivation of higher wisdom and discernment; study of scriptures; devotional practices; ceremonies; and in the Mahayana tradition, invocation of buddhas and bodhisattvas.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Taking refuge in the Three Jewels reveals a commitment to the Buddhist path and serves as a distinguishing factor between a Buddhist and a non-Buddhist.

With a career spanning six decades, she has reached legendary status in multiple fields of entertainment and is among a small group of entertainers who have been honored with an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Award. She is considered both an American icon and a gay icon.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - The Big Bird Cage is a 1972 American exploitation film of the \\"women in prison\\" subgenre. It serves as a non-sequel follow-up to the 1971 film \\"The Big Doll House\\". The film was written and directed by Jack Hill, and stars Pam Grier, Sid Haig, Anitra Ford, and Carol Speed.  - A cinematographer or director of photography (sometimes shortened to DP or DOP) is the chief over the camera crews working on a film, television production or other live action piece and is responsible for making artistic and technical decisions related to the image. The study and practice of this field is referred to as cinematography. Some filmmakers say that the cinematographer is just the chief over the camera and lighting, and the director of photography is the chief over all the photography components of film, including framing, costumes, makeup, and lighting, as well as the assistant of the post producer for color correction and grading.  - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.  - Joe D'Amato (birth name: Aristide Massaccesi; 15 December 1936 in Rome  23 January 1999 in Rome) was an Italian filmmaker who directed roughly 200 films, usually whilst also serving as producer and cinematographer, and sometimes providing script-writing duties as well. While D'Amato contributed to many different genres (such as spaghetti westerns, horror, war movies, swashbucklers, peplums, and fantasy), the majority of his films are exploitation-themed pornography, both soft and hardcore. He is generally considered the most prolific Italian filmmaker of all time.  - A gladiator (\\"swordsman\\", from , \\"sword\\") was an armed combatant who entertained audiences in the Roman Republic and Roman Empire in violent confrontations with other gladiators, wild animals, and condemned criminals. Some gladiators were volunteers who risked their lives and their legal and social standing by appearing in the arena. Most were despised as slaves, schooled under harsh conditions, socially marginalized, and segregated even in death.  - Pornography (often abbreviated to porn or porno in informal language) is the portrayal of sexual subject matter for the purpose of sexual arousal. Pornography may be presented in a variety of media, including books, magazines, postcards, photographs, sculpture, drawing, painting, animation, sound recording, writing, film, video, and video games. The term applies to the depiction of the act rather than the act itself, and so does not include live exhibitions like sex shows and striptease. The primary subjects of pornographic depictions are pornographic models, who pose for still photographs, and pornographic actors or porn stars, who perform in pornographic films. If dramatic skills are not involved, a performer in a porn film may also be called a model.  - An exploitation film is a film that attempts to succeed financially by exploiting current trends, niche genres, or lurid content.  - Women in prison film (or WiP) is a subgenre of exploitation film that began in the early 1900s and continues to the present day.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Coffy is a 1973 American blaxploitation film written and directed by American filmmaker Jack Hill. The story is about a black female vigilante played by Pam Grier.  - Quentin Jerome Tarantino (born March 27, 1963) is an American filmmaker and actor. His films are characterized by nonlinear storylines, satirical subject matter, an aestheticization of violence, extended scenes of dialogue, ensemble casts consisting of established and lesser-known performers, references to popular culture, soundtracks primarily containing songs and score pieces from the 1960s to the 1980s, and features of neo-noir film.  - An Emmy Award, or simply Emmy, recognizes excellence in the television industry, and corresponds to the Academy Award (for film), the Tony Award (for theatre), and the Grammy Award (for music).  - Pamela Suzette \\"Pam\\" Grier (born May 26, 1949) is an American actress.

She starred in Quentin Tarantino's film \\"Jackie Brown\\", for which she received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. She has also been nominated for a SAG Award as well as a Satellite Award for her performance in \\"Jackie Brown\\". Grier is also known for her work on television, for 6 seasons she portrayed Kate 'Kit' Porter on the television series \\"The L Word\\". She received an Emmy Award nomination for her work in the animated program \\"\\". Rotten Tomatoes has ranked her as the second greatest female action heroine in film history.

Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.   - Rotten Tomatoes is an American review aggregator website for film and television.  - A swashbuckler is an heroic archetype in European adventure literature that is typified by the use of a sword and chivalric ideals. The archetype also became common as a film genre.  - The Sterile Cuckoo (released in the UK as Pookie) is a 1969 American comedy-drama film released by Paramount Pictures that tells the story of an eccentric young couple whose relationship deepens despite their differences and inadequacies, and stars Liza Minnelli, Wendell Burton, and Tim McIntire.  - Blaxploitation or blacksploitation is an ethnic subgenre of the exploitation film, emerging in the United States during the early 1970s. Blaxploitation films were originally made specifically for an urban black audience, but the genre's audience appeal soon broadened across racial and ethnic lines. The Los Angeles National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) head and ex-film publicist Junius Griffin coined the term from the words \\"black\\" and \\"exploitation.\\" Blaxploitation films were the first to regularly feature soundtracks of funk and soul music and primarily black casts. \\"Variety\\" credited \\"Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song\\" and the less radical Hollywood-financed film \\"Shaft\\" (both released in 1971) with the invention of the blaxploitation genre.  - Margaret Markov is an American film and television actress.

Article: Why do some people live to be older than others? You know the standard explanations: keeping a moderate diet, engaging in regular exercise, etc. But what effect does your personality have on your longevity ? Do some kinds of personalities lead to longer lives? A new study in theJournal of the American Geriatrics Societylooked at this question by examining the personality characteristics of 246 children of people who had lived to be at least 100. The study shows that those living the longest are more outgoing, more active and less neurotic   than other people. Long-living women are also more likely to be sympathetic and cooperative than women with a normal life span. These findings are in agreement with what you would expect from the evolutionary theory: those who like to make friends and help others can gather enough resources to make it through tough times. Interestingly, however, other characteristics that you might consider advantageous had no impact on whether study participants were likely to live longer. Those who were more self-disciplined, for instance, were no more likely to live to be very old. Also, being open to new ideas had no relationship to long life, which might explain all those bad-tempered old people who are fixed in their ways. Whether you can successfully change your personality as an adult is the subject of a longstanding psychological debate. But the new paper suggests that if you want long life, you should strive to be as outgoing as possible. Unfortunately, another recent study shows that your mother's personality may also help determine your longevity. That study looked at nearly 28,000 Norwegian mothers and found that those moms who were more anxious, depressed and angry were more likely to feed their kids unhealthy diets. Patterns of childhood eating can be hard to break when we're adults, which may mean that kids of depressed moms end up dying younger. Personality isn't destiny , and everyone knows that individuals can learn to change. But both studies show that long life isn't... Question: What can we learn from the findings of the two new studies? Options: A: Anxiety and depression more often than not cut short one's life span.

The Vikings came into Week 9 in desperation mode as they went against the 3-4 Cardinals, whom they lost the previous December in the desert. The Vikings came into the game wearing their purple pants and played the Cardinals in what was arguably a desperation game not only for the season, but head coach Brad Childress' job. His job had become more scrutinized after he acted alone to cut WR Randy Moss, which drew a bunch of boos and jeers at Childress. However, the action did not start until the 2nd quarter, when the Vikings drove down the field and had a 2nd and goal. Favre threw to Peterson behind the line, but Peterson dodged a few players and got into the end zone, which made the game 7-0 in the 2nd quarter. The very next play, when the Vikings kicked off, Stephens-Howling returned a kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown which tied the game. After that, the Vikings responded with kicker Ryan Longwell nailing a 21-yard field goal. They fell behind with QB Derek Anderson completing a 30-yard TD pass to WR Andre Roberts to close out the first half. This was followed by DB Michael Adams returning a Percy Harvin kickoff fumble 30 yards for a touchdown, and with kicker Jay Feely making a 22-yard field goal. The lead was closed down by Peterson as he got a 4-yard TD run, and by QB Brett Favre's 25-yard TD pass to TE Visanthe Shiancoe.

Here are possible answers to this question: - go to jail - guilty conscience - find god - problems - knife  I believe the correct choice is \\"problems\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"People may commit murder for various reasons, and it is essential to understand that this explanation does not justify or condone the act of murder. Rather, it aims to provide insight into some of the potential factors that may contribute to an individual engaging in such a heinous act. The choice \\"problems\\" best encompasses the wide range of factors that could lead someone to commit murder, as these problems can stem from social, psychological, or environmental issues. Some possible reasons include: 1. Mental illness: Some individuals who commit murder may suffer from severe mental health problems, including disorders like psychopathy, schizophrenia, or extreme depression. These illnesses may impair an individual's ability to make rational decisions or empathize with others and can result in violent behavior. 2. Financial issues or greed: Financial stress or the motivation to acquire more resources could lead some individuals to commit murder. This might involve killing someone to claim insurance benefits, eliminate a rival in business, or seize control of valuable assets. 3. Revenge or retribution: A desire for revenge could lead someone to commit murder, especially if they feel they have been wronged or betrayed. This could involve avenging the death of a loved one or seeking retribution for perceived injustices. 4. Jealousy or romantic obsession: If someone feels threatened, jealous, or slighted in their romantic relationships, they may commit murder to eliminate their perceived rival or regain control over their partner. 5. Gang violence or criminal activity: Some individuals, particularly those involved in organized crime, may commit murder as part of their criminal activities or to assert dominance in their organizations. 6. Fear or desperation: In extreme situations, individuals may feel that murder is their only option to escape a dangerous situation or protect themselves and their families. 7. Ideological extremism or terrorism: Some people may commit murder in the name of a particular ideology, religious belief, or political agenda. These acts are often calculated to create terror, fear, or chaos in a society. 8. Impulsivity or loss of control: Some murders occur as a result of an individual losing control over their actions, often due to substance abuse or fits of rage. While other factors can contribute to an individual's motivation to commit murder, \\"problems\\" best captures the multifaceted and complex nature of this decision-making process. However, it's essential to remember that most people who experience these problems or stressors never resort to violence or murder, and it's crucial to seek help and support when facing difficulties in life."},{"instruction":"Question: Brad studied ancient human settlements from 100,000 years ago.

The President and the Vice President The President was seated in a classroom when, at 9:05, Andrew Card whispered to him: \\"A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.\\" The President told us his instinct was to project calm, not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis. The press was standing behind the children; he saw their phones and pagers start to ring. The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening. The President remained in the classroom for another five to seven minutes, while the children continued reading. He then returned to a holding room shortly before 9:15, where he was briefed by staff and saw television coverage. He next spoke to Vice President Cheney, Dr. Rice, New York Governor George Pataki, and FBI Director Robert Mueller. He decided to make a brief statement from the school before leaving for the airport. The Secret Service told us they were anxious to move the President to a safer location, but did not think it imperative for him to run out the door.

To achieve this, we must attempt to identify common English words that appear within the string. We need to proceed slowly and with care, making sure to not break any words in the wrong place.

Now, let's begin the segmentation process. 1. \\"Hisfriends,hisfamily,andhisstudentshavebeenenrichedbeyondboundbyhischaracter,hiswisdom,andhisunfailinggoodcheerandcontinuetobeenrichedbyhismemory.\\" The first word appears to be 'his', followed by 'friends', then a comma. This becomes: \\"His friends, ...\\" 2. Continuing, the next few words can be separated out as 'his', 'family', followed by 'and', then 'his', and 'students'. So far, we have: \\"His friends, his family, and his students ...\\" 3. After that, the following phrase seems to be 'have been enriched beyond bound by his character'. So now the sentence is:  \\"His friends, his family, and his students have been enriched beyond bound by his character, ...\\" 4. The pattern again here: 'his', 'wisdom', 'and', 'his', 'unfailing', 'good', 'cheer'. This gives us:  \\"His friends, his family, and his students have been enriched beyond bound by his character, his wisdom, and his unfailing good cheer ...\\" 5. 'And', 'continue', 'to', 'be', 'enriched', 'by', 'his', and finally 'memory' are the last string of words.  Therefore, the entire sentence after segmentation is: \\"His friends, his family, and his students have been enriched beyond bound by his character, his wisdom, and his unfailing good cheer and continue to be enriched by his memory.\\" By looking at the context of English language and using the knowledge of how words are typically strung together, we are now able to understand and make sense of the sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She had originally intended to take one year off, but despite working on material, twelve years passed before her next album release. Her name occasionally cropped up in the media with rumours of a new album release. The press often viewed her as an eccentric recluse, sometimes drawing a comparison with Miss Havisham from Charles Dickens's Great Expectations. In 1998, Bush gave birth to Albert, known as \\"Bertie\\", fathered by her guitarist and now husband Danny McIntosh. In 2001, Bush was awarded a Q Award as Classic Songwriter.

This conclusion can be drawn by connecting the statements provided. The first fact states that algae have varied life cycles, meaning that there is diversity within the different types of algae in terms of how they grow, reproduce, and evolve over time. The second fact highlights that some red algae are consumed by humans, indicating that these particular types of algae serve as a food source. By synthesizing these two pieces of information, we can infer that there is variation in the life cycles of certain organisms, in this case, some red algae, which humans consume. This means that the life cycle patterns of some edible red algae species may differ from one another. Since humans eat a diverse range of food items from various sources, it is not surprising that some of these food sources, such as red algae, exhibit varied life cycles. It is essential for consumers to understand these differences, as they may impact factors such as taste, nutrition, and sustainability of the food source."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The first step in this process was to convince groups of large states to combine to form a \\"princely union\\" through the execution by their rulers of Covenants of Merger. Under the Covenants of Merger, all rulers lost their ruling powers, save one who became the Rajpramukh of the new union. The other rulers were associated with two bodies—the council of rulers, whose members were the rulers of salute states, and a presidium, one or more of whose members were elected by the rulers of non-salute states, with the rest elected by the council. The Rajpramukh and his deputy Uprajpramukh were chosen by the council from among the members of the presidium. The Covenants made provision for the creation of a constituent assembly for the new union which would be charged with framing its constitution. In return for agreeing to the extinction of their states as discrete entities, the rulers were given a privy purse and guarantees similar to those provided under the Merger Agreements.Through this process, Patel obtained the unification of 222 states in the Kathiawar peninsula of his native Gujarat into the princely union of Saurashtra in January 1948, with six more states joining the union the following year. Madhya Bharat emerged on 28 May 1948 from a union of Gwalior, Indore and eighteen smaller states. In Punjab, the Patiala and East Punjab States Union was formed on 15 July 1948 from Patiala, Kapurthala, Jind, Nabha, Faridkot, Malerkotla, Nalargarh, and Kalsia. The United State of Rajasthan was formed as the result of a series of mergers, the last of which was completed on 15 May 1949. Travancore and Cochin were merged in the middle of 1949 to form the princely union of Travancore-Cochin. The only princely states which signed neither Covenants of Merger nor Merger Agreements were Kashmir, Mysore and Hyderabad.

News article: Prince obituary: ‘the music flowed out in an unstoppable torrent’ Typical of its prodigiously gifted composer, a multi-instrumentalist with a ferocious work ethic, the 1984 album Purple Rain, and accompanying semi-autobiographical hit movie of the same name, launched Prince, who has died aged 57, on to the global stage. It put him on track to become one of the greatest superstars of that decade and beyond. The chart-topping Purple Rain sold more than 20m copies, delivering two US No 1 singles in When Doves Cry and Let’s Go Crazy, and winning Prince the 1985 Oscar for best original song score. The anthemic title song could make it only to No 2, but it became the calling card of a compelling and glamorous performer who continued to dazzle and bewitch audiences. His career as a hit-maker had begun five years earlier, with the single I Wanna Be Your Lover, and he followed up Purple Rain with further hugely successful releases including Parade, Sign o’ the Times, Lovesexy and Diamonds and Pearls. While his profile and commercial fortunes ebbed and flowed over the following decades, and he even changed his name temporarily to a mysterious symbol as part of an attempt to get out of his contract with Warner Bros, in recent years he had regained his grip on his career, and become acknowledged as one of the most inspirational artists of his era. Related: Prince: every album rated – and ranked His ability to synthesise an intoxicating mix of musical styles, from funk, soul, gospel and rock to jazz, hip-hop and psychedelia, made him unique in rock music history, helped by his mastery of studio and audio technology. In addition, he presented his music and his persona with dazzling visual flair, and was always an enthralling live performer even when his record sales were not at their peak. After playing hours-long headlining concerts, he would often perform late-night shows with his band at local clubs; these became almost more sought after than the “official” performances. Prince Rogers Nelson was born in Minneapolis. His father, John Nelson, was leader of the Prince Rogers jazz trio, and met his wife-to-be, Mattie Shaw, when playing at community dances on Minneapolis’s North Side. Mattie joined the Prince Rogers trio as vocalist, but dropped out of the group after she married. The couple named their son after John’s stage name, though the boy was nicknamed “Skipper” when he was growing up. His parents’ musical leanings rubbed off on him, and at the age of seven he wrote his first song, Funk Machine, on his father’s piano. In 1960 his sister, Tyka, was born. His parents separated when Prince was 10, and he would alternate between living with his father and with his mother – who studied for a master’s degree in social work – and her new husband, Hayward Baker. It was Baker who took the boy to see James Brown perform, an event that had a profound influence on his approach to writing and performing. Prince eventually found a more permanent home with neighbours, the Anderson family, and their son Andre (later known as André Cymone) became a close friend and a musical partner. While attending Minneapolis’s central high school, Prince and Andre joined a band called Grand Central, which also included Prince’s cousin Charles Smith on drums. They played mostly cover versions, arranged by Prince. The group became Champagne, and acquired a new drummer, Morris Day, who later became lead singer with the Time and had prominent roles in Prince’s movies Purple Rain and Graffiti Bridge (1990). Related: Prince broke all the rules about what black American men should be After making some recordings with Pepé Willie and his band 94 East – released in the 1980s as Minneapolis Genius: 94 East – in 1976 Prince made a demo tape of his own material with the engineer Chris Moon, which caught the ear of a Minneapolis businessman, Owen Husney. He signed Prince to a management contract, forming the company American Artists, and funded the recording of high-quality demos which attracted interest from several record labels. Prince accepted the deal with Warner Bros, which gave him a rare degree of artistic control as well as ownership of his publishing rights. On his first album, For You (1978), the artist wrote and performed everything himself. The single Soft and Wet, an early indicator of Prince’s fondness for suggestive sexual wordplay, sold 350,000 copies and reached No 12 in the US R&B chart. The following January, Prince unveiled his new band at the Capri theatre in Minneapolis, a funk-rock ensemble featuring Cymone on bass alongside keyboard players Gayle Chapman and Matt Fink, guitarist Dez Dickerson and drummer Bobby Z. By the time his second album, Prince, appeared in October 1979, he had switched to Earth Wind & Fire’s management, Cavallo & Ruffalo. The album reached 22 in the Billboard 200, and would eventually sell a million copies as well as generating his first major hit with I Wanna Be Your Lover. The Dirty Mind album followed a year later, reaching the Top 50 in the US while provoking some criticism for the blatantly sexual nature of songs such as Head and Sister. Aptly, his next release was the following year’s Controversy, which contained more sexually explicit songs, a chant of the Lord’s Prayer, and even an intervention in US foreign policy, with a plea to President Reagan called Ronnie, Talk To Russia. Prince’s ability to provoke an audience was illustrated when he supported the Rolling Stones in San Francisco, and was pelted with shoes and chicken’s innards. Related: Prince a musical legacy like no other But the music was flowing out of him in an unstoppable torrent, and the 1982 double album called 1999 gave him his first Top 10 entry as well as hit singles with the title track, Delirious, and, above all, Little Red Corvette. The last-named benefited from heavy rotation on MTV, one of the first tracks by a black artist to receive such intense exposure, so helping to change the station’s programming policies. It was also the first album credited to Prince and the Revolution, his band now including Mark Brown and Lisa Coleman in place of Cymone and Chapman. Prince undertook a six-month tour to promote 1999, where he was joined on the bill by his proteges the Time and a new all-female group, Vanity 6, the latter seemingly an embodiment of Prince’s sexual fantasies. Filming of the Purple Rain movie began in late 1983, and took seven weeks on a budget of 7m. The Purple Rain campaign got off to a perfect start when the first single, When Doves Cry, topped the US charts (the Revolution now had a new guitarist, Wendy Melvoin, replacing Dickerson). The movie opened in July, the album arrived the following month, and in November Prince embarked on a 100-date US tour. At one point in 1984, Prince had the No 1 album, film and single in the US. Meanwhile he achieved another milestone of sorts when some of his lyrics, including those from Purple Rain’s Darling Nikki and his hit written for Sheena Easton, Sugar Walls, hit opposition from the newly formed Parents’ Music Resource Centre, which campaigned for a warning sticker on records containing sexually explicit lyrics. Related: Prince: a shy, nonconformist, unknowable talent | Alexis Petridis Intense press scrutiny didn’t seem to agree with Prince, who shunned interviews and in 1985 announced his retirement from live performing. This didn’t prevent Around the World in a Day from topping the Billboard chart that spring and delivering the hits Raspberry Beret and Pop Life. A year later came Parade, along with the chart-topping single Kiss (and behind it at No 2 was the Bangles’ Manic Monday, another Prince composition). July brought Prince’s new film Under the Cherry Moon, for which Parade provided the soundtrack, though the film was a comparative failure. His performing ban apparently rescinded, Prince embarked on the Hit n Run – Parade Tour, which included three nights at Wembley Arena. This was the end of the line for the Revolution, which Prince disbanded at the end of the tour. Music continued to pour out of him, and the epic double album Sign o’ the Times was released in March 1987. This produced a fresh batch of hit singles, including the title track, U Got the Look (featuring Easton) and I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man. Prince undertook an international touring campaign with a new band featuring the drummer Sheila E and dancer/choreographer Cat Glover, and a Sign o’ the Times concert film was released in November, though with limited commercial success. Shelving what later appeared as The Black Album – whose mix of lewd funk workouts, free jazz and hip-hop Prince suddenly decided was “evil” – he instead released Lovesexy (1988), an exercise in spiritually inclined R&B notable mostly for its infectious hit Alphabet St. The album fared well in Europe but poorly in the States, while the lavish Lovesexy world tour lost money. Prince’s financial affairs were in some disarray: “He wouldn’t budget, he wouldn’t run a business, he just did everything on a whim and a prayer,” said one business associate. However, Prince – having co-written and sung on Love Song, from Madonna’s 1989 album Like A Prayer – found himself back in commercial clover that year with his soundtrack for Tim Burton’s Batman movie, a multi-platinum US chart-topper which gave him another US No 1 with Batdance. His profile boosted by Sinéad O’Connor’s version of his song Nothing Compares 2 U, Prince embarked on another film and music project with Graffiti Bridge. The album went Top 10 but the film sank without trace, prompting another shake-up in Prince’s backing group. In 1991 he introduced the New Power Generation, who backed him on the Diamonds and Pearls album. This reached No 3 and delivered four hit singles, including his fifth US No 1, Cream. In 1992 Prince announced a new 100m deal with Warner Bros, but the shine faded when he found that the contract deprived him of ownership of his master recordings. The Love Symbol Album (which reached No 5 in the US and No 1 in Britain) was a harbinger of things to come, since in 1993 Prince changed his name to what he called “that symbol on the album” (the so-called “love symbol”, combining male and female images). Prince wanted to set a faster pace of album releases, but Warners wanted a more controlled flow to permit maximum exploitation of singles and touring. Prince, now referred to as the Artist Formerly Known As Prince, made his feelings towards the label explicit by writing SLAVE on his cheek whenever he appeared in public. Meanwhile the label marked time by releasing the triple-CD set The Hits/The B-Sides (1993). Prince reached a settlement with Warners in April 1996, by which time he had also released Come (a collection of material from his vaults), the notorious Black Album (1994), and The Gold Experience (1995), the latter providing a solid hit with The Most Beautiful Girl in the World. On Valentine’s Day that year he married a 22-year-old backing singer and dancer, Mayte Garcia, but in October their son Gregory died one week after his birth because of a rare skull defect, Pfeiffer syndrome. It drove the couple apart; they divorced in 2000. Related: Prince: his 10 greatest songs from Head to Cream (and Purple Rain in between) After releasing the contractual obligation album Chaos and Disorder (1996), Prince celebrated his escape from Warners with the triple-album Emancipation on his own NPG label; it sold 2m copies in the US. Prince now embraced the internet era by selling Crystal Ball, a five-CD set of previously unreleased tracks, on his website, though the delivery process was chaotic. This won him a Webby lifetime achievement award in 2006, as the first major artist to release a whole album exclusively online. Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic (1999) was designed to be commercial and accessible, but was a relative flop. In May 2000, after the expiry of his publishing contract with Warner Chappell Music, Prince officially retired the love symbol and became Prince again. He now focused on internet distribution via his NPGMusicClub.com site, which brought The Rainbow Children, the instrumental album N.E.W.S. and the jazzy Xpectation. One Nite Alone ... Live! (2002) was his first live album. In 2001 he had married Manuela Testolini, whom he met while she was working at his charitable foundation. They divorced five years later. In 2001 Prince joined Jehovah’s Witnesses, introduced by Larry Graham, who had played bass with Sly and the Family Stone and fronted his own band, Graham Central Station. In February 2004, Prince made a spectacular appearance at the Grammy Awards with Beyoncé, performing a medley which included Purple Rain, Let’s Go Crazy and Beyoncé’s Crazy in Love. In March Prince was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, playing a batch of his own songs before joining in While My Guitar Gently Weeps as a tribute to George Harrison, who had died in 2001. Musicology (2004) presented a relaxed, optimistic Prince making listener-friendly music with a new business model. He arranged distribution through Columbia Records, taking no advance payment but retaining complete ownership of the album. Anybody who bought a ticket for the Musicology tour received a copy of the album, which was also available though the online Music Club. “One advantage of writing SLAVE on my face back then is that when I meet with a label now, they already know they’re not going to be owning anything,” Prince said. “Maybe at one time they could get Little Richard for a new car and a bucket of chicken. We don’t roll like that no more.” He scored his first US No 1 album since Batman with 3121 (2006), and in November that year was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame. He opened the 3121 nightclub under a deal with the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, and performed there regularly. In February 2007, at the Super Bowl half-time show in Miami, one of the highest-profile showcases a US artist can achieve, he played some Purple Rain songs alongside cover versions of pieces by Queen, Bob Dylan, Creedence Clearwater Revival and the Foo Fighters. His Earth Tour brought him to London that summer, to play 21 nights at the O2 Arena. The Planet Earth album was given away free with the Mail on Sunday, to the dismay of music retailers (he was dubbed the Artist Formerly Available In Record Stores). In October 2008, he released the live album Indigo Nights, comprising music performed after hours at the IndigO2 nightclub, plus a matching book called 21 Nights. Related: Minneapolis celebrates its 'favorite son' Prince with all-night dance party The album 20Ten was released in 2010 as a free covermounted disc with various European publications but not available online; he toured the album in Europe in two separate legs with different bands. His appearance at the Hop Farm Festival in Kent in July 2011 was his debut at a UK festival. In 2013, Prince formed a new backing band called 3rdeyegirl, which came to London on the small-scale Hit and Run Tour in February 2014. Even more surprising than his performance at the home of singer Lianne La Havas was news that Prince had signed a new deal with Warner Bros after an 18-year gap. The label announced the release of a 30th anniversary deluxe edition of Purple Rain, and returned ownership of his Warner recordings to the artist.

Can Calorie Counts Convince Teens Not to Buy Sugary Drinks? Does calorie information help consumers make healthier choices? Not always. But a new study finds that when calorie counts are presented in an easily understandable way, even teenagers — those experts in never listening to useful advice — can be persuaded to avoid high-sugar choices. For the new study, published in the American Journal of Public Health, researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health went to corner stores in predominantly black neighborhoods of Baltimore and posted signs showing calorie information about sugary drinks (sodas, fruit drinks, energy drinks) on refrigerated beverage cases. The researchers tested three different signs, each brightly colored, in four corner stores. One sign said that a bottle of soda or fruit drink had 250 calories. Another noted that each bottle contained 10% of a person’s recommended daily calorie intake. A third sign informed consumers that they would have to run for 50 minutes to burn off the calories in a single sugary drink. The researchers collected data for 1,600 beverage purchases by black teens — who tend to drink more sugary beverages and to be obese — including 400 sales during a no-sign baseline period, and 400 for each of the three signs. Overall, they found, teens were 40% less likely to buy a sugary drink after seeing any of the posted calorie counts than when they were given no information. They were even less inclined to buy a soda or a fruit drink after viewing the sign that presented the exercise equivalent, which reduced soft drink purchases by 50%. The study did not track exactly which drinks teens substituted for the sugary ones, but the data suggest they may have tended toward some non-calorie options: while beverages like bottled water and diet soda made up only 6.7% of drink sales before the signs appeared, that percentage increased to nearly 14% after the calorie information was posted. Previous studies on calorie counts and buying behavior have been conflicting. One study in July of fast food customers in New York City showed that posting calorie information on above-the-counter menus did little to reduce the number of calories people ordered. Also, reported Healthland’s Tara Thean at the time: A 2009 study by NYU and Yale professors found, after checking receipts, that customers actually ordered slightly more calories than the typical customer had before the calorie count law was implemented. Two years later, an NYU School of Medicine study demonstrated that calorie labeling did not change the number of calories teenagers and parents purchased at fast food chains in the city, with teens buying a whopping 725 calories on average even after the labeling. And another analysis of one Taco Time outlet in Washington State found “basically absolutely nothing” in purchasing changes after calorie counts started popping up. The failures may have to do with how the information was presented. Calorie information works best when it is displayed clearly and visibly alongside the items and prices listed on menus, not tucked away where it can’t easily be seen. But even then, it may not matter if consumers don’t know how to interpret it — if they don’t know, for instance, how many calories they’re supposed to eat in a day. That may help explain why so many teens tended to heed the Baltimore store posters. Not only were they easily visible, but they also helped put calorie information in context. “This study showed that black teenagers will use calorie information, especially when presented in an easy-to-understand format, such as a physical activity equivalent, to make healthier choices when it comes to buying a drink at the local corner store,” lead researcher Sara Bleich, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said in a statement. “Most consumers underestimate the number of calories in a can of soda, and they often do not realize that such calories can add up quickly.” With American teenagers consuming an average 300 calories per day from sugary drinks alone — a significant contributing factor to children’s overweight and obesity rates — adding calorie-information posters could help.

So even though the text does not directly use the term 'reporter', it can be reasonably inferred, in the context of this courtroom scenario, that these media individuals are reporters. Furthermore, the paragraph mentions media presence outside of the courtroom as well.

Among his favourites was the SLS boutique hotel in Beverly Hills. On his blog, The Viscount’s Table, he advised readers: ‘Always insist on Ace of Spades champagne. Two bottles by the rooftop pool at the SLS in Beverly Hills is highly recommended for good living.’ The Vizconde also enjoyed some agreeable stays at the Roxburghe Crowne Plaza and Sheraton Hotel in Edinburgh, where he noted that staff ‘served the most beautiful spring tea to the Viscountess and I in the room’.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: In her new book, \\"The Smartest Kids in the World,\\" Amanda Ripley, an investigative journalist, tells the story of Tom, a high-school student from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, who decides to spend his senior year in Warsaw, Poland. Poland is a surprising educational success story: in the past decade, the country raised students' test scores from significantly below average to well above it. Polish kids have now outscored(......) American kids in math and science, even though Poland spends, on average, less than half as much per student as the United States does. One of the most striking differences between the high school Tom attended in Gettysburg and the one he ends up at in Warsaw is that the latter has no football team, or, for that matter, teams of any kind. That American high schools lavish more time and money on sports than on math is an old complaint. This is not a matter of how any given student who plays sports does in school, but of the culture and its priorities. This December, when the latest Program for International Student Assessment(PISA) results are announced, it's safe to predict that American high-school students will once again display their limited skills in math and reading, outscored not just by students in Poland but also by students in places like South Korea, Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland, Singapore, and Japan. Meanwhile, they will have played some very exciting football games, which will have been breathlessly written up in their hometown papers. Why does this situation continue? Well, for one thing, kids like it. And for another, according to Ripley, parents seem to like the arrangement, too. She describes a tour she took of a school in Washington D.C., which costs thirty thousand dollars a year. The tour leader--a mother with three children in the school--was asked about the school's flaws . When she said that the math program was weak, none of the parents taking the tour reacted.

Write an article based on this summary: Let the mixture sit for one hour.","output":"Title: The Science and Benefits Behind Letting Your Mixture Sit for an Hour Introduction In both cooking and baking, timings and techniques are essential to achieve the desired results. One often-overlooked aspect is the importance of letting your mixture sit for a while. In this article, we will explore the science behind allowing your mixture to rest and the potential benefits this approach offers for various recipes. This comprehensive guide will delve deep into the world of cooking to uncover the effects of letting your mixtures sit for an hour, covering topics like food chemistry, flavor development, and more. The Science Behind Resting Mixtures 1. Food Chemistry When a mixture of ingredients is combined, a plethora of chemical reactions takes place. Some of these reactions are instantaneous, while others occur over time. Allowing the mix to rest for an hour gives time for these chemical reactions to fully develop. These reactions may include enzymatic actions such as enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis, protein denaturation, starch gelatinization, and more. By providing sufficient time for these reactions, the desired texture, flavor, and consistency can be achieved. 2. Hydration In many recipes, certain dry ingredients like flour, starches, and proteins need time to hydrate fully. Allowing a mixture to sit for an hour ensures that these ingredients have ample time to absorb liquids and gases, which affects the overall texture of the final product. This is especially crucial in doughs and batters, where hydration plays a significant role in the outcome. 3. Gluten Development For recipes involving wheat flour, resting the mixture allows gluten proteins to relax and reorganize, leading to improved dough elasticity. When the dough is initially mixed, these proteins are tangled and can lead to a tough texture if not allowed to relax. Giving the dough an hour to rest helps to create a more workable and elastic dough with an improved texture in the final product. 4. Fermentation In recipes that require yeast or natural fermentation, allowing them to rest for longer periods is crucial. The fermentation process affects the flavor, texture, and other properties of the final product. Letting your mixture sit for an hour promotes the growth of yeast and other beneficial bacteria, which enhances flavor development and leavening. 5. Ingredient Compatibility When various ingredients are added together, they need time to mingle and interact. By giving your mixture time to rest, the flavors have the opportunity to blend, significantly improving the final taste. This is particularly helpful in complex dishes with multiple spices and flavors. The Benefits of Allowing Mixtures to Sit 1. Improved Texture Giving time for the ingredients to hydrate, relax, and interact can lead to a significantly improved texture in many recipes. This is especially true in cases where gluten development and hydration play a crucial role, such as in bread, pasta dough, and baked goods. 2. Enhanced Flavors Allowing the mixture to sit for an hour provides time for flavors to meld and intensify. This results in a more well-rounded and complex taste profile in your final dish, which is particularly important in dishes with multiple flavors and spices. 3. Easier Handling In recipes involving doughs or batters, an hour of resting time can make the mixture significantly easier to work with and manipulate. This can help in shaping, rolling, and other forms of handling, impacting the final presentation and structure of your dish. 4. Consistency By giving the mixture time to rest, the final consistency can be improved, particularly helpful in recipes with delicate textures and structures, like soufflés, meringues, and puddings. Conclusion Letting your mixture sit for an hour might seem trivial or inconsequential, but it holds significant sway over the output. By understanding the science behind this approach, you can improve the overall texture, flavor, and quality of your dishes, regardless of the complexities and intricacies of your recipe. Whether baking a simple cake or preparing the dough for handmade pasta, the hour of resting time is invaluable in achieving optimal results, adding another dimension to your cooking and baking skills."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you drive somewhere, park at the far end of the parking lot and walk to the building to get some extra steps in. For example, you could walk around the building when you're waiting for an appointment, rather than sitting in a waiting room flipping through a two-year-old magazine. Typically if you tell the receptionist you're going for a walk, they'll let you know about how long it will be. Getting at least 7 or 8 hours of sleep each night can help lower your stress levels and improve the functioning of your immune system. You'll also likely find that your productivity during the day will improve, since you'll think more clearly and find it easier to concentrate. While you sleep, your brain releases chemicals that affect your heart rate, blood pressure, metabolism, and digestion. Alcohol and caffeine can wreak havoc on any diet and exercise plan. They are also diuretics that can cause dehydration and other physical problems, particularly if you consume significant quantities on a regular basis.  If you exercise regularly, eat well, and get plenty of sleep, you'll likely find that you don't need as much caffeine to get through the day.

Following its initial publication in French, Du \\"Cubisme\\" was translated into English and Russian in 1913, making it more accessible to a wider international audience. The book played a significant role in promoting and consolidating the theoretical foundations of the Cubist movement, offering readers an insightful exploration of its key concepts. Metzinger and Gleizes' treatise explained and defended the innovations introduced by Cubist artists and helped foster greater understanding and acceptance of this pioneering approach to painting. Overall, a more detailed and comprehensive answer to the question \\"Who published Du \\"Cubisme\\"?\\" would be: \\"Du \\"Cubisme\\" was written by Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes and was first published by the innovative and influential French publisher Eugène Figuière in Paris in 1912. Following its initial publication, the book was translated into English and Russian in 1913, making this groundbreaking work available to a wider international audience.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you love a ruffled detail but you don’t want to go all-out, consider matching your ruffles with tailored pieces to help balance out the look. Look for pieces that will hold their shape, like blazers, structured jackets, and other pieces made from sturdy fabric like leather, wool, corduroy, or even denim.  For instance, you might wear a sheer, ruffled blouse with a blazer, tailored trousers, and flats if you’re heading to the office. Wear a sheer ruffled blouse under a leather jacket for a cool mix of tough and sweet. Ruffles add a sweet, flirty detail to outerwear. If the weather is a little cool, consider wearing a basic outfit, like trousers and a fitted T-shirt. Then, top them with a jacket with a pretty ruffle to create a look that’s instantly chic. The ruffle can be along the buttons or zipper, on the bottom hem, around the collar, or on the sleeves. A ruffled dress can look sweet and innocent, so a pair of ankle boots are the perfect way to toughen up the look a little. The pairings are endless, so play around with this style and see what you come up with!  Channel the 90s by pairing a babydoll-style ruffled dress with tough ankle-length hiking boots. Pair a minidress with a ruffle detail on the shoulder with a pair of stiletto-heeled ankle boots for a glam look that’s perfect for a night dancing with your besties! A ruffled gown is beautiful and romantic, making it a great option if you have a formal event to attend. However, ruffles can tend to look overly sweet, especially on a head-to-toe look like a long gown. To balance that, go for a little bit of an edgier look in your hair and makeup, like a messy up-do and smokey eye makeup.  If it’s appropriate for the occasion, you may be able to add on a leather jacket or a structured blazer to help balance out the feminine gown. Strappy stiletto heels and sleek pumps are popular shoe options for formal occasions.

Gently she stroked her hair and let the child weep.\\", does it follow that \\"Alice stroked her hair and let the child weep.\\"","output":"No, it does not follow that \\"Alice stroked her hair and let the child weep.\\" In the given sentence, \\"Mama came over and sat down beside Alice. Gently she stroked her hair and let the child weep.\\", Mama is the subject who performs the actions of sitting down beside Alice, stroking the hair, and letting the child weep. The pronoun \\"she\\" in this context refers to Mama, not to Alice.  To better understand the situation, let's break down the original sentence into its components: 1. \\"Mama came over and sat down beside Alice.\\" - This part indicates that Mama approached and sat next to Alice. It does not denote any action performed by Alice. 2. \\"Gently she stroked her hair and let the child weep.\\" - The pronoun \\"she\\" must refer to someone previously mentioned in the sentence, which is Mama in this case. Consequently, Mama is the one who gently strokes the hair, and the hair being stroked likely belongs to Alice since she is the only other person mentioned so far. Additionally, Mama allows the child - who we can assume to be Alice - to weep without interruption. In conclusion, the original sentence implies that Mama is the person taking care of Alice, providing emotional support through stroking her hair and permitting her to cry. By changing the subject to Alice, the meaning of the sentence becomes distorted and misrepresents the intended events."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Hypothesis: American troops took control of Puerto Rico soon after Spain gave it up. Does the premise entail the hypothesis? OPT: A. yes. B. it is not possible to tell. C. no.","output":"A. yes. The premise entails the hypothesis as it mentions that \\"eight months after Madrid had authorized home rule for Puerto Rico, American troops arrived to take it away.\\" This clearly indicates that soon after Spain had decided to provide Puerto Rico with self-governance, the United States decided to intervene and take control of the territory. The historical context of this situation can be traced back to the Spanish-American War in 1898. Spain had been struggling to maintain control over its remaining colonies, including Puerto Rico. As a result, they authorized home rule for Puerto Rico in an effort to appease the citizens and maintain some level of control. However, the United States, seeking to expand its influence in the region, seized the opportunity and intervened militarily. During the Spanish-American War, the United States sought to oust Spain from its remaining colonies in the Americas. The war ultimately resulted in the defeat of Spain and the signing of the Treaty of Paris. In this treaty, Spain ceded Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the United States, effectively ending Spanish rule in the region and the start of American control over these territories. As a result, the premise does entail the hypothesis, as it demonstrates a direct correlation between Spain's decision to grant home rule to Puerto Rico and the subsequent arrival of American troops with the intention to take control of the territory. The United States' actions had a significant impact on the political and social development of Puerto Rico, and its relationship with both Spain and the United States throughout the following years."},{"instruction":"Question: -  The wind and water pick up sediment that came off the rocks - Sediment is carried to an area by the wind, water, air, or ice - Sediment is deposited on the same spot many times - The sediment piles on top of other sediment for a long time - The sediment near the bottom is compressed by the weight of newer sediment - The sediment becomes sedimentary rock as it is pushed together by the heavy weight -   What might be the first step of the process?

You are given a new situation: Jacob recently contracted the HIV virus and is going to his first support meeting. While there, he meets Dan and strikes up a conversation with him. Dan says that he has had HIV for over a decade at this point and has learned ways to live with it. He is able to give Jacob some good advice on how to handle things and Jacob is very grateful to have someone to talk with.  and a hint : As time passes, the number of HIV copies keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells keeps decreasing. The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one.  Please answer this question : Who has more T cells, Jacob or Dan?

The information provided only gives a general overview of the decline in T cells after an HIV infection and does not offer specific data about Jacob or Dan's T cell counts. However, since Dan has been living with HIV for over a decade and Jacob was recently diagnosed, it is likely that Jacob has more T cells than Dan, assuming their immune systems were similar before becoming infected. This is because the decline in T cells tends to occur over several years after the initial infection. That being said, it is important to consider that factors such as treatment adherence, the individual's immune response, and other health factors could also affect each person's T cell count. The only way to know for certain would be to compare the actual T cell numbers for both Jacob and Dan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step 1: Research the history of telephone numbering systems To provide a more accurate answer, I will research the history of telephone numbering systems and how phone numbers have been divided into sections. Step 2: Analyze the information gathered After researching, I found that the North American Numbering Plan (NANP), which serves countries like the United States, Canada, and some Caribbean nations, uses three-digit and four-digit splits for phone numbers. The three-digit number is called the area code, and the four-digit number is considered the local number. This system was established to streamline and simplify the dialing process, organizing it into geographic areas. Step 3: Formulate a more accurate response Based on the information gathered, I can now provide a more accurate answer: A more accurate answer would be: Phone numbers were split into 3-digit and 4-digit sections primarily in countries following the North American Numbering Plan. The 3-digit section represents the area code, covering a specific geographic region, while the 4-digit section is the local number.

It's difficult to look back on one's own childhood without some element of nostalgia .I have four brothers and sisters, and my memories are all about being with them.Playing board games on the living room floor, or spending days in the street with the other neighborhood children, racing up and down on our bikes, or exploring the nearby woods.My parents scarcely appear in these memories, except as providers either of meals or of severe blame after some particularly risky adventure. These days, in the UK at least, the nature of childhood has changed dramatically.Firstly, families are smaller, and there are far more only children.It is common for both parents to work outside the home and there is the feeling that there just isn't time to bring up a large family, or that no one could possibly afford to have more than one child.As a result, today's boys and girls spend much of their time alone.Another major change is that youngsters today tend to spend a huge amount of their free time at home, inside.More than anything this is due to the fact that parents worry far more than they used to about real or imagined dangers, so they wouldn't dream of letting their children play outside by themselves. Finally, the kind of toys children have and the way they play is totally different.Computer and video games have replaced the board games and more interesting activities of my childhood.The irony  is that so many ways of playing games are called \\"interactive\\".The fact that you can play electronic games on your own further increases the sense of loneliness felt by many young people today. Do these changes mean that children today have a less relaxing childhood than I had? I personally believe that they do, but perhaps every generation feels exactly the same.

They are referring to two different concepts. 1. What is Mac? \\"Mac\\" is short for \\"Macintosh,\\" which is a brand of personal computers designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. The Macintosh was first introduced in 1984 and has since evolved through various models and designs. Macs are known for their user-friendly interface, sleek design, and integration with other Apple devices and services. Mac computers run on macOS, which is Apple's proprietary operating system. macOS is known for its graphical user interface, ease of use, and robust performance. Some popular Mac models include the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, Mac Mini, and Mac Pro. Apple also develops and maintains a suite of software applications specifically designed for its macOS, such as the Safari web browser, the iWork productivity suite, and the iLife creativity suite. 2. What is the MAC? \\"MAC\\" stands for \\"Media Access Control\\" and relates to computer networking. The MAC address (sometimes referred to as the Ethernet address, hardware address, or physical address) is a unique identifier assigned to network devices, such as network cards, routers, and switches.

Select the topic that this about: An investigative judge questioned former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet for half an hour on Saturday to decide whether to indict him in one of hundreds","output":"of human rights cases pending against him, government sources said. Topic: Human rights violations and the indictment of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet Overview: Augusto Pinochet was a Chilean military officer who held the position of dictator in Chile from 1973 to 1990. His rule began with a military coup that overthrew the democratically-elected government of President Salvador Allende. Pinochet's regime was marked by widespread human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrests, torture, and forced disappearances. Pinochet relinquished power in 1990, but remained a highly controversial figure in Chilean politics. He was arrested in 1998 while visiting the United Kingdom and faced extradition to Spain on charges of torture, but was ultimately ruled unfit to stand trial for health reasons. In 2004, Chilean courts ruled that Pinochet could be indicted for a range of human rights abuses, and in the following years, a series of indictments and investigations were launched against the former dictator. Human rights violations under Pinochet's regime: Pinochet's regime was infamous for its human rights abuses and political repression, which can be categorized as follows: 1. Forced disappearances: The regime was responsible for the forced disappearance of thousands of political dissidents, who were detained without charge and whose whereabouts remain unknown. These individuals are often referred to as \\"desaparecidos\\" (the disappeared). 2. Torture: Thousands of Chileans were tortured by Pinochet's security forces in detention centers throughout the country, including the notorious Villa Grimaldi, Colonia Dignidad, and the National Stadium. 3. Arbitrary detention: Thousands of people were detained without charge or trial in a campaign of mass arrests targeting political dissidents and suspected supporters of the Allende government. 4. Extrajudicial executions: The regime was responsible for the deaths of thousands of individuals, often as a result of summary executions carried out by security forces. Many of these executions occurred in secret; victims’ bodies were often dumped in unmarked graves or thrown into the ocean. 5. Political persecution: Pinochet's regime targeted various political parties and organizations, as well as trade unions, student groups, and religious institutions, in an effort to crush opposition and consolidate power. 6. Censorship and surveillance: Pinochet's regime maintained strict control over information and media outlets, suppressing dissenting voices and expressions critical of the regime. Citizens were subject to pervasive surveillance by Pinochet's security forces. Indictment and questioning of Augusto Pinochet: Following the end of his dictatorship in 1990, Pinochet faced growing scrutiny for the human rights abuses committed under his rule. In 1998, he was arrested in London on an international arrest warrant issued by Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzón, who sought to extradite Pinochet to Spain to face charges of torture and other human rights abuses. The arrest of Pinochet in London opened the door for further international efforts to hold him accountable for his actions. In Chile, dozens of lawsuits were filed against the former dictator for his alleged role in the human rights abuses committed by his regime. Late in his life, Pinochet faced questioning from investigative judges to determine whether he could be indicted for the many human rights violations perpetrated during his rule. The investigation process involved the amassing of evidence, such as documents and testimonies from witnesses and survivors, detailing the horrific crimes committed under the Pinochet regime. In addition to seeking justice for the victims, these investigations played an essential role in reconstructing an accurate historical account of the dictatorship, and holding Pinochet and his collaborators accountable for their actions. Conclusion: Despite the efforts to pursue justice for the victims of Augusto Pinochet's regime, the former Chilean dictator managed to evade a criminal trial for his actions. However, the indictment processes, questioning by investigative judges, and broader national and international efforts to uncover the truth about the human rights abuses that occurred under his regime, all served important roles in raising public awareness of these atrocities, holding Pinochet and his collaborators accountable in the court of public opinion, and striving for a sense of closure and justice for the victims and their families."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Costume is the distinctive style of dress of an individual or group that reflects their class, gender, profession, ethnicity, nationality, activity or epoch.  - Filmmaking (or in an academic context, film production) is the process of making a film. Filmmaking involves a number of discrete stages including an initial story, idea, or commission, through screenwriting, casting, shooting, sound recording and reproduction, editing, and screening the finished product before an audience that may result in a film release and exhibition. Filmmaking takes place in many places around the world in a range of economic, social, and political contexts, and using a variety of technologies and cinematic techniques. Typically, it involves a large number of people, and can take from a few months to several years to complete.  - Epic film is a style of filmmaking with large scale, sweeping scope, and spectacle. The usage of the term has shifted over time, sometimes designating a film genre and at other times simply synonymous with big budget filmmaking. Like epics in the classical literary sense it is often focused on a heroic character. An epic's ambitious nature helps to set it apart from other types of film such as the period piece or adventure film. Epic historical films would usually take a historical or a mythic event and add an extravagant setting and lavish costumes, accompanied by an expansive musical score with an ensemble cast, which would make them among the most expensive of films to produce. The most common subjects of epic films are royalty, and important figures from various periods in world history.  - An audience is a group of people who participate in a show or encounter a work of art, literature (in which they are called \\"readers\\"), theatre, music (in which they are called \\"listeners\\"), video games (in which they are called \\"players\\"), or academics in any medium. Audience members participate in different ways in different kinds of art; some events invite overt audience participation and others allowing only modest clapping and criticism and reception.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Computer animation is the process used for generating animated images. The more general term computer-generated imagery (CGI) encompasses both static scenes and dynamic images, while computer animation \\"only\\" refers to the moving images. Modern computer animation usually uses 3D computer graphics, although 2D computer graphics are still used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time renderings. Sometimes, the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes film as well.  - The phi phenomenon is the optical illusion of perceiving a series of still images, when viewed in rapid succession, as continuous motion. Max Wertheimer, one of the three founders of Gestalt psychology, defined this phenomenon in 1912. The phi phenomenon and persistence of vision together formed the foundation of Hugo Münsterberg's theory of film and are part of the process of motion perception.  - Grand opera is a genre of 19th-century opera generally in four or five acts, characterized by large-scale casts and orchestras, and (in their original productions) lavish and spectacular design and stage effects, normally with plots based on or around dramatic historic events. The term is particularly applied (sometimes specifically using in its French language equivalent grand opéra) to certain productions of the Paris Opéra from the late 1820s to around 1850; 'grand opéra' has sometimes been used to denote the Paris Opéra itself.  - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor.  - A background actor or extra is a performer in a film , television show , stage , musical , opera or ballet production , who appears in a nonspeaking or nonsinging ( silent ) capacity , usually in the background ( for example , in an audience or busy street scene ) . War films and epic films often employ background actors in large numbers : some films have featured hundreds or even thousands of paid background actors as cast members ( hence the term ' cast of thousands ' ) . Likewise , grand opera can involve many background actors appearing in spectacular productions . On a film or TV set , background actors are usually referred to as \`\` background talent '' , \`\` background performers '' , \`\` background artists '' , \`\` background cast members '' or simply \`\` background '' while the term \`\` extra '' is rarely used . In a stage production , background actors are commonly referred to as \`\` supernumeraries '' . In opera and ballet , they are called either \`\` extras '' or \`\` supers '' .  - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.  - Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion and the illusion of change by means of the rapid display of a sequence of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusionas in motion pictures in generalis thought to rely on the phi phenomenon. Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation. Animation can be recorded with either analogue media, a flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats with animated GIF, Flash animation, and digital video. To display animation, a digital camera, computer, or projector are used along with new technologies that are produced.  - In filmmaking, visual effects (abbreviated VFX) are the processes by which imagery is created and/or manipulated outside the context of a live action shot.     Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'instance of' with 'profession'. A:","output":"The entity that has the relation 'instance of' with 'profession' in the given paragraphs is 'background actor' or 'extra'.

In the first sentence, the word \\"played\\" indicates that the subject participated in the Hallmark series \\"When Calls the Heart\\" as an actor, but it does not explicitly state the level of their involvement, nor does it necessarily imply a leading role. They could have been a supporting character or appeared in a guest role. In the second sentence, the word \\"starred\\" implies that the subject had a leading role or significantly notable part in the Hallmark series \\"When Calls the Heart.\\" This sentence gives more prominence to their involvement in the series. Additionally, the first sentence places more emphasis on the networks (The CW and Hallmark) by mentioning them first, while the second sentence emphasizes the TV shows themselves and subsequently mentions the networks.

Information:  - Epicurus (or  \\"ally, comrade\\"; 341270 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher as well as the founder of the school of philosophy called Epicureanism. Only a few fragments and letters of Epicurus's 300 written works remain. Much of what is known about Epicurean philosophy derives from later followers and commentators.  - Epicureanism is a system of philosophy based upon the teachings of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, founded around 307 BC. Epicurus was an atomic materialist, following in the steps of Democritus. His materialism led him to a general attack on superstition and divine intervention. Following Aristippusabout whom very little is knownEpicurus believed that what he called \\"pleasure\\" was the greatest good, but that the way to attain such pleasure was to live modestly, to gain knowledge of the workings of the world, and to limit one's desires. This would lead one to attain a state of tranquility (\\"ataraxia\\") and freedom from fear as well as an absence of bodily pain (\\"aponia\\"). The combination of these two states constitutes happiness in its highest form. Although Epicureanism is a form of hedonism insofar as it declares pleasure to be its sole intrinsic goal, the concept that the absence of pain and fear constitutes the greatest pleasure, and its advocacy of a simple life, make it very different from \\"hedonism\\" as it is colloquially understood.  - Themista of Lampsacus , the wife of Leonteus , was a student of Epicurus , early in the 3rd century BCE . Epicurus ' school was unusual in the 3rd century , in that it allowed women to attend , and we also hear of Leontion attending Epicurus ' school around the same time . Cicero ridicules Epicurus for writing \`\` countless volumes in praise of Themista , '' instead of more worthy men such as Miltiades , Themistocles or Epaminondas . Themista and Leonteus named their son Epicurus .  - Marcus Tullius Cicero ( \\"Kikern\\"; 3 January 106 BC  7 December 43 BC) was a Roman philosopher, politician, lawyer, orator, political theorist, consul, and constitutionalist. He came from a wealthy municipal family of the Roman equestrian order, and is considered one of Rome's greatest orators and prose stylists.    What is the relationship between 'themista of lampsacus' and 'epicureanism'? A:","output":"Themista of Lampsacus was a student of Epicurus, the founder of the school of philosophy called Epicureanism. She was associated with Epicureanism as a follower and proponent of the philosophy. Epicurus' school was unique in the 3rd century, as it allowed women to attend, and Themista along with another woman, Leontion, attended Epicurus' school during that time. The relationship between Themista and Epicureanism lies in her being a student and advocate of the philosophical teachings of Epicurus."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

PUBLISHED:. 05:18 EST, 2 August 2013. |. UPDATED:. 10:13 EST, 2 August 2013. They may be the child heirs to a billion dollar fortune, but that was no protection against years of harrowing cruelty at the hands of their father. Forced to live in faeces-strewn basement, existing like slaves and enduring scalding baths in boiling water, some of the horrifying details of life for twins Georgina and Walker Inman III, 15, are just emerging. They are set to inherit part of the 1billion fortune of heiress Doris Duke - dubbed the 'richest girl in the world' thanks to trust funds set up by her father who founded American Tobacco - when they turn 21. Cruelty: Walker Inman III, left, and twin sister Georgia Inman, right, both 15, have trust funds worth millions of dollars, but they claim they have endured years of abuse at the hands of their heroin-addicted father. But Georgina has revealed that growing up at their heroin-addicted father’s mansion  was anything but a life of pampered privilege in a shocking interview for Rolling Stone magazine, out today. 'I never asked to be born into any of this. Sometimes I wish I was never born.' Georgia recalled one of the regular horrors she and her brother Walker faced at the hands of their father Walker 'Skipper' Inman Jr and, allegedly, his fifth wife at the Duke family estate in South Carolina. Inhumane: Walker 'Skipper' Inman Jr, pictured, made his children live in faeces-strewn basement until he died in 2010 of a methadone overdose. Speaking with a faltering voice, she described being dunked in a scalding bath. She told Rolling Stone magazine: 'They. Stuck my brother and I. In hot boiling water in our bath. It felt like our skin was melting away.' She called her fortune ‘blood money’ and told of one time when she put a gun to her father’s head in an attempt to end the torture. More details of their harrowing upbringing emerged in an affidavit related to a onetime lawsuit over damage at a rented, 10,000-square-foot mansion, dubbed Outlaw Acres, in Wyoming, provided by plantation caretaker Vick 'Butch' Deer. In it she recalled that 'Walker 'Skipper' Inman Jr made them stay down in the. basement all the time’. Glamorous: Doris Duke, a New York socialite who died in 1993, was known as the 'richest girl in the world' for her trust funds left to her by her father, who founded American Tobacco. 'Richest girl in the world': Doris Duke lived her entire adult life as the subject of news and gossip pages. Her wealth, philanthropy and multiple marriages made her one of the most famous women of her day. Heir to a fortune: This chart shows how the twins are in line to inherit a 1billion tobacco fortune. 'The basement was covered in faeces,. and it was smeared all over, and it smelled terrible. It was so bad that. I wouldn’t leave a dog in that condition.’ Several others said the kids were. locked in their room each night, and, according to a former nanny,. 'There was food strewn across the floor and a foul smell from where the. kids had been relieving themselves in a corner.' The cruel father — who received an estimated 90,000 monthly inheritance — got custody of the kids in 2000 when they were two years old. He had custody until he died from a meth overdose in 2010. Daisha Inman is now embroiled in a court battle over the twins¿ trust funds. The twins now live with their mother Daisha Inman, Walker’s third wife, in a 20,000-a month Utah rental. Inman is currently locked in a vicious legal battle with executives from Citibank and JPMorgan — who administer the twins’ trust funds thought to be worth 60million — in Manhattan Surrogate’s Court over her handling of their inheritance. Titled 'Poorest Rich Kids in the World', the article includes horrified recollections from employees who worked at Walker’s estates and saw first-hand how the children were treated. One incident described within the article, details how Walker’s fifth wife, Daralee, crashed into a tree while drink-driving the children to school at 7.30am. But amidst the savage cruelty, Georgina reveals glimpses of extraordinary privilege. The children had a pet lion cub and brought diamonds to school for show-and-tell, but they looked malnourished with dark circles under their eyes to the stream of nannies who cared for them. The staggering wealth and extreme neglect and abuse created a warped environment for the youngsters to grow up in. And they are still living a cloistered life, having never played the childhood game Musical Chairs, and still believing in Father Christmas. 'Dear Santa, I know I haven’t been good,. but if you do come all I want is to say hi to you in person,' Patterson. recently wrote to the mythical character, according to Rolling Stone, in. the shaky handwriting of a first-grader. Georgia. claims she once spotted the bearded man in the flesh, but it’s more. likely the vision was an apparition of her late father, who’s haunted. her since his untimely passing. 'I think he’s here,' she whispered during the magazine interview, gesturing to an empty chair in her new Utah home. Uprooted: The twins now live with their mother Daisha Inman, Walker¿s third wife, in a 20,000-a month Utah home. Walker’s fondest memory of their father. was when he intentionally set off a tear-gas grenade in the house as. part of a whacked-out safety lesson. Despite the detailed incidents of cruelty, authorities did not act to remove the children from their abusers, according to a report in the New York Post. Wyoming law-enforcement never filed charges against the Inmans, who lavished local staff with exorbitant salaries and benefits. When Walker brought his family to the South Carolina plantation, the Department of Social Services logged three reports about the crazy clan. In one incident, police were called to a restaurant after Georgia’s dad slapped her so hard, fellow diners feared for her life. The troubled duo were sent to a mental hospital for three months of recovery from a childhood of trauma. And they’ve yet to fully heal. Both teens have recently contemplated suicide and suffered from anorexia. Daisha’s plans for her kids’ future? Pairing them up with fellow fatherless children with a similar amount of baggage. 'She’s working on getting the twins together with Michael Jackson’s kids, with whom she thinks they’d have tons in common,' the article concludes. Doris Duke inherited untold millions from her father James 'Buck' Duke - the founder of American Tobacco, maker of Lucky Strike cigarettes. His massive gift to a small, private college in North Carolina led leaders there to change its name to Duke University. The huge sum resulted in Duke becoming one of the most elite universities in the country. Doris Duke, who died in 1993, left a large philanthropic legacy, as well. She was know during her time as 'the richest girl in the world' and was a superstar celebrity and socialite for most of her life. On her death, she left nearly all of her 1billon estate to the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, which remains a major force in the philanthropic world. However, Doris Duke had no surviving biological children and part of the Duke fortune went into trust funds for the Inman twins.

Step 1: Assess the situation Jeffrey observed that Donald would consistently come late to class, making a ruckus as he entered. He would also talk loudly to other classmates during the sessions, disturbing their focus and concentration. Step 2: Address the issue Jeffrey decided to talk to Donald privately after class. He explained the importance of punctuality, quietness, and respecting others in the class. Step 3: Monitor behavior Unfortunately, Donald's behavior did not change, and it even started affecting other students' progress and enjoyment of the practice. Step 4: Set consequences Jeffrey, feeling a responsibility toward his other students, decided to give Donald an ultimatum: either adhere to the class rules or leave the class. Step 5: Enforce consequences When Donald failed to follow the rules, Jeffrey had no choice but to ask him to leave the class in order to maintain the peaceful atmosphere for the rest of his students. Step 6: Reflect and learn Jeffrey contemplated how to prevent disruptive behavior in the future. He decided to incorporate a section in the class on the philosophy of yoga and its values to enhance mutual respect and understanding among his students. In the end, although Jeffrey hoped that Donald would change and continue on his yoga journey, the well-being of the entire class had to come first.

Question 2: Can ibuprofen be crushed? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1: Is 800 mg of ibuprofen more effective than 4 x 200mg of ibuprofen? If so, why? In terms of the total dose, 800 mg of ibuprofen is equivalent to 4 x 200 mg of ibuprofen. However, it is important to consider factors such as dosing schedule, rate of absorption, and the potential for side effects when comparing these two options. One potential difference between taking a single 800 mg dose and taking four 200 mg doses is the rate at which ibuprofen is absorbed into your system. When you take a larger dose, such as 800 mg, the concentration of the drug in your system may reach a higher peak, which could potentially result in greater efficacy. However, this may also be associated with a higher risk of side effects, particularly gastrointestinal issues, which are more common with higher doses of NSAIDs like ibuprofen. On the other hand, taking four separate doses of 200 mg ibuprofen may provide more sustained relief over a longer period of time, because the drug is being introduced into your system more gradually. In this case, you would ideally space out the doses evenly throughout the day for maximum efficacy. This approach could potentially lead to fewer side effects, as lower doses may be more gentle on your gastrointestinal system. Ultimately, the choice between these two options would depend on factors such as the severity and duration of your pain, your individual susceptibility to side effects, and any relevant medical advice from your healthcare provider. Question 2: Can ibuprofen be crushed? Ibuprofen tablets can be crushed if you have difficulty swallowing them whole. However, it is important to note that some formulations of ibuprofen, particularly extended-release or enteric-coated tablets, should not be crushed or chewed. Crushing these types of tablets can cause them to release their active ingredient too quickly, which may lead to increased side effects or reduced effectiveness. If you are unsure whether it is safe to crush your ibuprofen tablets, consult your healthcare provider or pharmacist for guidance. To address your last question, Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is inquiring about the effectiveness and potential side effects of different dosing strategies for ibuprofen, while Question 2 relates to the physical alteration of ibuprofen tablets for ease of consumption."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the below context:  In the 1980s, a young guitarist called Euronymous forms a black metal band called Mayhem, the first of the genre in their country of Norway, with Necrobutcher on bass, and  Manheim on drums. Manhein leaves and is soon replaced by new drummer Hellhammer and they recruit a new vocalist from Sweden called Dead, who exhibits self-destructive behavior, which he portrays during their live shows by cutting himself and bleeding on the audience, and throwing pig heads at the \\"posers\\". At a show filmed by their friend Metalion, the band meets a fan named Kristian, whom Euronymous initially looks down on. While home alone, Dead uses his personal knife to cut his arms and throat, and then uses Euronymous' shotgun to shoot himself in the forehead, leaving behind a suicide note. Euronymous returns home and finds the body but instead of calling the police, he takes photos of the body and moves the knife and shotgun around. After Dead's body is taken away, Euronymous gives necklaces to the other band members which he claims are pieces of Dead's skull; this disgusts Necrobutcher, prompting him to leave the band. Soon after, Euronymous starts his own black metal record label and opens a record shop called Helvete, which becomes a social hub for black-metallers like Metalion, Fenriz of Darkthrone, Faust of Emperor, and Kristian (who is now calling himself Varg Vikernes) of Burzum. They become known as the \\"Black Circle\\". After being mocked by an ego-driven Euronymous, Varg uses his anti-Christian beliefs as motivation to burn down a local church. When approached by Varg concerning his status as the leader of the Black Circle, Euronymous burns down a church with Faust and Varg accompanying. Euronymous recruits Varg as bassist, a guitarist called Blackthorn and a Hungarian vocalist, Attila Csihar, to record Mayhem's first album, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas.

Given the information provided in the previous sentences, we can reasonably infer that the youth team in question would be referring to Agger's early career. It is stated that Agger is returning to his former club and that he's Danish, which both point towards the club being Brondby, a well-known Danish soccer club. Additionally, when the story mentions that Agger has been signed by Brondby, this further provides context that confirms the logical conclusion is Brondby. The time frame, 1996, also matches up with Agger's age, making it a plausible start to his youth career.  So, the completed sentence would read: \\"Homecoming: The 29-year-old defender started his career with Brondby as a youth team player in 1996\\".  This completion adds value to the narrative, providing background information about Agger's connection with Brondby. It would highlight the significance of Agger's move back to Brondby, marking it not just as a shift in clubs, but as a return to his roots. This gives the news story a sense of coming full circle, detailing Agger's football journey from his early beginnings in the youth team to his professional career and now his return."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: What do apples, pears and oranges all have in common? If you answered that they are all fruits you are absolutely correct. If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing  an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%. In the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%.

Background: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

Coal is nonrenewable, and the sun is nonrenewable....A:","output":"The correct answer to this question is (C). Coal is nonrenewable, and the sun is renewable. Coal and the sun are two vastly different energy sources that have varying environmental impacts, availability, and extraction processes. Let's examine the differences between these energy sources in detail. Coal is a nonrenewable energy source as it takes millions of years to form from decaying plant material under high pressure and heat beneath the Earth's surface. Due to the significant amount of time required for coal to form and the rate at which we are consuming it, it is considered a finite resource. Moreover, the process of extracting and burning coal for energy production is associated with various environmental and health issues. Mining coal can cause land deformation, deforestation, and water pollution. Burning coal generates a significant amount of greenhouse gases contributing to climate change, as well as air pollutants like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, which can affect human health. On the other hand, the sun is a renewable energy source because it constantly emits energy in the form of sunlight, and it is estimated to continue burning for billions of years. Solar energy can be harnessed through solar panels that convert sunlight directly into electricity. Solar power generates clean energy, and it does not produce greenhouse gas emissions or harmful pollutants. As long as the sun shines, solar energy will be available, making it an inexhaustible source. In addition to their renewability, coal and the sun also have a significant difference in energy generation capacity and efficiency. Solar energy generation depends on the availability of sunlight, as such, there are variations in power output during night time or cloudy days. However, advancements in energy storage technology and a combination of diverse renewable energy sources can help address this issue. In contrast, coal-fired power plants generate a steady output of electricity, making them reliable for meeting base-load energy demand. Nevertheless, the environmental costs associated with coal make it an increasingly less favorable energy choice compared to renewable sources, such as solar energy. In conclusion, comparing coal and the sun as sources of energy, we can deduce that coal is nonrenewable, whereas the sun is a renewable source of energy. The environmental impacts, extraction processes, and availability of these two energy sources highlight the increasing importance of utilizing renewable and clean energy technologies to secure our energy future and mitigate the damaging effects on our planet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Grasslands occur naturally on all continents except Antarctica. Grasslands are found in most ecoregions of the Earth. For example, there are five terrestrial ecoregion classifications (subdivisions) of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome (ecosystem), which is one of eight terrestrial ecozones of the Earth's surface.  - An ecoregion (ecological region) is an ecologically and geographically defined area that is smaller than a bioregion, which in turn is smaller than an ecozone. All three of these are either less or greater than an ecosystem. Ecoregions cover relatively large areas of land or water, and contain characteristic, geographically distinct assemblages of natural communities and species. The biodiversity of flora, fauna and ecosystems that characterise an ecoregion tends to be distinct from that of other ecoregions. In theory, biodiversity or conservation ecoregions are relatively large areas of land or water where the probability of encountering different species and communities at any given point remains relatively constant, within an acceptable range of variation (largely undefined at this point).  - Martinique is an insular region of France located in the Lesser Antilles in the eastern Caribbean Sea, with a land area of and a population of 385,551 inhabitants as of January 2013.

In places where foliage is dense and plants are growing quickly, the index is high, represented in dark green. Regions where few plants grow have a low vegetation index, shown in tan. The index is based on measurements taken by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASAs Terra satellite. Areas where the satellite did not collect data are gray.  - Shrubland, scrubland, scrub or brush is a plant community characterised by vegetation dominated by shrubs, often also including grasses, herbs, and geophytes. Shrubland may either occur naturally or be the result of human activity. It may be the mature vegetation type in a particular region and remain stable over time, or a transitional community that occurs temporarily as the result of a disturbance, such as fire. A stable state may be maintained by regular natural disturbance such as fire or browsing. Shrubland may be unsuitable for human habitation because of the danger of fire. The term \\"shrubland\\" was first coined in 1903.  - Saint Lucia is a sovereign island country in the eastern Caribbean Sea on the boundary with the Atlantic Ocean.

Q:Context: Casey finished Robin's work, that Robin was suppose to do herself.  Question: How would Casey feel afterwards?  Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: would be delighted  B: happy  C: angry A:","output":"Step 1: Understand the context. Casey finished Robin's work, which Robin was supposed to do herself. Step 2: Analyze the situation. In the given context, Casey completed the work that was originally Robin's responsibility. It's important to consider that there may be various reasons for Casey finishing Robin's work, and the emotions can differ based on those reasons. The context does not provide any specific information about why Casey finished the work or Casey's personality, so we need to make assumptions based on the given information. Step 3: Evaluate the possible emotions in each answer choice. A: Delighted - This implies that Casey would feel very pleased about completing Robin's work. But there's not enough information in the context to say whether Casey would be pleased or not. B: Happy - This implies that Casey would feel some level of satisfaction after finishing Robin's work. But again, there's not enough information in the context to confirm this. C: Angry - This implies that Casey would be upset about having to do Robin's work, as Robin was supposed to do it herself. This is a more likely emotion since Casey had to do someone else's work (Robin's) without any clear motivation or incentives mentioned in the context. Step 4: Choose the best answer. Based on the analysis and considering the context, the answer would be C: angry. Since there is no clear reason for Casey to feel delighted or happy about completing Robin's work, it seems more likely that Casey would be angry about having to do someone else's work."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Waitrose is changing its offer for loyalty card members so they will have to buy something before being able to claim a \\"free tea or coffee\\" in store. The supermarket said it was just a \\"refinement\\" of the existing policy. But it has provoked mock outrage on social media from some of the chain's loyal shoppers. As one Twitter user put it: \\"A collective gasp from middle England as @waitrose announces you now have to *buy something* before indulging in free teas and coffees.\\" Another joked: \\"We will speak of this day for years to come. Social historians will trace the #Islington #Coffee #Riots to this act of betrayal!\\" The offer of a free hot beverage for myWaitrose members has not been without controversy. In 2014, Labour raised concerns about the promotion, claiming it was hurting independent traders nearby. The prime minister at the time, David Cameron, also gave his views on the issue, saying he could not see why people were complaining about it. A spokeswoman for the supermarket said the new policy was \\"just a refinement\\" for its customers. \\"From 3 April, we'll simply be asking myWaitrose members to make a purchase before collecting their cup at the checkout,\\" the company said in an email to myWaitrose members. Waitrose started to try out the new approach in 15 stores last year, and now it has decided to roll out the policy nationwide. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning But for those who might have been sneaking in the odd free cup of coffee, there is some good news. The supermarket said there would be no minimum spend to claim the hot drink. \\"A free tea or coffee has always been one of the ways we thank our customers for shopping with us - and that has not changed - we are underlining our commitment to this much-loved offer,\\" the supermarket's spokeswoman said. The obvious one. From October 2015, shoppers started being charged 5p for every new plastic bag they used at large stores in England. The charge provoked fury, and bag-hoarding, among some shoppers at the time. But official figures have suggested it has been effective. The number of single-use plastic bags used by shoppers in England plummeted by more than 85% in the first six months, according to the government. Before Easyjet and Ryanair rewrote the rules on short-haul air travel, passengers could take their free drink and snack for granted. But in January this year, British Airways signalled that era was well and truly over when it ended the practice on its shorter flights. Customers on its domestic and European flights now have to pay for food and drinks from an on-board menu. At petrol stations, at least, air is no longer free. Drivers need to pay a small charge to fill up their tyres. The charge has been around for a while, but Tesco angered some drivers last year, when it increased the minimum price to use the pumps from 20p to 50p. The supermarket says it re-invests the revenue to ensure that the air machines are working correctly.

Summarize this article: An avalanche near McBride, B.C., has killed five snowmobilers, say local authorities.      RCMP say they were notified of two separate GPS beacon activations in the Renshaw area east of McBride around 1:30 p.m. PT, at which point they activated the Robson Valley Search and Rescue Team.      There were at least three separate groups of snowmobilers caught in the slide, say RCMP. Six to eight people lost their snowmobiles and had to be shuttled off the mountain.

Ryan Joseph Giggs, OBE (ne Wilson; born 29 November 1973) is a Welsh football coach and former player. He is the manager of the Wales national team and a co-owner of Salford City. He played his entire professional career for Manchester United. The son of rugby union, and Wales international rugby league footballer Danny Wilson, Giggs was born in Cardiff but moved to Manchester at the age of six when his father joined Swinton RLFC. In October 2010, Giggs said he would \\"probably finish [his] career here [Old Trafford],\\" and that he could not see himself \\"dropping down leagues and playing at a lesser level.\\" He said he wanted to go into coaching, describing the management of Manchester United or Wales as \\"the two ultimate jobs,\\" and stating that he was halfway through his UEFA 'A' coaching licence.  Ahead of his testimonial in 2011, Gary Neville revealed he would spend the proceeds towards a supporters club and hotel near Old Trafford. Despite objections from Manchester United, Neville's plans were approved in 2012. In 2013, Giggs and Neville launched a hospitality company named GG Hospitality, with plans to build football-themed hotels and cafes around the United Kingdom, initially in Manchester and London. The first operation was a football-themed restaurant named Cafe Football in Stratford, London, which opened in November 2013, with Hotel Football, previously under the guise of the supporters club Neville announced in 2011, scheduled to be opened in late 2014.  In 2014, it was announced that Giggs, along with fellow Manchester United legends Gary Neville, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Phil Neville, had agreed a deal to purchase Salford City ahead of the 2014-15 season. with plans to get the club to the Football League. The group announced they would take part in a special friendly, with Salford facing a Class of '92 team. On 22 September, the group agreed to sell a 50% stake in the club to billionaire Peter Lim.  In November 2017, it was reported that Giggs had signed a consultancy deal with the Promotion Fund of Vietnamese Football Talents FC (PVF). The two-year deal would involve making two trips per year to Vietnam.  Along with other United players who won the 1992 FA Cup, Giggs has proposed a university in Greater Manchester, named University Academy 92 which would offer \\"broader courses than traditional degrees\\" and attract students who \\"otherwise might not go on to higher education\\".","output":"This text is about Ryan Joseph Giggs, a Welsh football coach, former player, and current manager of the Wales national team."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They might be hurt, and we want to help them, but we need to do it in the right way, so they don't get hurt even more. Today, we will learn about the safe steps we can take to move someone who needs help. Step 1: Pull the victim by their clothing First, let's say that our friend fell and isn't able to get up. We need to get them to a safe place. Look at their clothes, like their shirt, pants or jacket. Hold onto their clothes and start pulling them gently. This way, they won't get hurt as we are not directly touching their body. Step 2: Pull the victim by their arms or legs Sometimes, it's not easy to hold their clothes. So, we can also use their arms or legs to move them. Make sure to hold onto their wrists or ankles and not their hands or feet – this helps keep them safe and comfortable. Now, start pulling them slowly and gently. Step 3: Keep their neck and torso straight Our neck and torso are important parts of our body that we need to protect. When moving our friend, make sure their neck and the middle part of their body are straight. This helps avoid putting too much stress on those parts and keeps them safe while we move them. Step 4: Pull them in a straight line As we are moving our friend, we should try our best to pull them in a straight line. Imagine we're drawing a straight line on the ground with a giant pencil. This helps to keep our friend stable and comfortable during the move. Step 5: Use at least two people if you must roll the victim over Sometimes, we might need to roll our friend over, like when they're lying on their tummy and need to be on their back. In this case, we should ask another person to help. With one person on each side, you both can hold the victim and gently roll them over together. Teamwork makes the job easier and safer for our friend. In conclusion, moving someone who needs help should be done carefully and gently. Remember to pull the victim by their clothing or limbs, keep their neck and torso straight, pull them in a straight line, and use teamwork when needed. By following these steps, we can be great helpers and make sure our friends stay safe and comfortable."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Headlines Father Sentenced to 40 Years in Prison for Murdering Daughter's Sexual Abuser Jay Maynor, left, was sentenced to four decades behind bars for murdering convicted sex offender Raymond Brooks, 59. (Cullman County Sheriff's Office                        An Alabama man has been sentenced to 40 years in prison for murdering his daughter’s sexual abuser.      Jay Maynor, 43, pleaded guilty to the shooting death of Raymond Earl Brooks, 59, two years ago in Cullman, about 50 miles north of Birmingham.      Thirteen years earlier, Brooks had pleaded guilty to sexually abusing Maynor’s 8-year-old daughter, who was also Brooks’ adopted granddaughter.      Brooks served 27 months for that crime before he was released on parole. He was a registered sex offender.      Maynor’s daughter, who is now 24 and the mother of three, said her dad snapped that day in 2014 after she argued with him over Brooks, AL.com reported.      Her dad got on his motorcycle and drove to a convenience store, where he fired several rounds inside while trying to hit a man who had been dating his stepdaughter and allegedly had been abusing the woman, she said.      Maynor didn’t hit anyone, and took off for Brooks’ home, where he shot the man twice, killing him as he stood in his front yard, authorities said.      Maynor’s daughter said he pleaded guilty so she wouldn’t have to testify about being abused by Brooks over several years, until she finally told someone about it at age 8.      “My father was protecting me, like a father should do,” she told the news site. “He is an amazing father, actually the best. He loves us so much.”      InsideEdition.com does not identify sexual abuse victims.      Her father also pleaded guilty to attempted murder in the store shooting and was sentenced to 20 years, to be served concurrently with his murder sentence.      The daughter says her father’s punishment is too harsh.      “I’m going through hell,” she said.

Julia Maynor was sexually assaulted many times between the ages of 4 and 9 by a man she knew well – her maternal grandfather, Raymond Brooks.      Advertisement      “I've tried counseling and that didn't work and it's still here today. I relive it every day. I struggle to get out of bed in the morning,” Maynor said.      Brooks was sentenced for those crimes in 2002, and was released from prison after 27 months of a 5 year sentence.      In June 2014, Julia Maynor's father, Jay Maynor, got revenge for his daughter -- he shot and killed Brooks. Jay Maynor was sentenced to 40 years in prison Monday after pleading guilty to the crime.      For Julia Maynor, the new reminders of abuse followed by murder are crushing.      “I’ve overcome PTSD for a little while and now I’m having to re-overcome something that hasn’t happened in 14, 15, 16 years,” Julia Maynor said.      She’s now contemplating divorce even as she raises small children.      “I just thought it was better to separate than to keep making him miserable with my miserable life,” Julia Maynor said.      For Julia Maynor and her family, there may never be a semblance of normal life. After all, there have been countless therapy sessions and countless tears shed, and there are still ethical questions expressed by her mom.      Cindy Hudson said she understands the motive for the killing, but said, “I do feel that God's the only one who’s supposed to take someone that's supposed to punish anybody.”      Julia Maynor knows her dad is facing the consequence of revenge, but said if someone attacked her children, “I would do it with no questions asked. No matter how many years I would lose, I would do it.”      AlertMe ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Once upon a time, a very naughty man named Raymond Brooks did very bad things to a little girl named Julia. Julia's Grandpa, Brooks, had gone to jail for those bad things for only a little more than 2 years before coming out again. Julia's Daddy, Jay Maynor, was very upset about what happened to his little girl.  One day, after an argument with Julia, Daddy Maynor got so angry that he decided to do something about it. He rode his motorcycle to the store, where Julia's step-sister's boyfriend - who was also mean - was, and tried to shoot him, but he didn't hit anyone. Then Daddy Maynor went to Grandpa Brooks' house and shot him twice, which made Grandpa Brooks die. Daddy Maynor admitted to the police that he did these things so his daughter, Julia, wouldn't have to talk about the bad things Grandpa Brooks did to her in court. Because he admitted it, he was sent to jail for 40 years. Plus, he would get 20 extra years if he did anything bad again in the store. Now, Julia feels very, very sad. She thinks her dad got punished too much by the judge for trying to protect her. She said her dad loves her and her brothers and sisters very much and he is the best dad. She is having a hard time with life and isn't sure if she wants to stay married and is finding it tough to get out of bed because of the bad memories.  Julia's mom understands why Daddy Maynor did what he did but believes that only God should decide such big punishments. Julia, though, said that if any bad person tried to hurt her children, she would do the same thing her dad did without thinking twice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

News article: Antares Rocket Explosion Leaves Questions and Dead Mosquito Eggs No people were hurt when a rocket taking supplies to the International Space Station exploded just after launching Tuesday night — but the mosquito eggs did not survive. Julia Ellis, 13, was across the bay from the launching pad on Wallops Island, Va., less than two miles away, watching as the rocket lifted off. Amid the 5,000 pounds of cargo was an experiment that she and four classmates at Columbia Middle School in Berkeley Heights, N.J., had devised to study whether mosquito larvae can grow in zero gravity. “Everyone was just so excited and happy,” she said. “You could hear everyone cheering.” Then there was a flash, and the rocket fell. “It feels like someone smacked you in the chest,” she said. “You hear one small explosion, one really large explosion and then two small explosions.” On Wednesday, investigators started looking through the wreckage of the Antares rocket, built by the Orbital Sciences Corporation of Dulles, Va., one of two private companies that NASA relies on to take cargo to the station. Four previous Antares launches, three of which went to the space station, were successful. During a conference call with financial analysts, David W. Thompson, Orbital’s chairman and chief executive, said the rocket experienced a catastrophic failure about 15 seconds after liftoff, destroying the rocket and its payload. “It appears that the launch complex itself was spared from any major damage,” he said. Garrett E. Pierce, the company’s chief financial officer, said the failure would not affect the company’s finances this year, because insurance would cover repairs to the launching site and the payments from NASA that might be held back. Orbital has a 1.9 billion contract from NASA for eight cargo flights, or 237 million each. NASA officials said the loss would have no immediate effect on the operations of the space station, which has several months of supplies. A Russian cargo rocket successfully launched on Wednesday, as scheduled, and docked at the space station six hours later. Among the items lost in the Antares explosion were a suite of student experiments arranged by NanoRacks, a small company in Houston that flies commercial payloads to the space station. Also lost were 29 nanosatellites, the largest weighing about 22 pounds, that the company had arranged to be launched from the space station. Jeffrey Manber, NanoRacks’s managing director, spent the day like an airline customer service agent trying to rebook passengers from a canceled flight. An Antares rocket, carrying an unmanned spacecraft for NASA, exploded shortly after launch. “We’re sitting here right now working through the needs of our customers,” Mr. Manber said. “What are the priorities of the payloads? Who can rebuild? Who’s ready to go?” SpaceX, the other company that NASA has hired to ferry cargo, completed its most recent flight to the station last week, and its next rocket is scheduled to launch in December. Mr. Manber said some of the rebuilt student experiments could be on that flight. Mr. Thompson said he expected that the next Antares launch, set for April, would be delayed by several months. While he said it was too early to speculate on why the Antares crashed, Mr. Thompson added: “It will likely not take very long — I think a period measured in days, not weeks — for the investigation team to define the handful of most likely causes of the accident. It may take a little longer than that to zero in on the final root cause.” Certain to be scrutinized are the two engines in the rocket’s first stage. They were built in the Soviet Union in the late 1960s and early 1970s to power a giant rocket to go to the moon. After NASA’s successful moon landings, the Soviets abandoned their effort, and the engines lay in storage for decades. Then an American company, Aerojet, bought and refurbished them, and Orbital incorporated them into the Antares design. One of the engines failed during testing in May, delaying the previous Antares flight. Orbital officials said the company was considering accelerating its plans to replace the old Soviet engines. Orbital has had two other high-profile NASA failures in recent years. In 2009, NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory on top of Orbital’s Taurus XL rocket was lost when the nose cone protecting the satellite failed to separate, and the satellite crashed into the ocean. Two years later, a similar failure destroyed NASA’s Glory satellite, which was to have made climate observations.

The Antares rocket explosion occurred just after launching on Tuesday night. This rocket, built by the Orbital Sciences Corporation, was taking supplies to the International Space Station. No people were hurt, but the cargo, including a student experiment to study if mosquito larvae can grow in zero gravity, was destroyed. 2. The Antares rocket has had four previous successful launches, three of which went to the space station. This launch experienced a catastrophic failure about 15 seconds after liftoff. 3. Orbital Sciences Corporation is one of two private companies that NASA relies on to take cargo to the International Space Station; the other is SpaceX. Orbital has a 1.9 billion contract from NASA for eight cargo flights, or 237 million each. 4. The rocket explosion will not have an immediate effect on the operations of the space station, which has several months of supplies. A Russian cargo rocket was successfully launched and docked at the space station the following day. 5. Among the items lost in the Antares explosion were a suite of student experiments arranged by NanoRacks, a small company in Houston that flies commercial payloads to the space station, and 29 nanosatellites. 6. An investigation has begun to determine the cause of the Antares rocket explosion. The two engines in the rocket’s first stage, built in the Soviet Union in the late 1960s and early 1970s, will be scrutinized. These engines were designed to power a giant rocket to go to the moon but were later abandoned and lay in storage for decades before being purchased, refurbished, and incorporated into the Antares design by Aerojet. 7. Orbital Sciences Corporation has had previous high-profile NASA failures, including the loss of NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory on top of Orbital’s Taurus XL rocket in 2009 and the destruction of NASA’s Glory satellite in 2011."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is there some sort of magic involved?\\" Seba shook his head. \\"There is no magic, Gavner. It is a rare gift that few possess, formed through a deep connection with the creatures. Darren has achieved this bond through a mutual understanding, respect, and a shared language of sorts. He can sense their emotions and thoughts, and they can detect his own. This connection allows them to communicate and work together.\\" Kurda, feeling a bit left out, chimed in. \\"But how did Darren acquire this gift? Was he born with it, or did he learn it from someone?\\" Seba smiled, a note of pride shining in his eyes. \\"It is a talent he discovered and nurtured in himself. He spent countless hours observing and interacting with spiders, both in the wild and in captivity. Through patience and tenacity, he gradually formed a bond with them. It is a skill that requires immense dedication and empathy to master.\\" Gavner seemed both impressed and envious. He couldn't help but ask, \\"Might I be able to learn it as well? Is it a skill that can be taught?\\" Seba considered the question for a moment before replying. \\"It is not impossible, Gavner. However, it would require significant time, effort, and perhaps most importantly, an open mind and heart. Not everyone is capable of forging such a relationship with spiders, and fewer still have the patience to try. But if you genuinely wished to attempt it, I would not discourage you from doing so.\\" Kurda gave Gavner a playful nudge. \\"Perhaps one day, you'll be as talented as Darren, my friend. I'd certainly find that fascinating.\\" Gavner managed a small smile, though it was clear he was still somewhat sobered by the realization of just how unique and rare Darren's gift truly was. He glanced over at Darren, who was still surrounded by the arachnid horde, working in tandem with them to accomplish complex tasks. There was a newfound admiration in his eyes, mingled with the desire to prove himself. As the three continued to watch Darren, they couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at his incredible ability to communicate with and control the spiders. It served as a reminder of the vast potential that lay within them all, just waiting to be discovered and developed.

Ceramic can be used to insulate power lines. We had his bedroom insulated before winter came. Pick your answer from: [1]. different meanings. [2]. the same meaning...Answer:","output":"[2]. the same meaning... In both sentences, to \\"insulate\\" refers to the action of applying a material or structure to prevent the loss or gain of heat (or in some cases, electricity) and to improve energy efficiency.  In the case of \\"Ceramic can be used to insulate power lines,\\" ceramic is being used as an insulating material to prevent the loss of electrical energy through heat. Electrical power lines can get very hot due to the electrical resistance, and using an insulator like ceramic means less energy is wasted, increasing the efficiency of the power network. In the sentence \\"We had his bedroom insulated before winter came,\\" the term \\"insulated\\" refers to the addition of insulative materials to the walls, ceiling, or floors of a room to prevent heat loss. By doing this, the room remains relatively warmer than it would be without insulation. This is especially beneficial in the winter months when the external temperatures are much lower. Therefore, while the application type is different—one is for electrical energy and the other for thermal energy—the basic concept of insulating to prevent energy loss is the same in both contexts.

Given the question: I can use this background: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators.  Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4]  Now, I have a new situation: Two coastal communities  on two neighboring gulfs took different approaches to  bringing more money into the local economy. Davin village continued with commercial fishing and agriculture, while the village of Forx decided to mine sand from the nearby dunes, because it was very profitable. They did not think about the effect it would have on the environment.  Answer this question please: Which village harmed less fisheries? The answer is:","output":"Davin village harmed less fisheries. This conclusion can be drawn from the background information and the given situation. Davin village chose to continue with commercial fishing and agriculture as methods to bring more money into the local economy. In contrast, Forx village decided to mine sand from the nearby dunes, without considering the potential negative effects on the environment. As mentioned in the background information, sand mining can have detrimental consequences on the local environment and wildlife. In particular, the disturbance of underwater and coastal sand from sand mining increases the turbidity of the water. This turbidity is harmful to various organisms, such as coral, that require sunlight to survive. Additionally, the destruction of coastal barriers, like dunes, can lead to flooding in beachside areas and negatively impact tourism. Furthermore, sand mining can directly affect fisheries by destroying their habitat. As coastal sand is removed and the underwater environment is disturbed, the fisheries can lose the suitable areas they need to thrive. Consequently, this can lead to a decline in the overall fish population and, potentially, damage the financial well-being of the fisheries themselves. On the other hand, Davin village continued with commercial fishing, which, if followed sustainable practices and adhered to regional regulations, would have less negative effects on the fisheries compared to sand mining. Agriculture, if properly managed, can also contribute to the local economy without causing significant harm to fisheries. In summary, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that Davin village has harmed less fisheries than Forx village by focusing on commercial fishing and agriculture, rather than engaging in environmentally harmful sand mining activities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, the teacher that I remember most was Mrs. Green from Marianna, Florida. She was my 5thgrade teacher. Since I was a new student, not only in her class, but at the school, she made my time there much more pleasant. I immediately began to like her. She was really funny and I knew that she liked me. She made learning fun. I remember one day for Christmas holidays, she taught us how to make ornaments  from eggs. My parents still have some of the ornaments I made. She made me leader for many group projects and that made me feel special. I think that would make any child feel special, especially when a child is in a new place with no friends. She made me want to be like that. Not to pick a \\"favorite\\" student, but to make every student feel that they are special. That year, I received the Presidential Academic Award  .

Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Dara and Jody sat on the sun-scorched concrete with their backs against the bus shelter. They were sharing an apple, one of those tart green ones, and as Dara took her turn gnashing into it, Jody gagged and vomited up some peel. 'Shit, are you okay?' Dara asked, rubbing Jody's back. 'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too. Looking at the little pile of fruit skin and foam brought on more laughter, and they were both suddenly breathless but unable to cease the spasms of laughter hiccupping up from their stomachs. They had to lean on each other to save falling over, and even the tut-tut tongue-clicking of the old Italian lady having to divert around them on the footpath could barely stop the infinite but elusive humour. The bus droning into the stop enabled them some composure, but once on board just looking at each other was enough to start it up again. This was the coolest day Dara had had in forever. Jody and her had decided to wag school just that morning before rollcall, and despite her anxiety -- this was actually the first time Dara had ever wagged -- she was so, so glad she did. They were both in Year 11, and had only become friends three months earlier. They were from totally different scenes at school, but one maths lesson had changed all that. Jody had borrowed someone's correction fluid -- in fact it was Mr Dickinson, the teacher's correction fluid -- but it was borrowed from someone who'd borrowed it from him. At the end of the lesson Jody was packing her stuff up and didn't know what to do with the bottle of white-out, so she tossed it out the window of the classroom. Dara had seen her do it, and thought it was just so cool.

Question: Who arrests Nicole and Michel? Movie title: Les Diaboliques Movie plot: The story takes place in a second-rate boarding school run by the tyrannical and mean Michel Delassalle (Meurisse). The school, though, is owned by Delassalle's teacher wife, the frail Christina (Clouzot), and Delassalle flaunts his relationship with Nicole Horner (Signoret), a teacher at the school. Rather than antagonism, the two women are shown to have a somewhat close relationship, primarily based on their apparent mutual hatred of Michel, who is physically and emotionally abusive to both.Unable to stand his mistreatment any longer, Nicole devises a plan. Though hesitant at first, Christina ultimately consents to help Nicole. Using a threatened divorce to lure Michel to Nicole's apartment building in a remote village several hundred kilometers away, Christina sedates him. The two women then drown him in a bathtub and dump his body in the school's neglected swimming pool. When his corpse floats to the surface, they think it will appear to have been an accident. Almost everything goes according to their plans until the body fails to surface, and Michel's corpse is nowhere to be found when the pool is drained.Nicole sees in the paper that the police found the corpse. Christina goes to the morgue and learns it is not Michel's body. There she meets Alfred Fichet (Vanel), a retired private detective. He gets involved in the case, much to Nicole's chagrin.When Christina and Alfred come back, a boy is punished for breaking a window; the boy says Michel punished him. After hearing this Christina becomes very sick. She is unable to be photographed for the school photo; however, it seems that Michel is in it, in the back next to a window. Nicole becomes worried and leaves the school. Christina, overcome by fear, tells Alfred everything. He does not believe her, but he investigates the pool. Christina hears some noises and wanders the school. She concludes that someone is in the school and she runs back to her room. She finds Michel's corpse in the bathtub. Michel rises from the tub, and Christina has a heart attack...","output":"Based on the movie plot you've provided for \\"Les Diaboliques,\\" there does not seem to be a clear instance of Nicole and Michel being arrested. As the story revolves around Christina and Nicole devising a plan to get rid of Michel - and subsequently facing the mysterious presence of Michel's seemingly missing corpse - their focus is more on dealing with the consequences of their actions and less on the involvement of law enforcement. However, there is a character in the story, Alfred Fichet, who is a retired private detective. Alfred is responsible for investigating the case further, as he becomes involved after Christina visits the morgue and learns that the found corpse is not Michel's body. While Alfred is not directly arresting either Nicole nor Michel, he does play a significant role in observing and questioning the events that have unfolded. Ultimately, the film delves into themes of deception, abuse, and the consequences of one's actions. As you decide whether or not to invest in this film proposal, it's important to consider factors such as the potential market for this story, the talent involved in the project, and the budget necessary to create a quality adaptation.

Goal: Pans Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? Choices: 1). can serve pizza adequately 2). can serve people adequately...I think the answer is","output":"In order to provide a detailed and long answer, it is important to first understand the goal and context of the situation. The goal, as mentioned, is \\"Pans.\\" Based on the context, it can be assumed that the goal is to identify which of the given choices is better suited for the purpose of using pans effectively, specifically in a setting where food (e.g., pizza) is served to people. The two provided choices: 1). Can serve pizza adequately 2). Can serve people adequately Before diving into the analysis of these two choices, it is important to understand the role of pans in food preparation and serving. Pans are versatile kitchen tools used for various cooking tasks, including frying, sautéing, baking, and more. They come in different sizes and materials, each with its own advantages and applications. In the context of pizza, serving pans specifically designed for pizza can ensure an optimal dining experience, as they can keep the pizza intact, warm, and easy to serve. Now, let's scrutinize the given choices: 1). Can serve pizza adequately: This choice focuses on the ability of the pan to serve pizza in the most appropriate manner. It suggests that a proper pan should be able to hold the pizza well, maintain its warmth, and make it easy to cut and serve. This method, in this context, seems directly related to the goal. 2). Can serve people adequately: This choice focuses on the ability of the pan to serve people properly. While this choice may also be relevant, it is less specific in terms of the conditions necessary for a pan to be considered effective for the purpose of serving food, especially when considering the goal which revolves around pans. By closely examining both choices, it appears that choice #1, \\"Can serve pizza adequately,\\" is more reasonable in accomplishing the goal of identifying the best usage of pans. This choice specifically addresses the requirements of a pan to effectively serve pizza, ensuring that the pizza remains in the best possible condition throughout the serving process. In contrast, choice #2 is rather vague concerning the functions and abilities required of a pan to serve people adequately. It also lacks a clear focus on the specific requirements that would be most relevant for a pan used in a food-serving context, such as with pizza. In conclusion, choice #1 – \\"Can serve pizza adequately\\" – is the more reasonable method for achieving the goal of determining the best utilization of pans in a food-serving setting. This choice takes into account the specific requirements for a pan to properly serve pizza, offering a more reliable and direct approach to evaluate the efficiency and functionality of a pan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article using the following points: Antonio Navarro pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute meth - clearing the way for the state to proceed on kidnapping and assault charges. He was one of four men who 'kidnapped two teenagers at gunpoint after they thought they had stolen drugs from them' They 'cut of one of the teen's fingers and threatened their families before releasing them when they realized they knew nothing about the robbery' Article:","output":"Title: Antonio Navarro Pleads Guilty to Drug Charges, Kidnapping and Assault Case to Proceed Antonio Navarro, a key figure in a high-profile case involving drug trafficking, kidnapping, and assault, has recently pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute methamphetamine. This admission of guilt clears the way for the state prosecution to proceed on the additional charges of kidnapping and assault, which hold significant weight and possible severe consequences for Navarro upon conviction. Navarro was one of four individuals implicated in the harrowing ordeal involving two teenage victims who were kidnaped at gunpoint, following a robbery in which the group believed the teens had played a part. According to investigators, Navarro and his associates mistakenly believed that the teens had stolen drugs from them, leading them to kidnap the frightened young individuals and subject them to a terrifying experience. During the abduction, one of the teen's fingers was cut off by the assailants, while both were subjected to continued threats against their families. It was only after a period of time that the criminals realized that their captives had no knowledge or involvement in the drug robbery, subsequently releasing them from their captivity. The subsequent arrest of Navarro and his co-conspirators offered some small solace to the victims and their families, many of whom experienced significant trauma as a result of the ordeal. The consequences of Navarro's guilty plea on the drug distribution charges are severe, though they pale in comparison to the potential sentences he could face as a result of the ongoing kidnapping and assault case. His guilty plea could also impact the outcomes of his associates who are either presently awaiting trial or have yet to enter a plea deal. The ramifications of these circumstances have many layers, including public sentiment surrounding the case, the high-profile and violent nature of the offenses, and ties to drug trafficking organizations that are increasingly under scrutiny by law enforcement authorities. Despite the complexities involved in these related cases, Navarro's guilty plea serves as an important development within the context of achieving justice for the two teenagers and their families. This significant move by Navarro places the state on firmer ground in their pursuit of the remaining charges, which could, in turn, yield substantial sentences for the defendants should they be found guilty. As the case against Antonio Navarro and his co-conspirators continues to unravel, we are reminded of the chilling consequences that criminal activity, particularly those connected to drug distribution networks, can have on innocent lives. This horrific incident is an alarming illustration of the devastating impact of drug-related crime on communities and reinforces the need for law enforcement authorities to remain vigilant in their pursuit of justice, ensuring the safety and well-being of the public. In conclusion, Antonio Navarro's recent guilty plea in his drug distribution charge serves as an essential milestone in the case revolving around his suspected involvement in the violent kidnapping and assault of two innocent teenagers. As the state gears up to prosecute these grave charges, Navarro and his associates could face significant prison sentences if found guilty. The eventual judgments in this case will likely reverberate throughout the community, prompting wider discussions on drug crime, victim support, and crime prevention initiatives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the context provided, it is not unusual for royalty to have beautifully designed and maintained gardens near their palaces or living quarters. These gardens often serve both functional and aesthetic purposes, providing a relaxing and serene place for the king to enjoy and perhaps entertain guests or discuss important matters. The other options are not as directly related to the idea of a courtyard: A. Palace: The palace is undoubtedly close to the courtyard, but since the king is already within his palace grounds, it is logical to assume the question is asking about a specific area or feature near the courtyard. Therefore, a garden would be a more fitting answer in this context. C. Country estate: A country estate would not be \\"near\\" in the intended sense, as it would likely be a separate property located in a rural area, perhaps quite some distance from the palace. D. Large house: A large house could be nearby if it is part of the royal grounds or belongs to one of the king's important subjects. However, it would not be directly related to the back courtyard itself. The focus is on the king's act of strolling, so a garden would be more relevant as it provides a natural setting for such an activity. E. Suburbs: Suburbs are residential neighborhoods located outside of a city center, and it is highly unlikely that they would be situated near a king's back courtyard. Additionally, this option does not provide any clues or insight into where the king might be strolling, which is the focus of the question. In conclusion, based on the presented context, option B. garden would be the most suitable and logical choice for answering the question about where the king was strolling near in his back courtyard.

Fibre-optic sensors embedded in shallow trenches within slopes could help detect and monitor both large landslides and slow slope movements. Usually, electrical sensors have been used for monitoring the risk of landslides, but these sensors can be easily damaged. Fibre-optic sensors are more robust, economical and sensitive, say researchers at the department of industrial and information engineering at the Second University of Naples. A widely used monitoring technique used around the world involves installing an inclinometer inside a borehole. The instrument measures angles of slope, elevation, or depression of an object with respect to gravity. The new technology, however, has a few advantages over electrical sensors. The fibre-optic sensors placed in the ground bend with any shift in the land mass and register the movement as a loss of light. \\"Distributed optical fibre sensors can act as a ‘nervous system' of slopes by measuring the tensile strain of the soil they're embedded within,\\" said Prof. Luigi Zeni, whose team will be presenting the new tool on Oct. 21 at a conference in Tucson, Ariz., held by the American Physical Society Division of Laser Science and the Washington-based Optical Society Taking it a step further, Zeni and his colleagues worked out a way of combining several types of fibre-optic sensors into a plastic tube that twists and moves under the forces of pre-failure strains. Researchers are then able to monitor the movement and bending of the optical fibre remotely to determine if a landslide is imminent. The use of fibre-optic sensors \\"allows us to overcome some limitations of traditional inclinometers, because fibre-based ones have no moving parts and can withstand larger soil deformations,\\" Zeni said. These sensors can be used to cover large areas — several square kilometres — to pinpoint slope failures or early deformations. It’s estimated that every year landslides kill more than 4,500 people and injure thousands of others around the world. They are stark examples of how nature can wipe out entire communities within seconds. The landslide that struck Vargas state in Venezuela in December 1999, for example, killed as many as 30,000 people and erased entire towns from the map without warning. Two weeks of non-stop rain had weakened one side of the Avila mountain, causing the slide.","output":"Scientists in Italy have created a tool that might be able to predict landslides by noticing little changes in the soil. They put special sensors called \\"fibre-optic sensors\\" into the ground which can feel when the soil moves and sends a signal that something might be wrong. This new technology is stronger and cheaper than older ways and might help protect people living near hills and mountains where landslides can happen. Every year, landslides hurt or kill thousands of people, so this new tool can help keep them safe by giving a warning before a landslide happens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One end of the shoring plank was yet held by the upright placed in the center of the cutting, and it remained at an angle, although pinning him down, while the earth covered him completely.

Given the question: I saw one last night on an episode of Designated Survivor. To qualify this, I’m not normally bothered by product placements. Sometimes they can even add to the scene. But this one was bad, really bad. Agent is busy hunting for baddies. Finishes questioning one naughty person who climbs in his Ford F150 and speeds off. So far, so good - it is the sort of vehicle a country-living billionaire bad-guy would drive. The agent then pulls out her phone and… Move to close up of phone screen showing Ford app already loaded (and screen unlocked!). Agent slowly moves finger to app. Does something. Pause as app does fancy graphics. Cut to car interior. Shot of dash, showing Ford logo on steering wheel. It’s bright blue - are they not normally grey or more subtle? Pause for a second… Zoom in on dash. Dash light up. Car starts. Show pretty dash lights for a second or so. Cut to agent Agent walks to car, gets in drives off. Lingering shot of rear of car. It was just so clumsy. Massive halt to the flow of the scene to show it. In most films you never see anyone starting cars, putting on seatbelts or similar unless this is part of the plot because it’s unnecessary and not interesting to watch. I sort of expected the remote start function to have some sort of relevance later… but no, it was totally ignored. Added to that: There was no password or security on her phone - and this is an agent investigating super secret stuff. If you don’t show her unlocking the phone, why show her lovingly prodding the app? They are as relevant. She unlocked and started the car while she was 20–30 paces away, on the grounds of a suspect ranch. Someone could easily have jumped in the car. Not very security conscious. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: The agent pulled out her phone Options: - after the naughty person climbed in his Ford F150 and sped off - before the naughty person climbed in his Ford F150 and sped off - at the same time that the naughty person climbed in his Ford F150 as sped off - not enough information The answer is:","output":"- after the naughty person climbed in his Ford F150 and sped off"},{"instruction":"What might someone do who is having fun?

Movie title: Confessions Movie plot: Junior high school teacher Yuko Moriguchi (Takako Matsu) announces to her class that she will resign before spring break. Moriguchi reveals that because the HIV-positive biological father of her daughter Manami was ill, she used to bring Manami (Mana Ashida) to school with her. One day, after school, she returned to the room where Manami was but found her gone. Her daughter was later found drowned in a school swimming pool. She then explains that two pupils in her class, whom she dubs \\"Student A\\" and \\"Student B\\", have murdered her four-year-old daughter. She had found a small bunny purse amongst Manami's belongings which should not have belonged there, which led her to question Shuya, one of her students. Shuya, who immediately admitted killing Manami, mocked her compassionate reaction to his feigned expression of remorse with \\"just kidding\\". Having revealed their identities, she explained that because the killers, as minors, are protected by the Juvenile Law of 1947, turning them in wouldn't make a difference. So to exact revenge on them, she admits injecting her late daughter's biological father's HIV-contaminated blood in the milk cartons of the two students who she claimed to have murdered her daughter. The rest of the film switches between the aftermath of Moriguchi's confession and the events before the confession through a series of first-person narratives from Moriguchi and her three students. Naoki Shimomura (Kaoru Fujiwara), Student B, becomes a shut-in because he believes he has acquired AIDS from drinking HIV-contaminated milk. His mother (Yoshino Kimura), after spotting the hidden malicious messages in well-wishes cards from Naoki's classmates, realizes her son was somehow involved with an earlier incident. She decides to commit murder-suicide to free her son and herself from torment, but in the ensuing struggle, Naoki kills her. The police arrest him for the murder. Shuya Watanabe (Yukito Nishii), Student A, explains that his mother abused him before leaving to pursue her scientific ambitions....

By the time we were about to reach our house, we spot two dogs, a German Shepherd and a Husky, both male, on the other side of the street sniffing around with no owner in sight. I was ready to hightail out of there with my dog, but I knew if I ran they would chase, so we formed a wall in front of her to hide her. Of course she decides to stick out her head and start barking. Those two dogs whipped their heads so fast and came running towards us to see her. Since she is a puppy she has zero impulse control and starts throwing herself at them, at their backs, face, plus the fact that she doesn’t like being sniffed at her rear (which they are trying very hard to get to).

Salvatore obviously shies from committed relationships and has not been to his home village of Giancaldo, Sicily in 30 years. As his girlfriend asks him who Alfredo is, Salvatore flashes back to his childhood. It is a few years after World War II. Six-year-old Salvatore is the mischievous, intelligent son of a war widow. Nicknamed Toto, he discovers a love for films and spends every free moment at the movie house Cinema Paradiso. Although they initially start off on tense terms, he develops a friendship with the fatherly projectionist, Alfredo, who takes a shine to the young boy and often lets him watch movies from the projection booth. During the shows, the audience can be heard booing when there are missing sections, causing the films to suddenly jump, bypassing a critical romantic kiss or embrace. The local priest had ordered these sections censored, and the deleted scenes are piled on the projection room floor. At first, Alfredo considers Toto a bit of a pest, but eventually he teaches Salvatore to operate the film projector. The montage ends as the movie house catches fire (highly flammable nitrate film was in routine use at the time) as Alfredo was projecting The Firemen of ViggiÃ¹ after hours, on the wall of a nearby house. Salvatore saves Alfredo's life, but not before some film reels explode in Alfredo's face, leaving him permanently blind. The Cinema Paradiso is rebuilt by a town citizen, Ciccio, who invests his football lottery winnings. Salvatore, still a child, is hired as the new projectionist, as he is the only person who knows how to run the machines. About a decade later, Salvatore, now in high school, is still operating the projector at the Cinema Paradiso.

The review: Title: Disappointing Experience at The Breezy Bistro I had high hopes for The Breezy Bistro after reading some positive reviews online, but my experience there left much to be desired. Upon arrival, the restaurant appeared to be in disarray, with crowded tables and chairs haphazardly placed throughout the dining area. This made it difficult to navigate and created an unwelcoming atmosphere. The staff seemed to be overwhelmed by the number of customers, resulting in slow and inattentive service. At one point, we had to wait for more than 20 minutes for our drink refills and another 10 minutes just to get the attention of our server. The food, while not terrible, was mediocre at best. I ordered their surf and turf special, and the steak was overcooked, while the shrimp lacked flavor. My dining partner's grilled vegetable dish was forgettable, consisting of limp, under-seasoned vegetables. It's a shame that our experience was so underwhelming, as the restaurant has potential with its lovely location by the water. I hope The Breezy Bistro can address these issues and improve for future patrons. For now, though, I cannot recommend dining there.

What is the answer: The Mont Blanc Tunnel joins which two countries?","output":"The Mont Blanc Tunnel is a significant infrastructure that connects two European countries: France and Italy. This high-profile construction project was completed in 1965 as a remarkable achievement in engineering at that time. The tunnel runs beneath the Mont Blanc massif, the highest mountain in the Alps, which serves as a natural border between the two countries. To be more specific, the Mont Blanc Tunnel links the town of Chamonix in the Haute-Savoie department of France with the town of Courmayeur in the Aosta Valley region of Italy. Stretching for 11.6 kilometers (7.2 miles), the Mont Blanc Tunnel is a vital transportation artery that facilitates the movement of people and goods between the two countries, as well as between northern and southern Europe. It is an essential part of the European Route E25, which is a major north-south route that spans from the United Kingdom to Malta, passing through the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, France, and Italy. Before the construction of the Mont Blanc Tunnel, journeys between France and Italy required travelers to traverse treacherous mountain roads, which were often subject to severe weather conditions and closures. The construction of the Mont Blanc Tunnel, therefore, significantly shortened the travel time and made it much safer and more reliable to cross the border between the two countries by car or truck. Commercial vehicles also benefited extensively from the tunnel, as it enabled easier transportation of goods between France and Italy and beyond, contributing to the growth of trade and economic development in the region. The Mont Blanc Tunnel is operated and maintained by two companies from France and Italy: GEIE-TMB (Groupement Européen d'Intérêt Économique du Tunnel du Mont-Blanc) and Società Italiana per Azioni per il Traforo del Monte Bianco. These operators are responsible for ensuring that the tunnel is safe and efficient for commuters. In the past, there have been accidents, including the tragic fire incident in 1999, which resulted in several fatalities and the closure of the tunnel for nearly three years. Since then, new safety measures and protocols have been introduced to better protect the users of the Mont Blanc Tunnel. In conclusion, the Mont Blanc Tunnel connects the countries of France and Italy through a remarkable engineering feat that had a substantial impact on the transport and communication infrastructure of Europe. Providing a safer and more efficient passage for people and goods across the Alpine border, the Mont Blanc Tunnel has played a pivotal role in the growth and development of regional and intercontinental trade and travel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Diamond Wheels is owned and operated by former Dundee FC director of football Paul Marr, son of the club's former owner Peter Marr. The firm specialises in restoring alloy wheels for cars. Mr Conway, a 33-year-old father of two, was sent in to remove debris created from the process of stripping wheels using a chemical known as EFX Strip. That chemical contains methlyene chloride, methanol and hydrofluoric acid and is described as a \\"highly volatile organic compound\\". Mr Conway went in to the tank wearing trainers, tracksuit bottoms, a t-shirt and a fleece. He was not provided with overalls or any other protective clothing - and wore a mask that did nothing to protect him from the toxic fumes let off by the chemicals. Fiscal depute Emma Stewart told the court: \\"Mr Conway was found wearing the face mask, kneeling inside the stripping tank. He was slumped against the side of the tank and appeared to be unconscious.\\" Mr Marr and another colleague removed Mr Conway from the tank and tried to resuscitate him. He was later pronounced dead. A subsequent post-mortem examination found he had suffered chemical burns to his thighs, knees, shins and feet \\"typical of chemical burns from contact with hydrofluoric acid\\". Pathologists concluded he had died from inhaling industrial paint stripper. Defence advocate Gavin Anderson said the company had undertaken extensive efforts to adhere strictly to health and safety standards since Mr Conway's death. Mr Anderson said: \\"I express publicly in open court that Mr Conway's tragic death is genuinely and deeply regretted by all associated with the company.\\"","output":"A man named Steven Conway passed away while cleaning a tank at Diamond Wheels company, because he didn't have the right safety clothes and breathed dangerous chemicals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They both graduated Summa Cum Laudae.  Which cousin  had to make generalizations and propose explanations that are microscopic in nature?  Hint: Chemists look at the world in two ways, often simultaneously. The two worlds of the chemist are the macroscopic world and the microscopic world. Macroscopic refers to substances and objects that can be seen, touched, and measured directly. Microscopic refers to the small particles that make up all matter. Chemists must observe matter and do experiments macroscopically and then make generalizations and propose explanations that are microscopic in nature. For example, anyone can observe the physical change in appearance that occurs as an iron object such as a tractor that is left out in the elements gradually turns to rust. However, a chemist looks at the rusting tractor and thinks about what is going on with the individual atoms that make up the iron and how they are changing as a result of exposure to oxygen in the air and water from rain. Throughout your study of chemistry, you will often switch back and forth between the macroscopic and microscopic worlds. Answer:","output":"Based on the given information and hint, the cousin who had to make generalizations and propose explanations that are microscopic in nature is Dawn, who studied chemistry. Chemists look at the world in two ways, often simultaneously. These two ways are the macroscopic world and the microscopic world. While macroscopic refers to substances and objects that can be seen, touched, and measured directly, microscopic refers to the small particles that make up all matter. Dawn, as a chemistry student, had to observe matter and perform experiments macroscopically. However, her understanding of the subject did not stop there, as she was also tasked to make generalizations and propose explanations that are microscopic in nature. This means that while she was able to observe and analyze the changes and reactions occurring in the visible world, she also had to delve deeper into the microscopic world of atoms and molecules. In contrast, Greg, who studied biology, focused on the study of living organisms and their interactions with the environment. While some aspects of biology may involve delving into the molecular level, its primary focus lies around the macroscopic understanding of living systems rather than the detailed analysis of the microscopic structures of matter. For example, when looking at the rusting tractor mentioned in the hint, Dawn, the chemist, would focus on the individual atoms that make up the iron and the chemical changes they undergo when exposed to oxygen and water. She would extrapolate from her observations and propose explanations for the rusting process based on the behavior of atoms and molecules involved in the reaction. This ability to switch between macroscopic and microscopic perspectives is a crucial skill for chemists and demonstrates that, in this case, it is Dawn who had to make generalizations and propose explanations that are microscopic in nature."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Who composed the tune most closely associated to the \\"Infernal Galop\\" as part of the \\"Orpheus in the Underworld\\" opera? Answer:","output":"The composer who created the tune most closely associated with the \\"Infernal Galop\\" is Jacques Offenbach. Jacques Offenbach was a German-born French composer and cellist who was active during the 19th century. He is most famous for his contributions to the operetta genre, with \\"Orpheus in the Underworld\\" being a prime example of his work. \\"Orpheus in the Underworld\\" (Orphée aux enfers) is a French operetta that premiered on October 21, 1858, at the Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens in Paris. The work is a satirical take on the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, with a humorous libretto by Hector Crémieux and Ludovic Halévy. The opera includes four acts and 11 scenes, with the famous \\"Infernal Galop\\" occurring in Act II, Scene 2. The \\"Infernal Galop\\" is the tune most closely associated with the iconic \\"Can-Can\\" dance, characterized by its high-energy rhythm, fast tempo, and vigorous, acrobatic dance moves executed by a chorus line of female dancers. The piece is composed in 2/4 time, with an oom-pah accompaniment, and has become synonymous with energetic, raucous celebrations and exuberant displays of physical agility. Though originally written as part of \\"Orpheus in the Underworld,\\" the \\"Infernal Galop\\" and its accompanying \\"Can-Can\\" dance have surpassed the opera in terms of popularity and cultural significance. Today, the tune is frequently played as a standalone piece, often used to evoke the spirit of lively parties, Parisian nightlife, and the uninhibited dance style that has captivated audiences for over a century. In conclusion, Jacques Offenbach is the composer responsible for creating the \\"Infernal Galop\\" as a part of his operetta \\"Orpheus in the Underworld.\\" Its connection with the famous \\"Can-Can\\" dance has firmly established it as an enduring symbol of energy, excitement, and creativity in both music and dance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In order to make caring for your plants during your holiday as easy as possible, it is important to plan and prepare for their maintenance in advance. This way, you can ensure that your plants stay healthy and continue to thrive while you are away, and you or your plant-sitter will face minimal challenges in the process. Here are some steps to make the plant care process smooth and mutually beneficial: 1. Choose low-maintenance plants: If you are a frequent traveler or want plants that require minimal care, opt for low-maintenance indoor plants such as snake plants, ZZ plants, or pothos. These plants can tolerate neglect and varying conditions. 2. Provide detailed care instructions: Before leaving for your holiday, prepare a comprehensive plant-care guide for your plant-sitter, including information on water, light, and temperature needs for each plant. 3. Set up a watering system: Self-watering systems, such as drip irrigation or wicking systems, can be beneficial in ensuring that your plants receive the appropriate amount of water during your absence. Consider using an automated timer for a consistent, hassle-free watering schedule. 4. Group plants with similar needs: Organize your plants in groups according to their watering and lighting preferences, which will make it easier for the plant-sitter to care for them efficiently. 5. Use technology for communication: Utilize a smart camera or other remote monitoring devices to keep an eye on your plants while away, providing peace of mind and allowing you to give real-time guidance to your plant-sitter. 6. Prepare for pest control: Leave your plant-sitter with instructions on how to recognize and treat common pests, such as aphids and spider mites, to ensure that any infestations are addressed promptly. 7. Offer care incentives: Providing incentives, like taking care of your plants in return when the other person goes on vacation or even offering some paid compensation, can encourage your plant-sitter to take the task more seriously. 8. Show appreciation: To guarantee a positive and mutually beneficial relationship with your plant-sitter, always express gratitude for their help in caring for your cherished plants. By taking these steps, you can make caring for your plants during your holiday a seamless and stress-free process for everyone involved, leading to a mutually beneficial arrangement for both you and your plant-sitter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who attended concerts conducted by, among others, Arthur Nikisch?, what is it ?

Definition: Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation. Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no. Input: Is AUTHOR wrong in the post ? POST : A few weeks ago my roommate and I drove to Chicago for St. Patrick's Day. Usually for these trips, I would split the cost of gas with him, because he uses his car and it wouldn't be fair to ask him to front the cost of gas. We try to split everything and be as fair as possible. During the day, he told me that a friend of his was flying in from O'Hare Airport and wanted a ride from there back to our school, and if he gave her a ride then she would pay for gas. So, his friend paid for the gas and tolls and we all drove back together. I thought that that meant the expense was taken care of, but he told me that I still need to pay for half the gas, even though his friend covered the entire thing herself. I told him that that didn't make sense cause neither of us put any money in so there was no cost to split, her friend covered the whole thing. He told me if it weren't for her then I would have had to pay so it's only fair if I still give my half. We changed the subject and I thought he forgot about the whole thing until today when in the middle of the day I saw he put in the cost of gas and tolls into the splitter app that we had. I suspect that this is happening because he just ran out of all his spending money from his summer job, and he also currently owes me 40 total so he can't really pay me back. I've also been able to get gift cards from my parents that we used to buy things for our room, and I never tried to still charge him half the cost of these items, since I thought if we managed to get a deal on something then we both share the benefit of saved money. I have a job I work on campus for spending money so I also could really easily eat the cost of this, it's just the principle of it that bothers me. If he told me at the end of the school year that he couldn't afford to pay me back, I would happily forget about whatever he owes me, but this just feels like he's trying to rip me off. He's always been a really honest and straightforward guy, so I'm just trying to see if I'm missing something or wrong about this. Am I the asshole if I explain again why I think this is unfair and refuse to pay half the cost of gas, or should I just drop it? **tl;dr** Roommate and I usually split the cost of things. He got his friend to pay for gas for a trip but still wants me to pay \\"my half\\" of the cost of the gas. I don't think this is fair. Am I the asshole if I refuse to pay this? Output:","output":"No, AUTHOR is not wrong in the post. The situation described indicates that the roommate's friend has already covered the entire cost of gas and tolls for the trip. AUTHOR's argument that there is no cost left to split is valid.

A comet is a ball of dust, stones, and ice. Many people call comets dirty snowballs. The \\"snowball\\" may be only a few miles across. But when the sun heats the \\"snowball,\\" much of it is changed to gases. The gases spread out and form the comet's head, which may be thousands of miles across. A comet moves fast in its trip around the sun. But when we see it, the comet does not seem to move. That's because it is so far away. The moon moves fast, but when you look at it, you can't see any motion . That's because the moon is far away. Each year astronomers  discover new comets. Some of them are seen only once. They make one trip around the sun and then go away out into space. The sun's gravity cannot hold them. Other comets, like Halley, keep returning. They have been captured by the sun. Halley's earliest visit was probably 3,000 years ago. It may keep returning for another 3,000 years. But every time a comet goes around the sun, the comet loses part of itself. Gases and dust are pulled out of the comet. That's why Halley is now dimmer  than it used to be. Next time it visits us, in 2062, it may be even dimmer.

Write an article with the title: \\"Suharto’s Purge, Indonesia’s Silence\\"","output":"Title: Suharto’s Purge, Indonesia’s Silence Introduction The past, they say, is a foreign country. In Indonesia's case, it is a country marked with the blood and tears of a turbulent history that has left deep wounds on the country's collective conscience. Suharto's Purge is a stark example of events that have shaped Indonesia's complex history. The period between 1965 and 1966 witnessed one of the most brutal and systematic political genocides known to humankind, led by Indonesia's second president, Suharto. Despite the magnitude of these purges, the memory of this somber episode lies shrouded in silence. This article seeks to shed light on the purges, the reasons behind Indonesia's reluctance to address this unfortunate event, and the importance of revisiting history. Background: The Rise of Suharto and the Communist Party In the early 1960s, President Sukarno's Indonesia was a young but increasingly unstable nation. The Communists rapidly gained influence, causing rising tensions between the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), the military, and the right-wing factions of the country. Suharto, the formerly unknown army general, gradually built his power base through strategic alliances with anti-communist forces. In September 1965, the assassination of six senior army generals attributed to a failed coup attempt marked the catalyst for Suharto's purges. The Carnage Begins: Suharto's Purge Suharto's avowed objective behind the purge was to crush the PKI. The pretext for this brutal crackdown was the alleged communist coup attempt. However, researchers and historians continue to debate the PKI's exact role in the assassination. Nonetheless, the purge unfolded with full force. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Indonesian Communists, or those suspected of being so, were systematically massacred, imprisoned, or forced into exile. The purge not only eliminated communists but also targeted Suharto's political rivals, ethnic Chinese, and marginalized communities. It is estimated that between 500,000 to 3 million people perished during this murderous campaign. The Impact: Consolidation of Power and The New Order Suharto's purges enabled him to consolidate power and establish an autocratic military regime dubbed \\"The New Order.\\" Sukarno, now a mere figurehead, was ultimately sidelined and replaced by Suharto as the President, thus marking the beginning of his 31-year-long presidency. Under the New Order, Indonesia adopted a more pro-Western stance, soliciting foreign investments and aid. However, Suharto also maintained a tight grip on the nation, stifling political dissent and freedoms.  The Silence: Indonesia's Reluctance to Reckon with its Past More than five decades have passed since the purge unfolded, but the nation still remains sharply divided on its historical interpretation. Many Indonesians, particularly the older generation, see it as a necessary act to protect their country from communism. Others, notably younger Indonesians and human rights advocates, recognize the purge as an appalling event demanding accountability. Often, the issue is met with a hushed silence. This silence can be attributed to multiple factors.  Fear, for one, still lingers among those who survived the purges and their descendants. Many fear retribution if they were to openly discuss the events of this period. Second, progress has been slow in the absence of any concerted effort from the government to publicly acknowledge and investigate the purges. Finally, as memories fade and the younger generation remains largely unaware or uninterested in the past, the inertia of silence strengthens its grip. The Need for Revisiting the Past The unwillingness to confront this dark chapter in Indonesia's history has severe implications. Firstly, a transparent and honest examination of the past is required for the country to better understand its current political atmosphere and challenges. Second, only by addressing the issue can Indonesia begin the process of healing for the families of the victims who, for decades, have been forced to suffer in silence. Lastly, embracing the past truthfully is an essential step for Indonesia to successfully strengthen its democracy and human rights record. Conclusion Suharto's Purge stands as a haunting reminder of the capacity of political corruption, insatiable ambition, and ideological zealotry to unleash human suffering on a colossal scale. Indonesia's collective silence on the purges, be it borne out of fear, indifference, or allegiance to old narrative, serves as a disservice to the nation's development and future. By diving into the depths of its dark history, Indonesia can hope to chart a new path of accountability, healing, justice, and progress. Only then can the nation rise from the ashes of its painful past and lay the foundation of a more inclusive and democratic future."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Q: What is released during an enthalpy reaction?

I think birth has an influence over it, like alcoholism and some other things, but I think that basically you have a choice,\\" Buck said.      He also defended his handling of an alleged rape in 2005 that he declined to prosecute because he believed some of the details appeared to show the woman in question consented to the sexual encounter. Months later, he told the Greeley Tribune that \\"a jury could very well conclude that this is a case of buyer's remorse.\\"      \\"I don't regret the way I talked to her. I think it is important that a prosecutor approach a victim with a certain amount of reality, and that's what I've tried to do with this victim. I didn't blame her at all,\\" Buck said.      He said he used the \\"buyer's remorse\\" term to explain how the woman regretted her relationship with the man, who was her ex-lover. \\"When someone decides to make a case public, the public has to understand why,\\" Buck said.      Bennet seized on Buck's defense, arguing his opponent's handling of the victim was an issue in their closely contested race.      \\"He just used the language again, buyer's remorse, and as the father of three little girls, I just think that's the wrong way to talk about it.\\"      Afterward, in an interview with reporters, Bennet pointed to these two moments as the most memorable of the 30-minute face-off, calling Buck's answers \\"deeply troubling.\\"      Buck acknowledged he was nervous making his first appearance on the longest-running Sunday morning talk show and said he didn't know if he made any mistakes.      \\"I don't know — you guys will make that determination,\\" he said, going on to downplay the relevance of social issues in the campaign.      \\"The social issues that come before the Senate are fairly narrow, and if someone asks me a question on \\"Meet the Press,\\" I'm going to answer the question.

He used the term \\"buyer's remorse\\" to describe the situation and stood by his decision during the debate. Democratic Sen.

The paragraph states that the Northern Transcon is a route operated by the BNSF Railway, which traverses the most northerly route of any railroad in the western United States. The route was originally part of four railway systems, namely the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, Northern Pacific Railway, Great Northern Railway, and Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway systems. These systems were later merged into the Burlington Northern Railroad system in 1970. As the merge took place in 1970, it demonstrates that the original railway systems, which form the current Northern Transcon, were in existence before this date. Since the current year is 2021, this means the Northern Transcon is older than 40 years old as at least part of it has been in use for over 50 years. Moreover, it is important to note that the specific details about when each of the original railway systems was built are not provided in the paragraph.

For his study Greg labeled this zone as zone A. Then he found near a national park in his state a lake is not declared as a dead zone. To further his study he labeled this zone as zone B.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would zone A have less or more oxygen than zone B?  Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen.

Q:Information:  - Russian orthography is formally considered to encompass spelling and punctuation. Russian spelling, which is quite phonemic in practice, is a mix of the \\"morphological\\" and \\"phonetic\\" principles, with a few \\"etymological\\" or \\"historic\\" forms, and occasional \\"grammatical\\" differentiation. The punctuation, originally based on Byzantine Greek, was in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries reformulated on the French and German models.  - The letter  (italics \\"\\", \\"\\") of the Cyrillic script, also spelled jer or er, is known as the \\"hard sign\\" (  ) in the modern Russian and Rusyn alphabets, as \\"er golyam\\" ( , \\"big er\\") in the Bulgarian alphabet, and as \\"debelo jer\\" ( , \\"fat yer\\") in pre-reform Serbian orthography. The letter is called back yer or back er in the pre-reform Russian orthography, in Old Russian, and in Old Church Slavonic. Originally the yer denoted an ultra-short or reduced middle rounded vowel. It is one of two reduced vowels that are collectively known as the yers in Slavic philology.  - Old Church Slavonic, also known as Old Church Slavic (often abbreviated to OCS; self-name , \\"slovnsk jzyk\\"), was the first Slavic literary language. The 9th-century Byzantine missionaries Saints Cyril and Methodius of Slavic, Greek descent, or both, are credited with standardizing the language and using it in translating the Bible and other Ancient Greek ecclesiastical texts as part of the Christianization of the Slavs. It is thought to have been based primarily on the dialect of the 9th century Byzantine Slavs living in the Province of Thessalonica (now in Greece). It played an important role in the history of the Slavic languages and served as a basis and model for later Church Slavonic traditions, and some Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches use this later Church Slavonic as a liturgical language to this day. As the oldest attested Slavic language, OCS provides important evidence for the features of Proto-Slavic, the reconstructed common ancestor of all Slavic languages. History. The language was standardized for the mission of the two apostles to Great Moravia in 863 (see Glagolitic alphabet for details). For that purpose, Cyril and his brother Methodius started to translate religious literature to Old Church Slavonic, allegedly based on the Slavic dialects spoken in the hinterland of their hometown, Thessaloniki, in the today's Greece.  - Neutral Yer ( Majuscule :  , Minuscule :  ) is used in transcribing documents when it is hard to tell the difference between a  and a  .

They originally represented phonemically the \\"ultra-short\\" vowels in Slavic languages (including Old Church Slavonic), collectively known as the yers. In all Slavic languages they either evolved into various \\"full\\" vowels or disappeared, in some cases leaving palatalization of adjacent consonants. At present, the only Slavic language that uses \\"\\" as a vowel sign (pronounced //) is Bulgarian (although in many cases it corresponds to earlier \\"\\", originally pronounced /õ/). Many languages using the Cyrillic alphabet have kept one or more of the yers to serve specific orthographic functions.  - The Bulgarian alphabet is used to write the Bulgarian language.  - The Cyrillic script is a writing system used for various alphabets across eastern Europe and north and central Asia. It is based on the Early Cyrillic, which was developed in the First Bulgarian Empire during the 9th century AD at the Preslav Literary School. It is the basis of alphabets used in various languages, past and present, in parts of southeastern Europe and northern Eurasia, especially those of Slavic origin, and non-Slavic languages influenced by Russian. , around 252 million people in Eurasia use it as the official alphabet for their national languages, with Russia accounting for about half of them. With the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union on 1 January 2007, Cyrillic became the third official script of the European Union, following the Latin script and Greek script.

Question 1: What is induction motor drives? Question 2: What is induction motor and what is synchronous and asynchronous? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"To answer your questions, first, I will provide an explanation for each term, and then I will determine if the answers to these two questions are the same. Question 1: What is induction motor drives? Step 1: Define induction motor drives Induction motor drives are electrical systems used to control the speed, torque, and position of induction motors. These drives adjust the voltage and frequency supplied to the motor in order to achieve the desired performance. Step 2: Describe the components of induction motor drives An induction motor drive usually consists of the following components: 1. A power converter (typically a rectifier or an inverter) to convert the AC supply voltage to DC voltage and adjust the voltage levels. 2. A microcontroller or processor to process the control signals and regulate the motor's speed, torque, and position. 3. Interface circuitry to communicate with sensors and other devices, as well as to protect the system from possible electrical faults. Step 3: Explain the applications of induction motor drives Induction motor drives are used in various applications, including industrial machinery, electric vehicles, pumps, fans, and HVAC systems. They offer advantages such as improved energy efficiency, precise speed and torque control, and reduced wear on mechanical components. Question 2: What is induction motor and what is synchronous and asynchronous? Step 1: Define induction motor An induction motor is an AC electric motor in which the torque is produced by electromagnetic induction from the stator's magnetic field. The motor consists of two main parts, the stator (stationary part), and the rotor (rotating part). The stator generates a rotating magnetic field that induces a current in the rotor, creating torque and causing the rotor to turn.  Step 2: Define synchronous and asynchronous in relation to induction motors Synchronous and asynchronous are terms related to the operation of electric motors. 1. Synchronous motor: A motor in which the rotor rotates at the same speed as the stator's rotating magnetic field is called a synchronous motor. This means that the rotor maintains a constant speed irrespective of the load. 2. Asynchronous motor: On the other hand, an asynchronous motor, which is also called an induction motor, has a rotor speed that is slightly slower than the speed of the rotating magnetic field produced by the stator. The difference in speed is called slip, which is necessary for torque production in the motor. Now, I will determine if the answers to both questions are the same. Answer comparison: While both questions are related to induction motors, they have different focuses. The first question focuses on induction motor drives which control the performance of the motor, while the second question focuses on defining the induction motor itself and differentiating between synchronous and asynchronous motors. Therefore, their answers are not the same but they complement each other and contribute to a deeper understanding of induction motor systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is usually a white, crystalline, odorless powder, that decomposes at 250270 °C.  - Oxalate (IUPAC: ethanedioate) is the dianion with the formula , also written . Either name is often used for derivatives, such as salts of oxalic acid, for example sodium oxalate NaCO, or dimethyl oxalate ((CH)CO). Oxalate also forms coordination compounds where it is sometimes abbreviated as ox.  - A symptom (from Greek , \\"accident, misfortune, that which befalls\\", from , \\"I befall\\", from - \\"together, with\\" and , \\"I fall\\") is a departure from normal function or feeling which is noticed by a patient, reflecting the presence of an unusual state, or of a disease. A symptom is subjective, observed by the patient, and cannot be measured directly, whereas a sign is objectively observable by others. For example, paresthesia is a symptom (only the person experiencing it can directly observe their own tingling feeling), whereas erythema is a sign (anyone can confirm that the skin is redder than usual). Symptoms and signs are often nonspecific, but often combinations of them are at least suggestive of certain diagnoses, helping to narrow down what may be wrong. In other cases they are specific even to the point of being pathognomonic.  - Intermittent claudication (Latin: \\"claudicatio intermittens\\") is a symptom that describes muscle pain (ache, cramp, numbness or sense of fatigue), classically in the calf muscle, which occurs during exercise, such as walking, and is relieved by a short period of rest. It is classically associated with early-stage peripheral artery disease, and can progress to critical limb ischemia unless treated or risk factors are modified.  - Oxalic acid is an organic compound with the formula CHO. It is a colorless crystalline solid that forms a colorless solution in water. Its condensed formula is HOOCCOOH, reflecting its classification as the simplest dicarboxylic acid. Its acid strength is much greater than that of acetic acid. Oxalic acid is a reducing agent and its conjugate base, known as oxalate, is a chelating agent for metal cations. Typically, oxalic acid occurs as the dihydrate with the formula CHO·2HO. Excessive ingestion of oxalic acid or prolonged skin contact can be dangerous.  - Naftidrofuryl ( INN , also known as nafronyl or as the oxalate salt naftidrofuryl oxalate or nafronyl oxalate ) is a drug used in the management of peripheral and cerebral vascular disorders as a vasodilator . It is also claimed to enhance cellular oxidative capacity , and may also be a 5 - HT2 receptor antagonist . It is also licensed for the treatment of intermittent claudication due to peripheral arterial disease . Naftidrofuryl is marketed under the trade names Artocoron ; Azunaftil ; Di - Actane ; Dusodril ; Enelbin ; Frilix ; Gevatran ; Iridus ; Iridux ; Luctor ; Nafti ; Naftoling ; Naftodril ; Nafoxal ; Praxilene ; Sodipryl retard ; Vascuprax . Historically , it has been used to treat sudden idiopathic hearing loss and acute tinnitus . Naftidrofuryl may be effective for relieving the pain of muscle cramps .  - Dimethyl oxalate is a chemical compound from the group of oxalates (specifically, the dimethyl ester of oxalic acid).  - Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a narrowing of the arteries other than those that supply the heart or the brain. When narrowing occurs in the heart it is called coronary artery disease while in the brain it is called cerebrovascular disease. Peripheral artery disease most commonly affects the legs, but other arteries may also be involved. The classic symptom is leg pain when walking which resolves with rest, known as intermittent claudication. Other symptoms including skin ulcers, bluish skin, cold skin, or poor nail and hair growth may occur in the affected leg. Complications may include an infection or tissue death which may require amputation; coronary artery disease, or stroke. Up to 50% of cases of PAD are without symptoms. The main risk factor is cigarette smoking. Other risk factors include diabetes, high blood pressure, and high blood cholesterol. The underlying mechanism is usually atherosclerosis. Other causes include artery spasm. PAD is typically diagnosed by finding an ankle-brachial index (ABI) less than 0.90, which is the systolic blood pressure at the ankle divided by the systolic blood pressure of the arm. Duplex ultrasonography and angiography may also be used. Angiography is more accurate and allows for treatment at the same time; however, it is associated with greater risks. It is unclear if screening for disease is useful as it has not been properly studied. In those with intermittent claudication from PAD, stopping smoking and supervised exercise therapy improves outcomes. Medications, including statins, ACE inhibitors, and cilostazol also may help. Aspirin does not appear to help those with mild disease but is usually recommended in those with more significant disease. Anticoagulants such as warfarin are not typically of benefit. Procedures used to treat the disease include bypass grafting, angioplasty, and atherectomy. In 2010 about 202 million people had PAD worldwide. In the developed world it affects about 5.3% of 45 to 50 years olds and 18.6% of 85- to 90-year-olds. In the...

(AP) — A Kansas City auto parts dealer who had sworn allegiance to al-Qaida pleaded guilty Wednesday to taking part in a conspiracy to provide financial support to the terrorist group. Khalid Ouazzani, 32, a Moroccan native who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2006, admitted that he sent 23,500 to al-Qaida between August 2007 and mid-2008. Although Ouazzani talked with others about ways to support al-Qaida, including plans for them to fight in Afghanistan, Iraq or Somalia, U.S. Attorney Beth Phillips said he did not pose a threat to the Kansas City area, where he briefly operated a business that sold auto parts and used vehicles. \\"At no point prior to his arrest was he any threat to cause imminent harm or danger to the citizens of our community,\\" Phillips said at a news conference. Ouazzani was arrested in February on 33 counts contained in a sealed grand jury indictment charging him with bank fraud, money laundering, interstate fraud and making false statements to the government. There was no mention of any terrorism charges in the initial indictment. He pleaded guilty to one count of money laundering and one count of bank fraud and to an additional count of conspiracy to provide material support to a terrorist organization. Prosecutors said Ouazzani, who became a permanent U.S. resident in July 2004 and became a citizen about two years later, provided false information to obtain a 175,000 line of credit commercial loan in April 2007 to run his business, Truman Used Auto Parts. In May 2007, he wired 112,830 of the loan to a bank account in the United Arab Emirates, where it was used to purchase an apartment. In June or July 2008, he sold the apartment for a 17,000 profit, which was sent by a co-conspirator to al-Qaida, court records say. He also agreed in August 2007 to send al-Qaida an additional 6,500 through a co-conspirator, who paid the money on his behalf, and in November 2007, Ouazzani repaid the co-conspirator through a wire transfer to a bank account in the United Arab Emirates, court records show. Phillips said the 6,500 came from the sale of his business. She declined to comment on the co-conspirator or say how long Ouazzani had been in Kansas City prior to his arrest. Going back to the 1990s, public records indicate Ouazzani listed numerous addresses in Kansas City and St. Louis, as well as spots in Brooklyn, N.Y., Forest Hills, N.Y., and Cherry Hill, N.J. It was not clear Wednesday how much time, if any, Ouazzani spent in those cities. Dennis Hogan, who rented a salvage yard building to Ouazzani for his auto parts business, said Ouazzani owes him about 17,000 in back rent. \\"I'm shocked and stunned but I'm not surprised because he was such a low-life,\\" Hogan told The Associated Press. \\"Once he got in, he stopped paying his bills almost immediately.\\" Hogan said it was always a hassle to deal with Ouazzani and that other creditors in the Kansas City area were looking for him. Hogan said that when he first met Ouazzani, he asked him if he was a terrorist, then immediately regretted the question. \\"He looked at me and seemed real taken aback, and he said, 'Are you?'\\" Hogan said. Mustafa Hussein, director of the Islamic Society of Greater Kansas City, said Ouazzani's wife came to the center after her husband was arrested in February and asked if the center could help him. Hussein told her that if the charges were politically motivated, there are organizations that could help, but \\"if he's guilty, there's nothing we can do.\\" \\"She was crying, very upset,\\" Hussein said. \\"She did not come back to talk about it.\\" Hussein, who acknowledged that he knew Ouazzani only through brief encounters at the center or mosque, said Ouazzani seemed like a normal family man and didn't show any signs of extremism. Ouazzani's attorneys said their client was sorry for his actions and he was ready to pay the consequences. Ouazzani has \\"acknowledged the wrongfulness of his acts,\\" Overland Park, Kan., attorneys Robin Fowler and Tricia Tenpenny said in a statement. \\"He deeply regrets what he has done, and is taking steps to atone, to the extent he can, for his crimes. He will continue to do so,\\" the statement read. They declined to provide further details. Ouazzani faces up to 65 years in prison without parole, prosecutors said. No sentencing date has been set.

Title: Airport '77 Movie plot: A privately owned luxury Boeing 747-100, Stevens' Flight 23, flies invited guests to an estate in Palm Beach, Florida, owned by wealthy philanthropist Philip Stevens, who also owns the jetliner. Valuable artwork from Stevens's private collection is also on board the jetliner, to be eventually displayed in his new museum. Such a collection motivates a group of thieves led by co-pilot Bob Chambers to hijack the aircraft. Once Captain Don Gallagher leaves the cockpit and is knocked unconscious, the hijackers' plans go into action. A sleeping gas, which one of the hijackers secretly installed before the flight, is released into the cabin and the passengers lose consciousness. Knocking out the flight engineer, Chambers moves forward with the hijacking, and Stevens' Flight 23 \\"disappears\\" into the Bermuda Triangle. Descending to virtual wave-top altitude, Flight 23 heads into a fog bank, reducing visibility to less than a mile. Minutes later, a large offshore drilling platform emerges from the haze, Flight 23 heading straight for it at nearly 600 knots. Chambers pulls back on the yoke in a banking left turn, but an engine clips the derrick and catches fire. Chambers immediately hits the fire extinguishing button, and the flames are momentarily extinguished. Because the aircraft is at such a low altitude, the sudden loss of airspeed threatens to stall the airplane. As the engine reignites, Chambers is forced to use another fire suppression bottle. But by this time, the aircraft stall alarm is activated and the aircraft's tail hits the water. All the passengers wake up, and realizing what is happening, most panic.

The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.  - The Paleolithic or Palaeolithic; pronunciation: ) Age, Era or Period is a prehistoric period of human history distinguished by the development of the most primitive stone tools discovered (Grahame Clark's Modes I and II), and covers roughly 95% of human technological prehistory. It extends from the earliest known use of stone tools, probably by Homo habilis initially, 2.6 million years ago, to the end of the Pleistocene around 10,000 BP.  - The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was the last period in the Earth's climate history during the last glacial period when ice sheets were at their greatest extension. Growth of the ice sheets reached their maximum positions in about 24,500 BCE. Deglaciation commenced in the Northern Hemisphere gradually between approximately 18,000 to 17,000 BCE and in Antarctica approximately 12,500 BCE, which is consistent with evidence that it was the primary source for an abrupt rise in the sea level in about 12,500 BCE.  - Sir John Grahame Douglas Clark, KBE, FBA (28 July 1907  12 September 1995), who often published as J. G. D. Clark, was a British archaeologist who specialised in the study of Mesolithic Europe and palaeoeconomics. He spent most of his career working at the University of Cambridge, where he was appointed Disney Professor of Archaeology from 1952 to 1974 and Master of Peterhouse College from 1973 to 1980.  - Behavioral modernity is a suite of behavioral and cognitive traits that distinguishes current \\"Homo sapiens\\" from other anatomically modern humans, hominins, and primates. Although often debated, most scholars agree that modern human behavior can be characterized by abstract thinking, planning depth, symbolic behavior (e.g. art, ornamentation, music), exploitation of large game, and blade technology, among others. Underlying these behaviors and technological innovations are cognitive and cultural foundations that have been documented experimentally and ethnographically. Some of these human universal patterns are cumulative cultural adaptation, social norms, language, cooperative breeding, and extensive help and cooperation beyond close kin. These traits have been viewed as largely responsible for the human replacement of Neanderthals, along with the climatic conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum, and the peopling of the rest of the world.  - The Upper Paleolithic ( or Upper Palaeolithic , Late Stone Age ) is the third and last subdivision of the Paleolithic or Old Stone Age . Very broadly , it dates to between 50,000 and 10,000 years ago , roughly coinciding with the appearance of behavioral modernity and before the advent of agriculture . Modern humans ( i.e. Homo sapiens ) are believed to have emerged about 195,000 years ago in Africa . Although these humans were modern in anatomy , their lifestyle changed very little from their contemporaries , such as Homo erectus and the Neanderthals . About 50,000 years ago , there was a marked increase in the diversity of artifacts . In Africa , bone artifacts and the first art appear in the archeological record . Between 45,000 and 43,000 years ago , this new tool technology spread with human migration to Europe . The new technology generated a population explosion of modern humans which is believed to have led to the extinction of the Neanderthals . The Upper Paleolithic has the earliest known evidence of organized settlements , in the form of campsites , some with storage pits . Artistic work blossomed , with cave painting , petroglyphs , carvings and engravings on bone or ivory . The first evidence of human fishing is also noted , from artifacts in places such as Blombos cave in South Africa . More complex social groupings emerged , supported by more varied and reliable food sources and specialized tool types . This probably contributed to increasing group identification or ethnicity . By 40,000 - 50,000 BP , the first humans set foot in Australia . By 45,000 BP , humans lived at 61 ° north latitude in Europe . By 30,000 BP , Japan was reached , and by 27,000 BP humans were present in Siberia above the Arctic Circle . At the end of the Upper Paleolithic , a group of humans crossed the Bering land bridge and quickly expanded throughout North and South America .

Rob wants to know more about differences between fish and other non fish creatures in the water. He divided them into two groups, group A and group B. Group A consists of fish, and group B consists of non fish creatures in the water. He started to see the differences between these two groups.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   In group B, would the eggs most likely develop outside or inside the mother's body?  Hint: Fish reproduce sexually. They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization. Answer:","output":"In group B, which consists of non-fish marine creatures such as mammals, the eggs would most likely develop inside the mother's body. Unlike most fish (group A) that reproduce by laying eggs that develop outside of the body, many non-fish marine creatures reproduce through internal fertilization and give live birth or lay eggs with well-developed embryos that have developed internally. Some examples of marine creatures in group B that develop their eggs or embryos inside the mother's body include: 1. Marine mammals (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) - They reproduce through internal fertilization, and the eggs are fertilized and develop inside the mother's body. These mammals give birth to live offspring, who are then nursed and cared for by their mothers. 2. Sea snakes - As reptiles, sea snakes also reproduce through internal fertilization. Some species lay eggs on land, while others are ovoviviparous, meaning the eggs are retained within the mother's body until they hatch and the mother gives birth to live offspring. 3. Marine birds - Penguins, for example, reproduce through internal fertilization. The female lays an egg, which is fertilized inside the body. After laying, the egg is incubated outside the mother's body, but the egg contains a well-developed embryo before being laid. 4. Sharks and rays - These cartilaginous fish have a variety of reproductive strategies, with some species laying eggs (oviparous), others giving live birth after internal development (viviparous), and some having eggs develop inside the mother's body without connection to the mother's blood supply, with the young hatching and being born live (ovoviviparous). In general, it is more common for creatures in group B to have their eggs or embryos develop inside the mother's body, providing more protection and increasing the survival rate of the offspring. It contrasts with the majority of fish species in group A, whose eggs develop outside the mother's body in the surrounding water. Therefore, eggs in group B would most likely develop inside the mother's body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Where was Hebrew used for studying Biblical texts in their original language before Yale? Context: Serious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded Hebrew as a classical language, along with Greek and Latin, and essential for study of the Old Testament in the original words. The Reverend Ezra Stiles, president of the College from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient Biblical texts in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase אורים ותמים (Urim and Thummim) on the Yale seal. Stiles' greatest challenge occurred in July 1779 when hostile British forces occupied New Haven and threatened to raze the College. However, Yale graduate Edmund Fanning, Secretary to the British General in command of the occupation, interceded and the College was saved. Fanning later was granted an honorary degree LL.D., at 1803, for his efforts.

On Tuesday's episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Heidi opened up about her relationship with bodyguard Martin Kristen. \\"I'm very happy,\\" she said with a smile, making a roller coaster with her hands to show that her personal life had been up-and-down in recent months.

Heidi Klum goes makeup-free for children's charity      The Project Runway host sees the parallels between her real-life romantic situation and Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner's silver screen romance in the 1992 flick The Bodyguard. \\"I've actually watched that movie since [I started dating my bodyguard],\\" she told Ellen. \\"I had to!\\"      The mom of four even joked that next year, Whitney's character would be her Halloween costume.

And I’m like, ‘Oh my God, I’m going to have this twice.’ And I kind of did have it twice. I went to New York and then Sandy came to New York and it was crazy.”      The Hurricane-chasing former Victoria’s Secret model realized that there was no way she could throw her annual Halloween shindig amid the storm’s devastation.      “So many people have lost their homes and other people have lost a family member,” she continues. “I didn’t think it was right to dress up and drink and dance. And so I rescheduled it.”      Heidi and kids pick the right fall pumpkin      The model also talks about voting for only her second time in the U.S. and how she recently re-watched the movie, The Bodygard – for obvious reasons.

This year has been a tumultuous one for Heidi Klum’s love life, but the former Victoria’s Secret model has admittedly come a long way since her split from husband of seven years, Seal, at the beginning of 2012.      In fact, Klum said on the “Ellen DeGeneres Show” Tuesday that she couldn’t be more content with where her life is right now.      “The kids are very good. Yeah, no, they’re happy,” she began, telling the talk show host about how her four children are doing in the aftermath of the split. “They’re great and … you know, obviously they don’t hear a lot of the news and everything so they just celebrated Halloween obviously here in L.A. … They’re happy.”      When DeGeneres pushed on about how Klum herself was doing, the supermodel slyly replied, “I’m very happy,” while making a roller coaster motion with her hands to indicate that her love life had been full of ups and downs.      “Oh good, I’m glad,” DeGeneres grinned before quickly slipping in a reference to Klum’s current boyfriend, family bodyguard Martin Kirsten. “I was just wondering if you’ve seen the movie ‘The Bodyguard,’ because I love that movie.”      Klum laughed and gamely admitted that she’s seen the 1993 hit.      Michael Rozman/Warner Bros      Earlier this year, Klum appeared on Katie Couric’s talk show and confirmed rumors that she was dating Kirsten.      “It just started,” she said in September. “He’s a great man and recently we just got to know each other from a completely different side.”      The 39-year-old mother of four denied ever having wandering eyes while she was married to Seal, however.      She and the “Kiss From a Rose” singer, 49, called off their marriage in January of this year in what turned out to be a bit of a messy split.            jchen@nydailynews.com |||||","output":"In an episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Heidi Klum discusses her relationship with bodyguard Martin Kristen, stating she is \\"very happy.\\" Klum compares her real-life romance to Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner's in the 1992 film, The Bodyguard.

Here's a detailed explanation of how machines could assist in different tasks related to food: 1. Construct: There are machines, such as food processors, mixers, or specific machines like pasta makers, that can help construct or prepare food. These machines can ease the process of making food, for example, by kneading dough, chopping vegetables, or mixing ingredients together. 2. Dispense: Food dispensing machines encompass a wide range, from candy and snack dispensers to sophisticated machines that can dispense hot meals. These machines measure the proper serving size and present the food in a way that's easy to consume. 3. Vend: Vending machines are an automated way to purchase food. These machines hold a variety of packaged foods and drinks that can be purchased at any time. These are especially helpful in locations where access to a kitchen or a food service establishment might not be available around-the-clock, such as in offices, hotels, or schools. 4. Wash Dishes: Dishwashers are machines that are excellent for cleaning up after meals. They can efficiently wash all sorts of dishes, utensils, pots, and pans, saving you a great deal of time and effort. 5. Deliver: Several companies design food delivery robots. These machines can deliver food orders right to your door, bridging the gap between a food establishment and the customer's home. These are increasingly being used in busy urban areas. Therefore, depending on what you need assistance with, different machines can help with constructing food, dispensing it in appropriate portions, vending it for immediate consumption, washing dishes after a meal, or delivering food to your doorstep."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Be empathetic to the possibility that she may have external factors affecting her mood and engagement. 2. Change the subject: If you feel that the current topic might be causing the lackluster response, try introducing a new subject that could be of interest to her. Ask questions about her hobbies, plans, or favorite activities to spark a livelier conversation. 3. Use humor: Lightening the conversation with a joke or a funny remark can help reinvigorate the dialogue and make it more engaging. 4. Be more personal: Ask open-ended questions that give her an opportunity to share her thoughts and feelings. This not only deepens the connection but also encourages more engaging conversation. 5. Be an active listener: Make sure you're attentively listening to her responses and show genuine interest in what she has to say. 6. Know when to end the conversation: If, after trying these strategies, the conversation remains uninteresting or her engagement hasn't improved, recognize that it may be time to wrap it up.

Solidarity was established in September 1980 at the Gdańsk Shipyard in Poland and it was indeed originally led by Lech Wałęsa, who later became the president of the country. The Solidarity movement started as an independent labor union founded by workers and intellectuals in reaction to the oppressive communist regime in Poland. Its founding came in the wake of protests by shipyard workers in Gdańsk over an increase in food prices. These protests led to a strike where workers demanded the right to form their own independent trade union. Solidarity was the first trade union in a Warsaw Pact country that was not controlled by a communist party. It boasted nearly 10 million members at its height, it roughly gathered one-third of the work force of Poland coming together in the union. Its broad-based support and non-violent advocacy for change stood as a powerful testament against the communist government. The movement was a major factor contributing to the fall of communism in Poland and sparked a wave of strikes and protests throughout the Warsaw Pact countries. The organization's free and fair election in 1989 marked a significant victory for the movement and led to the peaceful transition of Poland from a communist state to a capitalist democracy. Lech Wałęsa, who had led the strike in the Gdańsk Shipyard and subsequently played a leading role in the negotiations for the formation of the union, was elected as the president of Poland in 1990. Recognized worldwide as a symbol of peaceful resistance and change, Wałęsa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983.  In summary, the Polish trade union founded in September 1980 at the Gdańsk Shipyard and originally led by Lech Wałęsa is called Solidarity or \\"Solidarność\\". This movement, with its peaceful and steadfast resistance, played a pivotal role in the fall of communism in Poland and the transformation of the country into a democratic, capitalist state."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

They've been inseparable, growing up in their small suburban town and going on countless adventures together. Both of them have a knack for getting into trouble but always finding a way to get out of it. Rob is smart, resourceful, and always has a solution to every problem. Sal, on the other hand, is a quick-witted and charming risk-taker who can charm himself out of any sticky situation. As they grew older, their paths started to diverge - Rob went to college and Sal became involved in small-time criminal activities. The story starts with Rob returning to his hometown after completing his Master's degree in engineering. Upon his return, he quickly realizes that Sal has gotten himself involved with a dangerous crime boss named Vincent. While Rob initially refuses to help Sal in his illegal activities, he eventually succumbs to his loyalty to his friend and agrees to help him in his latest heist – stealing a high-tech prototype from a nearby research facility. Rob and Sal, along with a team of other misfits, successfully steal the prototype. However, in the process, Rob discovers that the prototype is actually a device capable of harnessing limitless energy and could greatly benefit mankind. This leads to a moral dilemma for Rob. Should he come clean and turn the device into the authorities or return it to the crime boss they stole it for? Meanwhile, Vincent's true intentions are revealed: he plans to sell the device to a rival criminal organization interested in weaponizing it. Sal, who initially was only in it for the thrill and money, starts to reconsider his choices when he learns of Vincent's plans. In a surprising and touching turn of events, Rob and Sal team up and decide to protect the prototype while also finding a way to expose Vincent and his organization. During their attempt to turn the situation around, they engage in a series of high-stakes car chases, shootouts, and daring escapes, all the while enjoying and reviving their thrilling childhood adventures. In the climax, Rob and Sal confront Vincent, leading to an intense showdown. They barely manage to defeat his henchmen and destroy the prototype, leaving the device useless for any harmful purposes. Vincent is arrested, and our heroes are pardoned due to their help in disbanding a significant criminal organization. The entire ordeal ultimately brings Rob and Sal closer than ever before, rekindling their friendship and realizing the importance of loyalty, friendship, and doing the right thing. Seeing an opportunity to channel their resourcefulness and energy for good, they decide to team up and start a private security and investigation firm, where they can continue to embark on new adventures together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At time zero a new type of atomic explosion, a plutonium bomb, will be detonated at Desert Rock, Nevada.

Fiend Dalliant's hardened expression softens as he gazes at the vulnerable woman before him. He, too, has known the sweet anguish of love, its heady delights and sting of rejection. Swallowing his pride, he sets aside his personal feelings, realizing that Persia's happiness is of utmost importance. \\"I understand, Persia,\\" he relents with a sad smile. \\"Our connection may have brought us together, but love is not a bond that can be forced or manipulated. If your heart belongs to Myth, then I must accept it and do what I can to support you.\\" A glimmer of appreciation shimmers in Persia's eyes, a tear threatening to spill over. \\"Thank you, Fiend. Your understanding and willingness to let me go means more to me than you may ever know.\\" Fiend, his heart heavy, nods as he takes a determined step back. \\"All I ask is that you promise me one thing, Persia.

And I hope that, one day, you'll find a love that's as fulfilling as the one blossoming between Myth and me.\\" With that, Persia turns to depart, her footsteps leading her toward the source of her newfound joy and commitment. Though the painful sting of unrequited love lingers in Fiend Dalliant's heart, he knows deep within that he ultimately made the right choice. True love, after all, is about wishing the utmost happiness for the person one cares for, even if it means self-sacrifice and setting them free. In the days and weeks that follow, Persia's love for Myth Evermore only grows stronger, her heart skipping a beat each time their paths cross. They begin to spend more time together, sharing their interests, beliefs, and dreams for the future. And with every conversation, every stolen glance, and every touch, their connection deepens, entwining their hearts into an unbreakable bond. And as for Fiend Dalliant, though his heart aches at the thought of Persia in another's arms, he stays true to his promise. Rather than wallowing in despair, he embraces the pain as a reminder, a sign that he is capable of feeling such profound emotions. He moves forward, resolved to discover his own purpose in life and forge new connections beyond the confines of his longing for Persia. Ultimately, all three undergo a significant journey of self-discovery and growth, their lives forever changed by the lessons that love imparts. For it is in the interplay of love, loss, and acceptance that they each find the path to their destinies and the joy that life has to offer. And though the passage of time may alter their feelings and circumstances, the indelible impact of their shared experiences remains, a testament to the power of love and the choices they dared to make."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I could smell the expensive Dior perfume as soon as I opened the door, which surprised me, because my mom was usually fastidious about not getting perfume on her clothes. She was wearing her bug glasses--huge dark things with lenses that bulged out like fly eyes and reflected my face like a fun-house mirror. She had tied a yellow silk scarf around her hair and was taking deep pulls on a cigarette held between two immaculately manicured fingers. Only I knew about the nicotine stains she carefully covered with her special order \\"forest sable\\" cream each morning. Tiffany, a stupid but vicious senator's daughter who I had the misfortune of sharing a classroom with, suddenly dashed from inside the school, her face flushed. \\"Hello, Mrs. Wilson,\\" she called.

Carpenter's first album, 1987's Hometown Girl, did not produce any singles, although 1989's State of the Heart and 1990's Shooting Straight in the Dark each produced four Top 20 hits on the Billboard country singles charts. Carpenter's most successful album to date remains 1992's Carpenter was born in Princeton, New Jersey, to Chapin Carpenter Jr., a Life Magazine executive, and Mary Bowie Robertson. Carpenter lived in Japan from 1969 to 1971 before moving to Washington, D.C. She attended Princeton Day School, a private coeducational prep school, before graduating from The Taft School in 1976.  Carpenter described her childhood as \\"pretty typical suburban\\", with her musical interests defined chiefly by her sisters' albums of artists such as The Mamas & the Papas, The Beatles, and Judy Collins. When Carpenter was 16 her parents divorced, an event that affected Carpenter and that she wrote about in her song \\"House of Cards\\". Carpenter spent much of her time in high school playing the guitar and piano; while at Princeton Day School, her \\"classmates threatened to cut her guitar strings if she played 'Leaving on a Jet Plane' one more time.\\" Despite her interest in music, Carpenter never considered performing publicly until, shortly after graduating from Taft, her father suggested that she perform at a local open-mic bar, a stressful experience for the shy Carpenter, who recalled, \\"I thought I was going to barf.\\" Carpenter also hosted an open-mic night at a bar in the Cleveland Park neighborhood of Washington, DC for a number of years.  Carpenter graduated from Brown University in 1981 with a degree in American Civilization. Carpenter played some summer sets in Washington's music scene, where she met guitarist John Jennings, who would become her producer and long-time collaborator. However, she considered music a hobby and planned on getting a \\"real job\\". She briefly quit performing, but after several job interviews decided to return to music.

Passage:Born in Tohat, Maramureș County, his parents were Nichifor Dulfu and his wife Agapia (née Bran), members of the rural intellectual class. From early childhood, his mother inspired a love of stories in him. He attended Hungarian-language primary school and gymnasium in Baia Mare from 1864 to 1871, earning top marks, and went to high school in the same town from 1872. In 1876, he graduated from high school in Cluj, where he studied for two years. He attended Franz Joseph University in the latter city, earning a doctorate in philosophy in 1881. His thesis, written in Hungarian, dealt with the work of Vasile Alecsandri, surveyed the Romanian literary context and included a dozen poems translated by Dulfu. After graduation, he moved to the Romanian Old Kingdom and worked as a teacher. After a brief stint in the capital Bucharest, he directed and taught at a school in Turnu Severin for the 1881-1882 year. Beginning in 1882, he again taught philosophy and later Romanian in Bucharest; one of the two schools where he worked was for girls. He came to know faculty colleague Ioan Slavici, as well as Mihail Eminescu, Alexandru Vlahuță and Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu. In 1886, he married Elena Mateescu, with whom he had four children and who encouraged his work as a writer. He obtained Romanian citizenship in 1891. During World War I, he worked as a postal censor in the temporary capital of Iași, where an illness claimed one of his daughters. Although normally a disciplined teacher, he lost his composure on December 1, 1918, the day the union of Transylvania with Romania was proclaimed; cutting short the lesson and visibly moved, he explained the significance of the event to his pupils. In 1921, he retired from the girls' school, as the pupils daily reminded him of his deceased daughter. Solution:","output":"b"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Butterflies do not undergo what process? Context: Holometabolism, or complete metamorphosis, is where the insect changes in four stages, an egg or embryo, a larva, a pupa and the adult or imago. In these species, an egg hatches to produce a larva, which is generally worm-like in form. This worm-like form can be one of several varieties: eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa, a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon. There are three types of pupae: obtect, exarate or coarctate. Obtect pupae are compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed. Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended. Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin.:151 Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage, and emerge as adults.

Obama on torture memos: 'Time for reflection, not retribution' The Justice Department has today released memos issued by its Office of Legal Counsel on interrogation of terrorism suspectsÂ from 2002 to 2005. President Obama said in a statement that the release came \\"as part of an ongoing court case\\" and that the contents of the memos have already been widely reported. He said that \\"withholding these memos would only serve to deny facts that have been in the public domain for some time.\\" He also reiterated his opposition to prosecutions: This is a time for reflection, not retribution. I respect the strong views and emotions that these issues evoke. We have been through a dark and painful chapter in our history. But at a time of great challenges and disturbing disunity, nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past. Our national greatness is embedded in America's ability to right its course in concert with our core values, and to move forward with confidence. That is why we must resist the forces that divide us, and instead come together on behalf of our common future. The United States is a nation of laws. My administration will always act in accordance with those laws, and with an unshakeable commitment to our ideals. That is why we have released these memos, and that is why we have taken steps to ensure that the actions described within them never take place again. Politico has analysis and more from Obama's statement, including his view that these memos are a special case and the government must keep some information classified.

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which lake had more denser layers of water?  Scientists studied water stratification in two saltwater lakes. they were trying to find out why the fish population decreased in Long lake, and was very healthy and abundant in Shoal lake. They found out the phenomenon occurred more often in Long lake, leading to very many unpleasant chain effects.  Hint: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers.  Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] A:","output":"Long lake had more dense layers of water. Explanation: The paragraph explains that scientists were studying water stratification in two saltwater lakes - Long lake and Shoal lake - to understand the difference in their fish populations. They discovered that the phenomenon of water stratification occurred more often in Long lake, leading to many unpleasant chain effects. Since water stratification involves the formation of layers according to density, with denser layers sitting below less dense layers, it can be inferred from the context that Long lake had more dense layers of water than Shoal lake. This stratification could limit nutrient mixing, affect primary production, and result in a decreased fish population in Long lake as compared to Shoal lake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There is no story or plot, but a series of incidents, unexplained, that happen to a group of undeveloped characters. There is no tension because there is no story or character development. Since the events are entirely unexplained, there is no reason to read this book. I cannot recommend this to anyone other than collectors of poorly written trash. Oh, and both an editor and a copywritter would have been helpful...they couldn't have turned this pig's ear into a silk purse, but it would have been slighlty less painful.Oh, and one side note: The praise above for the author (not reader reviews, the critics reviews) is not for this book, but for a different book. I'm surprised that Amazon does this as it could mislead you into thinking there had been positive critical reviews for this book, when there haven't been. Answer: Answer:","output":"The product review presented is decidedly negative. Here's a breakdown of the issues raised by the reviewer: 1. Lack of story or plot: The reviewer highlights that the book does not possess a coherent narrative structure, which is a crucial element for engaging readers. The absence of a story or plot makes it difficult for the audience to follow and become invested in the book. 2. Series of unexplained incidents: The reviewer mentions the presence of numerous incidents that are not adequately explained, further hampering the reader's engagement and understanding of the story. This could lead to confusion and frustration. 3. Undeveloped characters: The characters in the book are not well-developed, meaning they lack depth, complexity, and relatability. Characters play a vital role in connecting readers to the story, and underdeveloped characters can leave readers feeling disinterested and detached. 4. Lack of tension and development: A key element of storytelling is creating tension and character development, which engage the audience and make them eager to follow the story to its conclusion. The absence of these elements renders the book uninteresting and less enjoyable for the reader, as indicated by the reviewer. 5. Inadequate editing and copywriting: The reviewer asserts that the book would have benefited from the intervention of an editor and a copywriter to improve its quality. This implies that the book contains errors or inconsistencies that could have been rectified, making the reading experience smoother and more satisfying. 6. Misleading praise for the author: Lastly, the reviewer raises concerns about the critical reviews mentioned on the product page, which are incorrectly attributed to the book in question. This could create false expectations for potential readers, who might assume the book has received positive feedback. In conclusion, this product review can be characterized as negative due to the various issues raised concerning story structure, character development, tension, editing, and misleading praise for the author. The reviewer's overall sentiment clearly demonstrates their dissatisfaction with the book and they urge readers to avoid it, specifically recommending it only for collectors of poorly written trash."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Good job, everyone!” That hour had been hell for everyone in the room, save only my little boy, sleeping peacefully in the warming crib, and his mother, who was just stirring from the general that had put her under about 55 minutes earlier. I had come within a few minutes, maybe seconds, of raising my boy as a single parent. Her OB/GYN had fought valliently to keep my family together, and won. Everyone who'd been awake knew exactly how close run a thing it had been. Mr. Murphy had been hanging around the whole time, and neither Doc nor mom was catching a whole lot of breaks that evening. But Doc only needed one, and he made full use thereof. One thing for all new dad's whose wives have had previous abdominal surgery. You never want to hear the muttered words, “Creative anatomy on the way out”, when somebody has your wife’s belly open. Those are about the worst words in the world, because they mean Doc's gotta put stuff to right in there, and he might not have what he'd like in order to get it done.

Here is a goal: How to make a frozen smoothie Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of making a frozen smoothie, it makes more sense to use fresh ingredients, a high-powered blender, and follow a simple recipe that enables you to create a delicious, refreshing beverage. Here's a step-by-step guide to making a frozen smoothie: 1. Gather ingredients: You will need a mixture of fruits, a liquid base, a thickener if desired, and flavoring agents. Some common ingredients include: - Fruits: Use a combination of fresh and frozen fruits for the best texture. Berries, bananas, mangoes, pineapple, and peaches are popular choices. - Liquid base: Choose from a variety of liquids, such as water, milk, almond milk, coconut milk, or fruit juice. - Thickener (optional): You can add yogurt, silken tofu, avocado, or nut butter to make your smoothie creamier and thicker. - Flavoring agents: Add sweeteners like honey, maple syrup, or agave nectar if needed, and a pinch of salt to enhance the flavor. You can also include spices like cinnamon or nutmeg or even extracts like vanilla to suit your taste. 2. Prepare the fruits: Wash and cut fresh fruits into small pieces. For a colder, thicker smoothie, consider freezing the fresh fruits for a few hours before blending. Peel and slice bananas and remove any seeds or cores from the fruits. 3. Get your blender ready: Ensure that your blender is clean and safe to use. A high-powered blender is recommended for a smooth and consistent texture. 4. Start blending: Add the prepared fruits to your blender first, followed by the liquid base. Put in about half the amount of liquid that you have in fruits, but you can adjust this ratio later for the desired thickness. If you're adding a thickener, include it now. Start blending at the lowest speed and gradually increase to the highest speed. Blend for about 45 seconds or until your smoothie reaches a creamy texture. 5. Taste and adjust: Give your smoothie a taste and then decide if it needs any adjustments. Add more fruits for thickness, more liquid for a thinner consistency, or additional sweeteners or flavorings to enhance the taste. Blend again for a few seconds to combine the additional ingredients. 6. Serve your frozen smoothie: Pour the smoothie into a glass or a to-go container. If you prefer an even colder beverage, you can serve it over ice. To add some visual appeal, garnish the smoothie with toppings like fresh fruit slices, nuts, coconut flakes, or granola. Enjoy your refreshing frozen treat. By following this adaptable process, you can easily create a wide range of frozen smoothies with various flavors, textures, and nutritional benefits. Experiment with different combinations of ingredients, and find your favorite frozen smoothie recipe that you can enjoy as a healthy snack, a post-workout refreshment, or a quick breakfast on-the-go."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Question: What are most people trying to do when going on vacation? Options: - panic - debate - having fun - debt - peace  Explain why a human would choose \\"having fun\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"Most people are trying to have fun when going on vacation. The primary purpose of a vacation for a majority of individuals is to take a break from the daily grind and indulge in activities that bring them joy, excitement, and relaxation. Let us further explore why \\"having fun\\" is the most appropriate answer to the question above, as well as why humans generally seek out this experience during their vacations. 1. Stress relief: In today's fast-paced world, humans face a lot of stress in their daily lives, be it from work, relationships, or personal issues. A vacation offers a valuable opportunity to break away from these stressors, allowing the individual to escape to a different environment and recharge their mental and emotional batteries. Engaging in fun activities during this time can significantly reduce feelings of stress and anxiety, making the person feel lighter and rejuvenated. 2. Quality time with loved ones: One of the primary reasons people go on vacations is to spend quality time with family and friends. Participating in entertaining and enjoyable activities together helps strengthen the bond between loved ones, creating cherished memories and fostering a sense of togetherness. Shared experiences of fun and adventure allow people to connect on a deeper level, thus improving their relationships and overall well-being. 3. Exploration and adventure: Vacations present numerous opportunities to explore new places, cultures, and experiences - all in the name of fun. Whether it is trying out a new activity, visiting an exotic location, or tasting unfamiliar cuisine, people typically seek out these novel experiences to break away from routine and expand their horizons. Engaging in such activities can be incredibly fulfilling and rewarding, as it not only broadens one's mindset but also cultivates a sense of personal growth. 4. Opportunities for personal growth: Many people appreciate the chance to step out of their comfort zones during their vacations, as it enables them to learn new skills, face challenges, and grow as individuals. Activities such as trekking, scuba diving, learning a new language, or even volunteering can offer personal enrichment and development, all while ensuring that the individual partakes in amusement and enjoyment. 5. Improved mental health and well-being: Engaging in fun activities on vacation, such as physical exercise, laughter, and exploration, can contribute to one's mental and emotional well-being. Not only do these experiences release endorphins - the body's natural mood elevators - but they also help increase self-esteem and foster a sense of achievement. Consequently, vacations can be seen as a catalyst for mental health improvement, encouraging relaxation, positivity, and overall happiness. In conclusion, when going on vacation, most people are primarily focused on having fun and creating memorable experiences. \\"Having fun\\" encompasses various aspects, such as stress relief, quality time with loved ones, exploration, personal growth, and improved mental well-being. These experiences allow individuals to enjoy a much-needed break from the monotony of daily life, ultimately contributing to a more balanced and fulfilled existence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While Nashiri was in Afghanistan, Nibras and Khamri saw their chance. They piloted the explosives-laden boat alongside the USS Cole, made friendly gestures to crew members, and detonated the bomb. Quso did not arrive at the apartment in time to film the attack. Back in Afghanistan,  Bin Laden anticipated U.S. military retaliation. He ordered the evacuation of al Qaeda's Kandahar airport compound and fled- first to the desert area near Kabul, then to Khowst and Jalalabad, and eventually back to Kandahar. In Kandahar, he rotated between five to six residences, spending one night at each residence. In addition, he sent his senior advisor, Mohammed Atef, to a different part of Kandahar and his deputy, Ayman al Zawahiri, to Kabul so that all three could not be killed in one attack. There was no American strike. In February 2001, a source reported that an individual whom he identified as the big instructor (probably a reference to  Bin Laden) complained frequently that the United States had not yet attacked. According to the source,  Bin Laden wanted the United States to attack, and if it did not he would launch something bigger. The attack on the USS Cole galvanized al Qaeda's recruitment efforts. Following the attack,  Bin Laden instructed the media committee, then headed by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, to produce a propaganda video that included a reenactment of the attack along with images of the al Qaeda training camps and training methods; it also highlighted Muslim suffering in Palestine, Kashmir, Indonesia, and Chechnya. Al Qaeda's image was very important to  Bin Laden, and the video was widely disseminated. Portions were aired on Al Jazeera, CNN, and other television outlets. It was also disseminated among many young men in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and caused many extremists to travel to Afghanistan for training and jihad. Al Qaeda members considered the video an effective tool in their struggle for preeminence among other Islamist and jihadist movements.  Question: \\"What actions did  Bin Laden take fearing retaliation?\\" Answer: \\"Fled to desert near Kabul\\" Is this answer to the question correct?

The online marketplace launched with 500 apps, mostly for established Web companies such as Facebook, eBay and Yelp. Today, it has more than 850,000. And, a couple of months ago, it passed a mind-boggling threshold, marking the 50 billionth app to be downloaded. Apple can no longer claim proprietary ownership of apps, those mini-programs that continue to push the boundaries of what a mobile phone can do. Google launched its own app store, now called Play, less than a year after Apple. Today, it's on a path toward surpassing Apple's number of downloads.

Answer:","output":"The Roman Empire, one of the greatest and most influential civilizations in world history, was centered in and around the city of Rome, which is located on the Italian Peninsula. Rome is situated in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, along the Tiber River, and it served as the heart of the empire from its founding in 753 BC until the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD. The city continues to exist today as the capital of Italy. The Roman Empire's dominance and power emanated from Rome and spread throughout a vast territory encompassing Europe, the Mediterranean Basin, parts of the Middle East, and North Africa. The size of the empire peaked during the reign of Emperor Trajan in the early 2nd century AD, with an estimated 5 million square kilometers, making it one of the largest empires in history. Beyond Rome itself, the empire's territory was divided into provinces, which were governed by appointed officials called proconsuls or governors. This vast network of provinces enabled efficient communication and administration, ensuring the empire's stability and growth for hundreds of years. Some key provinces included Britannia (modern-day Britain), Hispania (modern-day Spain and Portugal), Gallia (modern-day France), Aegyptus (modern-day Egypt), and Syria (modern-day Syria and Lebanon), among many others. One of the Roman Empire's most significant achievements was the construction of a highly intricate system of roads. These roads, which crisscrossed the empire, permitted efficient transportation of goods, people, and armies, fortifying Rome's power and reach. The city of Rome was the hub of this extensive network, as all major roads or \\"viae\\" led to it, which gave rise to the saying, \\"All roads lead to Rome.\\" The Roman Empire also benefited from the Mediterranean Sea, which acted as a natural highway for trade and cultural exchange. The empire's vast coastline allowed Rome to establish a powerful naval force, which was instrumental in securing its dominance over the Mediterranean region and safeguarding vital trade routes. The empire was multicultural in nature, as it absorbed various cultures and peoples throughout its expansion. This cultural diversity was evident in the empire's art, architecture, literature, and customs, ensuring the empire's legacy would be timeless and far-reaching. In terms of governance, the Roman Empire had a complex political system that consisted of various bodies and branches, with the emperor being the supreme leader. The government consisted of the Senate, the equestrian class, and the plebeian class, which coexisted in a delicate balance of power and influence. The structure of the Roman Empire's administration allowed for efficient governance, even as its territory expanded. In conclusion, the Roman Empire was centered around the city of Rome on the Italian Peninsula, and its influence reached across a vast expanse of territories encompassing Europe, the Mediterranean Basin, the Middle East, and North Africa. Rome's strategic location, the intricate system of roads, the might of its naval forces, and its efficient administrative structure enabled the empire to maintain its power and control for centuries. Despite the eventual fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, the city of Rome and the legacy of the Roman Empire continue to shape world history and culture to this day."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

[B]. shrimp were probably of older stock.","output":"The clams tasted worse than the shrimp did, so the clams were probably of older stock. This suggests that the clams may have been sitting around for a longer period of time before being cooked and served, leading to a decline in their overall taste and quality. While it is true that different types of seafood can have varying degrees of freshness and taste, in this case, it seems that the clams were the likely culprit behind the disappointing dining experience. It is generally advised to consume seafood as fresh as possible, as older stock may not only lose its flavors and textures but also poses a risk of foodborne illness. Ensuring the quality of the seafood being used would significantly impact the outcome of any dish. One possible cause for these old clams could have been improper storage conditions or a lack of proper rotation of stock at the restaurant or supplier. Temperature control is essential for seafood preservation, especially for products like clams that may become inedible as they age. Additionally, restaurants and suppliers should adhere to the first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle, in which older products are used or sold before newer ones, to help maintain the freshness of their seafood offerings. Consumers can often judge the freshness of clams by their appearance and smell. Fresh clams should have a clean, ocean-like aroma and be tightly shut or close when tapped lightly. Clams that show signs of age, such as a strong odor or shells that remain open, should be avoided. In conclusion, the taste difference in the scenario mentioned suggests that the clams were likely from an older stock than the shrimp, which led to their inferior taste. To avoid such situations, it is crucial for both suppliers and restaurants to maintain proper storage conditions and follow stock rotation practices. Additionally, consumers should be vigilant in assessing the freshness of seafood before purchasing or consuming it."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","output":"Yes, the statement \\"On the Origin of Species, published on 24 November 1859, is a work of scientific literature by Charles Darwin which is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology.\\" is a reasonable answer to the question regarding Darwin's Origin of Species. However, it can be elaborated upon to provide a more detailed and comprehensive response. \\"On the Origin of Species\\" is a book written by British naturalist Charles Darwin that introduced the scientific theory of evolution through the process of natural selection. It was the culmination of Darwin's years of research and analysis on the variation of species and how their traits were passed on to future generations. The full title of the book is \\"On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.\\" In this groundbreaking work, Darwin proposed that the natural world was not static and unchanging, but rather that it evolved and adapted over time. He argued that species were not independently created but descended from other species through a long, slow process of change. Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection revolved around several key ideas. First, he observed that populations of organisms tend to produce more offspring than can survive. This overproduction leads to a struggle for survival, in which only the fittest organisms with the best-adapted traits for their environment will survive and reproduce. Second, Darwin recognized that there was variation within populations, and these variations could be passed on to offspring. Over time, these heritable variations would accumulate and change the nature of the species. As the environment changed, so too would the traits necessary for survival, and populations would evolve to adapt to these changes. Darwin's \\"On the Origin of Species\\" sparked controversy at the time of its publication, as it challenged religious and deeply ingrained beliefs about the nature of life and the role of a divine creator. However, it also laid the foundation for modern evolutionary biology and provided a unifying explanation for the diversity of life on Earth. In the years following the publication of \\"On the Origin of Species,\\" scientists from various disciplines began conducting research that supported Darwin's theory. With the discovery of genetics and the understanding of DNA in the 20th century, scientists were able to demonstrate how genetic inheritance worked and further validate Darwin's concept of natural selection. Today, Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection remains a central principle in biology, providing a consistent framework for understanding the diversity of life on Earth. His book, \\"On the Origin of Species,\\" is viewed as a seminal work that transformed our comprehension of the natural world and our own place within it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They all live together in a large apartment with Joan (Edy Gall), Frank's teenage daughter from a previous marriage. Carol has been visiting a psychoanalyst (George Rigaud) because of a string of disturbing dreams shes been having featuring her decadent neighbor, Julia Durer (Anita Strindberg). Julia's frequent, late-night parties infuriate and yet exite Carol, evoking images of wild sex-and-drug orgies.During a meeting between Edmund and Frank, they talk about their recent court cases in which Edmund asks Frank if he has been unfaithful to Carol, which Frank denies. Then a phone call is made by an anonymous woman who claims to Edmund that she has damaging information about his family. But unknown to everyone, Frank is indeed having an affair with his personal secretary Deborah whom he meets after work at her country house for some romantic tryst.Carol's dreams continue which become more complicated during scenes that appear to be dreams or hallucinations, but may be partly real. Describing her latest one to her psychoanalyst, they depict a lesbian encounter between the two women, culminating in Carol grisly stabbing the seductive Julia to death. In an enigmatic coda to the dream sequence, Carol sees two kaftan-clad hippies (Mike Kennedy and Penny Brown) who have apparently witnessed the whole thing without intervening.The following day, it's revealed that Julia Durer has indeed been murdered.

A:","output":"In the movie \\"A Lizard in a Woman's Skin,\\" the clothing item found near the body is a discarded fur coat. This detail is significant because it ties Carol Hammond to the murder scene, making her the primary suspect. The film presents an intriguing and complex plot that explores the realms of dreams, reality, and possible mental instability. Carol, the daughter of a wealthy lawyer and politician, struggles with disturbing dreams featuring her neighbor, Julia Durer. The dreams evoke a mix of fascination and repulsion, as they involve wild and indulgent sex-and-drug orgies. As the story unfolds, the dreams become more complicated and intense, eventually culminating in Carol seemingly killing Julia in a violent act. What complicates matters further is that Carol's dream turns out to be shockingly close to reality when Julia is found murdered. Inspector Corvin from Scotland Yard, who leads the investigation, discovers that the murder scene and the condition of the body closely resemble the details from Carol's dream sequence. This revelation, coupled with the discovery of the fur coat near the body, makes Carol the prime suspect in the murder investigation. However, the film's narrative doesn't let the viewers easily settle on Carol as the culprit. Instead, it presents multiple layers of possible explanations and motives. For instance, Frank, Carol's husband, is revealed to be having an affair with his secretary, possibly giving him a motive to eliminate Julia, who is perceived as a threat to his marriage. Furthermore, the story becomes more enigmatic when Carol's dream sequence reveals the presence of two witnesses who did not intervene in the murder. As the investigation unfolds, the lines between reality and dream become increasingly blurred, adding to the suspense and keeping the audience guessing.

Questioned Tuesday about Trump's comments, Ryan said \\"I regret those comments he made. Claiming a person can't do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of racism.\\" But he did not retract his endorsement of Trump, made last week, and he said he does not believe Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton is \\"the answer.\\" Ryan made his comments during an appearance at a women's shelter in Washington, D.C. In a New York Times interview, Graham, also a former presidential candidate, said Trump's remarks were \\"the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy,\\" referring to the ultra-conservative senator of the 1950s who fueled fears of widespread communist subversion in the United States.

They later get involved with arms-traffickers who smuggle guns out of a monastery, and who mistakenly think they're a pair of federal agents. It all winds up falling flat in spite of a couple of funny scenes, especially the one where Trinity and Bambino are in a fancy French restaurant and don't know how to carry themselves. And the scenes with the card sharks was mildly humorous as well. The opening title music sung by Gene Roman sounds like a fair Bobby Goldsboro-like early 70s pop song while the music cues sprinkled throughout the movie are pretty good. Not sure if I'd want to buy the CD soundtrack of it but some others might. The film could have had a half hour whacked off of it and it wouldn't have dragged on for so long. It looks like a lot of scenery is being chewed up here. In fact, I lost interest in it about 2/3rds of the way through. The DVD is also terrible, with a constant hum in the soundtrack and a poor print that looks like it should have been sent to that great scrap heap in the sky. A big step down from the previous film. 4 out of 10","output":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly negative. The reviewer mentions that the film is \\"largely boring\\" and \\"drawn-out,\\" and states that it is \\"a big step down from the previous film.\\" They give it a low rating of 4 out of 10.  Positive points: 1. A couple of funny scenes, such as one in a restaurant and the scenes with card sharks. Negative points: 1. The film seems like a cash grab made to capitalize on the success of the previous movie. 2. The film didn't have much success in the U.S. 3. The promise of the main characters as successful outlaws falls flat. 4. The film could have been 30 minutes shorter without losing anything important. 5. The reviewer lost interest in the film 2/3rds of the way through. 6. The DVD has poor quality, with a bad print and a constant hum in the soundtrack. In conclusion, the negative aspects of the review significantly outnumber and outweigh the positive points, resulting in an overall negative sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One of the shows was named \\"Hannity,\\" and it was led by a man called Sean Hannity. On this show, people talked about many things, and sometimes they had special guests. Recently, a lady named Sydney Leathers was invited to the show \\"Hannity\\" for a special talk. Now, who is Ms. Leathers? She's a woman who was involved in a big story a few years ago. What's even more interesting is that the story also involved a man named Anthony Weiner. Mr. Weiner used to be a very important person who worked for the government and made many decisions for a big city called New York. However, Mr. Weiner made some mistakes, and that got him in a lot of trouble. So, what happened? One day, it was discovered that Mr. Weiner had been sending not-so-nice pictures and messages to different women, including our guest Ms. Leathers. This made many people very upset, and they didn't want him to be in charge of making decisions for the city anymore. As the news spread, it became known as the \\"Anthony Weiner Scandal.\\" When Ms. Leathers appeared on the show \\"Hannity,\\" she was asked questions about her involvement in the scandal. She told the whole story of what happened between her and Mr. Weiner, and it surprised many people to find out the details. Some people even felt sorry for her, while others believed that she had not done anything wrong. As friends and families sat together, watching the television with their eyes glued to the screen, they listened and learned about the Anthony Weiner scandal. The story was big news because it taught everyone that even important people can make mistakes, and that it is essential to be honest and careful with what we do."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Xi Jinping (; Chinese: Xi Jin Ping ; pinyin: Xi Jinping; born 15 June 1953) is a Chinese politician currently serving as General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, President of the People's Republic of China, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission. As Xi holds the top offices of the party, the state, and the military, he is sometimes referred to as China's \\"paramount leader\\"; in 2016, the party officially gave him the title of \\"core\\" leader. Xi Jinping was born in Beijing on 15 June 1953. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 by Mao Zedong, Xi's father held a series of posts, including propaganda chief, vice-premier, and vice-chairman of the National People's Congress. Xi's father is from Fuping County, Shaanxi, and Xi could further trace his patrilineal descent from Xiying in Dengzhou, Henan. He is the second son of Xi Zhongxun and his wife Qi Xin.  In 1963, when Xi was age 10, his father was purged from the Party and sent to work in a factory in Luoyang, Henan. In May 1966, Xi's secondary education was cut short by the Cultural Revolution, when all secondary classes were halted for students to criticise and fight their teachers. The Xi family home was ransacked by student militants and one of Xi's sisters, Xi Heping, was killed. Later, his own mother was forced to publicly denounce him as Xi was paraded before a crowd as an enemy of the revolution. Xi was aged 15 when his father was imprisoned in 1968 during the Cultural Revolution; Xi would not see his father again until 1972. Without the protection of his father, Xi was sent to work in Liangjiahe Village, Wen'anyi Town, Yanchuan County, Yan'an, Shaanxi, in 1969 in Mao Zedong's Down to the Countryside Movement. After a few months, unable to stand rural life, he ran away to Beijing. He was arrested during a crackdown on deserters from the countryside and sent to a work camp to dig ditches. He later became the Party branch secretary of the production team, leaving that post in 1975. When asked about this experience later by Chinese state television, Xi recalled, \\"It was emotional. It was a mood. And when the ideals of the Cultural Revolution could not be realised, it proved an illusion.\\"  From 1975 to 1979, Xi studied chemical engineering at Beijing's prestigious Tsinghua University as a \\"Worker-Peasant-Soldier student\\", where engineering majors spent about one-fifth of their time studying Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong thought, doing farm work and \\"learning from the People's Liberation Army\\".  From 1979 to 1982, Xi served as secretary for his father's former subordinate Geng Biao, the then vice premier and secretary-general of the Central Military Commission. This gained Xi some military background. In 1985, as part of a Chinese delegation to study U.S. agriculture, he stayed in the home of an American family in the town of Muscatine, Iowa. This trip, and his two-week stay with a U.S. family, is said to have had a lasting impression upon him and his views on the United States.  From 1998 to 2002, he studied Marxist philosophy and ideological education in an \\"on-the-job\\" postgraduate programme at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, again at Tsinghua University, and obtained a Doctor of Law (LLD) degree, which was a degree covering fields of law, politics, management, and revolutionary history, though commentators have questioned this qualification. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What did this lead to","output":"Xi Jinping is a very important leader in China. He is like the boss of the country and helps make big decisions. He was born many years ago, in 1953, and his dad was also an important person in China. When Xi Jinping was younger, he had to work very hard and had some tough times. He also went to a big school called Tsinghua University and learned many things like about how to help people and make good choices. This helped him become the leader he is today."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

First, let's look at the problem: 385 × r - 358 × r + 34026 = 348 × r 2. We want to find the value of \\"r\\" that solves the equation. 3. To do this, we need to simplify the equation by combining the r terms on the left side. Let's combine the r terms: 385 × r - 358 × r = (385 - 358) × r = 27 × r Now, the equation looks like this: 27 × r + 34026 = 348 × r 4. Next, we want to move the r terms to one side of the equation and the numbers to the other side. To do this, we can subtract 27 × r from both sides: 27 × r - 27 × r + 34026 = 348 × r - 27 × r This simplifies to: 34026 = 321 × r 5. Now, we want to find the value of r. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 321: 34026 ÷ 321 = r 6. When we perform this calculation, we find that: r ≈ 106 So, the value of r that solves the equation is approximately 106."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

An ad in prime-time television may cost 250,000 to 5,000,000 or more per minute, whereas a five-minute report on a network newscast would not cost anything. Publicity reaches a mass audience within a short time and new products or company policies are widely known. Credibility about messages is high, because they are reported in independent media. A newspaper review of a movie has more believability than an ad in the same paper, because the reader associates independence with objectivity. Similarly, people are more likely to pay attention to news reports than to ads. For example, Women's Wear Daily has both fashion reports and advertisements. Readers spend time reading the stories, but they skim through the ads. Furthermore, there may be 10 commercials during a half-hour television program or hundreds of ads in a magazine. Feature stories are much fewer in number and stand out clearly. Publicity also has some significant limitations. A firm has little control over messages, their timing, their placement, or their coverage by a given medium. It may issue detailed news releases and find only portions mentioned by the media, and media have the ability to be much more critical than a firm would like. For example, in 1982, Procter & Gamble faced a massive publicity problem over the meaning of its 123-year-old company logo. To fight this negative publicity, the firm had a spokesperson appear on Good Morning America to disprove the rumor  . The false rumors were temporarily put to rest.

He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

In our story, the family members of these Chinese leaders have been found to have links to those faraway companies. This is really interesting because it makes people wonder if these important leaders and their families are doing something sneaky, or if they are just trying to save money like everyone else. Since these families are connected to powerful people, it's important to make sure they're doing the right thing. So, to quickly review, seven families of important Chinese leaders have been found to have connections with offshore firms, which are companies located in different countries. This news is making some people curious and concerned about what these famous families might be doing. That's all for now! Remember, it's always good to learn and ask questions about the world around us. Have a great day!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

By Australian Associated Press and Sally Lee Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australia will do everything in its power to ensure the bodies of the Australians killed on Flight MH17 are respected. 'We owe it to the dead, all the dead, we owe it to the families, all the families to do everything in our power to respect the bodies, to find the truth and to ensure justice is done,' Mr Abbott told 60 Minutes on Sunday night.

The most logical way to complete the passage is with \\"Russia supplied weapon.\\" This choice suggests that Prime Minister Tony Abbott accuses Russia of providing the weapon that shot down Flight MH17 and holds Russia responsible for the incident. The other options do not make logical sense in this context, as they involve various unrelated entities (e.g., Australia, Channel 9, New York, etc.) being suggested as the weapon supplier. In the context of the passage, which discusses the crash site in eastern Ukraine — an area with known Russian involvement — blaming Russia is the most plausible answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A valid argument is clearly interpretable and either expresses an argument, or a premise or a conclusion that can be used in an argument for the topic of death penalty. An invalid argument is a phrase that cannot be interpreted as an argument or not on the topic of death penalty. Teacher: Now, understand the problem?

Student:","output":"To complete this task, you need to assess whether the given argument is valid or invalid based on the definition provided. The definition states that a valid argument is clearly interpretable, expresses an argument, or is a premise or conclusion that can be used in an argument for the topic of death penalty. An invalid argument is a phrase that cannot be interpreted as an argument or not on the topic of death penalty. Here's the given argument: \\"Bloodsworth was released from prison in June 1993 and pardoned in December 1993.\\" Now, let's break the task down step by step. Step 1: Determine if the argument is related to the topic of the death penalty. The argument concerns an individual's release from prison and subsequent pardon. Though it doesn't explicitly mention the death penalty, it is related to the broader topic of criminal justice, of which the death penalty is a part. Thus, it can be considered as related to the topic of the death penalty. Step 2: Check if the argument is clearly interpretable. The argument is clear and straightforward: Bloodsworth was released from prison in June 1993 and pardoned in December 1993. There is no ambiguity surrounding this statement. Step 3: Assess whether the argument presents a premise or conclusion that can be used in an argument for or against the death penalty. While the statement itself doesn't express an argument for or against the death penalty, it can be used as a premise in a broader argument concerning issues such as the potential for wrongful convictions, which might be relevant in a discussion about the death penalty. Based on these steps, we can conclude that the given argument is valid. Though it doesn't directly express an argument for or against the death penalty, it provides a premise that can be used in such an argument."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Next question: the plane that divides the animal into cranial and caudal parts is the?","output":"The plane that divides an animal into cranial (or anterior) and caudal (or posterior) parts is known as the transverse plane, also referred to as the axial or cross-sectional plane. To provide a comprehensive understanding, let's first discuss the different anatomical directions and planes used when analyzing and describing animal anatomy. 1. Anatomical Directions: a. Cranial (Anterior): Refers to the side of the body or structure that is closer to the head. In humans, this would be the front side, and in quadruped animals, the side towards the head. b. Caudal (Posterior): Refers to the side of the body or structure that is closer to the tail end. In humans, this would be the back side, and in quadruped animals, the side towards the tail. c. Dorsal: Refers to the upper or back side of the body or structure. d. Ventral: Refers to the lower or front side of the body or structure. e. Medial: Refers to structures or sides that are near or towards the midline or center of the body. f. Lateral: Describes structures or sides that are toward the side or away from the midline of the body. g. Proximal: Refers to structures that are closer to the point of attachment or origin. h. Distal: Refers to structures that are farther from the point of attachment or origin. 2. Anatomical Planes: a. Sagittal Plane: This is a vertical plane that divides the body into left and right parts. The midsagittal or median plane refers specifically to the vertical plane that perfectly creates equal left and right halves of the body. b. Transverse Plane: This is a horizontal plane that divides the body into cranial and caudal parts, or in humans, superior (upper) and inferior (lower) parts. c. Frontal (Coronal) Plane: It is a vertical plane that divides the body into dorsal (back) and ventral (front) sections, or in humans, anterior (front) and posterior (back) parts. In summary, the transverse plane is the one that divides an animal's body into cranial (anterior) and caudal (posterior) parts. This plane, along with sagittal and frontal planes, are essential for understanding spatial relationships and providing precise descriptive language for various anatomical structures in the field of veterinary medicine, human medicine, and comparative anatomy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sirhan Bishara Sirhan is a Palestinian-born Jordanian, who was convicted for the assassination of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. As stated in the text, Kennedy was shot by Sirhan at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California. The attack took place on June 5, 1968, after Kennedy completed his speech to celebrate his win in the California Democratic presidential primary. He was then rushed to Good Samaritan Hospital in an attempt to save his life, but he ultimately succumbed to his injuries and died on June 6, 1968, as indicated in the text. It is crucial to note the assassination's impact on American politics and the Kennedy family. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was a key political figure in the United States during the 1960s, serving as the Attorney General under his brother, President John F. Kennedy, and actively participating in the civil rights movement. His death came only five years after his brother's assassination, adding to the tragic legacy of the Kennedy family. Furthermore, the assassination of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy led to an increased push for gun control legislation in the United States and enhanced security measures for political figures. It also marked a turning point in American political history, as many people viewed Kennedy as a promising leader who could unite a deeply divided country during a time of social upheaval.

He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath. Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog.

I kinda thought of an idea to get back at him for all the pain he caused me.  He asked to meet up for dinner just to talk. We’d pay for our own things. I agree to it. I purposely leave my wallet at home, make it sound like a mistake. I pretend to realize this after the check comes. He’s annoyed, but he pays. Then, we’re in his car. We start making out and after a while he’s all hot and bothered. After it’s obvious that he thinks he’s going to score, I pull away and tell him that I want to go home. I made it sound like I thought it was a bad idea, but I actually planned to do this. He was angry. Drove me home.  I thought this would finally make him leave me alone. But he didn’t. still got messaged two times a month. Eventually he stopped though and got the hint.  AITA for getting back at an awful person who deserved it?

Article: It's the dieting fashion that is sweeping the world, and encourages fasting   for two days of the week. But does it work? People are starving themselves to lose weight, with a dieting trend known as the \\"fast diet\\" growing in popularity. The method is also known as the 5:2 diet, and consists of eating normally for five days of a week and cutting calories to about 25 percent of normal intake during other two days. Men consume just 600 calories on the two fast days, while women are limited to 500 calories. Notably, the two fasting days should not be _ . The dieter should have at least one normal eating day in between. In the best-selling book The Fast Diet: Lose Weight, Stay Healthy, and Live Longer with the Simple Secret of Intermittent   Fasting by Dr. Michael Mosley and Mimi Spencer, the two authors claim that the 5:2 diet not only promotes weight loss, but also benefits health, offering protection from disease, improved cognitive   function and increased lifespan. The diet originated in the United Kingdom and became popular in the United States. Now, it is gaining popularity among the Chinese middle-class. Zhong Minghui, who is 178 cm tall and used to weigh 100 kilograms, finds fasting effective in weight control. He works in the sales department of a trade company and used to drink and eat a lot after work. After sticking to the fasting diet for five months, he managed to lose about 20 kilograms. \\"Actually I did not exactly rely on the 5:2 diet to lose weight. My fasting was more extreme. I almost completely cut off my supper every day and only ate some fruit. I also used an app to calculate the calories in the food I ate and was cautious of not eating any high-calorie food. I did about an hour's aerobic exercise   every day.

Given the question: Information:  - Belgians are the citizens and natives of the Kingdom of Belgium, a federal state in Western Europe.  - A solicitor is a legal practitioner who traditionally deals with most of the legal matters in some jurisdictions. A person must have legally-defined qualifications, which vary from one jurisdiction to another, to be described as a solicitor and enabled to practise there as such. For example, in England and Wales a solicitor is admitted to practise under the provisions of the Solicitors Act 1974. With some exceptions, practising solicitors must possess a practising certificate. There are many more solicitors than barristers in England; they undertake the general aspects of giving legal advice and conducting legal proceedings.  - Jurisdiction (from the Latin \\"ius, \\" meaning \\"law\\" and \\"\\" meaning \\"to speak\\") is the practical authority granted to a legal body to administer justice within a defined area of responsibility, e.g., Michigan tax law. In the federations like USA, areas of jurisdiction apply to local, state, and federal levels; e.g. the court has jurisdiction to apply federal law.  - A bar association is a professional body of lawyers. Some bar associations are responsible for the regulation of the legal profession in their jurisdiction; others are professional organizations dedicated to serving their members; in many cases, they are both. In many Commonwealth jurisdictions, the bar association comprises lawyers who are qualified as barristers or advocates in particular, versus solicitors (see \\"bar council\\"). Membership in bar associations may be mandatory or optional for practicing attorneys, depending on jurisdiction.  - An advocate is a type of professional person in several different legal systems and it is also a commonly used \\"honorific\\" for remarkable lawyers, such as in \\"Adv. Sir Alberico Gentili\\". The broad equivalent in many English law-based jurisdictions can be a \\"barrister\\". However, in Scottish, South African, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Scandinavian, Polish, South Asian and South American jurisdictions, advocate is also a word to indicate lawyers of superior classification.  - The University of Pittsburgh School of Law (sometimes referred to as Pitt Law) was founded in 1895. It became a charter member of the Association of American Law Schools in 1900. Its primary home facility is the Barco Law Building. The school offers four degrees: Master of Studies in Law, Juris Doctor, Master of Laws for international students, and the Doctor of Juridical Science. The school offers several international legal programs, operates a variety of clinics, and publishes several law journals.  - A bar council or bar association, in a common law jurisdiction with a legal profession split between solicitors and barristers or advocates, is a professional body that regulates the profession of barristers. In such jurisdictions, solicitors are generally regulated by the law society.  - Bernard J. Hibbitts is a Canadian lawyer, professor, and publisher currently teaching in the United States at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. Originally trained as a legal historian whose McLuhanistic early work focused on the historical relationship between law, media and the senses, he wrote a series of controversial articles in the mid-1990s on the future of law reviews and scholarly publishing in the then-just-emerging age of the Internet. He is best known today as the founder and publisher of JURIST, the Webby award-winning online legal news service, established in 1996. He is Chairman of the Board of Directors of JURIST Legal News and Research Services, Inc., a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.  - A barrister (also known as barrister-at-law or bar-at-law) is a type of lawyer in common law jurisdictions who works at higher levels of court. Barristers mostly specialise in courtroom advocacy and litigation. Their tasks include taking cases in superior courts and tribunals, drafting legal pleadings, researching the philosophy, hypothesis and history of law, and giving expert legal opinions. Often, barristers are also recognised as \\"legal scholars\\".  - The High Fens , which were declared a nature reserve in 1957, are an upland area, a plateau region in the province of Liège, in the east of Belgium and adjoining parts of Germany, between the Ardennes and the Eifel highlands. The High Fens are the largest nature reserve or park in Belgium, with an area of ; it lies within the German-Belgian natural park \\"Hohes Venn-Eifel\\", in the Ardennes. Its highest point, at above sea level, is the Signal de Botrange near Eupen, and also the highest point in Belgium. A tower high was built here that reaches above sea level. The reserve is a rich ecological endowment of Belgium covered with alpine sphagnum raised bogs (not \\"fens\\" as the name would imply) both on the plateau and in the valley basin; the bogs, which are over 10,000 years old, with their unique subalpine flora, fauna and microclimate, are key to the conservation work of the park.  - A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services.  - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - The Netherlands  is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean.

How do you do this: Cook an bacon in the air fryer","output":"Sure, I'd be happy to guide you through the steps of cooking bacon in an air fryer. Here's what you would typically do: Step 1: Prepare the Bacon Before you even switch on your air fryer, you'll need to prepare your bacon. Lay out your bacon strips. Keep in mind, depending on the size of your air fryer, you may not be able to cook a whole pack of bacon at once. Step 2: Preheating the Air Fryer Preheat the air fryer to 180°C or 360°F. This step is important to ensure that your bacon cooks evenly.  Step 3: Load the Fryer Place the bacon strips into your air fryer basket. You want to avoid overlapping them as much as possible so that they can cook evenly. Depending on the size of your air fryer, you may need to cook the bacon in batches. Step 4: Cook Now that your bacon is in the air fryer, you can close it and set the timer. On average, it should take about 10 minutes for your bacon to cook, but this can vary based on the thickness of the bacon and how crispy you like it.  Step 5: Checking the Bacon It's advisable to check on your bacon halfway through the cooking time to ensure nothing's going awry. You can look to see if it’s cooking evenly and adjust the slices if needed.  Step 6: Removing the Bacon Once the bacon has achieved your preferred level of crispiness, it's time to remove it. It's best to use tongs to do this, due to the heat from the air fryer. Step 7: Drain the Bacon After removing it from the air fryer, place the bacon on a plate lined with paper towels. The paper towels will absorb the excess grease, leaving you with crispier bacon. Just to note, take into account the wattage and model of your air fryer can affect cooking time, so it's always best to keep an eye on the bacon to avoid overcooking or undercooking it. Always consult your model's specific instructions where necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Mayfield Brewery was a brewery that operated in Mayfield, California between years 1868 and 1920. The brewery was located at what is now the corner of California Avenue and Birch Street in Palo Alto, California. The brewery produced Steam beer and sold it in kegs to local saloons. The brewery was shut down by Prohibition. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Prohibition had a negative impact on the workers of Mayfield Brewery.","output":"To determine if the sentence \\"Prohibition had a negative impact on the workers of Mayfield Brewery\\" is true based on the information provided, we can follow these steps: 1. Identify the relevant facts from the paragraph.    - The Mayfield Brewery operated between 1868 and 1920.    - The brewery was shut down by Prohibition. 2. Analyze the connection between the facts.    - Prohibition led to the closure of the Mayfield Brewery. 3. Determine the potential impact on the workers.    - As the brewery was shut down due to Prohibition, it is reasonable to assume that the workers at the brewery lost their jobs or had to find employment elsewhere, as the production at the brewery ceased. 4. Evaluate the impact as negative or positive.    - Losing a job or being forced to find new employment can generally be regarded as a negative impact, especially considering the context of the Prohibition era, when many businesses in the alcohol industry were affected.

Which statement best describes the climate of Nevada? Options:  a). Temperature at night dropped behind a cold front.  b). Wind increased during the day.  c). Humidity is low throughout every summer.  d). Air pressure increased gradually all week.","output":"c). Humidity is low throughout every summer. Nevada has a primarily arid to semi-arid climate, with low humidity throughout the year and particularly during the summer months. Spanning across the western region of the United States, Nevada experiences substantial variations in its climate due to its diverse landscape which includes large deserts, mountain ranges, and flat plains. Despite this diversity, the low humidity during summer is the most consistent and prominent characteristic. The other options provided are not ideal choices to describe Nevada's climate, and here's why: a). Temperature at night dropped behind a cold front. Cold fronts can happen in any part of the world and are not specific to the climate of Nevada. While temperatures may indeed drop during the night in Nevada, this statement doesn't give a comprehensive description of the state's overall climate. Nevada experiences a wide range of temperature differences between day and night, particularly in desert areas, but this statement doesn't capture the essence of the overall climate. b). Wind increased during the day. Although Nevada can experience strong gusts of wind due to its geographic location, this statement is not the most accurate depiction of its climate. Wind conditions can vary across the state, with some areas experiencing calm conditions, while others may have stronger winds due to their proximity to mountain ranges or the topography of the region. However, the presence of wind alone is not sufficiently indicative of Nevada's climate. d). Air pressure increased gradually all week. This statement is not an apt description of the climate in Nevada, as changes in air pressure are common in various climates and regions around the world. In general, air pressure can fluctuate according to weather conditions and atmospheric patterns. In Nevada, air pressure can change depending on the time of the year, weather systems, and geographical factors such as elevation. As such, this statement does not provide a clear understanding of Nevada's overall climate. In conclusion, the best statement to describe Nevada's climate is \\"c). Humidity is low throughout every summer.\\" The hot and dry conditions of the state, resulting from its desert landscape and semi-arid climate, make low humidity the primary characteristic that sets Nevada's climate apart from other regions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As the oven is heating up, line your baking sheet with parchment paper. If you don't have any parchment paper, non-stick cooking spray will do in a pinch, or a little melted butter. You want it to be soft, but not liquidy. Room temperature should be fine, as it will be easy to blend. If you need, put the butter briefly in the microwave — 4-5 seconds, tops. Mix everything well so that there are no clumps and everything is well distributed. Cream of tartar leads to a light tang and helps the cookies get fluffy. However, if you want crispier cookies or don't want this tangy edge, you can skip the cream of tartar. Mix the butter/margarine and sugar together until fluffy. Keep your electric beaters on medium speed and work the softened butter until it is a nice whipped, semi-stiff mixture. All of the sugar should be incorporated into the butter. This should only take 3-5 minutes of mixing. Keep the mixer going until the eggs are completely incorporated into the butter mixture. Use a rubber spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl as necessary, making sure everything is well mixed. Want tangier, less sweet cookies? Skip the vanilla. Add the flour in small chunks, keeping the mixer going the entire time. This prevents flour \\"explosions,\\" where the beaters scatter the flour instead of mixing it. As you add flour, keep scraping the sides of the bowl to make sure everything is getting added in. After dough is thoroughly mixed, chill it for 30-45 minutes to guarantee the best results. Start with 2 tablespoons of each, adding more as necessary. Feel free to play with this ratio as well -- while few chefs use more cinnamon than sugar, many will add a few extra parts sugar to avoid overly spiced cookies. You can use a small spoon to measure out the dough, then roll it between your palms to form the dough balls. You then roll the dough in the cinnamon sugar to coat it completely. Make sure the cookies are at least 2 inches apart, as they will flatten and spread as they cook. A good snickerdoodle has a light, chewy texture, not a crunch. You want to try and keep the tops of the cookies light, so remove them when the outsides are just getting golden for the best cookies. Let them cool on the baking sheet for 2-3 minute before eating.","output":"This article provides a detailed guide on how to make snickerdoodle cookies, highlighting the importance of proper butter consistency, the optional use of cream of tartar, incorporating ingredients, chilling the dough, and specific baking techniques for achieving the desired cookie texture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran have increased this year, particularly over Bahrain and Syria, and relations are likely to worsen on the news of the alleged Iranian plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in Washington. But ironically, the rise of more representative governments in key Arab countries poses risks to both Iran and Saudi Arabia. While each country will seek to defend its allies against uprisings (for Saudi Arabia, the Bahraini ruling family; and for Iran, the Syrian regime), neither will be able to control or dominate the changing regional dynamics -- and both have reasons to worry about the risk of unrest at home. The news comes at a time when regional relationships are in flux. The ongoing domestic political changes in a number of key countries -- especially Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and Syria -- will create new foreign alliances and rivalries. There are few certainties. It is not yet clear whether these countries will become democratic in the near future, or which parties will be empowered. New political players have plenty of domestic challenges to absorb their attention and won't necessarily be focused on foreign policy for some time. With these caveats, however, here are four predictions about the new Arab order. 1) Dividing the region into two \\"camps\\" is an oversimplification. In recent years, many analysts and policy makers saw a \\"pro-Western\\" camp, led by Saudi Arabia and Egypt, opposed to a self-styled \\"resistance\\" camp of Iran, Syria, Hezbollah and Hamas. But new political players will probably want to avoid being forced into these old categories. Emerging political players in Egypt and Tunisia, whether Islamist or secular, generally do not want their countries to look like either Saudi Arabia or Iran. Representative governments would not be as reflexively pro-Western as their predecessors. They are likely to be more pro-Palestinian,and more sympathetic to the fact that Hamas and Hezbollah are both popularly-elected movements, but they will also be wary of Iran. Analysts have also written about the countries of the revolution versus the countries of the counter-revolution, meaning the Gulf states. But the Gulf states have backed the uprising in Libya and have withdrawn their support from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad -- indicating that they will not necessarily act as a conservative force throughout the region. 2) Egyptian-Saudi rivalry will be a defining feature. In the 1950s and 1960s, Egypt and Saudi Arabia were major regional rivals, with Egypt representing pan-Arab nationalism, socialism and sympathy for the \\"non-aligned\\" movement, while Saudi Arabia was a more traditional, pro-US monarchy. The two countries backed opposing sides in the Yemeni civil war, while Egyptian political philosophy inspired leftist movements throughout the Gulf. Egypt is witnessing a resurgent nationalism and there is plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest that Saudi Arabia is unpopular among Egyptians, particularly given reports that the Saudi king wanted to help former president Hosni Mubarak stay in power, which would probably have required the Egyptian military to fire on civilian protesters. Egypt is also the only Arab country that can rival Saudi Arabia's influence on the pan-Arab media, with the partial exception of Qatar (where al-Jazeera is a single broadcaster rather than a media hub). This renewed rivalry will take time to materialize. In the short term, Egypt's foreign policy is likely to remain constrained by the persistent power of the army. At the same time, Saudi Arabia's foreign policy is constrained by domestic preoccupations, including the political succession, and by the fact that key foreign policy players are ageing. Saudi Arabia is unlikely to have the capacity to act as a regional \\"counter-revolution sponsor\\" even if it wants to. 3) Iraq will rise as a foreign policy player. Since 2003, Iraq has been consumed with its internal problems and has had little capacity to be a foreign policy player. However, this year, Iraqi politicians have taken vocal positions on Bahrain -- opposing the crackdown and expressing their concern about the risk of exacerbating regional sectarian tensions -- and on Syria, with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki calling on Syria's President Bashar al-Assad to end the one-party rule of the Ba'ath party there. As one of the larger countries in the region, with nearly twice as many citizens as Saudi Arabia, and as a major oil producer, Iraq will expect to be a regional diplomatic heavyweight once again. Importantly, Iraq's current oil production targets are likely to create tensions within OPEC, particularly with Saudi Arabia and with Iran. Iraqi officials have recently said they should revise down their existing ambitious oil production targets, which would see the country producing 12 million barrels a day by 2017 -- more than Saudi Arabia currently produces. But even the revised level of eight million barrels a day recently suggested by the oil minister would mean Iraq produced more oil than Iran -- and almost as much as Saudi Arabia. 4) Arab uprisings pose risks to both the Iranian and Saudi models of government. While neither Iran or Saudi Arabia would be enamored of the comparison, neither is a democracy. Both have authoritarian governments that claim religious legitimacy; and in both cases, significant segments of the growing youth population that are dissatisfied with the political and social restrictions that they face. Iran and Saudi have backed different uprisings this year. Iran has expressed support for the uprising in Bahrain, which was repressed with Saudi help, while following severe state violence against protesters in Syria, Saudi Arabia has broken off diplomatic relations with President al-Assad of Syria, Iran's key Arab ally. But both the Iranian and the Saudi governments have mixed feelings about the political transitions in Egypt, Tunisia and Egypt. If these latter countries emerge as successful democracies -- which is still a big if -- they are likely to offer more inspiring models for future Arab development than either Saudi Arabia or Iran can offer. Indeed, it is the lack of existing models in the Arab region that explains why so many Arabs regard the Turkish government with such enthusiasm. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jane Kinninmont. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"1. The old divisions of \\"pro-Western\\" and \\"resistance\\" camp in the region are becoming obsolete as new political players emerge, who will likely avoid being categorized into these camps. 2. Egyptian-Saudi rivalry could be a defining feature in the new Arab order, as Egypt experiences resurgent nationalism and Saudi Arabia's foreign policy is constrained by domestic issues and an aging leadership. 3. Iraq is likely to rise as a significant foreign policy player in the region, as it moves past its internal problems and becomes a diplomatic heavyweight in the region. 4. The Arab uprisings pose risks to both the Iranian and Saudi models of government, as growing youth populations are increasingly dissatisfied with the political and social restrictions they face."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? sloppily","output":"The phrase \\"sloppily\\" can be considered generally negative; however, its interpretation may vary depending on the context in which it is used. The word \\"sloppily\\" is an adverb derived from the adjective \\"sloppy,\\" which means to be careless, messy, or lacking attention to detail. In most scenarios, this would be seen as a negative quality or attribute. However, it is essential to understand the context in which the word is used to determine whether it has a positive or negative connotation. For instance, if \\"sloppily\\" is used in relation to a person's appearance, it generally means that the individual's clothing or grooming habits are untidy, disheveled, or disorganized. In this case, it is considered a negative term. Similarly, if \\"sloppily\\" is used to describe someone's work or performance, it implies that the person did not apply an appropriate level of care or detail in completing their task, which would also be seen as negative. It can imply a lack of focus, professionalism, or dedication to the task at hand. Having said that, there are some instances where \\"sloppily\\" might be used with a more neutral or even positive connotation. An example includes the use of the term in abstract art or music. When describing an artist's style as \\"sloppily,\\" it could mean that their creative approach is intentionally messy or uninhibited, which might be seen as a positive attribute by some. In these cases, the term can be associated with a sense of freedom, spontaneity, or authenticity that breaks from traditional or rigid forms. In conclusion, while the phrase \\"sloppily\\" is generally considered negative due to its association with carelessness, messiness, and lack of attention to detail, it is essential to consider the context in which it is used to accurately determine its connotation. In some cases, it can be seen as a neutral or even positive descriptor, particularly when used in relation to creative expression."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How do you fit more devices in an electrical outlet?","output":"When trying to fit more devices into an electrical outlet, there are several options available to help you safely and efficiently organize your plug-in devices. Here, we will discuss two of the most common solutions: using a power strip and an outlet multiplier, and then compare them to help you determine which option would be most suitable for your needs. Solution 1: Power Strip A power strip is a multi-outlet device that allows you to plug several devices into the same electrical source. It usually has multiple electrical sockets and one or multiple power buttons to control the electric flow. Power strips often come with surge protection, which can shield your devices from voltage spikes. Advantages: 1. Extended plug-in space: A power strip can greatly increase the number of devices you can connect by providing additional outlets. 2. Surge protection: Many power strips have built-in surge protection to safeguard your devices from voltage fluctuations and power surges. 3. Safety: Power strips often have individual switches to control the power flow to each socket, lowering the risk of overloading. 4. Accessibility: Power strips typically have an elongated shape and are designed to handle larger or oddly shaped plugs, making it easier to plug in various devices. Disadvantages: 1. Limited to its size and outlet count: The number of devices you can plug in depends on the number of outlets available on the power strip. 2. Cord management: Power strips have cords that must be managed, and an untidy arrangement could lead to potential hazards. 3. Power limit: The power strip has maximum limits for power load; exceeding these limits could risk damage to the devices or the power strip. Solution 2: Outlet Multiplier An outlet multiplier is a device that connects directly to an existing electrical outlet and provides multiple sockets for plugging in your devices. They usually come in different shapes and sizes and provide a space-saving design for a cluttered area. Advantages: 1. Compact design: Outlet multipliers are compact and discreet, typically taking up little space compared to power strips. 2. No cords: Outlet multipliers plug directly into the wall socket, removing the need for cable management. 3. Wall outlet expansion: They can instantly multiply the number of available outlets on a wall socket. Disadvantages: 1. No surge protection: Most outlet multipliers don’t offer built-in surge protection, leaving your devices vulnerable to voltage fluctuations and power surges. 2. Limited accessibility: The compact design may cause difficulties when plugging in larger or oddly shaped plugs, limiting the types of devices you can connect. 3. Limited to the number of outlets: Like power strips, you can only plug in as many devices as there are outlets on the multiplier. Comparison: When deciding which solution is better for your needs, consider the following factors: 1. Surge protection: If you require surge protection for your devices, a power strip would be more suitable. 2. Space and accessibility: If you have limited space or need to accommodate large plugs, a power strip may be a better choice, while outlet multipliers work well in smaller spaces. 3. Cable management: If you prefer a minimalist appearance without cords, an outlet multiplier would be ideal for you. 4. Number of outlets: Both options increase the number of available outlets, but you should choose the one with the necessary number of outlets for your devices. In conclusion, there's no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to fitting more devices into an electrical outlet. Depending on the specific requirements and constraints in your situation, either a power strip or an outlet multiplier could work for you. Consider the advantages and disadvantages of each option and evaluate them according to your preference and needs before making a decision."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.

He finally struck gold, finding what looked to be his car being sold on eBay and kept at a dealership in East Los Angeles. Viral vigilantism, Tony Hawk style Russell spoke with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, enlisting its help. All those years later, he still had the car's title that listed its vehicle identification number (VIN), which matched the VIN on eBay. Russell and his wife later arrived in OPTIONS: - Austin-Healey to pick up the car -- righting a wrong after 42 years. - CNN to pick up the car -- righting a wrong after 42 years. - East Los Angeles to pick up the car -- righting a wrong after 42 years. - Internet to pick up the car -- righting a wrong after 42 years. - Los Angeles to pick up the car -- righting a wrong after 42 years. - Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to pick up the car -- righting a wrong after 42 years. - Philadelphia to pick up the car -- righting a wrong after 42 years. - Robert Russell to pick up the car -- righting a wrong after 42 years. - Russell to pick up the car -- righting a wrong after 42 years. - Texas to pick up the car -- righting a wrong after 42 years. - Tony Hawk to pick up the car -- righting a wrong after 42 years. - VIN to pick up the car -- righting a wrong after 42 years. - eBay to pick up the car -- righting a wrong after 42 years.","output":"- East Los Angeles to pick up the car -- righting a wrong after 42 years. The correct answer is that Russell and his wife arrived in East Los Angeles to pick up the car. This is because the passage states that the car was being sold on eBay and kept at a dealership in East Los Angeles. Incorrect options: - Austin-Healey, CNN, Internet, Los Angeles, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Philadelphia, Robert Russell, Russell, Texas, Tony Hawk, VIN, and eBay are all mentioned in the passage but do not accurately describe the location where Russell and his wife arrived to pick up the car."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Hampton, Florida (CNN) -- It's do-or-die time in a city that has been threatened with extinction, become a symbol of small-town corruption and even been mocked in the media as \\"too Florida, even for Florida.\\" Can this worn-down, one-stoplight city prove to detractors that it can save its very soul from the venal forces that tempted it to set up a speed trap, rake in 1 million over the past few years and then lose track of the money?

Hunter was nervous about asking his crush to the prom.; 2). Joel was nervous about asking his crush to the prom.;","output":"Hunter lent Joel his lucky rabbit foot because Joel was nervous about asking his crush to the prom. The thought of rejection weighed heavily on his mind, making his hands clammy and his heart race. He confided in his best friend, Hunter, who was known to have excellent luck. With a deep sense of camaraderie and a true understanding of Joel's anxieties, Hunter reached deep into his heart – and his pocket – and placed the rabbit foot in his friend's palm. Hunter had carried the lucky rabbit foot since he was a child, when his grandfather gifted it to him as a symbol of fortune and good luck. The foot had accompanied Hunter on many adventures, helping him face life's challenges head-on. Their connection had grown almost like an unbreakable bond, often encouraging others to envy their fabled fortune. But this time, it was Joel who needed that aura of success. High school events like prom had the ability to leave long-lasting memories - for better or worse. As Joel toyed with the rabbit foot between his shaking fingers, Hunter offered him a comforting smile, sharing words of encouragement, and lending a listening ear to his insecurities. With newfound confidence, Joel began to strategize the best approach for asking his crush to the prom. Throughout their many conversations, the duo crafted an irresistible proposal that focused on their shared interests and common experiences. The strategy was simple but sweet, aiming to evoke the same warmth and happiness their friendship created. The day finally arrived, and the hallways of the school buzzed with anticipation of the big event. Joel felt the weight of the rabbit's foot in his pocket, and the closeness it represented with his best friend, fueling his determination. With his nerves under control and that gentle smile on his face, he approached his crush bearing a touching handwritten note – a testament to his feelings and the genuine connection he hoped to establish. And as fate would have it, Hunter's luck came through once more. A glowing smile bloomed on the girl's face as she read the heartfelt words on that crumpled piece of paper, her eyes sparkling with excitement and an undeniable appreciation for the thoughtful approach. She quietly whispered the word her suitor had been hoping for all along - \\"Yes.\\" While the night of the prom was ultimately filled with celebration, dancing, and laughter, the story of Hunter's lucky rabbit foot lived on even after the event. Joel carried the significance of their friendship, symbolized by that small token, deep within his heart, recognizing that it wasn't just the foot that brought him good fortune – it was the unwavering support and trust of his best friend. Through thick and thin, Hunter and Joel's bond remained strong, their stories ripe with luck and adventure. And in moments of happiness or pain, there was never a more powerful reminder of the importance of friendship – or a more cherished token of faith – than that simple little lucky rabbit foot."},{"instruction":"Is this product review positive?

Megan quickly explained the issue with her toilet and led Cynthia to the problematic bathroom. Cynthia, a skilled plumber, immediately got to work examining the situation and identifying the root of the problem. With her years of experience, Cynthia quickly diagnosed the issue – a broken flush valve – which was causing the toilet to continuously run. She informed Megan about the problem and reassured her that it could be fixed in no time. Megan was relieved to hear this and thanked Cynthia for her expertise. Cynthia fetched her tools and replacement parts from her truck and got to work. With steady hands and focused determination, she removed the damaged valve and installed the new one. The process was smooth and efficient, and Cynthia was pleased with the rapid progress she was making.

His teacher alerts astronomer Dr. Marcus Wolf, who realizes that the object is a comet on a collision course with Earth. Wolf dies in a car accident before he can alert the world. One year later, MSNBC journalist Jenny Lerner investigates the sudden resignation of Secretary of the Treasury Alan Rittenhouse and his connection to \\"Ellie\\", supposedly a mistress. After interviewing Rittenhouse, she is intercepted by the FBI and brought before President Tom Beck. Lerner realizes that Ellie is not a mistress but an acronym: \\"E.L.E.\\", for \\"Extinction-Level Event\\". Due to Lerner's investigation, President Beck makes an announcement earlier than planned: the comet named Wolf-Biederman (named after Wolf and Biederman, mistakenly assuming Leo Biederman was killed along with Professor Wolf) is headed for Earth. It is 7 miles (11Â km) long, large enough to cause a mass extinction, and possibly wipe out humanity, if it hits the Earth. He also reveals that the United States and Russia have been constructing an Orion spacecraft called Messiah in orbit in order to transport a team led by Oren Monash and including veteran astronaut Spurgeon Tanner to the comet, so that its path toward Earth may be diverted using nuclear weapons. After his name is mentioned on TV, Leo speaks to the town about the discovery and how the White House thought he died alongside Wolf. After landing on the comet, the crew members plant nuclear bombs beneath the surface, but are delayed and caught in out-gassing explosions when sunlight hits the comet surface. While fleeing to the space vehicle, Monash is blinded due to direct unfiltered sunlight and suffers severe facial burns, and Gus Partenza is lost, ejected from the surface by an outflow of gas.

One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Information:  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - In fashion, midriff is a term for the human abdomen. The midriff is exposed when wearing a crop top or some forms of swimwear. The cholis worn by Indian women exposes a thin section of midriff, usually 3 to 4 inches.  - Satin is a weave that typically has a glossy surface and a dull back. The satin weave is characterized by four or more fill or weft yarns floating over a warp yarn or vice versa, four warp yarns floating over a single weft yarn. Floats are missed interfacings, where the warp yarn lies on top of the weft in a warp-faced satin and where the weft yarn lies on top of the warp yarns in weft-faced satins. These floats explain the even sheen, as unlike in other weaves, the light reflecting is not scattered as much by the fibres, which have fewer tucks. Satin is usually a warp-faced weaving technique in which warp yarns are \\"floated\\" over weft yarns, although there are also weft-faced satins. If a fabric is formed with a satin weave using filament fibres such as silk, nylon, or polyester, the corresponding fabric is termed a \\"satin\\", although some definitions insist that the fabric be made from silk. If the yarns used are short-staple yarns such as cotton, the fabric formed is considered a sateen.  - Fashion is a popular style or practice, especially in clothing, footwear, accessories, makeup, body, or furniture. Fashion is a distinctive and often constant trend in the style in which a person dresses. It is the prevailing styles in behaviour and the newest creations of textile designers. Because the more technical term \\"costume\\" is regularly linked to the term \\"fashion\\", the use of the former has been relegated to special senses like fancy dress or masquerade wear, while \\"fashion\\" generally means clothing, including the study of it. Although aspects of fashion can be feminine or masculine, some trends are androgynous.  - Lingerie are women's undergarments, and may imply their being fashionable and alluring.  - A crop top (also cropped top, belly shirt, half shirt, midriff shirt, midriff top, tummy top, short shirt, and cutoff shirt) is a top, the lower part of which is high enough to expose the waist, navel, or some of the midriff. The cropping of a top in this manner is generally limited to female garments. Bikinis and sports bras are generally not regarded as crop tops.  - A camisole is a sleeveless undergarment for women, normally extending to the waist. The camisole is usually made of satin, nylon, or cotton.  - Undergarments are items of clothing worn beneath outer clothes, usually in direct contact with the skin, although they may comprise more than a single layer. They serve to keep outer garments from being soiled or damaged by bodily excretions, to lessen the friction of outerwear against the skin, to shape the body, and to provide concealment or support for parts of it. In cold weather, long underwear is sometimes worn to provide additional warmth. Special types of undergarments have religious significance. Some items of clothing are designed as undergarments, while others, such as T-shirts and certain types of shorts, are appropriate both as undergarments and as outer clothing. If made of suitable material or textile, some undergarments can serve as nightwear or swimsuits, and some are intended for sexual attraction or visual appeal.  - The abdomen (less formally called the belly, stomach, tummy or midriff) constitutes the part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis, in humans and in other vertebrates. The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity. In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax. The abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim. The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint (the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet. The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity. The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear.  - Nylon is a generic designation for a family of synthetic polymers, more specifically aliphatic or semi-aromatic polyamides. They can be melt-processed into fibers, films or shapes. The first example of nylon (nylon 6,6) was produced on February 28, 1935, by Wallace Carothers at DuPont's research facility at the DuPont Experimental Station. Nylon polymers have found significant commercial applications in fibers (apparel, flooring and rubber reinforcement), in shapes (molded parts for cars, electrical equipment, etc.), and in films (mostly for food packaging).<ref name=\\"Materials/Polyamide\\"></ref>  - A bustier ( alternately bustiere ) is a form - fitting garment for women , which is traditionally worn as lingerie . Its primary purpose is to push up the bust by tightening against the upper midriff and forcing the breasts up , while gently shaping the waist . Nowadays , it might also be worn as a push - up bra under a low - backed dress , or as a camisole for outerwear . The bustier can also be worn as a half - slip under sheer upper garments if a bold display of the midriff is not desired . A bustier resembles a basque , but it is shorter . It reaches down only to the ribs or waist . Modern bustiers are often made with mesh panels rather than the traditional boning .  - A choli (Hindi Nepali: , , , \\"ravike\\" Tamil: , Telugu: (ravike), although choli is the preferred word Telugu Kannada: ) is a midriff-baring blouse or upper garment in the Indian sari costume worn in India, southern Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and other countries where the sari is worn. It is also part of the ghagra choli costume of India.   - Cotton is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll, or protective case, around the seeds of the cotton plants of the genus \\"Gossypium\\" in the family of \\"Malvaceae\\". The fiber is almost pure cellulose. Under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will tend to increase the dispersal of the seeds.

After Gonggil kills the manager in defense of Jang-saeng, the pair flees to Seoul, where they form a new group with three other street performers.Together the group comes up with a skit mocking some members of the Royal Court, including the king and his new concubine Jang Noksu. After they are arrested for treason, Jang-saeng makes a deal with Choseon, who turns out to be one of the King's servants, to either make the king laugh at their skit or to be executed. They perform their skit for the king, but the three minor performers are too terrified to perform well. Gong-gil and Jang-saeng barely save themselves with one last joke at the king, who laughs and then makes them part of his Court. The King falls for the effeminate Gong-gil, whom he calls to his private chambers often to perform finger puppet shows. Jang-saeng becomes jealous of this relationship. Meanwhile, the King becomes more and more unstable. He makes the clowns perform a skit depicting how his mother, the favorite concubine of the former king, was forced to take poison after being betrayed by other jealous concubines. The King then slaughters these concubines at the end of the play. Jangs-aeng asks Gong-gil to leave with him and the gang at once before the King kills them too during one of his homicidal fits. Gong-gil, who initially sympathized with the King, begs the tyrant to give him his freedom but his pleas fall on deaf ears.The king's main concubine, Jang Noksu, becomes enraged by the attention the king has been lavishing on Gong-gil.

Choices:  - batman - diluted - fragile - regular - weak  The rationale to choose \\"weak\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"The rationale for choosing \\"weak\\" as the answer, when considering the question and the given choices, revolves around various factors such as the definition of a morally upright individual, the understanding of roles and priorities in protection, and the innate sense of moral responsibility. Firstly, a morally upright individual is someone who follows a strong code of ethics, integrity, and adherence to high moral principles. This person often shows compassion and empathy towards others, seeking to make a positive impact in their lives. In this context, the individual in question, who is morally upright and strong, is expected to have a high sense of responsibility and duty to protect those who are vulnerable or less capable of defending themselves. Now, let's look at the given choices to determine which group of people would warrant the protection of a morally upright and strong person. 1. Batman: Batman is a fictional superhero who is highly skilled, intelligent, and resourceful, with access to advanced technology and extensive martial arts training. It is unlikely that he would require the protection of another individual, especially someone who is morally upright and strong in the real world. 2. Diluted: The term \\"diluted\\" is not relevant in this context as it generally refers to the process of reducing the concentration of a substance or weakening its impact on other substances. It does not define any specific group of people who might need protection. 3. Fragile: Although fragile individuals might require care and protection, the term's connotation is often associated with physical or emotional vulnerability. However, simply being fragile does not necessarily imply weakness. Moreover, this term can also be context-specific and may not necessarily represent individuals in an all-encompassing sense. 4. Regular: The term \\"regular\\" refers to people who fall within the norms of society but does not explicitly convey their need for protection or assistance. Regular people can have varying levels of personal strength and resourcefulness, and the term itself does not account for any specific signs of weakness or need for protection. 5. Weak: In this context, \\"weak\\" refers to individuals who are less capable, disadvantaged, or those with limited resources to defend and protect themselves. These individuals often require support, care, and assistance from a capable, morally upright, and strong person to ensure their safety and well-being. Considering the aforementioned factors, the rationale to choose the term \\"weak\\" as the answer lies in the understanding that a morally upright and strong person has an innate moral responsibility to protect those who are the most vulnerable or disadvantaged. By doing so, they uphold their ethics, integrity, and commitment to making a positive impact in the lives of others, and the term \\"weak\\" most accurately depicts the group of individuals who need this protection the most. Therefore, this person should extend their protection primarily to people who are in the \\"weak\\" category, reflecting their moral values and sense of duty towards helping others."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

These decision-makers form big groups called \\"government boards.\\" They talk together and decide what must be done to make Queensland even better for everyone living there. But, do you remember, it is important to have different voices on these boards? Yes, that's right! Because when people with different ideas come together, they can create the best plans. In the past, most people on these boards were men. But now, more women are joining them. Having more women is wonderful because boys and girls, men and women, can all think differently, and that makes their discussions richer. Now, let me tell you a magical number: 39. That's the percentage of women now on Queensland government boards! That means if we had 100 people from these boards in a room, 39 of them would be women. This change has happened because many people understand that it is important for everyone to have a chance to share their thoughts, no matter if they are boys or girls. But guess what? The people in charge want to make this number even bigger! They hope to have a perfect balance of men and women on these boards soon.

Context: Leucocytes have been implicated as mediators of renal ischaemia-reperfusion injury. This study aimed to demonstrate the effect of white cells in early renal reperfusion injury using an isolated haemoperfused porcine kidney model.', 'After 2 h cold storage, porcine kidneys were perfused with normothermic autologous blood using an isolated organ preservation system. This was designed using cardiopulmonary bypass technology, and perfusion commenced with a circulating serum creatinine level of 1000 micromol/l. In group 1 (n = 6) a leucocyte filter was included in the circuit and in group 2 (n = 6) non-filtered blood was used.', 'The mean(s.d.) area under the curve for serum creatinine was lower in the leucocyte-depleted experiments (1286(214) versus 2627(418); P = 0.002). Leucocyte depletion also led to improved urine output (191(75) versus 70(32) ml/h; P = 0.002) and higher creatinine clearance (10.6(2.8) versus 1.9(1.0) ml/min; P = 0.002).

Between the rain and your sweat, your socks may get extremely moist. Many brands have technology to wick away sweat and moisture. Hygiene, odour issues, and performance can all be affected by extreme moisture. Each brand has its own patented technology:  Puma technology is referred to as DryCell, CoolPlus Yarn, and CoolCell. Nike technology is referred to as Dri-Fit. Adidas technology is referred to as ClimaCool and ClimaLite. Under Armour technology is referred to as ArmourDry and HeatGear Each player is comfortable with a different sock length. In an official match, you may need to keep your socks at least above your shin guard. In practice you may find that a shorter length allows for more movement. Cold weather may also affect your decision. Here are some helpful descriptions that you may come across:  OTC stand for socks that come over the calf. These socks are the longest you can get and usually are worn above your knee. Crew refers to socks that cover slightly above your calf. Low-cut refers to socks that are below your calf and slightly above your ankle. No-show refers to socks that are below your ankle and basically cannot be seen with your shoes on. Invest in higher end technology that creates strategic support, cushioning, and comfort for each foot. These socks will usually have an L or R to indicate which foot to place the sock on to. Choose from a variety of technological specifications including: ribbed ankle support, anti-odor technology, mesh ventilation, achilles cushioning, and arch support. For example, you may need achilles cushioning if you have been injured or find that your shoes irritate that area when you perform certain movements. Team administrators and coaches may have the added responsibility of choosing team colours. They should also consider construction and sweat control as these socks will need to be durable and prevent player issues with hygiene and performance. Think about the ratio of synthetic material against natural material before making your final decision. Synthetic materials provide more stretch and can help to manage sweat and moisture. Synthetic materials include polyester and spandex. Natural materials can provide warmth and increased cushioning. These materials include cotton and hemp. A blend of both synthetic and natural materials tend to work best. Also factor in your team’s budget before making the final purchase. If you don’t wear shin guards while practicing, you have a lot more sock options. Crew socks are very popular for training. No-show and low-cut socks are popular for cardio or gym training. You must choose the right size and correct material to meet your comfort and fit needs. Training can be grueling and the wrong fit can lead to painful blisters. Your skin may also get easily irritated by certain material. If you are on a team, you will need two pairs for both your home and away soccer kits. If you play in tournaments, you will most likely play in several games in one day or over a weekend. Training may require at least five pairs depending on how often you intend to train during the week. High-level players may train every day or even two or three times in a single day. You can get blisters, athlete’s foot, or severe foot damage if you continuously wear your used socks without cleaning them. Keep in mind that you will also need extra socks for cold weather, if you damage a pair, or if a fresh pair helps with your performance. You may also lose a single sock in the laundry or use specific pairs for specific activities. For example, you may use a special pair for shoot outs. Players at every position prefer different socks lengths. If you are a forward and attack aggressively, you may want your socks to be lower or to have added achilles support for your quick movements and ball handling. Goalies may prefer socks that are thicker and longer when playing in colder weather.","output":"This article discusses the importance of choosing the right sock technology, length, material, and fit for soccer players, taking into consideration moisture management, comfort, performance, hygiene, and specific needs based on practice, match conditions, and player preferences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The inuit tribe lived and hunted on the shores of the Arctic ocean., very close to the North pole. The weather there was very cold throughout the year. Their distant cousins the umpala tribe, lived thousands of miles away, on the shores of the Indian ocean, where the weather was humid and warm, in a tropical climate.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which tribe experienced colder winters?  Hint: Located mostly in the Arctic north polar region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic Ocean is almost completely surrounded by Eurasia and North America. It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years.

While you are taking your dog to the vet or animal hospital, apply pressure with a clean bandage or towel. If there is a foreign object in the wound, do not try to remove it yourself.   If the wound is not severe or bleeding quickly, you will likely have time to dress it before seeking vet help. If the wound is so minor that the dog is not scratching at it or paying attention to it, you may not even have to dress it. Just go straight to the vet. If the blood from the wound is coming out in spurts or is bright red, this could indicate arterial bleeding. Such bleeding can be life-threatening. Apply pressure to the wound and seek immediate help. Ask someone to help keep the dog in place so you can bandage the wound and wrap the shoulder. The dog should be standing so you can wrap the bandage under the dog's torso. If the dog is in pain, it may snap or bite. Even a typically calm dog can bite out of fear when hurt. To avoid this, consider using a muzzle or having someone gently but firmly hold the dog's head and neck forward while you dress the wound. If possible, before you wrap the wound try to gently clean it with a saline solution and a clean gauze or cotton pad. You do not need to extensively clean the wound at this moment. Simply flush out the opening with the solution. Dab the wound gently with clean cotton gauze. Then cut a cotton bandage to fit the size of the wound and place it directly on the open wound. Press down firmly with 1 hand to slow any bleeding. Consider wearing gloves to prevent introducing germs to the wound. Summary:","output":"If your dog gets a big cut or it's bleeding a lot, you should go to the vet very fast. While going, press a clean cloth on the cut. Don't take out anything stuck in the wound. If the cut is not too big or bleeding fast, you can cover it before going to the vet. If the dog isn't worried about the cut, go straight to the vet. If the blood is coming out very fast and bright red, it can be very dangerous. Press on the cut and get help quickly. Ask someone to hold the dog while you cover the cut. Be careful because the dog might be scared and bite. Before wrapping the cut, clean it softly with a salty water and a clean cloth. Put a cotton bandage on the cut and press it to help stop the bleeding. Wear gloves to keep germs away from the cut."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Hunter-gatherers tend to have an egalitarian social ethos, although settled hunter-gatherers (for example, those inhabiting the Northwest Coast of North America) are an exception to this rule. Nearly all African hunter-gatherers are egalitarian, with women roughly as influential and powerful as men. In American culture, women are roughly what?","output":"In American culture, women's status, influence, and power have evolved significantly over time. While historically, women held lower social standing compared to men, their roles and opportunities have expanded considerably in recent years. Today, American society strives to achieve gender equality in various aspects of life, including education, employment, and political representation. In the realm of education, women have surpassed men in terms of college enrollment and degree attainment, with the majority of college students and degree holders now being female. Consequently, American women also have expanded career opportunities, increasingly entering professions once dominated by men. In the workforce, some progress has been made towards salary equality, but disparities still persist, especially when observing differences among various fields, organizational levels, and racial and ethnic backgrounds. In the political sphere, women's representation has improved, with more female politicians getting elected to local, state, and national government positions. While the number of female office holders has increased, it is still not proportionate to the country's gender demographics. Furthermore, women in American culture have made strides in domains beyond education, employment, and political representation. They have contributed to advancements in science, arts, sports, and other areas, steadily breaking through traditional gender barriers over time. In summary, the status, influence, and power of women in American culture have improved noticeably. However, full gender equality is yet to be achieved, and work continues to eliminate disparities and achieve parity in all aspects of life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Unlike Craig, William avoided getting a cramp during the marathon, because","output":"he followed a proper training regimen and focused on specific strategies to prevent muscle cramps. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of William's approach: 1. Rigorous Training Plan: William ensured that he had a consistent and well-structured training plan leading up to the marathon. This allowed his muscles to gradually adapt to the stress and reduce the likelihood of cramps during the race. He increased his running distance progressively and incorporated rest days, helping him to avoid overexertion. 2. Proper Hydration: William understood the importance of maintaining adequate hydration before, during, and after the run. He drank enough water to maintain a balance of electrolytes in his body, which helped prevent muscle cramps due to dehydration. 3. Balanced Nutrition: A balanced diet played a crucial role in William's preventive measures. He consumed a diet rich in potassium, magnesium, and calcium, as these minerals aid in the prevention of muscle cramps. He also ensured he had adequate carbohydrates for energy and protein for muscle repair. 4. Stretching and Warm-up: Before the marathon, William dedicated time to stretching and warming up his muscles. This helped increase blood flow and flexibility and prepared his body for the long run ahead. Stretching also helped in reducing sudden, intense muscle contractions that cause cramps. 5. Pacing: During the race, William stuck to a comfortable pace that allowed him to maintain proper running form. He avoided pushing his body too hard, which could lead to muscle fatigue and eventually cramps. By maintaining a steady pace, he conserved his energy throughout the race. 6. Post-Marathon Recovery: After the marathon, William prioritized muscle recovery through proper cool-down techniques, gentle stretching, and refueling his body with water and ample nutrients. This helped reduce muscle soreness and prevent cramps from developing after the race. By adhering to these strategies, William was able to prevent muscle cramps during the marathon, unlike his fellow runner, Craig. This not only led to a more enjoyable experience but also a better overall performance."},{"instruction":"Who was rosemary clooney married to?","output":"Rosemary Clooney was married twice.

Your feet should be flat on the floor in front of you.","output":"In the next paragraph, a few key stretches will be mentioned to alleviate the strain and improve overall posture. To achieve this, consider the following steps: 1. Identify and focus on the target areas: Since the text mentions neck and shoulders as common problem areas due to slumping, the paragraph will most likely include stretches that focus on these areas, in addition to the back and chest muscles, to encourage proper alignment. 2. Provide examples of effective stretches: The paragraph should mention a few stretches that can be easily incorporated into one's daily routine. Examples might include: - Neck stretches: Gently tilt your head to one side, bringing your ear closer to your shoulder, then slowly return to the center and repeat on the other side. - Shoulder rolls: Roll your shoulders backward and then forward in a circular motion. - Chest stretch: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, interlace your fingers behind your back, and gently lift your arms upward to stretch the chest muscles. 3. Incorporate the importance of consistency and duration: Emphasize the importance of regularly practicing these stretches, either as a break during work hours or incorporated into a morning or evening stretch routine. Furthermore, recommend holding each stretch for 15 to 30 seconds to maximize the benefits.

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]  What is an answer for this question: Which fruit retained their quality longer, apples or peaches?

Step 3: Integrate the concepts in the sentence Now that we have the subject and action verb, I will add the other concepts while keeping the sentence as coherent as possible. Since 'beach,' 'silhouette,' and 'sunrise' are all related to visual experiences, I can connect them quite naturally by describing the setting: Final Sentence: As she practiced yoga on the beach, her silhouette was beautifully outlined against the inspiring backdrop of the sunrise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In motor vehicles, the transmission generally is connected to the engine crankshaft via a flywheel or clutch or fluid coupling, partly because internal combustion engines cannot run below a particular speed. The output of the transmission is transmitted via the driveshaft to one or more differentials, which drives the wheels. While a differential may also provide gear reduction, its primary purpose is to permit the wheels at either end of an axle to rotate at different speeds (essential to avoid wheel slippage on turns) as it changes the direction of rotation. is a motor and transmission the same thing? Options: (a). no (b). yes","output":"(a) No, a motor and transmission are not the same thing. They are two distinct components of a motor vehicle, each serving a specific purpose. To understand their differences, it is essential to know the functions of each component. A motor (also known as an engine) is responsible for converting energy into mechanical power, allowing the vehicle to move. In most vehicles, the engine is an internal combustion engine, where the controlled burning of fuel (usually gasoline or diesel) within the engine releases energy in the form of expanding gases. These gases apply force on the engine's pistons, which in turn crank the engine's connecting rods, thus converting the linear motion of the pistons into rotational motion. This rotational motion is harnessed by the crankshaft, which transfers the motion to other parts of the vehicle. On the other hand, the transmission is a complex system designed to transfer the engine's power to the wheels. It does this by selecting the appropriate gear ratio, which helps maintain the optimal balance between the engine's speed (measured in revolutions per minute or RPM) and the vehicle's speed (measured in miles or kilometers per hour). By changing the gear ratios, the transmission ensures that the engine operates efficiently and within its optimal power and torque range. This is crucial for achieving good fuel efficiency and overall vehicle performance. The two components interact closely in a vehicle, as the transmission is connected to the engine's crankshaft, typically via a flywheel, clutch, or fluid coupling. This connection allows the transmission to receive the engine's rotational power and distribute it to one or more differentials. These differentials connect to the wheels, allowing them to rotate at different speeds when navigating turns to maintain traction and avoid wheel slippage. In summary, the motor (engine) generates the mechanical energy required to move the vehicle, while the transmission efficiently transfers this energy to the wheels. They are separate components with distinct functions and are not the same thing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

What is the sentiment of the following document towards the entity Steve Jobs ? Now an independent consultant  Blankenship was previously a vice president at Tesla Motors from 2010 to 2013  and a vice president of real estate at Apple  working closely alongside  Steve Jobs  to launch the first 165 Apple Stores worldwide before that. Blankenship recently sat down with Business Insider deputy executive editor Matt Turner to discuss  the visionary leadership of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk   and how  they  set  their  companies up for success from the beginning. At Apple  we looked around at what was going on in the world at the time  and the technologies that were available that weren't in phones of the time. If you went back 10 years ago and you looked at a Motorola flip phone â one of the hottest phones â or the Palm  Nokia  et cetera  they worked  but there was so much more potential.  Steve  just saw so much more opportunity for what this device could be.  Steve  just saw so much more opportunity for what this device could be. They had a phone  which then enabled the real disruptive part of that technology  which was the app store. Think about it  for two  three  four years  Apple never advertised the phone; it was \\"there's an app for that.\\" If you step back  what would Uber be today without a smartphone? What would Facebook be? What  Steve  saw were opportunities with existing things that other people just didn't see. With Elon  it's very  very interesting talking to  him  because everything really does have a bigger picture to it. You think about Tesla. Well  when I first met with  him  six or seven years ago   he  had this vision  and the vision was to move the planet away from fossil fuels and into renewable resources. Tesla is a part of that  but it's not the whole picture. It's moving people to electric vehicles  but what else could you do? Well  if you're building an electric car you have to have a lot of batteries  so you go to a battery factory. Well  if you've got these batteries what else could you do with them? You could do a battery wall  a battery pack that hangs on the wall â you charge it up and run your house and car off of it. And then what's missing is solar  so a year ago they merged with Solar City. Now you can take this energy from this great big fusion reactor in the sky  put it in batteries and run your car and your house. It's a bigger picture than what other people are doing. You might ask  well  why don't other car dealers do this? Or why don't other manufacturers do this? It's because they just don't see things the way a  Steve Jobs  and an Elon Musk do â and they have the conviction to make it happen. Turner: How alike are those two people   Steve Jobs  and Elon Musk?  They 're almost iconic now. What similarities do  they  share  and what was it like to work with  them ? Blankenship:  They  share a lot of the same qualities.  They  have a conviction and a belief that the direction  they 're going is right. Regardless of what anybody else says  the direction is right. Turner: How much of those companies are tied up in the individual? Clearly  Apple exists after  Steve Jobs   but how much of the culture that's there was really  the Steve Jobs culture ? How does  it  survive on after  he 's no longer there? What would you make of Apple today? Blankenship: When you put together the group of people I just described  those people have a can-do mind-set  that nothing's impossible: \\"We're doing something bigger than making an electronic device; there's a bigger purpose here.\\" Look at what the results have been of Apple. Yes   Steve  passed away in 2011  but look at the way the company has continued to evolve as a service company: How many millions of iPhone X's do you think they're going to take on order for over the next couple of weeks? It's going to be massive. The company today isn't going through the product innovations on an every three-year basis that it was in the 10 years between 2000 and 2010  but I think it's finding ways that the device has become more personal and more embedded in what you do and how you do it  which aligns you to the platform in an incredible way. Tim [Cook] has done a really good job of doing that. Turner: What you've described at both Apple and Tesla with  Steve Jobs and Elon Musk  is a mission at the heart of the company and its strategy. Are there any other companies or people you see out there that when you look at them you say  that's the same thing? Blankenship: I think there are different types of missions. Yes  Elon and  Steve  had their missions. If you look at Amazon  Amazon's mission  without a doubt  is the customer: What can we do for the customer? What can we do to make the experience better for the customer? How do we have the best customer experience on the planet? That's a mission.","output":"The sentiment of the document towards the entity Steve Jobs is Positive. The author is discussing Steve Jobs' visionary leadership and how he saw opportunities that others didn't. Furthermore, the document praises Steve Jobs for his conviction and compares him positively to Elon Musk, another visionary leader."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the following context:  Little is known for certain of the life of Hieronymus Bosch or of the commissions or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history. Although Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome. He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels \\"are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind\\". The art historian Carl Justi observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by \\"the news of recently discovered Atlantis and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise\\". The period in which the triptych was created was a time of adventure and discovery, when tales and trophies from the New World sparked the imagination of poets, painters and writers.

Article: Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mystery donor gives thousands to ill Shropshire boy      A mystery donor has given £100,000 to an ill four-year-old boy to enable him to go to the US for potentially life-saving cancer treatment.      The parents of Zac Oliver from Broseley, Shropshire, who has a rare strain of leukaemia, have been campaigning to raise £500,000.      The donation, first reported in the Daily Mail, ensured the family reached its target.      NHS England has been asked to comment on why Zac cannot be treated in the UK.      Zac's mother Hannah Oliver-Willetts, 33, who is an occupational therapist, said she received a phone call out of the blue telling her \\"not to worry\\" and \\"pack her bags\\", reassuring her it was not a hoax.      Hours later, the money appeared in their bank account.      \\"It takes a very special type of person to do that\\", she said.      Latest news and updates from the West Midlands      Zac was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in May.

He is not eligible to receive the type of treatment he needs in the UK because his condition does not currently meet criteria set by the NHS, his parents said.      Doctors at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia say its 17-week CAR T-cell therapy will give Zac a 60 to 80 per cent chance of survival, she added.      Speaking on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show on Wednesday, Mrs Oliver-Willetts said: \\"Hopefully we will come back with a cured little boy who will get his life back.\\"      His parents managed to raise £400,000 in just a few weeks thanks to the donations of neighbours and friends in Shropshire.      They ran a special event called ZacFest in Telford Town Park last weekend that is understood to have raised about £10,000.

It is the culmination of a huge fundraising campaign that first captured the hearts of Zac's hometown Broseley, then Shropshire, and now the country.      The total means Zac's parents, Hannah and Mark, can now begin the preparations for taking him to Philadelphia where he can undergo CAR-T therapy unavailable on the NHS.

One day, the people who work at the prison and make sure everyone stays safe, found out that 14 bad gang members had been killed inside the prison. Gang members are people who join a group that often does bad things and sometimes hurts others. It's very sad that these people were killed, because nobody should get hurt like that.  The people who are in charge of El Salvador, called authorities, talked to everyone about what happened. They were trying to find out more information and understand why these gang members were killed. They want to make sure everyone in the prison is safe and that something like this never happens again. It's important for all of us to remember that even though some people make bad decisions, like joining a gang, they can still change and become better people.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person whose neighbours tried to help douse the fire?  After two rainy summers in 1664 and 1665, London had lain under an exceptional drought since November 1665, and the wooden buildings were tinder-dry after the long hot summer of 1666. A fire broke out at Thomas Farriner's bakery in Pudding Lane a little after midnight on Sunday 2 September. The family was trapped upstairs but managed to climb from an upstairs window to the house next door, except for a maidservant who was too frightened to try, who became the first victim. The neighbours tried to help douse the fire; after an hour, the parish constables arrived and judged that the adjoining houses had better be demolished to prevent further spread. The householders protested, and Lord Mayor Sir Thomas Bloodworth was summoned, who alone had the authority to override their wishes. When Bloodworth arrived, the flames were consuming the adjoining houses and creeping towards the paper warehouses and flammable stores on the riverfront. The more experienced firemen were clamouring for demolition, but Bloodworth refused on the grounds that most premises were rented and the owners could not be found. Bloodworth is generally thought to have been appointed to the office of Lord Mayor as a yes man, rather than by possessing requisite capabilities for the job. He panicked when faced with a sudden emergency and, when pressed, made the oft-quoted remark, \\"Pish! A woman could piss it out\\", and left. After the City had been destroyed, Samuel Pepys looked back on the events and wrote in his diary on 7 September 1666: \\"People do all the world over cry out of the simplicity [the stupidity] of my Lord Mayor in general; and more particularly in this business of the fire, laying it all upon him.\\" Pepys was a senior official in the Navy Office by then, and he ascended the Tower of London on Sunday morning to view the fire from a turret. He recorded in his diary that the eastern gale had turned it into a conflagration. It had burned down several churches and, he estimated, 300 houses and reached the riverfront.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham? , can you please find it?   In 1775, Fort Ticonderoga, in disrepair, was still manned by a token British force.  They found it extremely useful as a supply and communication link between Canada (which they had taken over after their victory in the Seven Years' War) and New York. On May 10, 1775, less than one month after the American Revolutionary War was ignited with the battles of Lexington and Concord, the British garrison of 48 soldiers was surprised by a small force of Green Mountain Boys, along with militia volunteers from Massachusetts and Connecticut, led by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold.  Allen claims to have said, \\"Come out you old Rat!\\" to the fort's commander, Captain William Delaplace.  He also later said that he demanded that the British commander surrender the fort \\"In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!\\"; however, his surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham and not the fort's commander, who did later appear and surrender his sword.With the capture of the fort, the Patriot forces obtained a large supply of cannons and other armaments, much of which Henry Knox transported to Boston during the winter of 1775–1776.  Ticonderoga's cannons were instrumental in ending the Siege of Boston when they were used to fortify Dorchester Heights.  With Dorchester Heights secured by the Patriots, the British were forced to evacuate the city in March 1776. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Patriots made communication between the British Canadian and American commands much more difficult. Benedict Arnold remained in control of the fort until 1,000 Connecticut troops under the command of Benjamin Hinman arrived in June 1775. Because of a series of political maneuvers and miscommunications, Arnold was never notified that Hinman was to take command.  After a delegation from Massachusetts (which had issued Arnold's commission) arrived to clarify the matter, Arnold resigned his commission and departed, leaving the fort in Hinman's hands. The answer is:","output":"William. Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham received the surrender demand from Ethan Allen, but the person whose surrender demand was made to Feltham was Captain William Delaplace, the fort's commander."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Last month Elena went on vacation but not Christine because    --Elena had to work every day..  --Christine had to work every day.. Answer:","output":"Last month Elena went on vacation but not Christine because Christine had to work every day, while Elena, having saved up enough leave, could finally indulge in the much-needed break she had been dreaming of for months. Christine was envious, but she understood that taking time off at that point could have jeopardized her position at work. Elena, on the other hand, had meticulously planned her vacation, ensuring she had accumulated enough vacation days to have an uninterrupted and enjoyable trip. Despite being tied up with her work responsibilities, Christine always eagerly awaited updates from Elena. Throughout her vacation, Elena enjoyed exploring various picturesque locations, trying out new cultural experiences, and savoring delicious local cuisines. Christine, although busy and unable to join Elena, felt a sense of thrill and excitement vicariously through her friend's detailed anecdotes and vibrant pictures. However, as the days passed, Christine felt the mounting pressure and stress of her daily tasks at work. She began to dream about unwinding on sunny beaches, breathing in the fresh mountain air, and dining with an unbeatable view. As the vacation days dwindled and Elena prepared to return home, Christine resolved to make a conscious effort in managing her own work-life balance. She started diligently scheduling her time to avoid heavy workloads and began working towards taking her own much-deserved vacation. Upon Elena's return, Christine confronted her with a newfound exuberance. Together, they sat down and exchanged stories - Elena reveling in the memories of her wonderful vacation, and Christine speaking of her eye-opening experiences during her friend's absence, as well as her newfound determination to plan her own vacation. Elena, ever the supportive friend, offered to help Christine strategize the perfect holiday. They spent hours discussing their dream destinations, calculating budgets, and identifying the best times to finally take that long-awaited break. Each day, Christine's excitement grew as she inched closer to her own vacation, all the while learning to maintain a healthier work-life balance. In the end, although Christine initially missed out on the opportunity to join Elena on her vacation, it ultimately transformed into a valuable lesson about the importance of taking breaks, managing stress, and allowing oneself to truly enjoy life's experiences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Instructions: In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Input: Cancer chemoprevention involves the chronic administration of a synthetic, natural or biological agent to reduce or delay the occurrence of malignancy. The potential value of this approach has been demonstrated with trials in breast, prostate and colon cancer. The paradigm for developing new chemopreventive agents has changed markedly in the last decade and now involves extensive preclinical mechanistic evaluation of agents before clinical trials are instituted and a focus on defining biomarkers of activity that can be used as early predictors of efficacy. This review will summarise the current status of the field of chemoprevention and highlight potential new developments.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: On the night before his epic solo flight across the Atlantic, Charles Lindbergh (James Stewart) lies awake in his hotel bed, worrying about his chances. Will he have enough fuel? Will he even be able to take off? Rain falls outside his window, dimming the chances for an early start. Time is short, and Lindbergh knows he must make his attempt soon, because there are others trying to make the same flight.Tossing and turning, he thinks back to the events that led him here. Once, flying airmail for the Army, his plane failed in a Midwest blizzard, and after bailing out, he had to find his way through the dark and take a train to his destination. Lindbergh was no stranger to the dangers of flight, but his faith in its capabilities was unshakable, and a dream formed in his mind: he wanted to do something remarkable, something that would show people what airplanes could really do.Back at his home base in St. Louis, he calls a New York aircraft builder to get a quote on a special plane. One that can make a very long distance flight: New York to Paris, non-stop. Lindbergh next sets out to raise the money needed to buy it, and manages to get several St. Louis businessmen interested. They like the idea, and they see its value, but aren't sure about Lindbergh's chances. Is he really sure he can do this? He convinces them that he can, and the name \\"The Spirit of St. Louis\\" is coined for the project.Lindbergh travels to New York to purchase the special plane, but the deal falls through and he returns home, discouraged. Another possible builder is found however, and Lindbergh is off to California to see the small Ryan Aircraft Co. He locates the sleepy little factory and finds the firm's president Frank Mahoney (Bartlett Robinson) frying fish with a torch. Amused, Lindbergh makes the deal, and they all get to work. In a few weeks, a little silver plane has taken shape, and Lindbergh takes it up for testing. Satisfied, he heads back to St. Louis, but learns that another team has taken off from Paris and is trying to make it...

Let's make it thirty minutes earlier.  What was said before this conversation? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, I will need to consider the context and make an educated guess about the prior conversation. Step 1: Identify the context In the given statement \\"W: I'm afraid it's too late. Let's make it thirty minutes earlier.\\", it seems as though the speaker (W) is discussing the timing of an event or a meeting. Step 2: Analyze the statement As W said \\"I'm afraid it's too late.\\", it implies that the current timing is not suitable or convenient for the event/meeting. W also suggests making the event/meeting thirty minutes earlier, indicating that they want to adjust the time. Step 3: Make a reasonable inference Based on the context and provided information, it is likely that the preceding conversation was about the scheduling of a meeting or event. Possible prior conversation: Someone (let's call this person X) might have proposed a specific time for an event or meeting, for example: \\"X: How about we schedule the meeting for 2:00 PM?\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
