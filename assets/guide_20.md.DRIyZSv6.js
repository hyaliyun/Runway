Carrier taught that scientific research and its promise for progress were not antagonistic to the ideals of intellectual and moral culture endorsed by the Church. One of Carrier's students was Father John Augustine Zahm (1851–1921) who was made Professor and Co-Director of the Science Department at age 23 and by 1900 was a nationally prominent scientist and naturalist. Zahm was active in the Catholic Summer School movement, which introduced Catholic laity to contemporary intellectual issues. His book Evolution and Dogma (1896) defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover, that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something like it. The intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented Zahm's censure by the Vatican. In 1913, Zahm and former President Theodore Roosevelt embarked on a major expedition through the Amazon.\\"?

In the rest of the world, China's supreme sage, Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu), is better known by the romanized name \\"Confucius.\\" He was born in 551 b.c. in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China. So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers. After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \\"Warring States\\" period (475–221 b.c.).

Justin has never had any animals in his house unlike Derrick because","output":"Justin's family was allergic to animal fur. Derrick, however, had grown up surrounded by a variety of animals, including dogs, cats, and even a few more exotic pets like iguanas and parakeets. Justin often found himself envious of the bond that Derrick had with his pets, and he longed for that kind of companionship. Step 1: Establishing the characters' desires and backgrounds To continue the story, we need to establish what each character's desires and backgrounds are. Justin wants to experience having a pet but cannot due to his family's allergies, while Derrick is already very experienced with having pets. One day, when Justin was hanging out at Derrick's house, he noticed a small aquarium in the corner of the room. Inside the aquarium were a few colorful fish swimming around. As he watched the fish, an idea began to form in his mind - perhaps there was a type of pet that his family could have without triggering their allergies! Step 2: Introducing a potential solution to Justin's problem Now that we've established the characters' backgrounds and desires, the story can progress to offer a potential solution to Justin's longing for a pet. In this case, the solution could be a hypoallergenic pet, like fish. With excitement, Justin approached Derrick to learn more about the fish and how to properly take care of them. Derrick enthusiastically told Justin all about the different species living in the aquarium, as well as the care and maintenance required to keep them happy and healthy. Step 3: Building the bond between characters through shared interests By having Derrick share his knowledge about aquarium care with Justin, we create a bond between the two characters and show the beginning of a mentor/apprentice relationship with Derrick guiding Justin in the realm of pet ownership. Over the following weeks, Justin researched more about fish and aquariums, eventually convincing his parents to let him set up a small fish tank in the living room. With Derrick's help, Justin bought all the necessary equipment and fish, slowly starting his journey as a fish owner. Step 4: Demonstrating growth and progress for Justin as a pet owner Show Justin's dedication to learning about fish and actually setting up an aquarium in his home, which demonstrates growth and progress in achieving his goal of having a pet. As Justin's collection of fish grew, so did his bond with Derrick. The two friends spent countless hours discussing their shared passion for animals, even visiting aquariums and local pet stores during their free time. Justin's family soon found that they, too, enjoyed the calming presence of the fish and appreciated their son's growing sense of responsibility. Step 5: Showing the positive effects on both characters and their families Displaying how Justin's passion for fish positively impacts not only himself but also Derrick and their respective families will wrap up this part of the story nicely. Over time, Justin and Derrick's passion for animals continued to grow. They both knew that, despite their differences, their shared love of animals brought them closer together and enriched their lives in a way they could never have predicted. Step 6: Closing the story with a reflection on the characters' growth and friendship Conclude the story by acknowledging the growth of both characters through their shared passion for animals, and how their friendship was strengthened by their experiences together. In summary, the story highlights the journey of Justin in overcoming obstacles to experience the joy of pet ownership and building a stronger bond with Derrick through their shared love of animals. The story also showcases the positive effects that their passion for animals brought to their lives and the lives of their families."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (later known as the Pre-Raphaelites) was a group of English painters, poets, and critics, founded in 1848 by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. The three founders were joined by William Michael Rossetti, James Collinson, Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner to form the seven-member \\"brotherhood\\". Their principles were shared by other artists, including Marie Spartali Stillman and Ford Madox Brown.  - A priest or priestess (feminine) (from Greek  \\"presbýteros\\" through Latin \\"presbyter\\", \\"elder\\", or from Old High German \\"priast\\", \\"prest\\", from Vulgar Latin \\"provost\\" \\"one put over others\\", from Latin \\"praepositus\\" \\"person placed in charge\\"), is a person authorized to perform the sacred rituals of a religion, especially as a mediatory agent between humans and one or more deities. They also have the authority or power to administer religious rites; in particular, rites of sacrifice to, and propitiation of, a deity or deities. Their office or position is the priesthood, a term which also may apply to such persons collectively.  - Charles Robert Darwin, (12 February 1809  19 April 1882) was an English naturalist and geologist, best known for his contributions to the science of evolution. He established that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors, and in a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding.  - A sobriquet is a nickname, sometimes assumed, but often given by another. Distinct from a pseudonym that is assumed as a disguise, it usually is a familiar name, familiar enough such that it may be used in place of a real name without the need of explanation. This salient characteristic is of sufficient familiarity that the sobriquet may become more familiar than the original name.  - John William Waterhouse (April 6, 1849  February 10, 1917) was an English painter known for working in the Pre-Raphaelite style. He worked several decades after the breakup of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, which had seen its heyday in the mid-nineteenth century, leading to his sobriquet \\"the modern Pre-Raphaelite\\". Borrowing stylistic influences not only from the earlier Pre-Raphaelites but also from his contemporaries, the Impressionists, his artworks were known for their depictions of women from both ancient Greek mythology and Arthurian legend.  - The Progressive Era was a period of widespread social activism and political reform across the United States, from the 1890s to the 1920s. The main objectives of the Progressive movement were eliminating problems caused by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, and corruption in government.   - The Blue Carpet is a piece of Public Art in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, England, designed by Thomas Heatherwick.

The piece occupies a public open space in front of the Laing Art Gallery, close to the main shopping and nightclub areas.   - The Church of England (C of E) is the Anglican Christian state church of England. Headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury (currently Justin Welby) and primarily governed from London with the monarch as the supreme governor, the Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion. The church dates its formal establishment as a national church to the 6th-century Gregorian mission in Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury, with considerable features introduced and established during and following the English Reformation in the 16th century.  - Charles William Mitchell ( 1854 -- 1903 ) was an English Pre-Raphaelite painter from Newcastle . A contemporary of John William Waterhouse , his work is similar in many ways . His one famous piece was Hypatia , shown in 1885 and likely inspired by the Charles Kingsley serialized novel Hypatia or New Foes with an Old Face . This painting is currently in the Laing Art Gallery .  - The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) is a department of the United Kingdom government, with responsibility for culture and sport in England, and some aspects of the media throughout the whole UK, such as broadcasting and internet.  - The Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, is located on New Bridge Street. The gallery was designed in the Baroque style with Art Nouveau elements by architects Cackett and Burns Dick and is now a Grade II listed building. It was opened in 1904 and is now managed by Tyne & Wear Archives & Museums and sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. In front of the gallery is the Blue Carpet.  - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems.  - The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\".  - Charles Kingsley (12 June 1819  23 January 1875) was a broad church priest of the Church of England, a university professor, social reformer, historian and novelist. He is particularly associated with Christian socialism, the working men's college, and forming labour cooperatives that failed but led to the working reforms of the progressive era. He was a friend and correspondent with Charles Darwin.  - The Working Men's College (or WMC), is among the earliest adult education institutions established in the United Kingdom, and Europe's oldest extant centre for adult education. Founded by Christian Socialists, at its inception it was at the forefront of liberal education philosophy.  - Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole.  - Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.  - Newcastle upon Tyne, commonly known as Newcastle, is a city in Tyne and Wear, North East England, 103 miles (166 km) south of Edinburgh and 277 miles (446 km) north of London on the northern bank of the River Tyne, from the North Sea. Newcastle is the most populous city in the North East and forms the core of Tyneside conurbation, the eighth most populous urban area in the United Kingdom. Newcastle is a member of the English Core Cities Group and is a member of the Eurocities network of European cities. Newcastle was part of the county of Northumberland until 1400, when it became a county of itself, a status it retained until becoming part of Tyne and Wear in 1974. The regional nickname and dialect for people from Newcastle and the surrounding area is Geordie. Newcastle also houses Newcastle University, a member of the Russell Group, as well as Northumbria University.  - Christian socialism is a form of religious socialism based on the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. Many Christian socialists believe capitalism to be idolatrous and rooted in greed, which some Christian denominations consider a mortal sin. Christian socialists identify the cause of inequality to be the greed that they associate with capitalism.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?  - Broad church is a term referring to latitudinarian churchmanship in the Church of England in particular and Anglicanism in general. The term is often used to refer to secular political organisations, meaning that they encompass a broad range of opinion.  - Hypatia (\\"Hupatía\\"; born 35070; died 415), often called Hypatia of Alexandria, was a Greek mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher in Egypt, then a part of the Byzantine Empire. She was the head of the Neoplatonic school at Alexandria, where she taught philosophy and astronomy.  - Alexandria (or ; Arabic: '; '; \\"\\") is the second largest city and a major economic centre in Egypt, extending about along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in the north central part of the country. Its low elevation on the Nile delta makes it highly vulnerable to rising sea levels. Alexandria is Egypt's largest seaport, serving approximately 80% of Egypt's imports and exports. It is an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez. Alexandria is also an important tourist destination.

Build a movie plot around this: Who taught Alexander how to find the Morlocks not in passage Answer:","output":"Title: Timebound Shadows Genre: Sci-Fi/Adventure Plot: In the not too distant future, a brilliant historian and linguist, Alexander Harrington, stumbles upon an ancient and cryptic text that seems to hint at the existence of the mythical creatures called Morlocks - the ones who dwell in the shadows and were thought to be a mere fabrication in H.G. Wells' novel, \\"The Time Machine.\\" The text speaks of a secret passage that connects the present world with the world of the Morlocks. Intrigued by the idea, Alexander begins his research to decipher the passage's location, only to find that he's reached a dead end. But fate has other plans for Alexander when he encounters a mysterious and enigmatic mentor named Orpheus, who claims he has been searching for the Morlocks for centuries and possesses the knowledge of ancient arts and time travel. Brought together by their shared curiosity, Alexander and Orpheus form an unlikely alliance as they decipher clues and unravel mysteries to locate the passage. On their quest, they face numerous challenges and dangers, including the deceptive charm of the Sirens, who attempt to hinder their progress, and a rogue time traveler named Atticus, who seeks to harness the power of the Morlocks for his own sinister reasons. With time running out, Alexander and Orpheus are led to a forgotten underground city hidden beneath the largest metropolis in the world. There, they discover the Morlocks, a highly advanced but troubled society who, despite their frightening appearance, possess the secrets to both the universe's creation and its inevitable destruction. However, upon finding the Morlocks, Alexander and Orpheus uncover a shocking truth: the Morlocks are not the monsters once depicted in literature, but rather the gatekeepers to an ancient secret. This secret reveals that a cosmic force called the Shadow Divide threatens to tear apart time and space itself, and only Alexander, taught by the wisdom and guidance of Orpheus, has the power to unite the past, present, and future into one cohesive timeline and save humanity from ultimate annihilation. In the end, as Alexander embraces his newfound destiny and Ascends to his full potential, he must call upon the wisdom of the Morlocks and allies from different times and realms to confront the adversarial forces conspiring against him and prevent the looming apocalypse. Fractured alliances will be mended, betrayals will be revealed, and the ultimate battle for time and existence will be waged, with the fate of countless worlds hanging in the balance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Wikipedia is not a reliable source for academic writing or research. Wikipedia is increasingly used by people in the academic community, from freshman students to professors, as an easily accessible tertiary source for information about anything and everything, and as a quick \`\`ready reference'', to get a sense of a concept or idea. Choose from: (i). no. (ii). yes.","output":"(i). No. It is not advisable to cite Wikipedia as a source in a research paper or academic writing. The reasons for this are as follows: 1. Lack of reliability: The main reason for not using Wikipedia as a source in academic writing is its lack of reliability. Unlike peer-reviewed articles and books, the content on Wikipedia can be edited by anyone, regardless of their expertise or credibility. As a result, information on the platform can be inaccurate, biased, or incomplete. 2. Frequent changes: Wikipedia's content is constantly being updated and modified. As an open-content platform, anyone can edit or add new information. Consequently, there is always a risk that the information you cite may be changed or removed entirely at a later time. 3. Informal nature: Wikipedia is meant to be a \\"quick reference\\" source and is not intended for in-depth research. The writing style and tone of Wikipedia articles are often informal and may not meet the rigorous standards expected in academic writing. 4. Lack of proper citation and sources: While Wikipedia articles generally contain citations and references to other sources, the quality of these references varies. In some cases, sources may be unverifiable, biased, or not meet academic standards. By citing Wikipedia, you may inadvertently cite less reputable sources. 5. Plagiarism concerns: Since Wikipedia is an open-content platform, the text within Wikipedia articles is often borrowed or paraphrased from other sources. If you were to directly quote information from Wikipedia without verifying the original source, you risk unintentional plagiarism. To ensure the credibility and reliability of your research paper, it is best to use primary and secondary sources that have undergone a peer-review process, such as articles from scholarly journals, books, or other reputable sources. While Wikipedia can be a valuable starting point for getting a general understanding of a topic, it should not be cited as a definitive source in academic writing. Instead, use the references listed in Wikipedia articles to track down primary and secondary sources that can be cited with confidence."},{"instruction":"Question: Article: How could we tell time if there were no watches or clocks anywhere in the world?

A:","output":"Based on the given answer options, it may appear that neither \\"Yes\\" nor \\"No\\" would be the most suitable answer to the question of what zooplankton feed on. In order to accurately address the question, it is important to provide a more detailed response outside of the provided options. Zooplankton are indeed tiny animals that primarily feed on phytoplankton, which are microscopic plants that can be found drifting near the surface of the water in marine and freshwater environments. These phytoplankton are vital to the existence of zooplankton, as they serve as the primary food source for the tiny animals. Through filtering techniques or by capturing individual cells, zooplankton are able to consume these minuscule plants as part of their diet. To classify the components of a zooplankton's diet, it can be helpful to consider the different types of organisms that constitute phytoplankton. Some common examples of these microscopic plants include diatoms, cyanobacteria, and green algae. Although they may vary in size, structure, and ecological functions, all these organisms serve as the basis of aquatic food webs where zooplankton play an important role as primary consumers. As a result, it is not accurate to claim that zooplankton feed on \\"an organism's body,\\" as it does not properly reflect the specific dietary habits of these creatures. Instead, it is more precise to say that zooplankton consume microscopic plants or phytoplankton in the forms mentioned above and can also eat other types of planktonic organisms. Moreover, they may also consume some bacteria and organic debris present in the water. In summary, the correct answer to the question of what zooplankton feed on is not presented in the given options of \\"Yes\\" or \\"No.\\" Rather, the most accurate way to describe their diet would be to emphasize their consumption of microscopic plants, known as phytoplankton, along with other forms of plankton they may consume as well."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of Andy's character on Taxi? is inside the article: Andy Kaufman is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings children's songs and refuses to tell conventional jokes. As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his previously timid \\"foreign man\\" character puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them. He catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro, who signs Kaufman as a client and immediately lands him a network TV series, Taxi, much to Kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit. Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on Taxi. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a \\"villain character\\" created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda. Once again, the gag is on the audience. Kaufman's profile increases with appearances on Saturday Night Live, but he has problems with his newfound fame. When performing live, audiences dislike his strange anti-humor and demand that he perform as Latka. At one show, he deliberately antagonizes attendees by reading The Great Gatsby aloud from start to finish. Kaufman shows up on the Taxi set as Clifton and proceeds to cause chaos until he is removed from the studio lot.

Here is a question about this article: In the east there is a Dutch Low Saxon dialect area, comprising the provinces of Groningen, Drenthe and Overijssel, and parts of the province of Gelderland as well. The IJssel river roughly forms the linguistic watershed here. This group, though not being Low Franconian and being close to the neighbouring Low German, is regarded as Dutch, because of a number of reasons. From the 14th to 15th century onward, its urban centers (Deventer, Zwolle and Kampen as well as Zutphen and Doesburg) have been increasingly influenced by the western written Dutch and became a linguistically mixed area. From the 17th century onward, it was gradually integrated into the Dutch language area. In other words, this group is Dutch synchronically but not diachronically.[citation needed] What is the answer to this question: Although Dutch Low Saxon is similar to Low German, it's synchronically included with which language?","output":"The Dutch Low Saxon is synchronically, which means at the same time in history, included with the Dutch language. Even though it might not have originally been part of Dutch (diachronically, or over time), because of various reasons like influence from nearby areas and changes over the centuries, it has become part of what we now call the Dutch language.

Title: Troy Movie plot: The story takes place in the fertile, eastern lands bordered by the Mediterranean Sea and kept by the gods. Within the cradle of ancient civilization empires are built, wars fought, alliances forged, and heroes born.Agamemnon (Brian Cox), king of Mycenae, has united most of Greece's kingdoms under his rule and now advances his army upon the nation of Thessaly, hoping to include it in his collection of ever-growing conquests. King Triopas (Julian Glover) bargains with Agamemnon to each let one of their best fighters decide who wins the battle rather than engaging in open war. Triopas calls upon the giant Boagrius (Nathan Jones) while Agamemnon calls to Achilles, but the legendary warrior is nowhere to be found. A messenger boy (Jacob Smith) is sent to fetch him and Agamemnon curses the stubborn nature of the fiercest warrior Greece has ever seen. A half-god and blessed with incomparable strength and skill, Achilles lives to fight but he refuses to associate with Agamemnon, preferring instead to seek his own destiny and be immortalized in history. Achilles easily defeats Boagrius, sealing Agamemnon's control over the nation, and calls out if there is anyone else worthy enough to fight him.Meanwhile, Prince Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom) of Troy feast in the banquet hall of King Menelaus of Sparta (Brendan Gleeson) as honored guests and peace ambassadors to their home nation. However, young Paris sneaks away to be with Menelaus' beautiful wife, Helen (Diane Kruger), whom he loves dearly. He convinces her to come back with him to Troy, stowing her away on his brother's ship. When Hector finds out he is clearly angry but it is too late to return to Sparta with Helen and seek pardon. Finding Helen gone, Menelaus vows revenge on Troy and seeks the approval of his brother, Agamemnon, who is only too happy to oblige, though Agamemnon's decision comes mostly from his desire to sack Troy.Odysseus (Sean Bean), king of Ithaca and under command of Agamemnon, goes to convince Achilles to accompany them in the...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sometimes laughter in the middle of a horror film is a signal of its greatness. I remember the nervous laughter from the audience in the re-release of The Excorcist really nervous laughter. It punctuated just how freaked out we all were watching the voice of Satan coming out of a 12 year old girl. In the case of the 2006 remake of the 1972 cult classic The Wicker Man however, it made me think that this new Wickerman is about as scary as the South Park character, Scuzzlebut, the friendly forest monster with TV's Patrick Duffy for a leg and a celery stalk for an arm who's favorite hobby is weaving wicker baskets. 3 years ago a friend of mine in Hollywood told me that he heard that Nicolas Cage was going to do a remake of the film. I started laughing and my friend (Keith) got mad at me touting Nicolas Cage as a great actor. I just didn't think that he could pull it off and unfortunately for moviegoers I was right. Gone is the realness, the outstanding original music, the originality, the creepiness and the wonderfully powerful dialogue. Instead we have horror movie clichés, affected acting and changes to the storyline that make any believability fall apart. Like many of the countless Hollywood remakes we have been inundated with lately this feels like we are watching 4th graders on a playground \\"playing Wickerman\\". The original film takes place on a remote Scottish Isle where a Scottish police officer is lured there to find a missing young girl named Rowan Morrison. In the new spin a California cop (Cage) is lured to an island of the coast of Washington state by his ex-girlfriend to find her missing daughter. She sends a photo and the missing daughter looks exactly like a young girl he tried to save in a fiery crash not long ago. The crash still haunts him in part because the girl's body was never found. Yet even after he gets a letter with her picture in it that connection is completely cast aside as he heads north, alone, to help his ex-girlfriend find her daughter. He arrives to find an island full of actors pretending to be the descendants of Wiccans, many of whom seem like they didn't get call backs for roles in The Village. And like The Village it isn't long before you realize there is nothing to be afraid of here. Not even the cloudy eyed blind sisters who speak in unison. I think that the opportunity in Hollywood to make great amounts of money on a film often comes at great expense to the artistry. I think someone like Nicolas Cage who is in so many films these days loses touch with the magic that film can be when it gets to the point where he has a personal chef on the set preparing his snacks. We needed a bad re-make of the Wickerman like we needed yet another '9-11' movie. I'm starting to wonder if Nicolas changed his surname from Coppola because he wanted to or because he was pleaded with to do so. Would you say this review is positive or negative?","output":"The review is decidedly negative. The reviewer strongly criticizes the 2006 remake of \\"The Wicker Man,\\" taking issue with the film on multiple fronts.  The criticism starts off with the reviewer indicating that the laughter during the remake was not due to nervousness or tension, which he implies would be a positive indicator of a good horror film, but instead due to disbelief or perhaps mockery. The South Park character comparison denotes the reviewer's lack of respect or fear towards the film’s antagonist. The reviewer then moves on to express disappointment over Nicolas Cage's casting. This disappointment is rooted in information received years prior about Cage's involvement, which elicited laughter from the reviewer, indicating a lack of confidence in Cage's suitability for the role. The reviewer further criticizes Cage's performance, stating that he was correct in his skepticism about Cage's ability to deliver a compelling performance.  The reviewer decries the loss of \\"realness,\\" \\"outstanding original music,\\" \\"originality,\\" \\"creepiness,\\" and \\"wonderfully powerful dialogue\\" from the original film, asserting that the remake is filled with \\"horror movie clichés,\\" \\"affected acting\\" and alterations to the plotline that make any credibility crumble. The reviewer denounces the film's setting and cast, which he describes as an island full of actors pretending to be Wiccans, comparing them unfavorably to characters from \\"The Village\\". He furthermore emphasizes that unlike in a good horror flick, in the remake of the Wicker Man, the viewer quickly realizes that there is no real threat or cause for fear. Lastly, the reviewer briefly laments about the commercialization of the film industry, touching upon Nicolas Cage’s fame and wealth, and questioning if Cage's frequency in movie roles detracts from the magic of cinema. In addition, the reviewer seems to express frustration over Hollywood’s tendency to produce unnecessary remakes and unsatisfactory movies that exploit tragic events or popular sentiments, like the ones about 9-11.  It's also noteworthy that the closing statement insinuates that Nicolas Cage's change of surname may have been urged by others potentially to distance himself from illustrious relatives, hinting at the reviewer’s low opinion about Cage's acting skills and his impact at the box office.  Overall, the review is significantly negative, expressing dissatisfaction and disappointment with the movie through various angles, including the cast, the plot, and the direction of the remake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a more detailed exploration of the provided options and their relevance to this situation: (a) A team player: Carson's performance in the game would surely lead his teammates, coaches, and even fans to view him as a valuable team player. By hitting the crucial run and winning the match, Carson demonstrated commitment, skill, and a great sense of timing that ultimately benefited the entire team. His actions, which brought victory, would inspire trust among his teammates as they now know they can rely on him during vital moments in future games. Such contributions are essential in team sports like baseball, where individual efforts often combine to affect the collective outcome.

Consequently, it is highly plausible that others would view Carson as a good baseball player. (c) Ecstatic: The sense of joy and excitement that Carson's game-winning hit would generate among his teammates, coaches, and the team's fans cannot be understated. Ecstatic reactions are likely to be observed, given the nature of the accomplishment and the direct positive impact on the team's performance. Teammates would be thrilled to have secured victory, and they would be proud of Carson's timely success. Coaches may experience immense satisfaction, as Carson's hit may affirm the effectiveness of their training strategies and techniques, ultimately leading to the desired outcome. Fans, often passionately associated with their teams, would likely be elated, as this victory would contribute to their general sense of pride and enthusiasm for the team's continued success. In conclusion, the emotions and perceptions resulting from Carson's game-winning hit can be multi-faceted and far-reaching. From being viewed as a valuable team player and good baseball player, to evoking ecstatic emotions in teammates, coaches, and fans, Carson has left a memorable impression on various stakeholders involved with the game.

The emergence of networking involved a redefinition of the nature and boundaries of the computer. Computer operating systems and applications were modified to include the ability to define and access the resources of other computers on the network, such as peripheral devices, stored information, and the like, as extensions of the resources of an individual computer. Initially these facilities were available primarily to people working in high-tech environments, but in the 1990s the spread of applications like e-mail and the World Wide Web, combined with the development of cheap, fast networking technologies like Ethernet and ADSL saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous.

This is not to say that Sicily was completely isolated from trends elsewhere in Europe. Architecture in the island's major cities was strongly influenced by the family of the sculptor Domenico Gagini, who arrived from Florence in 1463. This family of sculptors and painters decorated churches and buildings with ornate decorative and figurative sculpture. Less than a century after his family had begun to cautiously decorate the island's churches (1531–37), Antonio Gagini completed the proscenium-like arch of the \\"Capella della Madonna\\" in the \\"Santuario dell'Annunziata\\" at Trapani. This pedimented arch to the sanctuary has pilasters — not fluted, but decorated heavily with relief busts of the saints; and, most importantly in terms of architecture, the pediment is adorned by reclining saints supporting swags linked to the central shield that crowns the pediment. This ornate pediment, although still unbroken, was one of the first signs that Sicily was forming its own style of decorative architecture. Similar in style is the Chiesa del Gesù (Illustration 14), constructed between 1564 and 1633, which also shows early signs of the Sicilian Baroque. Thus a particular brand of Baroque architecture had begun to evolve in Sicily long before the earthquake of 1693. While the majority of those buildings that can be clearly classified as Baroque in style date from around 1650, the scarcity of these isolated, surviving examples of Sicily's 17th-century architectural history makes it hard to fully and accurately evaluate the architecture immediately before the natural disaster: the earthquake destroyed not only most of the buildings, but also most of their documentation. Yet more information has been lost in subsequent earthquakes and severe bombing during World War II. The earliest example of Baroque on the island is Giulio Lasso's Quattro Canti, an octagonal piazza, or circus, constructed around 1610 at the crossroads of the city's two principal streets.  Around this intersection are four open sides, being the streets, and...","output":"The name of the pediment adorned by reclining saints is the \\"Capella della Madonna\\" in the \\"Santuario dell'Annunziata\\" at Trapani."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Authorities: Man was sledding downhill when homemade rocket exploded. Victim had reputation for doing \\"crazy things\\" at his parties, authorities say. Article:","output":"Title: Michigan Man's Rocket Sled Stunt Ends in a Fiery Fiasco A recent incident in which a Michigan man's impromptu rocket sled stunt went horribly wrong has sent shockwaves through the local community. Authorities reported that the man, known for hosting events filled with eccentric and daring deeds, was sledding downhill with an attached homemade rocket when it suddenly exploded. This calamity serves as a stark reminder of the perils that accompany some of the most audacious and seemingly harmless stunts. According to reports, the incident took place on a Saturday afternoon at the man's residence in a quiet Michigan neighborhood. His home, often the site of numerous boisterous gatherings, attracted a crowd expecting yet another sensational and unforgettable performance. Little did they know that the party would take a dramatic and unfortunate turn. The victim, whose identity has not been disclosed, had a reputation for doing what locals called \\"crazy things\\" at his parties. Among friends and family, he was known as a thrill-seeker, always pushing the limits of his own abilities to entertain. Onlookers that day anticipated an adrenaline-pumping, top-notch performance, but instead, they witnessed an alarming real-life disaster. The incident began when the man revealed his latest creation: a makeshift sled attached to a homemade rocket. The purpose of the contraption was ostensibly to provide him and his guests with an exhilarating ride down a steep hill adjacent to his property. Undeterred by the inherent risks of his endeavor, the man began his descent. However, as he gained speed, something went wrong. Witnesses described the scene as \\"chaotic\\" and \\"terrifying\\" when the rocket suddenly exploded, engulfing the sled and the man in flames. First responders quickly arrived at the scene, extinguishing the fire and rushing the victim to a nearby hospital. Authorities confirmed that the man sustained serious injuries, but his current condition remains undisclosed. Upon investigating the cause of the accident, authorities discovered that the homemade rocket had been constructed using dangerously unstable materials. Paired with the victim's inadequate preparation and insufficient safety measures, the situation had all the makings of a catastrophic outcome. As news of the tragedy spread, the community's response was one of shock and sadness. Locals expressed concern for the victim's wellbeing and extended support to his family. However, some residents also criticized the man's reckless behavior and the danger he imposed on his friends, family, and neighbors. The aftermath of this disastrous event brings to light the pressing issue of safety and the dire consequences of ignoring it. While adrenaline-inducing activities may provide a temporary rush, the reality is that the risks they present often outweigh the momentary benefits. In today's world, where individuals often engage in risk-taking behavior, either for personal satisfaction or social media notoriety, this tragic episode reminds us all of the importance of prioritizing safety and adopting responsible practices even in pursuit of thrills. The Michigan man's rocket sled stunt may have ended in a blaze, but it also sparked a crucial conversation about the inherent dangers of reckless behavior and the significance of valuing personal and public safety above all else."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1: Can you sprain your ankle with no pain? It is uncommon to sprain your ankle without experiencing any pain. A sprain typically involves stretching or tearing of the ligaments within the ankle joint, which leads to pain, swelling, and sometimes bruising. However, mild sprains might not cause significant pain, especially if they are immediately addressed by following the RICE method (rest, ice, compression, and elevation). In such cases, a person might continue to go about their daily activities without realizing that they have a mild sprain. Nevertheless, they may later show other symptoms such as stiffness or weakness in the ankle. It is crucial to monitor any unusual changes or discomfort in the affected area. If you suspect a sprain even without noticeable pain, it is best to consult a medical professional for proper evaluation and treatment. Question 2: What does it feel like to have a sprained ankle? A sprained ankle typically presents several characteristic symptoms including: 1. Pain: This is the most common symptom of a sprained ankle. The pain can range from mild to severe depending on the extent of the injury. It is usually localized to the affected area but can radiate to the surrounding regions. 2. Swelling: Inflammation occurs as the body's natural response to injury. Swelling around the ankle joint is a typical sign of a sprain. 3. Bruising: When blood vessels are damaged during a sprain, it can cause pooling of blood beneath the skin, leading to the formation of bruises. These are generally purple or blue in color and may change to green or yellow as they heal. 4. Instability: A sprained ankle may feel unstable or weak, making it difficult to bear weight on the affected foot or walk without discomfort. 5. Limited range of motion: Along with instability, the affected ankle will have a reduced range of motion due to pain and swelling. 6. Popping or tearing sensation: Some people experience a tearing or popping sensation at the time of injury, which indicates that the ligament has been stretched or torn. The intensity and duration of these symptoms vary depending on the severity of the sprain. Mild sprains can heal within a few days to a couple of weeks, while moderate to severe sprains might take several weeks or even months to fully recover. Regarding the similarity between Questions 1 and 2: While these questions are related to the topic of sprained ankles, they are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is asking if it's possible to have a sprain without pain, while Question 2 is inquiring about the overall sensations and symptoms associated with a sprained ankle, including pain. So, while both questions address the theme of ankle sprains, they focus on distinct aspects of the condition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The answer is:","output":"Harriet Tubman, born Araminta Ross in the early 1820s in Dorchester County, Maryland, was a remarkable individual who played multiple roles throughout her life, including conductor on the Underground Railroad, nurse, scout, and suffragist. She dedicated her life to fighting for the rights and freedom of enslaved people and contributed to numerous significant causes. Here are some of the jobs and roles that Harriet Tubman undertook during her lifetime: 1. Slave: Tubman was born into slavery, and her early years were spent working as an enslaved person on different plantations. She experienced brutal treatment and abuse from her slave owners, but as a child, she began working as a house servant and later transitioned to field labor, where she tended animals and performed other manual tasks. 2. Underground Railroad Conductor: After successfully escaping from slavery in 1849, Tubman became involved in the Underground Railroad, an informal network established to help enslaved people escape to freedom in the Northern United States and Canada. As a conductor, she personally guided around 70 enslaved individuals to freedom in 13 expeditions, exhibiting immense courage and resourcefulness in the face of great danger. 3. Nurse: During the American Civil War, Tubman served as a nurse in the Union Army. She treated wounded soldiers and provided them with comfort and support in their time of need. She used her knowledge of natural remedies and practical nursing skills to care for the sick and injured. 4. Scout and Spy: Tubman's intrepidity and familiarity with the Southern landscape made her an invaluable asset to the Union Army. She worked as a scout, guiding troops through challenging terrains, and acted as a spy, gathering crucial intelligence from local African Americans about Confederate troop movements and other pertinent information. 5. Civil War Commander: In June 1863, Tubman became the first woman in United States history to lead a military engagement. As a commander, she guided Union troops in a raid on the Combahee River in South Carolina, resulting in the destruction of key Confederate supplies and the liberation of more than 700 enslaved people. 6. Suffragist: After the Civil War, Tubman emerged as an advocate for the women's suffrage movement. She believed that women should have equal rights, including the right to vote, and she participated in events and lectures to promote these ideals. 7. Humanitarian: Tubman played a pivotal role in supporting her community in Auburn, New York, after the Civil War. She established her own home as a refuge for the elderly and impoverished, eventually turning the property into the Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged, which provided shelter and care for those in need. 8. Public Speaker: Throughout her later years, Tubman often spoke at gatherings, sharing her powerful story and advocating for the abolition of slavery and equality for all. Harriet Tubman's life was marked by her unwavering pursuit of justice and her tireless dedication to helping others. These various roles and jobs reflect her incredible resilience, courage, and commitment to creating a better world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step 1: Identify the objects in the solar system - Planets - Moons (natural satellites) - Asteroids - Comets - Dwarf planets - Man-made satellites Step 2: Eliminate objects that do not reflect light Since most celestial bodies in our solar system reflect light to some extent, we cannot eliminate any of them just yet. Step 3: Determine which objects can be classified as satellites - Moons (natural satellites) and man-made satellites are satellites by definition. Step 4: Discard man-made satellites as they typically orbit multiple/other planets - The description mentions a satellite that orbits around only one planet. Man-made satellites can orbit multiple planets or other celestial bodies, so we can eliminate them as a possibility.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person that the Viola is named after?, using the article: The apothecary and botanist, William Sole (June 1741 February 1802), was born in Little Thetford and educated at King's School, Ely. Sole was apprenticed to Robert Cory of Cambridge for five years; he followed this by setting up a solo apothecary practice in Bath and later a practice in partnership with Thomas West. Sole published Menthae Britannicae; he was one of the first elected associates of the Linnean Society of London and Sprengel named a plant species Solea (now Viola) after him. An Enclosure Act is a parliamentary authority to fence-off common land, thus making that land private property, while awarding commoners land in compensation. Inclosure is the name given to the parliamentary statute thus created. The enclosure process began in the 13th century and was supported by Acts of Parliament from 1640. In November 1833, the Isle of Ely intended to apply for Acts of Parliament to enclose the lands of Little Thetford. Officials arrived in the village armed with nothing more than a notice to be pinned on the Church of England's St. George's church door, but were prevented from doing so by a dozen villagers.

Context: I have always been a “handyman” involved in various building projects around the house. One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that. Anger has its place in your life. You have to control it and use it directly to solve a problem. To this day I do not know how I accomplished what I did the way I did it. But, if I hadn't been so angry I would never have attempted it at all. Life is full of little lessons. Pay attention to them and learn. If you have to lash out, lash at solving the situation you are in instead the person who caused it. It is significantly more productive that way.

Family Says Exploding Scooter Destroyed Home (CN) — A Tennessee family claims in a 30 million lawsuit that their decision to buy a hoverboard scooter from Amazon ended with two children jumping from second-story windows to escape their burning home.      Megan and Charles Brian Fox sued the online retailer Wednesday in Davidson County, Tenn., individually and on behalf of their children Hailey, Matthew, Rebecca and Sarah Fox.      According to the 18-page complaint, Megan bought \\"a self-balancing scooter, more commonly known as a hoverboard,\\" from Amazon.com in November 2015. The Fiturbo F1 scooter was a Christmas gift for 14-year-old Matthew.      The family used the hoverboard until tragedy struck two weeks later, they say.      \\"The hoverboard burst into flames inside the Fox house on Saturday, Jan. 9, 2016,\\" the complaint states. \\"The fire completely destroyed the plaintiffs' house and virtually all of their personal belongings in a matter of minutes.\\"      Brian Fox says he was turning into the family's subdivision when 16-year-old Hailey told him on the phone that the house was on fire.      \\"Then the phone line went dead. Brian looked up and saw smoking billowing over the trees. He accelerated toward his house, drove his car over the curb, and stopped in the front yard,\\" according to the lawsuit.      The father \\"feared that Hailey and Matthew were either dead or dying\\" inside the house, the complaint states, and he kicked in the front door, trying to locate his two children. He says he saw Hailey banging on her second-story bathroom window and \\"pleaded with her to break the small window out from the inside.\\"      \\"Eventually she was able to break out and, with smoke billowing from behind her, Brian yelled for Hailey to jump out the window to him. Hailey flung herself through the second floor window, and Brian did his best to break her fall,\\" the lawsuit states.      Brian then ran around the house yelling Matthew's name, and eventually saw him banging on a second-story window in a room above the garage, according to the complaint.      \\"Brian grabbed the ladder he kept behind the house and used it to climb up to the window where Matthew was. Brian could see Matthew through the massive fire and smoke and yelled for him to keep trying to break the window,\\" the complaint states. \\"Eventually, despite having to inflict significant injuries on his hands and forearms as well as his legs, Matthew was able to break through the glass. Panicked, Matthew dove out of the second story window into his father's arms. Brian and Matthew fell to the ground from the second floor.\\"      Megan, meanwhile, \\"arrived moments later to see her house fully engulfed in flames and multiple fire engines, but her husband and children injured but alive.\\"      \\"Brian Fox suffered the unspeakable terror of finding out that his two teenage children were trapped in a burning house and believing that he was going to lose one or both of them to the fire,\\" according to the lawsuit.      The hoverboard's lithium battery pack was the cause of the \\"catastrophic fire,\\" the Foxes say.      The family brought claims of product liability, negligence and misrepresentation against Amazon. W2M Trading Corp. is also named as a defendant, based on Amazon's contention that it participated in the sale of the scooter.      \\"These hoverboards, including the one sold to Mrs. Fox, were extremely dangerous and presented a substantial product hazard,\\" the complaint states. \\"The Amazon defendants knew of these product hazards well in advance of the fire at the Fox home.\\"      The family says the value of their home and personal property lost in the fire is more than 1.9 million.

(Photo: Nashville Fire Department)      NASHVILLE — A Nashville family whose 1 million home was destroyed earlier this year in a fire caused by a hoverboard toy is suing Amazon saying the retail giant knowingly sold a dangerous product.      \\"The Foxes contend that Amazon and its various subsidiaries had information about the danger of this product well in advance of the Jan. 9 fire, and on top of that, they had notice, they should have known the product was being misrepresented on their website,\\" Steve Anderson, of the Nashville law firm Anderson & Reynolds PLC, said.      Anderson represents the six-member Fox family, whose home was destroyed. The father, Brian Fox, rescued two of his children from the second floor of the burning home, according to fire officials and the lawsuit.      \\"The most horrific thing was obviously the episode that day and trying to rescue these two teenagers, and the profound impact on them,\\" Anderson said. \\"It's also important to consider that literally in a matter of few minutes every single personal possession of this entire family was destroyed. The only things that remained were their vehicles and handful of books and pictures they were able to find that had water damage they were able to dry out. In the blink of an eye it was all gone.\\"      The lawsuit says the seller of the hoverboard listed online, \\"W-Deals,\\" is a sham organization that is registered to an apartment in New York City that has not responded to requests from lawyers in the case. It alleges the family was sold a counterfeit product from China instead of a brand with a Samsung lithium ion battery they believed they were buying from Amazon.      It says Tennessee product liability law holds a seller responsible if the manufacturer cannot be found.      (Photo: Nashville Fire Department)      \\"We've spent months investigating it and to this day I don't know who manufactured this product, and it doesn't appear that Amazon does,\\" Anderson said. He said Amazon charged and shipped the hoverboard.      The lawsuit names 10 defendants, including Amazon and retailers on its sites, and says they are responsible. A representative of Amazon said the company does not comment on pending cases.      The lawsuit seeks 30 million in damages and asks a jury to weigh additional financial penalties against the retailer. Nashville Fire Department officials said a hoverboard caught fire on Jan. 9, destroying a 4,000-square-foot 1 million home on Radcliff Drive, near Edwin Warner Park.

The answer to the question: In what year did the Chicago Symphony Orchestra travel to Europe? is inside the article: In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Four hundred cyber-warriors from 16 countries last week responded to a scenario in which computer networks came under attack from another state's hackers. The scenario was based around the idea of \\"hybrid conflicts\\", just below the level of war, in which one state both carries out espionage and disrupts the communications and operations of another, tied in with other activities. The countries portrayed in the scenario were fictional, but it is hard to interpret this as anything other than thinking about Russia, which is seen as having pioneered hybrid conflict in Ukraine and, before that, Georgia. The exercise itself was taking place in Estonia, which was subject to its own cyber-attack. But the ability to carry out significant - even destructive  - cyber-attacks is spreading rapidly: all part of a cyber-arms race accelerating rapidly not just between Nato and Russia but also beyond into other states and even non-state actors. Just before Christmas, Sony Pictures got hacked. The intrusion was attributed by the US to North Korea and linked to the release of the studio's film The Interview, in which North Korea's leader was featured as being killed. The cyber-attack did not only expose embarrassing corporate secrets but also wiped company computers, rendering them as useful as a brick. Computer espionage has been happening for years, but the destructive element was another sign that states are increasingly willing to deploy malware that does real physical damage and to link their cyber-attacks to physical threats (in this case against cinemas showing the film). In North Korea's case, cyber-weapons are a vital part of the country's arsenal. \\"Cyber-hacking is a crucial part of their asymmetric military capabilities. They have been pursuing it for such a long time with unbelievable levels of concentration, support and investment,\\" says Kim Heung Kwang, a former computer science professor in North Korea who left for the South. \\"That's how they have been able to foster this in such a lopsided shape compared to everything else in the country.\\" He says a military unit that had 500 personnel when it started in 1998 has now grown to more than 3,000. This kind of wiper attack, which renders computers unusable, was first seen on a large scale in 2012, when staff at the oil company Saudi Aramco tried to switch on their computers. US officials believed this attack was, like the Sony hack, state-sponsored, in Saudi Aramco's case by Iran. But, if so, it was almost certainly simply a response to attacks on Iran itself - including most famously the Stuxnet virus, which damaged Iranian centrifuges over an extended period and is widely believed to have been the joint work of the US and Israel. Stuxnet was first detected in June 2010 by a security firm based in Belarus, but may have been circulating since 2009. Unlike most viruses, the worm targets systems that are traditionally not connected to the internet for security reasons. Instead it infects Windows machines via USB keys - commonly used to move files around - infected with malware. Once it has infected a machine on a firm's internal network, it seeks out a specific configuration of industrial control software made by Siemens. Once hijacked, the code can reprogram so-called PLC (programmable logic control) software to give attached industrial machinery new instructions. What surprised cyber-experts is the speed with which cyber-attack capabilities are now proliferating. No-one was surprised that the first tier of cyber-states - the US, UK, China, Israel and Russia - were capable of carrying out destructive attacks on infrastructure, but the speed with which others - such as Iran - were able to do the same has caused consternation and is a sign of how far cyber-attack can be a force-equaliser between different nations who might otherwise have wildly different capabilities. Capabilities are also spreading to non-state actors. Criminals have long used ransomware to extort money from people or else see their computers locked. But terrorist groups may also now be toying with more than just low-level disruptive attacks that deface or take off-line websites. France's TV5 Monde saw the real-world effects of a cyber-attack when it was taken off air by people who claimed to belong to the \\"cyber-caliphate\\" affiliated to the group calling itself Islamic State. There are fears the use of destructive attacks against industrial control systems - like Stuxnet - could also spread. At a recent Cyber Security Challenge, Dr Kevin Jones, from Airbus, showed me how a model city connected up to the internet could have its power switched off remotely. \\"Unless we put a security architecture in place, this is very possible,\\" he says. A German government report said a steel mill had been damaged by a cyber-attack last year - the perpetrators were unknown. Dr Jones believes the attackers got in through the regular corporate infrastructure, although it is not clear how far they deliberately targeted the control systems for the blast furnace that was damaged. When it comes to the cyber-arms race, are Western countries still in the lead? Some argue the top end of cyber-espionage tools may well still be in the hands of the US. The security firm Kaspersky Labs, for instance, recently revealed the work of hackers they called the Equation Group, who were highly sophisticated. \\"The Equation Group are masters of cloaking and hiding,\\" says Costin Raiu, director of the Global Research and Analysis Team at Kaspersky Labs, pointing to the ability of the group to get inside the firmware of machines and then launch highly advanced attacks. \\"This is insanely complicated to be honest,\\" he says. Kaspersky Labs will not directly point the finger, but the widespread assumption is that the Equation Group is linked to America's National Security Agency (there are links with the codes used in Stuxnet as well). Documents released by the American whistle-blower Edward Snowden have also raised the profile of Britain's cyber-activities. \\"GCHQ has formidable resources,\\" says Eric King, of the group Privacy International, whose concern lies in the lack of a transparent framework of accountability over offensive hacking. \\"In the last year and a half, we've seen their malware. The depth of the work and where they are going is very formidable.\\" He says: \\"We have non-existent policies, practices, legal safeguards to oversee this.\\" (GCHQ always maintains its activities are lawful and subject to oversight). Another concern is the way in which such some of these cyber-espionage capabilities are now commercially available and being used by more authoritarian states. \\"Companies are providing surveillance as a consultancy service,\\" says Mr King, who adds foreign law enforcement and intelligence agencies can then use the bought services to hack dissidents and activists based in the UK. The capabilities may be spreading to more and more actors but a small handful of states still operate at the highest level. One senior Western intelligence official believes the Russians are already ahead of the US and UK - partly because of the level of resources, mainly people - they throw at finding and exploiting vulnerabilities. That official, of course, may be bluffing, but they also said they did not think it would be long before the Chinese had also not just caught up but moved ahead.","output":"Cyber-warriors from 16 countries participated in an exercise responding to a hypothetical situation where computer networks were attacked by hackers from another state, highlighting the increasing prevalence and significance of cyber-attacks in state conflicts, with various destructive, espionage, and disruptive scenarios portrayed."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Contradictory Philosophy Review: This book is a continuous barrage of opinions from Patrick Henry, whose philosophy seems to be that \\"nothing is certain except the fact that nothing is certain,\\" which is intellectual relativism. The good thing about the book is its style. As a sort of journal of lessons learned in life, it would be interesting even to someone who disagrees. I would like to see more books out there that take that approach, but I hope that future authors view their work as an addition to the existing 2000 years of Christianity, rather than a modification of it. Answer: Answer:","output":"The tone of this product review can be considered as mixed. Step 1: Analyze the review for negative comments. - The reviewer mentions that the book has a 'continuous barrage of opinions from Patrick Henry' and discusses 'intellectual relativism,' which seem to be negative aspects of the book, according to the reviewer.

If more than one seedling sprouts in the same pot, then snip the weakest seedlings with scissors. This will make room for the healthiest seedling. You can also transplant all of the seedlings into separate containers, but keep in mind that this is riskier. Once your plant reaches maturity, transplant it to a larger pot whenever the roots come out the drainage hole or press against the sides of the container. The soil should remain moist at all times, but never soggy. If the sensitive plant is in a dry room, mist it with water occasionally, or place it on a humidity tray. Sensitive plants are an invasive weed in many areas. Unless you are in one of their native habitats in tropical America, you may want to grow sensitive plants indoors. Gardeners worldwide report the plant taking over their lawns. In Australia, you are legally required to minimize the spread of mimosa pudica seeds off your property. Dilute a balanced fertilizer to half the strength recommended on the label. Apply to the soil once a week during the growing season, and once a month during winter. Since it is a tropical plant, Mimosa pudica will grow best if nighttime temperatures are 70ºF (21ºC) or higher. If temperatures fall below 65ºF (18ºC), move the plant to a warmer room or keep the plant warm in other ways. Adult plants can survive temperatures as low as 40ºF (4.5 °C), but are at risk of damage or death. Keep an eye out for yellow leaves and stems, which are signs of possible cold damage. It's normal for the stem to fall over and creep along the ground once the plant matures. Provide a trellis or sturdy plant to support it, or allow enough horizontal space for it to grow. Some sensitive plants grow more than 1 meter (3 ft) high or 2 meters (6.6 ft) horizontally, but in temperate zones they will more likely reach half this size. Mimosa pudica can survive for at least two years in tropical climates, but are usually annual plants in temperate zones. Even if your plant survives after its first bloom (usually in summer), you may have better results letting it die and collecting its seeds for next spring. To collect seeds, let the pods dry on the plant, then break them open and collect the seeds. The sensitive plant is not particularly prone to disease, but it may become infested with some common pests, such as red spider mites, mealy bugs, and thrips. These can be removed by spraying the plant with a direct stream of water or neem oil every few days. Avoid using insecticidal soaps, as these can turn the leaves of the plant black.

If I could give this place zero stars I would. When I arrived the only person who showed any signs of hospitality was the first valet I encountered. I asked him how much valet was and he told me it was free so I gave him 10 and he said he was going to keep my car close. When going into the resort to check in I waited in line for about 15 minutes and when It was my turn to go to the front deck, the lady behind the front desk just stared at her computer screen and finally said \\"next\\" with out even looking up from her computer. When I walked up she did not say\\" hello\\" or \\"welcome to the resort\\" she just simply said\\" credit card and ID\\" i've been in the hospitality industry for seven years. If you don't make eye contact and greet your guests when they arrive, you already know what kind of experience you are gonna have the rest of your stay.... And the Talkingstick resort definitely delivered the kind of service I was expecting from my check in process. everyone from the bartender to the man who asked for my keys before I can enter the hallway to get to my room was extremely rude and I tried to even joke with them and they wouldn't even crack a smile. I went to top golf with some friends and when I returned I was smoking a cigarette and the hallway guard told me I need to extinguish it before entering the hall to my room. I placed a cigarette into the half empty drink I was holding and continued on to my room. When I checked out the next day I received a statement saying that it had my normal room rate that I was expecting to pay.One month later I see on my credit card statement they charged me 300 for a cleaning fee because there was a cigarette butt inside a glass in in my room. They said it was evidence I was smoking in the room. Of course my room smelled like smoke, my friend and I were in your cigar bar for the evening and bought cigars. Of course our clothes are going to smell like smoke and I was asked to put my cigarette out on my way to my room and what was I supposed to do? Refuse? The manager I spoke with, was very polite in a passive aggressive manner about not refunding the 300 cleaning fee and was very defensive about the matter.  When leaving the resort, I gave my valet ticket along with a 10 bill to the valet attendant. (which was a man with long hair and kind of shabby, not what you would expect from a resort that claims to have as many diamonds as they do) when the ballet attended came back with my keys he simply pointed at my car on the far end of the drive which was literally about 100 yards away and said\\"there's your car\\".. Dude, I just gave you a 10 tip.. When I was a valet 10 years ago, if somebody gave me 10 I would make sure they saw me running! On a positive note the rooms were beautiful the hotel was very nice, but something has to be done with management and the overall morale of the employees at the Talkingstick resort.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]  I am facing a new situation today: The fruit harvest was awesome this year, so Mary decided to experiment by candying some raspberries, apricots and apples. She didn't candy plums, cherries and pears though. the candied fruit lasted longer, preserved their aroma and tasted delicious.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which of Mary's fruit are saturated with sugar, apricots or cherries? Answer:","output":"Based on the background article and the new situation you provided, the candied fruit that is saturated with sugar in Mary's case would be apricots. This is because Mary decided to candy raspberries, apricots, and apples, while she did not candy plums, cherries, and pears. The candying process saturates the fruit with sugar, helping it to last longer, preserve its aroma, and taste delicious. Since apricots were among the fruits Mary candied and cherries were not, apricots are the fruit that is saturated with sugar in this situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: As the world's population of older adults increases, so do conversations around successful aging -- including seniors' physical, mental and social well-being.      A variety of factors can impact aging adults' quality of life. Two big ones, according to new research from the University of Arizona, are the health and cognitive functioning of a person's spouse.      Analyzing data from more than 8,000 married couples -- with an average age in the early 60s -- researchers found that the physical health and cognitive functioning of a person's spouse can significantly affect a person's own quality of life.      The findings have implications for how to most effectively address quality-of-life issues in people's later years.      \\"When we think about quality of life for older adults, and improving quality of life, it seems like targeting the individual is only part of the story, and our findings suggests that for older adults, a larger part of individual well-being is defined by our partner's health and cognitive functioning as well,\\" said UA psychologist David Sbarra, a co-author of the paper, which will be published in Psychology and Aging, a journal of the American Psychological Association.      The population of Americans age 65 years or older is expected to double during the next 25 years to about 72 million, as baby boomers age and people live longer. By 2030, older adults will account for roughly 20 percent of the U.S. population and health-care spending will increase by 25 percent, largely because of the aging population, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.      \\"As we build public health interventions for our aging population when it comes to quality of life, we need to take a more dyadic approach, looking at both partners,\\" said Sbarra, an associate professor in the UA Department of Psychology with joint appointments in Family Studies and Human Development (link sends e-mail) and the Evelyn F McKnight Brain Institute.      The study was based on analysis of data from the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe, or SHARE study, of adults age 50 and older. The data was collected at three intervals over a six-year period, between 2004-2005 and 2010-2011.      UA researchers considered survey respondents' self-reports of physical health and quality of life, as well as their scores on cognition tests measuring verbal fluency, word recall and delayed word recall. The UA study looked at health and cognition across a normal spectrum, rather than focusing on clinical cognitive disorders or chronic illnesses.      The findings support existing research on the interdependence of older married couples, and they extend that research by identifying cognition and physical health as two specifically important factors that influence spouses' quality of life.      Kyle Bourassa, a UA doctoral student in clinical psychology and the paper's lead author, said husbands' and wives' quality of life appears to be equally impacted by their spouse's physical health, with no differences across gender lines. In other words, a wife's physical health impacts her husband's quality of life as much as a husband's physical health affects his wife's quality of life.      \\"If you have people whose physical health is low -- maybe they're suffering from an illness or unable to walk -- those kind of physical health issues not only impact the individual but the person they're married to as well,\\" Bourassa said. \\"Their husband or wife is the one who may have to adjust and help with their partner's new lifestyle.\\"      With regard to cognition, wives' cognitive functioning appears to have as much of an effect of husbands' quality of life as husbands' own cognitive abilities. Wives' quality of life was not as strongly affected by their husbands' cognition, but there was a measurable impact, Bourassa said.      Finally, changes in participants' self-reported overall quality of life at the three intervals in the SHARE survey varied similarly between husbands and wives, suggesting that change in one spouse's life quality over time parallels change in the other's.      As adults age, changes in physical health can be a natural part of the process, as can cognitive decline, which can range from normal change in cognition to the onset of disorders such as dementia or Alzheimer's disease. As this change can vary dramatically between different people, it makes sense to look at both physical health and cognition as they relate to quality of life for both partners, Bourassa said. Additional research is needed to determine how changes in these two areas can change quality of life over time, he said.      \\"The population of aging adults is going up drastically, and as we have more and more people who are living longer and longer it's really important to understand successful aging,\\" said Bourassa, whose co-authors on the paper included Sbarra and UA psychology doctoral students Molly Memel and Cindy Woolverton.      Said Bourassa: \\"You could extend these findings to think about interventions targeting cognition and physical health to improve quality of life not only for the individual, but also for their partner.\\" ||||| Many things can impact older adults' quality of life. But two big ones, according to new research from the University of Arizona, are the health and cognitive functioning of their spouse. By analyzing data from more than 8,000 married couples (with an average age in the early 60s), researchers found that the physical health and cognitive functioning of a person's spouse can significantly affect someone's own quality of life.      A press release quoted UA psychologist David Sbarra, a co-author of the paper, as saying, \\"When we think about quality of life for older adults, and improving quality of life, it seems like targeting the individual is only part of the story, and our findings suggest that for older adults, a larger part of individual well-being is defined by our partner's health and cognitive functioning as well.\\" The paper will be published in Psychology and Aging, a journal of the American Psychological Association.      Sbarra urged \\"looking at both partners\\" when one partner develops serious health issues. The study underscores the need for caregiver relief and assistance. If a spouse is suffering from an illness or is unable to walk, their care frequently falls to the healthy spouse, who in turn must make their own lifestyle changes to accommodate their needs.      UA researchers considered survey respondents' self-reports of physical health and quality of life, as well as their scores on cognition tests measuring verbal fluency, word recall and delayed word recall, said the release.      Other studies have also bolstered the idea that caregivers' lives are deeply impacted by the illness of a loved one. Nearly 60 percent of Alzheimer's and dementia caregivers rate the emotional stress of caregiving as high or very high; about 40 percent suffer from depression. Due to the physical and emotional toll of caregiving, Alzheimer's and dementia caregivers had 9.7 billion in additional health care costs of their own in 2014, reports the Alzheimer's Association.      Caregiving is also costly. The total estimated aggregate of lost wages, pension, and Social Security      benefits of people who care for their elderly parents is nearly 3 trillion, according to the MetLife Study of Caregiving Costs. |||||Summary:","output":"As the global population of older adults increases, discussions around successful aging, including physical, mental, and social well-being become more important. New research from the University of Arizona discovered that the health and cognitive functioning of an older person's spouse can significantly affect their own quality of life. The study found that physical health and cognitive functioning impact both husband and wife's quality of life equally, regardless of gender. When one spouse develops significant health issues, it's important to consider the needs of both partners in addressing quality-of-life concerns. This research supports the concept of providing relief and assistance for caregivers, whose well-being may be compromised when caring for a spouse with an illness or disability. This study, published in the American Psychological Association's journal Psychology and Aging, highlights the interdependence of older married couples in terms of health and cognitive functioning. The findings underscore the need for public health interventions targeting both cognition and physical health to not only improve an individual's quality of life but also their partner's.

Blunt-spoken and popular with military personnel, Kelly, 66, was born and raised in Boston. He initially enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1970, and was discharged from active duty as a sergeant in 1972. He returned to the Marine Corps after graduation from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 1976. Kelly rose through the ranks to serve as the commanding general of the Multi-National Force West in Iraq from February 2008 to February 2009, and as the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North in October 2009. He succeeded General Douglas Fraser as commander of U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) on Nov. 19, 2012. As the head of USSOUTHCOM, Kelly was in charge of the military jail at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and also was exposed to immigration, drug trafficking and other cross-border problems over a sprawling area that encompasses 32 countries in the Caribbean, Central America and South America.

He produced higher frequency with fork A and lower frequency with fork B. Interestingly, both frequencies had the same amplitude.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would fork A needed John to move it more or less quickly than fork B?  Hint: The frequency of a wave is the same as the frequency of the vibrations that caused the wave. For example, to generate a higher-frequency wave in a rope, you must move the rope up and down more quickly. This takes more energy, so a higher-frequency wave has more energy than a lower-frequency wave with the same amplitude. You can see examples of different frequencies in the Figure below (Amplitude is the distance that particles of the medium move when the energy of a wave passes through them.) The answer to this question is:","output":"Fork A would need John to move it more quickly than fork B.  The reason behind this lies in the relationship between frequency, energy, and the speed of the vibrations that generate the wave. As the hint suggests, a higher-frequency wave carries more energy as compared to a lower-frequency wave of the same amplitude. Since fork A produces a higher frequency, it implies that it carries more energy. To generate this higher-frequency wave, John has to move fork A more quickly than fork B. The frequency of a wave is directly related to the frequency of the vibrations that caused the wave. In other words, as the speed of the vibrations (or the number of vibrations per unit of time) increases, so does the frequency of the wave being produced. In summary, for fork A to produce a higher frequency wave compared to fork B, John needs to move it more quickly, resulting in more vibrations per unit of time and thus, a higher frequency wave."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Dear David, It is with enormous regret - not least because of the tremendous support and loyalty you have shown me during recent weeks - that I am writing to resign as your chief whip. Over the last two days it has become clear to me that whatever the rights and wrongs of the matter I will not be able to fulfil my duties as we both would wish. Nor is it fair to continue to put my family and colleagues through this upsetting and damaging publicity. I have made clear to you - and I give you my categorical assurance again - that I did not, never have, and never would call a police officer a \\"pleb\\" or a \\"moron\\" or used any of the other pejorative descriptions attributed to me. The offending comment and the reason for my apology to the police was my parting remark \\"I thought you guys were supposed to f***ing help us\\". It was obviously wrong of me to use such bad language and I am very sorry about it and grateful to the police officer for accepting my apology. I am immensely grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to serve as your Development Secretary for seven and a half years, both in Opposition and in Government. I believe Britain, under your leadership, has made real progress in transforming the lives and the opportunities of some of the world's poorest people and that we will continue to do so as we deploy an expertise and commitment which show Britain at its best. I now intend to concentrate on serving my constituents in the Royal town of Sutton Coldfield to the best of my ability and giving you the strong support you rightly deserve from all members of the Conservative Party. With every good wish, Yours ever, Andrew Mitchell. Dear Andrew, Thank you for your letter. I was sorry to receive it, but I understand why you have reached the conclusion that you have, and why you have decided to resign from the Government. I regret that this has become necessary, and am very grateful for all you have done, both in Government and in Opposition - as well as for the kind words in your letter. I am in no doubt that your work in the field of international development has made a really important contribution - not only to the Conservative Party, but more importantly to Britain's standing in the world, and above all to international efforts to tackle deep and sustained poverty. You brought real passion to the job in Opposition, which you turned into more than two years of very successful work in Government. You brought immense energy and dedication to the role, a focus on the world's poorest, and decisive progress on the key issues of vaccination against preventable diseases, maternal health and family planning that make the greatest difference to the greatest number of people. You have also brought a proper accountability and transparency to the Department for International Development's work. Under your leadership of the Department, Britain achieved a leading global role, which will be continued as Britain chairs the United Nations High Level Panel. As we discussed in advance of the reshuffle, I wanted you to bring your organisational skill and energy to the important job of Chief Whip. It was clear to me that you had already made a strong start. As you have acknowledged, the incident in Downing Street was not acceptable and you were right to apologise for it. You have much to be proud of from your service on the Frontbench both in Opposition and in Government, and in your continued service to your constituents in Sutton Coldfield. I hope that, in time, you will be able to make a further contribution to public life. Yours David","output":"A man named Andrew wrote a letter to his friend David, who is an important leader.

Jane Stuart is an incredibly unsympathetic character, who, although she loves her son more than anything in the world, seems perfectly ok leaving him with anyone who happens to turn up. Her relationships run hot and cold; she gets really angry and behaves in a way no one would tolerate. There's no gray in this book, the characters are either saints or devils, and they switch from one to the other with amazing speed.

We chased ducks , went down some slides , ran around , swung on some swings & just had some fun for once without any parents up our asses . Loving life once again , except for the whole step - dad being a douche . Question: How do I feel towards my step - dad ?","output":"Based on the information shared in this recount of your day at the park with little Christopher, it's clear that you enjoyed spending time in a relaxed, carefree, and fun-filled environment. The day allowed you to experience a sense of freedom and happiness without the interference of parental figures. When referring to your step-dad, you described him as \\"a douche,\\" which demonstrates that there is a negative perception or feeling towards him. We can deduce that your relationship with your step-dad is most likely strained, and there might be some conflicts or disagreements that have occurred between the two of you. The use of a derogatory term for describing him signifies a strong dislike or resentment. It is important to note, however, that the feelings and relationships can be complex and layered, particularly in a step-family setting. The bitterness towards your step-dad could stem from multiple factors, including: 1. Adjusting to the new family dynamics: The introduction of a step-parent into a family can lead to various concerns and challenges, regardless of the age of the children involved. It could be that you are finding it difficult to accept your step-dad and adapt to the changes that his presence has brought to the family. 2. Perceived interference in the relationship with your biological parent: Sometimes, a step-parent might inadvertently or intentionally interfere or influence the relationship between you and your biological parent, which could result in feelings of anger, jealousy, or resentment towards the step-parent. 3. Personality clashes and disagreements: There could also be genuine personality and temperamental differences that lead to arguments and confrontations, adding to the tension in the relationship. 4. Discipline and parenting style: If your step-dad has a different approach to discipline and parenting than your biological parents, it could lead to frustration and a lack of understanding or respect between the two of you. To summarize, based on your description of your step-dad and the events in the park, it appears that your feelings towards your step-dad are ones of negativity and resentment. It is essential to understand the reasons behind these feelings so that you can effectively address any issues and work towards building a more harmonious relationship. This could involve open and honest communication with your step-dad, your biological parent, and potentially seeking professional family counseling to navigate through the complex dynamics and emotions within the step-family."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How can I remember how to write the Chinese character 鼠?","output":"Though the questions share a common theme, namely, remembering how to write a specific Chinese character, they differ in meaning as they pertain to two different characters, 贰 (èr) and 鼠 (shǔ). Understanding the individual components of each character and employing memory techniques would allow you to remember the strokes and formations of both characters. For the character 贰 (èr): This character primarily means \\"two\\" or \\"second\\" and is used in more formal contexts, such as in legal or financial documents. It is composed of the radical 贝 (bèi), which suggests the meaning related to money, and 耳 (ěr) that phonetically completes the character. Following these steps would help you remember the structure of 贰: 1. First, write the radical 贝 (bèi), which looks like a shell and represents the meaning of valuables or money. It consists of two strokes: a horizontal stroke and a downward curved stroke. 2. Next, write 耳 (ěr) inside the 贝 radical. This character means \\"ear\\" and is comprised of six strokes: a small vertical stroke, a long downward curved stroke, a small upward curved stroke, a short diagonal stroke, a long diagonal stroke, and a final horizontal stroke. 3. Once you've completed 耳(ěr), you've created the character 贰 (èr). It is essential to practice writing the character multiple times to build stroke order familiarity. For the character 鼠 (shǔ): This character primarily translates to \\"rat\\" or \\"mouse.\\" It is composed of the radical 鼓 (gǔ) that indicates the meaning related to drums, and 耳 (ěr) for its phonetic aspect. The steps below would help you remember the structure of 鼠: 1. Start by writing the radical 鼓 (gǔ), which represents a drum. The radical has a top part and bottom part, with the top part, 示 (shì), exemplifying a divine being or altar and the bottom part 福 (fú) meaning happiness or blessing. 2. First, write 示 (shì), composed of the following strokes: a short horizontal stroke, two downward curved strokes on each side, a long horizontal stroke crossing through the downward curved strokes, and a small vertical stroke below the long horizontal stroke. 3. Second, write 福 (fú) beneath 示 (shì), which is composed of the following strokes: a short horizontal stroke, a short vertical stroke, a long diagonal stroke, a small horizontal stroke, another horizontal stroke, and, finally, a downward curved stroke. 4. Once you've completed 鼓 (gǔ), write 耳 (ěr) on the right side of the character to create 鼠 (shǔ). As previously mentioned, 耳 (ěr) consists of six strokes and means \\"ear.\\" 5. To reinforce your memory, practice writing the character several times to become familiar with the stroke order and structure. By examining the components of both characters and practicing them individually, your memory concerning how to write 贰 (èr) and 鼠 (shǔ) will be strengthened.

A:","output":"Based on the provided statement, we can deduce that the higher the pH of a substance, the more basic it is. Therefore, when the pH decreases, the substance becomes less basic or more acidic.  To answer the question, John noticed that the lower the pH of the substance, the amount of basic it was decreased. To fully understand this concept, it's important to have a general understanding of the pH scale. The pH scale is a logarithmic scale that ranges from 0 to 14. This scale measures the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of a solution based on the concentration of hydrogen ions (protons, H+) in the solution. The scale is defined as follows: 1. Neutral: A pH value of 7 indicates a neutral solution (pure water at 25°C is an example). 2. Acidic: A pH value between 0 and less than 7 indicates an acidic solution. As the pH value decreases below 7, the acidity of the solution increases. 3. Basic (Alkaline): A pH value greater than 7 and up to 14 indicates a basic or alkaline solution. As the pH value increases above 7, the basicity of the solution increases. In summary, as the pH value decreases, the solution becomes more acidic and less basic, and as the pH value increases, the solution becomes more basic and less acidic. John's observation is correct, as he found out that when the pH of the substance is lower, the substance is less basic."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the following conversation and answer the question.

Article: A Battery's Nightmare Portable electronics that can be carried about easily are only as good as their batteries   and, let's face it, batteries aren't very good, especially when compared with, say, petrol, which packs 100 times a battery's energy into an equal space. That's why a large group of mechanical engineers (centered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but with partners at other universities and companies) are hard at work in an effort to replace batteries with a tiny engine that runs on fuel. Imagine a battery-free life! When the fuel runs out in your mobile phone, you just fill up and go. The engine---about the size of a ten-cent coin---starts with a combustion chamber   that burns hydrogen. Its tiny parts are etched   onto silicon wafers   in the same manner that computer parts are etched onto integrated circuits  . The first engine is made up of five wafers. And since these wafers could be produced in much the same way as computer chips, they could probably be produced quite cheaply. But the _ in all this nice detail is efficiency. Tiny engine parts don't always behave like the bigger parts of the first engine. Something between the parts can slow down the works, according to Columbia University Professor LucFrechette, one of the engine's designers. Extreme heat from the combustion chamber is also a problem, often leaking to other parts of the engine. The scientists' goal is to create an engine that will operate 10 times better than batteries operate. Frechette says that a complete system, with all parts in place and working, will be set up in the next couple of years, but commercial models aren't likely until at least the end of the next ten years.

He loves… Continue reading. Dave was always inclined to stay indoors since he enjoyed the tranquility and comfort that the house had to offer. While some of us wouldn't think twice about grabbing an umbrella and stepping out, Dave had a unique preference for staying inside to cuddle up with a warm cup of coffee and his favorite book, letting the rain serenade him in the background. On rainy days like this one, Dave's creative side would often come to life. He loved indulging in his hobbies, ranging from painting and writing to experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. It wasn't just the warmth and safety of the house, but the opportunity to be lost in his own little world that really captivated his heart. Dave's love for music, too, would get the best of him on these days. He could sit for hours on end, playing his guitar or piano while humming to the rhythm of the falling raindrops. The walls of the living room would echo the melodies, and his house transformed into a haven of artistic expression. Another enjoyable aspect of rainy days was the atmosphere. The soft light filtering through the curtains, combined with the smell of petrichor – the scent that arises when rainwater hits the earth – emanated a sense of peace and calmness. For Dave, the rainy day signaled an escape from the hustle and bustle of the modern world. It became a sanctuary for him to relax, reflect, and recharge his energy and thoughts. We all knew that Dave cherished these moments at home, and we made sure to respect his preferences. Though, we couldn't help but occasionally join him in the endearing activities he engaged in. Movie nights with his dearest friends would become a spontaneous agenda, with blankets sprawled out over the floor and the smell of popcorn in the air. Nobody could resist the comforting warmth of the house, united with those who mattered most to him. Dave's perspective on rainy days is a gentle reminder to us all. Life can be chaotic, filled with responsibilities and relentless noise. It is important that we, too, carve out time for ourselves amidst the chaos – be it through immersing ourselves in our hobbies or by simply enjoying the sometimes healing sound of water droplets hitting the windows. The world may be constantly moving, but we should not forget the simple pleasures of life that exist within the walls of our own cozy haven."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The game started when the 49ers attempted an onside kick, recovered by the Jets.  Later, the 49ers went up first as Shaun Hill completed a pass to Jason Hill that was fumbled at the goal line and recovered by offensive tackle Joe Staley for the touchdown.  Then, Brett Favre ran for a 2-yard touchdown.  The 49ers retook the lead as Shaun Hill completed a touchdown screen pass to Frank Gore.  After half-time, Thomas Jones plowed through the 49ers secondary to get a 17-yard score. On the ensuing 49ers possession, a Shaun Hill touchdown pass to Delanie Walker was called back, and the 49ers settled for a Joe Nedney 32-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the 49ers cemented their lead when Shaun Hill completed a 3-yard touchdown pass to a diving Bryant Johnson.  The Jets had enough time to make a late comeback, but a Brett Favre deep pass was intercepted by Walt Harris.  The 49ers ran down the clock and punted, and the Jets did not have sufficient time to attempt the comeback. The 49ers fumbled the ball a total of 5 times, although, fortunately for them, only one was lost. With the win, the 49ers improved to 5-8.

Information:  - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk).  - The froghoppers, or the superfamily Cercopoidea, are a group of Hemipteran insects, in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha. Adults are capable of jumping many times their height and length, giving the group their common name, but they are best known for their plant-sucking nymphs which encase themselves in froth in springtime.  - Baissa is a lower Cretaceous locality in Siberia, on the left bank of the Vitim River. The Zaza Formation sediments exposed at Baissa are represented mostly by sandstones, siltstones, marls and bituminous shales. The total thickness if the section is about 80 m. Insect remains occur throughout the section, except for the most coarse-grained rocks. Their abundance and state of preservation vary from one bed to another.  - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period.   - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions.  - Saurophthirus is an extinct genus of flea that represents a transition between primitive stem fleas , and modern species . The type species , S. longipes is found in early Cretaceous strata of Baissa , Siberia . The second species , S. exquisitus , is from the is from the Lower Cretaceous Yixian Formation .  - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.  - A larva (plural \\"larvae\\" ) is a distinct juvenile form many animals undergo before metamorphosis into adults. Animals with indirect development such as insects, amphibians, or cnidarians typically have a larval phase of their life cycle.  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.  - Warm-blooded animal species can maintain a body temperature higher than their environment. In particular, homeothermic species maintain a stable body temperature by regulating metabolic processes. The only known homeotherms are birds and mammals. Other species have various degrees of thermoregulation.  - Fleas are small flightless insects that form the order Siphonaptera. They are external parasites of warm-blooded animals, living by hematophagy off the blood of mammals and birds. The adults are up to about long and usually brown. They are flattened sideways to enable them to move through their host's fur or feathers, and have strong claws to prevent themselves from being dislodged. They are wingless insects, with mouthparts adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood and hind legs adapted for jumping. They can leap a distance of some 50 times their body length, a feat second only to jumps made by froghoppers. The larvae are worm-like with no limbs; they have chewing mouthparts and feed on organic debris.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'parent taxon' with 'siphonaptera'.

The reticulation of a photographic emulsion.","output":"To determine if the term reticulation is used to mean the same thing in these two sentences, let's examine the context and meaning of reticulation in each sentence. 1. The reticulation of a leaf: In the context of a leaf, reticulation refers to the arrangement and branching pattern of veins visible on the leaf surface. It is a network of interconnected veins that provides nutrients and water to different parts of the leaf. 2. The reticulation of a photographic emulsion: In the context of photography, reticulation refers to an effect produced when a film's emulsion layer contracts, often caused by fluctuations in temperature or chemicals during the development process. This effect creates a network of irregular lines and patterns on the photographic image. Now, to compare the meanings: - In both contexts, reticulation refers to a network of interconnected lines or structures. - In the leaf context, reticulation is a natural part of leaf design and serves a biological function. - In the photographic context, reticulation is an effect that occurs during the development process and usually considered an unwanted artifact. Although the term \\"reticulation\\" refers to a network of interconnected lines or structures in both contexts, the nature of those networks is different, and their purposes are not the same.

This has always helped him to win. He wins the first three games. She wins the next game, and the man is surprised. He has never lost to a woman. The old man worries about the way the young woman is playing the game. He can't read her face, he does not understand her way of playing. \\"The way I think about the game\\", says the woman, \\"is that it is steps for getting what I want.\\" Again, the old man is surprised. For him, the game is a way of life itself, and not a model of life. \\"There is no more beauty any longer. Everything is science and rules. Everything is about winning. Nothing is about playing,\\" he says. They cannot agree with each other, but it is not necessary. \\"Change is a necessary part of life\\", thinks the man. \\"Playing is as important as winning\\", thinks the woman. They start to play their final game. Question: . Which of the following is true according to the passage? Options: A: The old man loses the third game to the woman.

Coming off their win over the Cardinals the Chargers flew to Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum for an AFC West division rivalry match against the Raiders. In the first quarter the Chargers' offense had problems when after a three-and-out Mike Scifres' punt was blocked by RB Rock Cartwright out of bounds in the end zone for a safety. Then kicker Sebastian Janikowski made a 50-yard field goal. Then Scifres' punt was blocked again and returned by FS Hiram Eugene 5&#160;yards to the endzone for a touchdown. The Chargers then fought back and took the lead with QB Philip Rivers completing a 19-yard TD pass to TE Antonio Gates. Then RB Mike Tolbert got a 4-yard TD run. Then the Chargers trailed with Janikowski making a 30-yard field goal. But they responded and got the lead back with kicker Nate Kaeding making a 43-yard field goal, followed in the third quarter by Rivers making a 41-yard TD pass to WR Malcolm Floyd. The Raiders replied with QB Jason Campbell completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Zach Miller. Followed in the 4th quarter by Kaeding making a 34-yard field goal.

That's the finding of an extensive study of Dutch men in which deaths from heart disease were more than 50 percent lower among those who consumed  at least an ounce of salt water fish per day than those who never ate fish. The Dutch research is one of three human studies that give strong scientific backing to the long-held belief that eating fish can provide health benefits, particularly to the heart. Heart disease is the number-one killer in the United States , with more than 550, 000 deaths occurring from heart attacks each year . But researchers previously have noticed that the incidence  of heart disease is lower in cultures that consume more fish than Americans do. There are fewer heart disease deaths, for example, among the Eskimos of Greenland, who consume about 14 ounces of fish a day, and among the Japanese, whose daily fish consumption averages more than 3 ounces. During the next two decades, 78 of the men died from heart disease. The fewest deaths were among the group who regularly ate fish, even at levels far lower than those of the Japanese or Eskimos. This relationship was true regardless of other factors such as age , high blood pressure , or blood cholesterol   levels . The passage is mainly about   _  . A) the high incidence of heart disease in some countries B) the changes in people's diet in the United States C) the daily fish consumption of people in different cultures D) the effect of fish eating regularly on people's health A:","output":"The passage primarily discusses D) the effect of eating fish regularly on people's health. It elaborates on the potential health benefits of consuming fish, mainly in terms of heart disease prevention. The main basis for this assertion are the results of a study conducted in the Netherlands, in which a significant decrease in heart disease-related deaths was observed among men who consumed at least an ounce of saltwater fish per day. This relationship between eating fish and lower instances of heart disease aligns with previous observations made by researchers, who noticed fewer cases of heart disease in populations known for a higher fish intake compared to Americans. For instance, the Eskimos of Greenland and the Japanese, both of whom have diets rich in fish, show a significantly lower rate of heart disease incidents. The Eskimos eat approximately 14 ounces of fish per day while the Japanese consume more than 3 ounces daily, on average. Despite the difference in the quantity of fish consumption, all three populations — the Dutch, the Eskimos, and the Japanese — have demonstrated the same pattern. A lower rate of heart disease was associated with eating fish regularly. Notably, this association maintained its validity irrespective of other factors that could potentially influence heart disease like age, high blood pressure, or blood cholesterol levels. The findings of these studies strongly endorsed the long-standing belief that eating fish may provide health benefits, particularly to the heart. This is significant considering that heart disease is the top cause of death in the United States, contributing to over 550,000 deaths each year. Consequently, the assertion stemming from the research that a small piece of fish each day may keep the heart doctor away acts as a crucial takeaway from this passage.  It's important to note that while the passage also mentions the dietary habits of different cultures and the high incidence of heart disease in some countries, these discussions primarily function as supporting details. The core focus remains the impact of regular fish consumption on heart health, making option D the best choice for the main topic of the passage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On one side stand those who see clothes dryers   as a waste of energy and a major polluter of the environment.As a result, they are turning to clotheslines as part of the \\"what-I-can-do environmentalism.\\" On the other side are people who are against drying clothes outside, arguing that clotheslines are unpleasant to look at.They have persuaded Homeowners Associations (HOAs) access the U.S.to ban outdoor clotheslines, because clothesline drying also tends to lower home value in the neighborhood. This has led to a Right-to-Dry Movement that is calling for laws to be passed to protect people's right to use clotheslines.So far, only three states have laws to protect clothesline.Right-to-Dry supporters argue that there should be more. Matt Reck, 37, is the kind of eco-conscious person who feeds his trees with bathwater and reuses water drops from his air conditioners to water plants.His family also uses a clothesline.But on July 9, 2007, the HOA in Wake Forest, North Carolina, told him that a dissatisfied neighbor had telephoned them about his clothesline.The Recks paid no attention to the warning and still dried their clothes on a line in the yard.\\"Many people say they are environmentally friendly but they don't take matters into their own hands,\\" says Reck.The local HOA has decided not to take any action, unless more neighbors come to them. North Carolina lawmakers are saying that banning clotheslines is not the right thing to do.But HOAs and housing businesses believe that clothesline drying reminds people of poor neighborhoods.They worry that if buyers think their future neighbors can't even afford dryers, housing prices will fall.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person that the sheriff admits his identity to?, using the article: Ray Dolezal, a bored Torrance County Deputy Sheriff, is called to the scene of an apparent suicide in the desert. Alongside the body of Bob Spencer is a suitcase containing 500,000.  During the autopsy, they find a digested piece of paper with a phone number; Dolezal, posing as Spencer, calls the number and goes to a meeting, where he is robbed and instructed to meet Gorman Lennox at a restaurant. FBI agent Greg Meeker intercepts Dolezal and informs him that Spencer was an undercover agent. Now that Dolezal has lost the money, Meeker suggests he continue posing as Spencer to recover the money or help arrest Lennox. Dolezal meets Lennox and his wealthy associate Lane Bodine and learns the money is intended for the purchase of unused military weaponry to arm left-wing freedom fighters in South America.  The arms dealers demo the guns for Dolezal and Lennox, but demand an additional 250,000 due to unforeseen expenses; Meeker, unwilling to provide more money, pushes the responsibility on Dolezal, who romances his way into Lane's life so she will attract rich humanitarian donors to fund the deal. Meanwhile, two FBI internal affairs agents suspect Dolezal of killing Spencer and stealing the money. Dolezal is forced to admit to Lane he is not really Spencer, but she agrees to help raise the money because she finds Dolezal a better alternative to the volatile Lennox. Dolezal learns from Noreen, who had an affair with the real Spencer, that he was working with an FBI agent who likely killed him. Noreen runs away at the sight of Meeker and the internal affairs agents grab Dolezal.  Lennox runs the agents off the road; Dolezal flees and returns to Lane.  He discovers Noreen shot dead and a Polaroid of her with Spencer and Meeker., what would be the answer ?

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Enduring Love Movie plot: One fine spring afternoon, Joe (Daniel Craig) and his girlfriend Claire (Samantha Morton) get away for a romantic picnic in the countryside near Oxford. Joe pauses before he surprises Claire by producing a bottle of Dom Perignon. The moment appears portentous, but before Joe can pop the cork and say whatever is on his mind, a huge red hot-air balloon drifts onto the field.A young boy cowers in the basket of the balloon which is being dragged along the ground quickly while an older man, his grandfather, trails behind, pulling on one of the ropes and urging the frightened boy to jump out. Joe races to assist, and he is joined by several other men coming from all directions. It looks like they've got the situation under control, but before the boy can climb out of the basket, the wind picks up, setting the balloon suddenly aloft; the men hang on reflexively. As the balloon rises higher and higher, four men let go one by one, tumbling safely to the ground. They recover from their panic only to realise that one man never let go and is now dangling from the end of a rope hundreds of feet in the air, the balloon still rising and floating away from the field. The group watch in helpless horror as the man finally loses his grip and falls to his death in the distance.While the onlookers all gape in shock, Joe, rational and practical to a fault, decides to walk over to where the man fell and see if anything can be done. One of the men from the group (Rhys Ifans) follows behind him. A grisly sight awaits Joe and the other man, and it is immediately obvious that the man who fell is quite beyond assistance. The man who tagged along suggests that Joe pray with him. Joe resists, grumbling that prayers won't help, but the other man pleads with him until he finally kneels down. Eventually the authorities arrive and everyone leaves the tragic scene.Shortly afterwards, Joe and Claire are dining at the home of their married friends Robin (Bill Nighy) and Rachel (Susan Lynch), retelling the story of what happened on that fateful...

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  In the first print Hogarth introduces Tom Nero, whose surname may have been inspired by the Roman Emperor of the same name or a contraction of \\"No hero\\". Conspicuous in the centre of the plate, he is shown being assisted by other boys to insert an arrow into a dog's rectum, a torture apparently inspired by a devil punishing a sinner in Jacques Callot's Temptation of St. Anthony. An initialled badge on the shoulder of his light-hued and ragged coat shows him to be a pupil of the charity school of the parish of St Giles. Hogarth used this notorious slum area as the background for many of his works including Gin Lane and Noon, part of the Four Times of the Day series. A more tender-hearted boy, perhaps the dog's owner, pleads with Nero to stop tormenting the frightened animal, even offering food in an attempt to appease him. This boy supposedly represents a young George III. His appearance is deliberately more pleasing than the scowling ugly ruffians that populate the rest of the picture, made clear in the text at the bottom of the scene: The other boys carry out equally barbaric acts: the two boys at the top of the steps are burning the eyes out of a bird with a hot needle heated by the link-boy's torch; the boys in the foreground are throwing at a cock (perhaps an allusion to a nationalistic enmity towards the French, and a suggestion that the action takes place on Shrove Tuesday, the traditional day for cock-shying); another boy ties a bone to a dog's tail—tempting, but out of reach; a pair of fighting cats are hung by their tails and taunted by a jeering group of boys; in the bottom left-hand corner a dog is set on a cat, with the latter's intestines spilling out onto the ground; and in the rear of the picture another cat tied to two bladders is thrown from a high window. In a foreshadowing of his ultimate fate, Tom Nero's name is written under the chalk drawing of a man hanging from the gallows; the meaning is made clear by the schoolboy artist pointing towards Tom.

Context: Beginning the Age of Revolution, the American Revolution and the ensuing political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century saw the Thirteen Colonies of North America overthrow the governance of the Parliament of Great Britain, and then reject the British monarchy itself to become the sovereign United States of America. In this period the colonies first rejected the authority of the Parliament to govern them without representation, and formed self-governing independent states. The Second Continental Congress then joined together against the British to defend that self-governance in the armed conflict from 1775 to 1783 known as the American Revolutionary War (also called American War of Independence). The answer to this question is:","output":"The goal of the American Revolutionary War was for the Thirteen Colonies of North America to overthrow the governance of the Parliament of Great Britain, reject the British monarchy, and establish themselves as self-governing, independent states that would ultimately form the sovereign United States of America. This was achieved through the armed conflict from 1775 to 1783 known as the American Revolutionary War or the American War of Independence, which allowed the colonies to defend their self-governance against British attempts to maintain control."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Q: Which lymphoid organ is situated in the upper chest?    Choices:  - thyroid gland  - spleen  - pancreas  - thymus  A: A:","output":"The lymphoid organ situated in the upper chest is the thymus gland. To give you a more detailed understanding of the role and function of the thymus within the human body, let's discuss its location, structure, and function, as well as compare it to the other options listed.  1. Thymus gland Location: The thymus gland is a bilobed structure found in the anterior superior mediastinum, which is situated in the upper chest region between the lungs. It lies behind the sternum and in front of the heart, and it is positioned predominantly above the heart level. The thymus is more prominent and larger in children and starts to shrink and become less active as one ages. Structure: The thymus gland is comprised of two lobes, each with numerous lobules. These lobules are separated by connective tissue. The thymus has an outer cortex that is dense with immature T cells, and an inner medulla with fewer mature T cells and epithelial cells.  Function: The thymus plays a critical role in the development and maturation of T cells, which are essential for the immune system to help defend the body against infections and diseases. It is in the thymus where T cells are \\"trained\\" to identify and eliminate foreign pathogens and avoid attacking the body's own cells. 2. Thyroid gland Location: The thyroid gland is located in the neck, just below the larynx, and wraps around the front of the trachea. Function: It produces hormones that regulate metabolism, growth, and development, specifically thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). 3. Spleen Location: The spleen is located in the upper left quadrant of the abdominal cavity, beneath the diaphragm and tucked between the 9th and 11th ribs. Function: The spleen acts as a blood filter, removing old, damaged, and infected red blood cells from circulation. It also stores and recycles iron from red blood cells and produces antibodies against bacteria. 4. Pancreas Location: The pancreas is located in the upper abdominal cavity, behind the stomach and adjacent to the duodenum (the first section of the small intestine). Function: The pancreas is a dual-function gland, acting as both an exocrine gland (producing and secreting digestive enzymes) and an endocrine gland (producing and secreting hormones, such as insulin and glucagon, which regulate blood glucose levels). In conclusion, the lymphoid organ situated in the upper chest is the thymus gland. It plays a vital role in the development and maturation of T cells, which are crucial for the immune system to protect the body against infections and diseases. The thyroid gland, spleen, and pancreas are other vital organs with differing functions, but they are not located in the upper chest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She is the 2010 Olympic silver medalist, a three-time World champion (2008, 2010, 2014), a three-time Four Continents champion (2008, 2010, 2013), and a four-time Grand Prix Final champion (2005-06, 2008-09, 2012-13, 2013-14). She is the only female figure skater who has landed three triple Axel jumps in one competition, which she achieved at the 2010 Winter Olympics. Context: Asada moved from Japan to the United States in August 2006 to train with Rafael Arutyunyan in Lake Arrowhead, California. There she was able to escape the overcrowding of Japanese rinks and the pressure of the Japanese media.  At her first event, the 2006 Skate America, Asada won the bronze medal behind Miki Ando and Kimmie Meissner. Asada had won the short program, but was fourth in the free skating, finishing with a total score 171.23 points. She was 21.36 points out of first place. Asada won her second event, the 2006 NHK Trophy with 199.52 points, setting the highest combined score in a Ladies' competition under the ISU Judging System and consequently, a world record. Her margin of victory was 20.21 points ahead of silver medalist Fumie Suguri. Asada went into the 2006-07 Grand Prix Final as the reigning champion. She placed second with 172.52 points, 11.68 behind gold medalist Yuna Kim. Asada had won the short program, but placed fourth in the free skating.  Asada won the 2006-07 Japan Championships by 26.11 points ahead of silver medalist Miki Ando. At the 2007 Worlds Championships, Asada was fifth in the short program, 10.03 points behind Yuna Kim, who placed first in that section of the competition with a score of 71.95 points, setting a new world record for the highest short program score. Asada won the free skating with a score of 133.13 points, setting a new world record for the highest free skating score, a record which stood for eight months. During her free skating, she successfully landed a triple axel, a triple flip-triple loop combination, a double axel, a triple lutz, a triple flip, and a triple lutz-double loop-double loop combination but under-rotated the second jump of a double axel-triple toe loop combination. She won the silver medal at her first Senior World Championships appearance, earning an overall of 194.95 points, 0.64 behind gold medalist Miki Ando and 8.31 ahead of Yuna Kim, who won the bronze. Question: so in this time season did she win anything big. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, during that time season, Mao Asada won some big competitions.

Which language is this?","output":"The language you're asking about is Turkish. Turkish is a language spoken mainly in Turkey and Cyprus, but also in other countries where Turkish communities exist, such as in Balkan countries. It belongs to the Turkic branch of languages and has about 80 million native speakers worldwide. It is written in the Latin script, modified with various diacritics for Turkish sounds.  This Turkish text talks about certain statistics provided by a company named Promocija Plus. The text discusses the sales of new cars in Croatia during the period January through May as estimated by the firm. The subject matter of the text, relating to auto sales in a specific time period, suggests it might come from a financial or business publication or report.  Some unique characteristics of Turkish language are agglutination and vowel harmony. Agglutination means words in Turkish often consist of a base word to which various suffixes are added to indicate tense, mood, indirect/direct objects etc. Vowel harmony is a significant grammatical feature in the Turkish language where the vowels in a word should harmonically correspond to each other depending on their position. Also, the sentence structure of Turkish is Subject-Object-Verb, while in English it is Subject-Verb-Object. Learning Turkish can be a challenge for those who are unaccustomed to agglutinative languages, but it offers interesting insights into a culture and history that has been influential in both the Eastern and Western world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3. Q: Question: In what years was William Temple governor? Passage 1:In 1998, Helmut Rix put forward the view that Etruscan is related to other members of what he called the \\"Tyrsenian language family\\". Rix's Tyrsenian family of languages—composed of Raetic, anciently spoken in the eastern Alps, and Lemnian, together with Etruscan—has gained acceptance among scholars. Rix's Tyrsenian family has been confirmed by Stefan Schumacher, Norbert Oettinger, Carlo De Simone, and Simona Marchesini. Common features between Etruscan, Raetic, and Lemnian have been found in morphology, phonology, and syntax. On the other hand, lexical correspondences are rarely documented, due to the scant number of Raetic and Lemnian texts, and, above all, due to the very ancient date at which these languages split, because the split must have taken place before the Bronze Age. The Tyrsenian family, or Common Tyrrhenic, in this case is often considered to be Paleo-European and to predate the arrival of Indo-European languages in southern Europe. Several scholars believe that the Lemnian language could have arrived in the Aegean Sea during the Late Bronze Age, when Mycenaean rulers recruited groups of mercenaries from Sicily, Sardinia and various parts of the Italian peninsula. Scholars such as Norbert Oettinger, Michel Gras and Carlo De Simone think that the Lemnian is the testimony of an Etruscan piratesque or commercial settlement on the island that took place before 700 BC, not related to the Sea Peoples.  Passage 2:A vast number of artifacts have been discovered from ancient Mesopotamia depicting explicit heterosexual sex. Glyptic art from the Sumerian Early Dynastic Period frequently shows scenes of frontal sex in the missionary position. In Mesopotamian votive plagues from the early second millennium BC, the man is usually shown entering the woman from behind while she bends over, drinking beer through a straw. Middle Assyrian lead votive figurines often represent the man standing and penetrating the woman as she rests on top of an altar. Scholars have traditionally interpreted all these depictions as scenes of ritual sex, but they are more likely to be associated with the cult of Inanna, the goddess of sex and prostitution. Many sexually explicit images were found in the temple of Inanna at Assur, which also contained models of male and female sexual organs, including stone phalli, which may have been worn around the neck as an amulet or used to decorate cult statues, and clay models of the female vulva.  Passage 3:After the election of Abraham Lincoln and the secession of the Confederate states, Temple took a position opposing the enforced restoration of the Union, and joined the Democratic Party. After presiding over a futile \\"Peace Convention\\" in Dover in June 1861, he became the Democratic candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in the hotly contested and controversial 1862 election. His opponent was the incumbent Republican George P. Fisher, who had served as Secretary of State when Temple was governor. Now Fisher was convinced that there were various schemes being planned to prevent a legitimate election. Accordingly, he requested that Abraham Lincoln leave the Delaware troops in the U.S. Army home until after the election, and that he send additional Federal troops to supervise the polls on election day. The Democrats were outraged and managed to narrowly elect Temple and a majority in the General Assembly, although losing the governorship. While officially a member of the U.S. House from March 4, 1863, Temple died before the December convening of the House, and consequently never actually served. He was forty-nine years old. In a subsequent special election, Republican Nathaniel B. Smithers won the seat due to a Democratic Party boycott of the election in protest of the continuing presence of Federal troops at the polling places.

Recognizing the potential benefits that aligning with the world's second-largest economy may bring, French Polynesia's leaders hope to explore economic and cultural opportunities. One of the key areas where both nations can benefit is in trade cooperation. As French Polynesia possesses abundant natural resources, and China continues to assert itself as a major market player, there is immense opportunity to showcase their respective strengths. The establishment of trade relations could greatly benefit both parties, with French Polynesia's products entering the vastly populated Chinese market, and Chinese investments potentially fueling Polynesian economic growth. Cultural exchange is another crucial aspect of enhanced cooperation. Learning from one another's culture can bolster diplomatic ties and create lasting international understanding. Expanding tourism initiatives, student exchange programs, and even joint cultural events can provide a platform for mutual learning and appreciation. Encouraging collaboration in technology and innovation, with a focus on sustainable development and environmental protection, is another area where French Polynesia and China can work together. French Polynesia has a vested interest in preserving its pristine natural environment and sustainable practices.

A). a mirror is unable to be dark; B). phone screens are barely reflective; C). a lilac door is easily seen; D). a black door is easily seen;","output":"The ability to reflect light is indeed influenced by the lightness in color of an object. Before diving into the multiple-choice options, let’s first understand the fundamentals of color, light, and reflectivity. Color is a visual characteristic of objects which results from the interaction of light with the surface of the object. When light interacts with an object, the object absorbs some wavelengths of light and reflects the rest. The color of an object primarily depends on the wavelengths of light it reflects. A lighter-colored object tends to reflect more wavelengths of light than a darker-colored object, which absorbs more wavelengths. With this background information, let’s analyze the choices you provided: A). A mirror is unable to be dark; This statement is true. Mirrors are designed to reflect a high percentage of incoming light. They have a silver or aluminum coating with minimal color, which enables them to efficiently reflect light without influencing the frequency of the reflected light. B). Phone screens are barely reflective; This statement is primarily true. Phone screens are designed to have minimal reflectivity to ensure clear visibility of the displayed content, even in bright surroundings. Some screens have an anti-reflective coating to reduce the reflection of light, thus minimizing glare. C). A lilac door is easily seen; This statement is true, as lighter colors like lilac tend to reflect more light than darker colors. A lilac door will be more visible, particularly in low-light conditions when compared to a darker-colored door. The increased reflectivity leads to better visibility and recognition. D). A black door is easily seen; This statement is less accurate. A black door will not be as easy to see as a lighter-colored door. Black objects have a higher tendency to absorb all wavelengths of light and, as a result, reflect very little light. In low-light or shaded situations, a black door will generally be less visible and noticeable than a lighter-colored door that has better light-reflecting properties. In conclusion, as the lightness in color of an object increases, the ability of that object to reflect light will increase. Among the choices you provided, options A, B, and C are more aligned with this concept, as they illustrate the relationship between lightness, reflectivity, and visibility. Choice D does not align with this principle, as it states that a black door is easily seen; however, darker colors, like black, tend to have lower visibility due to their minimal light reflection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: When Howard Ceter peered through the dusty air of Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922 and, in his own words,  wonderful things  met his eyes, he confirmed the immeasurable wealth of the Pharaohs, and when the backer of the dig, Lord Carnarvon, died suddenly only a few months later, vox populi blamed it on the curse of the Pharaohs mummy and Hollywood was quick to feed our fantasies. Hypothesis: Ceter explored Tutankhamun's tomb. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"Yes, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. Let me explain it in a simple way. Premise: In 1922, a man named Howard Ceter looked inside Tutankhamun's hidden room, and saw lots of amazing treasures. People thought the Pharaohs, like Tutankhamun, had many valuable things, and this proved it. Later, another man, Lord Carnarvon, who helped pay for this exploring, died suddenly. Many people thought it was because of a curse from the mummy, and movies loved this idea. Hypothesis: Ceter visited Tutankhamun's special room. So, the main story tells us that Ceter did explore Tutankhamun's room.

Deshabandu Muttiah Muralitharan (Tamil: muttaiyaa murlliitrnnn, Sinhalese: muttyiyaa murlidrn; also spelt Muralidaran; born 17 April 1972) is a former Sri Lankan cricketer who was rated the greatest Test match bowler ever by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 2002. He retired from Test cricket in 2010, registering his 800th and final wicket on 22 July 2010 from his final ball in his last Test match. Muralitharan holds the world record for the most wickets in both test and one-day cricket. On 7 July 2010, Muttiah Muralitharan formally announced his retirement from Test cricket at a media briefing in Colombo. He confirmed that the first Test Match against India due to commence on 18 July, 2010 would be his last, but indicated that he was willing to play One-Day Internationals if it was considered necessary leading up to the 2011 World Cup, which Sri Lanka co-hosted. He identified Sri Lanka's World Cup win of 1996 as his greatest moment as a cricketer. He also stated that there were some regrets during his 19-year playing career. \\"Not winning Test Matches in South Africa, Australia and India are regrets. But I am sure we will win very soon.\\"  At the start of his last match, Muralitharan was eight short of 800 wickets. At the fall of the ninth wicket of the Indian's second innings Muralitharan still needed one wicket to reach the milestone. After 90 minutes of resistance Muralitharan was able to dismiss the last Indian batsman Pragyan Ojha on the last delivery of the final over of his Test career. By doing so he became the only bowler to reach 800 wickets in Test cricket. Sri Lanka won the match by 10 wickets, the seventh time they have done so and the second time they have done it against India.  In late 2010, Muralitharan announced his retirement from international cricket after 2011 Cricket World Cup, co-hosted by Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka announcing \\"This World Cup will be my last outing. I am retiring totally from international cricket thereafter. My time is up. I've signed up to play for two years in IPL.\\" His final ODI appearance in Sri Lankan soil came during the semi0final clash against New Zealand, where Muralitharan took the wicket of Scott Styris in his last delivery. His last ODI was against India in World Cup final at Mumbai, however Sri Lanka lost the match and Murali couldn't take any wicket. who won his last game","output":"Muttiah Muralitharan's last Test match was won by Sri Lanka.

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: -  Magma comes up to the surface of the earth - The magma cools - Particles inside the magma move closer together - Crystals are formed A:","output":"A: The final step of the process after magma comes up to the surface of the earth, cools, particles inside the magma move closer together, and crystals are formed is the formation of igneous rocks. To elaborate, the process can be broken down into the following steps: 1. Magma generation: Magma is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles, and solid minerals that forms beneath the Earth's surface. It is generated when rocks in the Earth's mantle partially melt due to various factors, such as increased temperature, pressure changes, or the presence of water. This process can happen at mid-ocean ridges, subduction zones, and hotspots. 2. Magma ascent: The magma formed in the mantle rises towards the Earth's surface through fractures, faults, or other pathways due to its lower density compared to the surrounding solid rocks. This ascent can also be facilitated by the pressure exerted by buoyant gases dissolved in the magma. 3. Magma intrusion or extrusion: Upon reaching the Earth's surface, the magma either intrudes into the crust and solidifies below the surface, forming intrusive igneous rocks, or it is extruded onto the surface as lava, leading to the formation of extrusive igneous rocks. Volcanic eruptions can result from the extrusion process. 4. Cooling and solidification: As the magma cools, whether it is still below the Earth's surface or has been extruded as lava, it begins to solidify. The rate of cooling affects the size of the crystals formed in this process. Slow cooling typically results in larger crystals, while rapid cooling leads to smaller crystals or even glassy textures with no visible crystals. 5. Particle movement and crystal formation: With the cooling of magma, the particles in the once-molten material start moving closer together as thermal energy is lost. As they reach their saturation points, minerals start precipitating and form crystals. This process is known as crystallization. Different minerals crystallize at different temperatures and rates, leading to the variation in the composition and appearance of the resulting igneous rocks. 6. Igneous rock formation: The final step in this process is the formation of igneous rocks. These rocks are classified based on their mineral composition, crystal size (which is related to the rate of cooling), and whether they are intrusive (formed below Earth's surface) or extrusive (formed above the Earth's surface). Common examples of igneous rocks include granite, basalt, and obsidian. In conclusion, the final step of the process that starts with magma coming up to the surface of the Earth and eventually forming crystals is the formation of igneous rocks, which are characterized by their diverse characteristics and textures that are highly dependent on the conditions under which they were formed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who sang with Roy in Mendelssohn's Elijah? from the following article ?  Ferrier gave her first London recital on 28 December 1942 at the National Gallery, in a lunch-time concert organised by Dame Myra Hess. Although she wrote \\"went off very well\\" in her diary, Ferrier was disappointed with her performance, and concluded that she needed further voice training. She approached the distinguished baritone Roy Henderson with whom, a week previously, she had sung in Mendelssohn's Elijah. Henderson agreed to teach her, and was her regular voice coach for the remainder of her life. He later explained that her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat: \\"one could have shot a fair-sized apple right to the back of the throat without obstruction\\". However, this natural physical advantage was not in itself enough to ensure the quality of her voice; this was due, Henderson says, to \\"her hard work, artistry, sincerity, personality and above all her character\\". Ferrier's performances in the Glyndebourne run, which began on 12 July 1946, earned her favourable reviews, although the opera itself was less well received. On the provincial tour which followed the festival it failed to attract the public and incurred heavy financial losses. By contrast, when the opera reached Amsterdam it was greeted warmly by the Dutch audiences who showed particular enthusiasm for Ferrier's performance. This was Ferrier's first trip abroad, and she wrote an excited letter to her family: \\"The cleanest houses and windows you ever did see, and flowers in the fields all the way!\\" Following her success as Lucretia she agreed to return to Glyndebourne in 1947, to sing Orfeo in Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice. She had often sung Orfeo's aria Che farò (\\"What is life\\") as a concert piece, and had recently recorded it with Decca. At Glyndebourne, Ferrier's limited acting abilities caused some difficulties in her relationship with the conductor, Fritz Stiedry; nevertheless her performance on the first night, 19 June 1947, attracted warm critical praise.Ferrier's association... The answer to this question is:","output":"The last name of the person who sang with Roy in Mendelssohn's Elijah is Ferrier.

Do these questions have the same meaning? What is the latest format of writing a leave application in school by self? How do I write application for school leaving certificate? Select from: A). no. B). yes.","output":"A). No. These questions do not have the same meaning. Let me explain the difference between the two questions: 1. The first question, \\"What is the latest format of writing a leave application in school by self?\\" is asking for information on the most current and widely accepted format for writing a leave application in school. A leave application is a formal request made by a student to the school's administration or teacher for temporarily being absent from school due to personal reasons such as illness, family emergency, or any other justifiable cause. The latest format for writing a leave application typically includes: a. Your name and relevant personal details b. The date of writing the application c. The name and designation of the person you are addressing the letter to d. A subject line that briefly states your request for leave e. The body of the letter, which should describe the reason for your leave request and the duration of your absence f. A closing statement expressing gratitude for considering your request, and any necessary contact information during your leave g. Your signature or name at the end of the application 2. The second question, \\"How do I write an application for a school leaving certificate?\\" is asking for guidance on how to write a formal request to obtain a school leaving certificate. A school leaving certificate is a document that serves as proof that a student has completed their studies, withdrawn from a school, or is transferring to another institution. To write an application for a school leaving certificate, you would typically need to include: a. Your name and relevant personal details b. The date of writing the application c. The name and designation of the person you are addressing the letter to (e.g., the principal or head of the institution) d. A subject line that states your request for a school leaving certificate e. The body of the letter, which should explain the reason why you need the certificate (e.g., transferring to another school, completion of studies, etc.) and provide any necessary details such as enrollment dates and courses completed f. A closing statement expressing gratitude for considering your request g. Your signature or name at the end of the application In summary, while both questions deal with writing formal requests in a school context, they refer to different types of requests. The first question deals with applying for leave from school, while the second question pertains to obtaining a school leaving certificate."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - x86 is a family of backward compatible instruction set architectures based on the Intel 8086 CPU and its Intel 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \\"x86\\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \\"86\\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors.  - DOS , short for \\"disk operating system\\", is an acronym used to describe the family of several very similar command-line computer operating systems for x86-based computers: primarily MS-DOS and PC DOS, but also DR-DOS, FreeDOS, ROM-DOS, and PTS-DOS. None of these systems were officially named \\"DOS\\", and indeed \\"DOS\\" is a general term for disk operating system.  - ELF Corporation ( or élf) was an eroge studio. One of its most popular games is \\"Dkysei\\", a pioneering dating sim, which has had a sequel, and been turned into video and TV series. The character design of the main villains from the \\"-saku\\" series is the company mascot. They are also known for role-playing video games such as the \\"Dragon Knight\\" series and visual novel adventure games such as \\"YU-NO\\".  - Dragon Knight II (II) is a fantasy-themed eroge role-playing video game in the \\"Dragon Knight\\" franchise that was originally developed and published by ELF Corporation in 1990-1991 only in Japan as the first sequel to the original \\"Dragon Knight\\" from 1989. The game is an erotic dungeon crawler in which a young warrior Takeru fights to lift a witch's curse that has turned girls into monsters.   - MSX is the name of a standardized home computer architecture, first announced by Microsoft on June 16, 1983, and marketed by Kazuhiko Nishi, then Vice-president at Microsoft Japan and Director at ASCII Corporation. Microsoft conceived the project as an attempt to create unified standards among various hardware makers of the period.  - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, It is lying off the eastern coast of the Asia Mainland (east of China, Korea, Russia) and stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and near Taiwan in the southwest.   - An is a Japanese pornographic video game. History. Japanese eroge, also known as H-Light novels or hentai games, have their origins in the early 1980s, when Japanese companies introduced their own brands of microcomputer to compete with those of the United States. Competing systems included the Sharp X1, Fujitsu FM-7, MSX, and NEC PC-8801. NEC was behind its competitors in terms of hardware (with only 16 colors and no sound support) and needed a way to regain control of the market. Thus came the erotic game. The first commercial erotic computer game, \\"Night Life\\", was released by Koei in 1982. It was an early graphic adventure, with sexually explicit images. That same year, Koei released another erotic title, \\"Danchi Tsuma no Yuwaku\\" (\\"Seduction of the Condominium Wife\\"), which was an early role-playing adventure game with colour graphics, owing to the eight-color palette of the NEC PC-8001 computer. It became a hit, helping Koei become a major software company.  - A microcomputer is a small, relatively inexpensive computer with a microprocessor as its central processing unit (CPU). It includes a microprocessor, memory, and minimal input/output (I/O) circuitry mounted on a single printed circuit board. Microcomputers became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors. The predecessors to these computers, mainframes and minicomputers, were comparatively much larger and more expensive (though indeed present-day mainframes such as the IBM System z machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their CPUs). Many microcomputers (when equipped with a keyboard and screen for input and output) are also personal computers (in the generic sense).  - MS-DOS (; acronym for \\"Microsoft Disk Operating System\\") is a discontinued operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. It was the most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems, and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system by Microsoft Corporation.  - A disk operating system (abbreviated DOS) is a computer operating system that can use a disk storage device, such as a floppy disk, hard disk drive, or optical disc. A disk operating system must provide a file system for organizing, reading, and writing files on the storage disk. Strictly speaking, this definition does not apply to current generations operating systems, such as versions of Microsoft Windows in use, while this definition is actually only used for older generations of operating systems.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, and in the past was also known as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country.  - Koei Co., Ltd. is a Japanese video game publisher, developer, and distributor founded in 1978. The company is known for its historical simulation games based on the novel \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\", as well as simulation games based on pseudo-historical events.  - FreeDOS (formerly Free-DOS and PD-DOS) is a free operating system for IBM PC compatible computers. It intends to provide a complete DOS-compatible environment for running legacy software and supporting embedded systems.  - Knights of Xentar is an eroge role - playing video game published for the PC DOS in North America by Megatech Software in 1995 and has been originally published as Dragon Knight III in Japan in 1991 . It is part of the Dragon Knight series of games created by Japanese game developer ELF , who originally released the game for the NEC PC - 8801 computer in 1991 , followed by ports for the Sharp X68000 and PC Engine CD platforms .

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Question: A woodworker is missing a screw, where should he look for it? Options: - tool box - wall outlet fixture - on the ground - motorcycle - computer  The answer is \\"tool box\\" because The answer is:","output":"\\"tool box\\" because a woodworker's primary responsibility involves working with various tools and components to create, repair or refine wooden items. These tasks often require the use of different types, sizes, and styles of screws to ensure a strong and secure connection between wooden parts. The tool box is an essential storage space where woodworkers keep their hand tools, power tools, and other woodworking necessities, including screws, nuts, and bolts, making it the most logical and convenient place to look for a missing screw. Furthermore, the other options are not suitable for the following reasons: - Wall outlet fixture: Although it may sometimes contain screws, it is an unlikely place for a woodworker to find the exact screw they need, as it is unrelated to their tasks and the screws in wall outlets tend to be specifically designed for electrical work. - On the ground: While it is possible to find a missing screw on the ground, especially if it had fallen during a woodworking session, this option does not guarantee that the woodworker will find the right screw for their needs, as it may have gotten mixed up with other unrelated items, debris, or dirt. Additionally, searching on the ground may consume more time and effort than simply checking the tool box. - Motorcycle: A motorcycle is entirely unrelated to woodworking, and the screws found on it are typically designed for use in a vehicle’s components, meaning they may not be suitable for the woodworker's project. Therefore, searching through a motorcycle for the missing screw is both an inefficient and impractical solution. - Computer: Much like the motorcycle, a computer harbors screws designed for electronics and computer components. These screws are typically smaller and not intended for woodworking applications. Searching for the missing screw within a computer would be an inappropriate and unproductive approach, potentially causing damage to the computer components as well. In conclusion, the answer \\"tool box\\" is the most appropriate response given the context of a woodworker's needs. A tool box serves as the primary storage for woodworking tools and materials, making it the go-to place for locating a missing screw. Other options listed may serve as distractions or time-consuming alternatives that lead the woodworker further away from the optimal solution."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

The major time divisions of classical music up to 1900 are the early music period, which includes Medieval (500–1400) and Renaissance (1400–1600) eras, and the Common practice period, which includes the Baroque (1600–1750), Classical (1750–1830) and Romantic (1804–1910) eras.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements:  Now, I have a new situation: John is an amateur astronomer. Last week he was observing the sky with his telescope. First he pointed his telescope at planet Mars. He noted it as case A. Then he pointed his telescope to planet Jupiter, which is farther form the Sun than Mars is. He noted it as case C. Finally, he pointed the telescope to a faraway planet called WASP-17b. He noted that as case B.  Answer this question please: Which case would see faster movement, case A or case C? Answer:","output":"In this situation, case A would see faster movement. This is because Mars is closer to the Sun than Jupiter, and as a result, it has a shorter orbital period and moves at a higher speed in its orbit. According to Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. In simpler terms, this means that the closer a planet is to its star, the faster it moves in its orbit. In case A, John observes Mars, which is at a distance of approximately 227.9 million kilometers from the Sun and has an orbital period of about 687 Earth days. In case C, he observes Jupiter, which is located approximately 778.3 million kilometers from the Sun and has an orbital period of about 4,332.59 Earth days. Due to Mars' closer proximity to the Sun, it moves faster in its orbit compared to Jupiter.

Here are three rules for chop shopping. Size It Up: While professional chefs wield 12-inch blades with abandon, home cooks should get a knife with a blade around 8 inches in length. Residential-kitchen counters, nonindustrial cutting boards, and civilian muscles can't handle anything much bigger than that. Weigh In: Before you buy, consider how you tend to use a knife in the kitchen. If your idea of a good time is spending 20 minutes chopping vegetables into a fine brunoise or breaking down a brace of hens, then go with a heavy knife that can take the action. If you slice and dice only when you need to, a light knife can be just right. Get a Grip: Heft a few knives for comparison. You want a handle that's secure in your fingers, neither too big nor too small. You'll know when you find the right one—it'll feel like a natural extension of your arm. Stick To It: If you're going to buy a beautiful knife, why not show it off on a magnetic knife bar, like the one above? It's more space-efficient than a block, and it's easier to keep clean. Grundtal magnetic knife rack by Ikea, 9, ikea.com Unlike traditional Western knives, which are sharpened on both sides of the blade, Japanese-inspired Gyutous are sharpened on just one side for right- or left-handed cooks. Perhaps the most fetishized style among knife geeks (including Del Posto's Mark Ladner, who chopped Mario Batali's team to victory with a Glestain Gyutou on Iron Chef America), the Gyutou's blade is insanely sharp, but fragile. Use it only on softer cutting boards like those made from wood or cork.

Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What does the Case for Colorblind Justice recommend with respect to affirmative action? Context: Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \\"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147 Answer:","output":"The Case for Colorblind Justice recommends ending affirmative action, as it believes that the policy has unintended consequences and can lead to feelings of self-doubt, entitlement, and increased competition, rather than promoting equal opportunity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a short passage that may convey stereotype, anti-stereotype, or is unrelated. A stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against a common stereotype. The passage is unrelated if it does not convey a stereotype or anti-stereotype. You are expected to classify the passage into three classes: stereotype, anti-stereotype, and unrelated. Problem:Passage: Are those the people from Yemen? Rain drops on roses. Solution:","output":"Step 1: Read and understand the passage I will read the passage to make sure I understand the context and the message it is conveying. In this passage, there are two distinct sentences, one mentioning people from Yemen, and the other about raindrops on roses. Step 2: Identify any stereotypes or anti-stereotypes The next step is to identify if any sentence conveys a stereotype or anti-stereotype.  - Sentence 1: \\"Are those the people from Yemen?\\" This sentence mentions people from Yemen but does not explicitly convey any stereotype or anti-stereotype about them. - Sentence 2: \\"Rain drops on roses.\\" This sentence talks about raindrops and roses, which is unrelated to any group of people or stereotypes. Step 3: Determine the classification After analyzing both sentences, it can be concluded that the passage does not contain any stereotype or anti-stereotype. Instead, it appears to be a combination of unrelated sentences. The first sentence mentions people from Yemen but doesn't assign any generalized belief or assumption about them, and the second sentence is completely unrelated to the topic of stereotypes. Solution: The passage should be classified as \\"unrelated\\" since it does not convey a stereotype or anti-stereotype."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","output":"Title: The Cabin's Secret Genre: Mystery/Thriller Plot: Act 1: The story begins with the protagonist, Chris Vaughan, receiving a mysterious letter from his long-lost cousin, Larry. The letter reveals that Larry has inherited an old cabin in the mountains from their late uncle, and he invites Chris to join him for a weekend getaway. Chris, seeking an escape from his mundane life, decides to take Larry up on the offer, despite not seeing him for years. Unbeknownst to Chris, he is about to embark on a harrowing journey rooted deep in their family's dark past.  Act 2: Upon arriving at the cabin, Chris can't shake the feeling that something is off about the seemingly charming but increasingly secretive Larry. Chris begins noticing strange occurrences around the cabin, such as items moving on their own and unsettling noises during the night. As Chris delves deeper into this mysterious place, he stumbles upon a hidden room filled with cryptic journals, old family photos, and newspaper clippings detailing the unsolved disappearances of several people, all linked to the very same cabin.  As tension mounts, Chris questions Larry about the unsettling discoveries, who initially tries to play it off as old family history. However, persistent in his search for the truth, Chris uncovers evidence that suggests a malevolent presence haunting the cabin, connected to their family lineage. The more Chris learns, the more signs point to Larry's involvement in the recent string of unexplained events.  Act 3: The relationship between Chris and Larry takes a dark turn, as Chris starts uncovering the horrifying truth. Larry, who exhibits increasingly erratic behavior, confesses that he was drawn to the cabin by the same evil presence that tormented their ancestors, compelling him to carry out a sinister plan. Through the power of this presence, Larry has been luring unsuspecting victims to the cabin and is responsible for their subsequent disappearances. In a shocking twist, it is revealed that Larry's real target is Chris, intending to sacrifice him to the malevolent force.  A gripping final showdown ensues, with Chris fighting for his life against his treacherous cousin. As the presence grows stronger and consumes Larry, Chris manages to narrowly escape the cabin, setting it ablaze in a desperate attempt to end the evil once and for all. The movie ends with Chris, forever changed by the harrowing ordeal, seeking to piece his life back together -- only to find a cryptic message suggesting that the malevolent force might still be lurking somewhere out there, waiting for its next victim."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The reviewer acknowledges that the device is convenient, easy to use, and reasonably priced, which can be seen as positive elements of the review.

However, the review's focus on the display issue makes the overall tone of the review negative. The reviewer states that the display is hard to read and nearly unusable under certain lighting conditions, implying dissatisfaction with the product's primary function. Moreover, they mention that the backlight feature, intended to resolve the display issue, is inadequate, making it evident that they consider this to be a significant problem with the product. Thus, while the review does mention some positive aspects of the chord finder unit, the emphasis on the unsatisfactory display quality makes the overall tone of the review negative.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump says he may veto a 1.3 trillion spending bill because it does not offer protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived as children and does not fully fund the border wall. In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

How many Pins does Pinterest see per day? OPT:  a). no;  b). yes; The answer is:","output":"b). yes; Both questions are fundamentally asking about the number of Pins that are created or interacted with on Pinterest in a single day. The main difference in the phrasing is that the first question uses the phrasing \\"how many pins on Pinterest per day\\", while the second question says \\"how many Pins does Pinterest see per day\\". The first question's phrasing might lead someone to believe it is asking how many pins are created per day. However, the second question's phrasing is broader, asking about the number of pins that Pinterest \\"sees\\" or encounters in a given day. This could include the pins that are created, saved, or interacted with throughout the platform. But despite the subtle differences in phrasing, answers to both questions effectively represent the daily engagement of Pins within the Pinterest ecosystem. To get a clearer understanding of the daily engagement, Pins on Pinterest per day can be categorized into three groups: pins that are created, pins that are saved, and pins that are interacted with. Created pins refer to new content being added to the platform, while saved pins imply Pins that users have pinned to their boards for future reference or use. Lastly, interacted pins indicate each time a user clicks, comments, or engages with any pin in any way. It's important to note that specific numbers for these values might not be easily available since they can fluctuate greatly due to various factors such as user base and platform updates. Nonetheless, considering these three categories of Pins could provide a clearer understanding of the volume and engagement of Pins on Pinterest each day. However, both questions seek information about the daily activity of Pins on the platform, making them essentially the same question despite the minor differences in the wording.

If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does.

Paragraph: Water flowing over Earths surface or underground causes erosion and deposition. Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. How water transports particles depends on their size. When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment. This process starts with the largest particles first. Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain. It picks up sediment. Runoff carries most of the sediment to bodies of water. Mountain streams erode narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers create broad floodplains and meanders. Deposition by streams and rivers may form alluvial fans and deltas. Floodwaters may deposit natural levees. Erosion and deposition by groundwater can form caves and sinkholes. Stalactites and stalagmites are mineral deposits. They build up in caves as water continues to drip.

Roman engineering genius was particularly evident in the construction of roads, aqueducts, and monuments in the Iberian peninsula. Hypothesis: 1. Rome conquered the Iberian peninsula. 2. Rome forced its culture on the people of the Iberian peninsula. Step 1: Compare the components - Premise (1) has some correlation to Hypothesis (2), as a decisive imprint on language, culture, and government suggests significant influence from Rome. - Premise (2) doesn't directly relate to either part of the hypothesis, but the widespread presence of Roman engineering contributions can also imply a deeper level of Roman influence. Step 2: Analyze the relationships - Although the premise clearly states that Rome had a major impact on the Iberian peninsula, it doesn't explicitly mention conquest or the forceful imposition of Roman culture on the inhabitants. - The premise also suggests that Roman influence was more significant in certain areas like engineering, but doesn't specify any other areas where their influence was significantly felt. Step 3: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis - Based on the comparison and analysis, the premise doesn't fully entail the hypothesis. While there is an indication of strong Roman influence, the premise doesn't provide enough information to determine whether Rome actually conquered the Iberian peninsula or forcefully imposed its culture on the local population.

The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council.

In which US State did the Salem witch trials take place?","output":"The Salem Witch Trials took place in the state of Massachusetts, specifically in the towns of Salem Village (now Danvers) and Salem Town (present-day Salem), located in Essex County. These infamous trials occurred during a period of mass hysteria from early 1692 to May 1693. During this time, both Salem Village and Salem Town were part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, which was one of the thirteen original English colonies that later formed the United States of America. The trials are a notable and dark episode in American colonial history, involving a series of hearings and prosecutions of approximately 200 people accused of practicing witchcraft or possessing supernatural powers. The Salem Witch Trials were initiated after a group of young girls in Salem Village exhibited bizarre and unexplainable mood swings, bodily contortions, and verbal outbursts. The local physician, unable to diagnose a medical cause for these symptoms, concluded that the girls were the victims of witchcraft. As a result, accusations and paranoia spread rapidly in the tight-knit Puritan community. This led to the establishment of a special court that presided over the hearings and trials of those accused of witchcraft. The events surrounding Salem Witch Trials have been extensively documented and studied by historians, who attribute the mass hysteria to a combination of factors. Some factors include extreme religious beliefs and practices, the effects of local political and economic disputes, poor understanding of mental health and neurological conditions, and some even explore the potential impact of widespread rye consumption contaminated with hallucinogenic ergot fungus. Tragically, the trials led to the execution of 20 individuals, 19 of whom were hanged, while one was pressed to death with heavy stones. Another four accused individuals died in jail awaiting their trials. On October 29, 1692, Governor William Phips disbanded the court, thus putting an end to the Salem Witch Trials. In the years that followed, those accused and their families received apologies and financial compensation. Subsequently, the Salem Witch Trials have become a reminder of the potential dangers of mass hysteria, the importance of due process, and the need for a fair and unbiased judicial system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The exact power saving scheme depends on the operating system version and on the hardware and firmware capabilities of the system in question. For instance, on x86 processors under Windows 2000, the idle thread will run a loop of halt instructions, which causes the CPU to turn off many internal components until an interrupt request arrives. Later versions of Windows implement more complex CPU power saving methods. On these systems the idle thread will call routines in the Hardware Abstraction Layer to reduce CPU clock speed or to implement other power-saving mechanisms.  John spends most of his time on computers. While at work his work computer does not need modern  capabilities. So, he still uses Windows 2000 at his office computer. At home it's a complete different ball game. He plays so much computer games at home that he needs a better computer. In his home computer he  installed the latest version of Windows. Now, there is no lag in his system.  In which computer CPU will not turn off many   internal components, office computer or home computer? A:","output":"A: The home computer with the latest version of Windows will not turn off as many internal components as the office computer running Windows 2000. This is because the idle thread in the latest version of Windows implements more complex CPU power-saving methods, while in Windows 2000, the idle thread runs a loop of halt instructions causing the CPU to turn off many internal components until an interrupt request arrives. John's home computer, being more modern and for gaming purposes, is better equipped to handle higher performance demands without needing to turn off as many internal components as his office computer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Emory is a Cincinatti steel worker like his father before him and for most of the 20th century the twin pillars of his family's existence have been the steel mill and the union. The mill, which once employed 45,000, has seen its numbers dwindle to 5,000 recently and now 1, as the plant just shut its doors, leaving a single security guard. At first, newly-unemployed Emory and his pals enjoy their independence, hanging out around town and carousing at their favorite bar, where they down \\"depth charges\\" with reckless abandon. They think the mill will reopen after listening to their union rep's optimistic spiel, but reality starts to sink in when they find themselves selling their personal vehicles in a struggle to put food on the table and stave off foreclosure of their homes. Emory's father - a dedicated union man - is sure the plant will reopen and recalls for his son all the short-lived closures during his own 35 years at the mill. Meanwhile, some of the unemployed men take demeaning make-work jobs or hop in their trucks and take off in a desperate search for employment.  Finally the union admits its helplessness, as Emory explains to his stubborn father that times have changed and that the mill won't ever open again. Emory tearfully asks \\"What did I do wrong?\\" as a lifetime of hard work and devotion to job, union, church and family have left him with nothing and nowhere to turn. He hits rock bottom when in a drunken rage he manhandles his young sons and knocks his wife to the floor. Tossed out of his own home and stinging from the plant manager's comments that he and his men didn't work hard enough to justify their substantial paychecks, Emory recruits the steel workers still left in town to do something that will demonstrate to all what they are capable of. Early in the morning they break into the mill, fire up the furnaces and work harder than they ever have in their lives, producing in one shift enough high-quality steel pipes to fill the loading docks from wall to wall, top to bottom - something the plant manager thought was impossible.  Arriving at the suddenly-reopened plant, the stupefied manager looks around him at the tremendous output that came from a single day's work, realizing that production like this could make the plant profitable again. The manager asks Emory: \\"Can you do this every day?\\" Emory is forced to nod \\"No\\" and the manager asks: \\"Then what were you trying to prove?\\" Emory explains that the workers' decades of hard work, honesty and devotion to their jobs had meaning and that by showing how much they could produce in one day \\"We just spit in your eye.\\" Emory bids a tearful farewell to his wife and kids as he takes off with his buddies to look for work down south, promising to relocate the family when he finds it.  This is a powerful and honest treatment of the plight of American workers displaced by foreign competition and gives a realistic view of the costs they bear for the short-sightedness of concession-demanding unions and greedy plant owners who extracted every penny they could from their factories but never gave back by modernizing them. Peter Strauss as Emory, John Goodman as his best friend, Gary Cole as his college-boy brother, Pamela Reed as Emory's sympathetic wife and John Doucette as his dying father all turn in excellent performances in this fine picture.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Netflix raises prices for some subscription plans LOS GATOS, California (AP)  is raising the prices of some of its subscription plans and shifting its focus to streaming video as more members move to the Internet to watch movies and television shows. Netflix said Monday that its subscription plan for unlimited movies and TV shows streamed over the Internet and unlimited DVD deliveries — with one DVD out at a time — will increase 1 a month to 9.99. Prices for other plans allowing more DVDs out at one time are also going up. Existing members will incur the price increases in January, while new customers will pay the higher prices immediately. Netflix has more than 16 million members in the U.S. and Canada and predicted in October that it would gain another 2.1 million to 2.9 million customers by year's end. That means Netflix could enter 2011 with more than 19 million subscribers, doubling the service's size in two years. Netflix is also launching a 7.99 a month streaming-only plan in the U.S. to accommodate the online shift. It already has a streaming service in Canada for a monthly fee of 7.99 Canadian dollars (7.86). With high-speed online access becoming a household staple and various gadgets making it easier to connect high-definition TVs to the Web, Netflix is realizing it needs to evolve as Internet streaming goes mainstream. The company, based in Los Gatos, Calif., previously announced that more of its members are watching more content streamed over the Internet than on DVDs. To deal with this shift, Netflix says it will spend more this quarter to license streaming content than to buy DVDs. \\"We are now primarily a streaming video company,\\" co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings said. Netflix is spending heavily to obtain the streaming rights to more movies and TV shows to help lure more customers and shift existing subscribers away from DVDs. In the third quarter, Netflix spent 115 million on video streaming rights, up from just 10 million at the same time last year. Spending on DVDs dropped 35% from a year ago to just under 30 million in the third quarter. You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of photosynthesis. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by cation exchange, wherein root hairs pump hydrogen ions (H+) into the soil through proton pumps.

Going on holiday makes you feel good while you're there-you gain the health benefits for months, new research shows. Jetting off to exotic destinations such as the Maldives cuts your blood pressure, helps you sleep better and bounce back from stress, it found. The benefits last at least a fortnight longer than the vacation and can be felt for months in some cases where it is claimed. Experts say workers should always take their full holiday entitlement each year-as many as one in three don't-to get the benefits. The study compared key health markers in holidaymakers visiting Thailand, Peru or the Maldives, with people who stayed at home and continued working. The average blood pressure of those on holiday dropped by 6% while the workers saw their blood pressure rise by 2% over the same period. The sleep quality of holiday-makers improved by 17% while that of the non-holidaymakers _ by 14%. The study also found the ability of vacationers to recover from stress--known as the stress-resilience test-improved by 29%. There was a 71% fall in stress resilience scores among workers.

Movie title: Persuasion Context: The film opens by cutting back and forth between scenes of a naval ship carrying Admiral Croft (John Woodvine), and a buggy carrying Mr. Shepherd (David Collings) and his daughter Mrs. Clay (Felicity Dean) to Kellynch Hall. Shepherd and Clay are accosted by creditors due to the debts owed by the residence's owner, Sir Walter Elliot (Corin Redgrave), while Croft discusses the end of the Napoleonic Wars with fellow men of the navy. Sir Walter, a vain foppish baronet, is faced with financial ruin unless he retrenches. Though Sir Walter initially opposes the idea, he eventually agrees to temporarily move to Bath while the hall is let; the idea came from Shepherd, family friend Lady Russell (Susan Fleetwood), and Sir Walter's second eldest daughter, the intelligent Anne (Amanda Root). Anne is visibly upset upon learning that the new tenant of Kellynch Hall will be Admiral Croft, who is the brother-in-law of Frederick Wentworth (CiarÃ¡n Hinds)âa naval captain she was persuaded to reject in marriage nine years previously because of his lack of prospects and connections. Wentworth is now wealthy from serving in the Wars, and has returned to England, presumably to find a wife. Later, Anne expresses to Lady Russell her unhappiness at her family's current financial predicament, and her past decision to reject the captain's proposal of marriage. Anne visits her other sister Mary (Sophie Thompson), a hypochondriac who has married into a local farming family. Anne patiently listens to the various complaints confided in her by each of the Musgrove family; this includes Mary's husband Charles, sisters-in-law Louisa (Emma Roberts) and Henrietta (Victoria Hamilton), and parents-in-law Mr and Mrs Musgrove (Roger Hammond and Judy Cornwell). Captain Wentworth comes to dine with the Musgroves, but Anne avoids going when she volunteers to nurse Mary's injured son.

The first sensible lesson is that you shouldn't bother trying to find your way in the dark at all, but just stay put until dawn. Because then you won't trip over things? No, mainly because you'll have an idea of direction. The sun rises in the east. But you will be amazed at how many people forget they know that. Apparently, the area underneath a holly bush provides a good makeshift shelter -- they are thick, and evergreen.

Answer: A spoiler is an automotive aerodynamic device whose intended design function is to 'spoil' unfavorable air movement across a body of a vehicle in motion, usually described as turbulence or drag. Question: what are spoilers for The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, a spoiler is an automotive aerodynamic device whose primary purpose is to 'spoil' unfavorable air movement across a body of a vehicle in motion, usually described as turbulence or drag. Spoilers are used extensively in various types of vehicles, including cars, trucks, and even airplanes, for achieving enhanced handling, increased fuel efficiency, and improved aesthetics. Spoilers function by altering the airflow around a vehicle while it is in motion, leading to various beneficial effects. They specifically target the unwanted turbulence and drag by redirecting the air, which reduces the aerodynamic resistance the vehicle faces as it moves. This reduction in air resistance results in a more stable ride, better grip on the road, and increased fuel efficiency. Spoilers can be installed on various parts of a vehicle, depending on their intended purpose and design. For instance, front spoilers, also known as air dams or splitters, are mounted to the underside of the front bumper. They help direct the airflow around and under the car, stabilizing it at high speeds and reducing the amount of lift it experiences. This provides better control and handling, enabling the driver to negotiate turns with confidence and precision. Rear spoilers, on the other hand, are attached to the trunk or hatch of a car. They work by interrupting the flow of air over the rear of the vehicle, reducing the amount of turbulence experienced and, consequently, the drag. This results in better traction and stability, particularly useful when cornering at high speeds or during fast accelerations. Additionally, the increased downforce generated by rear spoilers can enhance braking, leading to shorter stopping distances. There is also another type of spoiler commonly seen on vehicles with a hatchback or station wagon body style, known as the roof spoiler. Roof spoilers are installed at the top of the rear windshield, helping reduce turbulence and drag at the rear of the vehicle. This provides added stability and can lead to better fuel economy. Besides their functional advantages, spoilers are often installed for aesthetic reasons, as they lend a sporty and aggressive look to vehicles. Many car enthusiasts consider spoilers as an essential accessory to enhance the visual appeal of their vehicles. In conclusion, spoilers are aerodynamic devices used to improve a vehicle's performance, handling, and fuel efficiency by reducing turbulence and drag. They can be found in various forms and locations on a vehicle, depending on the design and purpose. Additionally, spoilers are considered aesthetically pleasing and are often added to vehicles to create a sportier appearance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Context: \\"Jeffrey loved to listen to hip hop music but Kevin thought it was terrible.\\" Option 1: \\"Jeffrey put in a cd by Run DMC.\\" Justification: Since Jeffrey loves hip hop music, it is more probable that he would put in a CD by Run DMC, a hip hop group. Option 2: \\"Kevin put in a cd by Run DMC.\\" Justification: Although the sentence says Kevin thinks hip hop music is terrible, it would be counterintuitive for him to put in a CD by Run DMC, given his dislike for the genre.

She and her chaperone, Miss Wiggin, visit the publishing house of Harold and Fruing Warne, who decide to publish her book. Beatrix is thrilled and returns home, taking a drive through the parks to celebrate first. However, it is revealed the Warne brothers think her book is ridiculous and will no doubt be a failure. The only reason they agreed to publish it is because they promised their younger brother, Norman, a project. When Norman Warne visits Beatrix, they make decisions about her book regarding size, colour and price. Norman admits he has never done anything like this before but has given her book a great deal of thought. Beatrix realises what Norman's brothers have done regarding him and her, but they become determined to prove them wrong.

Movie title: Attack the Block Movie plot: Walking home on Bonfire Night through a housing estate in South London, Samantha Adams (Jodie Whittaker), a 25-year-old trainee nurse, is mugged by a small gang of teenage hoodlums: Pest (Alex Esmail), Dennis (Franz Drameh), Jerome (Leeon Jones), Biggz (Simon Howard), and leader Moses (John Boyega). The attack is interrupted when a meteorite falls from the sky into a nearby car, giving Samantha the chance to escape. As Moses searches the wreck of the car for valuables, his face is scratched by a pale, hairless, eyeless dog-sized creature; the object which fell from the sky was its cocoon. The creature runs away, but the gang chase and kill it. Hoping to gain fame and fortune, they take the corpse to their acquaintance, cannabis dealer Ron (Nick Frost), to get advice on what to do. He lives at the top of their tower block, Wyndham Tower. Moses asks Ron and his boss, Hi-Hatz (Jumayn Hunter), to keep the creature in their fortified \\"weed room\\" while he decides how to proceed. More objects fall from the sky. Eager to fight the creatures, the gang arm themselves and go to the nearest crash site.

The aliens, following Moses, maul the police to death and attack their van, leaving Samantha and Moses trapped inside. Dennis reaches the vehicle and drives the van away, only to crash into Hi-Hatz's car. Samantha runs away while the rest of Moses's gang catch up and confront Hi-Hatz.

Write highlights for this article: With Kinect, the new controller-free system for its Xbox 360 gaming console, Microsoft isn't just trying to revolutionize video gaming. The company wants to change how people interact with all their entertainment choices. Kinect, which goes on sale Thursday, allows players' physical movements to control action on the screen. Unlike the similar Nintendo Wii or Sony Move, there is nothing to hold and no buttons to push. Three camera sensors and four microphones help Kinect recognize who is standing in front of it. The system recognizes voice commands and reads a player's full range of movements -- not just swings of the arm -- translating them into an avatar's actions within a game. Alex Kipman, director of incubation for Kinect, said Microsoft is trying to break down technological barriers and make game interaction more natural. \\"We wanted to transform entertainment where technology understands you,\\" Kipman said during a Kinect demo in Washington. \\"It was our goal to merge really amazing tech with a really amazing experience.\\" Kipman explained that the specific components used to create Kinect have been around for years. He said the real breakthrough was in the proprietary software used to make it all work together. Cloud profiles, featuring information accessed from the Web on an as-needed basis instead of from a local hard drive, help the Kinect and Xbox 360 learn about users and what types of entertainment they might be interested in. Kinect also will help live-stream music, movies and more in real time. The much-anticipated system, first unveiled more than a year ago, is Microsoft's entry in the growing era of motion-controlled gaming pioneered by the Wii in 2006. Sony launched Move, a motion-sensing game controller for its PlayStation 3 console, in September. A Microsoft spokesperson said 30,000 North American retailers would have Kinect available Thursday, with 7,000 of those planning to open at midnight. She would not say how many units would be available on launch day. The system will launch with at least 17 games. I spent four days testing out Kinect, which should appeal to casual gamers and families more than hardcore action gamers. Here are my impressions:. Getting started. Out of the box, the Kinect sensor is 11 inches long and 3 inches high, including the motorized stand it sits on. Connecting to the Xbox is easy. For the new Xbox 360 Slim consoles, it is plug-and-play -- no additional wires. To use on the original Xbox 360 consoles, you will need a power source for the device. After some software downloads, the Kinect calibrates itself to the room automatically. It is actuated by specific gestures (waving your hand at the Kinect) or by using a specific key word for voice commands (\\"Xbox\\"). \\"It is technology that understands you,\\" Kipman said. \\"Kinect looks at 48 points on the body to figure out what it should do. It always knows who is in charge.\\" The Kinect should go at or as near eye level as possible so it can read all your movements. Also, it requires a clear space to play so nothing impedes its view of the player and nothing gets bumped or knocked over. Someone playing alone will need to be at least 6 feet back, while two players should be about eight feet from the screen. Kinect comes bundled with \\"Kinect Adventures,\\" an introductory game that teaches you how to use the device. Hovering your hand over game menu options activates those choices. Five different adventures require the player to move and react to different scenarios. \\"Rallyball\\" will get you reacting to things being thrown at you. \\"River Rush\\" and \\"Reflex Ridge\\" get you dodging and steering. \\"Space Pop\\" requires using your arms to propel you in a weightless situation. \\"20,000 Leaks\\" will stretch you out as you try to stop water from rushing in through cracked glass. All of these adventures teach players how to use their movements to control the action on the screen. The gestures will come in handy for other Kinect games. Fun with wild animals. \\"Kinectimals\\" was demonstrated at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles in June, where it received high marks for its cuteness factor -- and lower marks for being, well, a little bizarre. In the game, players get to adopt a virtual pet. Among the 40 choices are a Bengal tiger, lion, panther, cheetah or leopard cub. By using voice commands and body gestures, kids can teach their cub to do tricks, feed and brush their baby animal, or just play games with it. It is definitely a game geared toward younger players. I play a lot of first-person shooter games, but I'll admit there is something neat to rubbing a tiger cub on its belly -- even if it is virtual. Full-body sports. \\"Kinect Sports\\" cranks up the action with six different games at four different skill levels. From the outdoors to the table top, different sports challenge players to really get involved with the action. Full body movements mimic those that would be needed to really play the sport. Want to score a goal in soccer? Kick the ball. Want to knock out your opponent in boxing? Throw a punch. \\"The only skill you need is life skill,\\" Kipman said. \\"If you know how to bowl, you can bowl in our game.\\" The action and movements are lifelike and will get players moving. For example, while you won't actually have a javelin in your hand, you will need to run in place up to the line and throw. The escalating skill levels make it easy for players to learn what to do and master those actions before moving up to more challenging opponents. Wheel-free racing. \\"Kinect Joy Ride\\" offers different game modes that let you race cars, do stunts or even crash into objects -- and each other. But it doesn't feel quite right because, with Kinect, there is nothing to feel. You control your car by grabbing an imaginary steering wheel. There is no accelerator or brake; the game does that for you automatically. Turning your hands left or right steers the car, but there is no tactile feedback to give you the sensation of running off the road or colliding with a light pole. This isn't a \\"Grand Turismo\\" title by any stretch of the imagination. But a racing game should have a feel to it -- this one just leaves you grasping for air. Get your body moving. Two other initial titles, \\"Your Shape: Fitness Evolved\\" and \\"Dance Central\\" are where Kinect really shines. \\"Your Shape: Fitness Evolved\\" features workouts created by Men's Health and Women's Health magazines. Players are scored on how well they match the movements of instructors who demonstrate exercises. There are Zen exercises for relaxation, or cardio boxing if you want to blow off steam in a different way. There are also personalized exercise plans to help lose weight, tone the body or get more energy. The game offers a good workout. Kinect helps correct postures and actions so users can get the most benefits out of the exercises being done. In this way, it really does work well. \\"Dance Central,\\" made by the creators of \\"Rock Band,\\" aims to get you moving to the beat, but realizes we all aren't ready to strut our stuff on the dance floor. The game combines today's dance hits performed by pop stars with moves that seem clunky at first but get more involved and intense as the difficulty ratchets up. Like \\"Guitar Hero,\\" you have to match your movements to those on the screen to get a perfect score. Beyond games. Because it has cameras, Kinect also offers the ability to connect via video with other Kinect users -- or those who use Microsoft's Live Messenger program on their PCs. It also works with the other entertainment features for the Xbox 360, such as on-demand ESPN, music from Zune.com and movies from Netflix. \\"It is all about your choice, your content when you want it,\\" Kipman said. The bottom line. I didn't get to test out the 11 other games that Microsoft says will use the new controller. But my experience with the initial six titles shows where Kinect will shine and where it will stumble. Games that feature full-body movement make best use of what Kinect can offer. Syncing up your movements with the movements on the screen is a lot easier and more natural with Kinect than with a normal controller. It's also hard to compare the Kinect to Sony's Move -- the two systems are like apples and oranges. I was pleasantly surprised and amused by Kinect's ability to record video while you are playing. While I was doing hurdles in \\"Kinect Sports'\\" track and field, my kitten decided to join the fun and began jumping as I jumped. Needless to say, the resulting video of us provided many laughs after the game. But games that would be better enhanced with a physical device in hand feel flat. On Kinect, they're just not up to the demands that players make from those types of games. You will probably not enjoy racing games and first-person shooter games as much with Kinect that you do with regular controllers. Right now, the Kinect can understand languages from the United States, United Kingdom, Mexico, Japan and Canada -- with more to roll out in the near future. Kipman said they will be constantly refining voice-recognition software to help the system recognize dialects in each language. Prices range from 399 for a 250GB Xbox 360 Kinect bundle to 299 for the 4GB bundle and 149 for the Kinect box by itself, without the console. Is it worth it? That may depend on whether you have kids -- and what kind of gamer you are. Highlights:","output":"1.

Paragraph: (CNN) -- Jo-Wilfried Tsonga ended Roger Federer's hopes of winning a record-equaling seventh Wimbledon title on Wednesday as the French 12th seed staged a stunning fightback to reach the semifinals. Federer appeared to be cruising into the last four after winning the first two sets, but Tsonga inflicted the Swiss world No. 3's first defeat from that vantage point in 179 grand slam matches. It was only the third time in the 29-year-old's glittering career that the 16-time grand slam champion had surrendered a two-set lead. Tsonga, ranked 19th in the world, triumphed 3-6 6-7 (3-7) 6-4 6-4 6-4 on Centre Court, serving out to love as he earned a clash with second seed Novak Djokovic. The Serbian, who beat Tsonga in the 2008 Australian Open final, ended the dream run of Australian 18-year-old Bernard Tomic. Tsonga defeated Federer for just the second time in six meetings, their first on grass. \\"It was amazing. I played unbelievable. It's never easy to come back against Roger. I'm so happy, it's crazy,\\" the 26-year-old told reporters after reaching the semifinals at Wimbledon for the first time. \\"He's the biggest champion in the sport. He has achieved so much and is the best player in the world. To be two sets down and come back was unbelievable. I served really well. Against Djokovic I will have to come out and do the same again.\\" Federer has now lost in the quarterfinals two years in a row, being beaten by eventual runner-up Tomas Berdych in 2010. \\"Jo played great.

Cynthia always considered themselves a cat person.. Answer:","output":"Even though Monica liked animals less than Cynthia, it is interesting to note that Monica always considered themselves a cat person. This preference likely stemmed from her early childhood experiences with her grandparents, who lived in a picturesque countryside home and raised several cats. Each time Monica visited, she would find herself instantly drawn to their graceful, independent, and low-maintenance nature. Cynthia, on the other hand, while having a much stronger affinity for animals, seemed to have a love for all creatures across the spectrum—dogs, birds, reptiles, and more. This made her an ideal candidate for her role as a veterinarian, in which she could interact with both animals and their caregivers on a daily basis. However, given her relatively diverse interests in various animal species, Cynthia never really identified herself as a staunch cat person. Nevertheless, Monica's and Cynthia's differences in their love for animals did not pose any threat to their friendship. In fact, these differences only served to enrich the dynamic between them. Occasionally, Monica would accompany Cynthia to the local animal shelter, where they would spend hours discussing the behavioral traits and distinctive qualities of the various animals housed there. Over the years, Monica began to develop a passion for animal rights and became involved in several animal welfare organizations. Cynthia, too, found herself increasingly aware of animal welfare issues and engaged in numerous initiatives to support the same cause. They made an excellent team, using their combined knowledge and passion to raise awareness, fundraise and volunteer in various capacities to improve the lives of animals in need. In summary, even though Monica liked animals less than Cynthia, her affinity for cats played a significant role in shaping their mutual interests and enriching their friendship. While Monica always considered themselves a cat person, Cynthia's love for animals was diverse and all-encompassing, making both of them valuable assets to the world of animal welfare and a remarkable example of how seemingly contrasting personalities can come together to make a positive impact."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For example, mentioning a specific menu item that was not up to expectations, the wait time, or the staff's behavior. Step 5: Draft a negative review Taking all the above factors into account, I will now draft a negative review for Fancy's Bistro in Spring Grove City. --- Title: Disappointing Experience at Fancy's Bistro I usually don't leave negative reviews, but my experience at Fancy's Bistro was far from enjoyable. The moment I walked in, I noticed the dim lighting and cluttered tables, which made it difficult to navigate around the restaurant. On top of that, the music was too loud, making it hard to have a conversation. The waitress took nearly 15 minutes to attend to our table, and there was no apology for the delay. We ordered their signature dish, the Lemon Herb Chicken, but when we received our meals, the chicken was overcooked and bland. The vegetables on the side were cold and looked like they had been sitting out for a while. When we tried to address our concerns with the staff, they brushed us off. It took ages to get our bill, and to top it all off, the restrooms were unkempt and lacking in basic hygiene. Overall, I would not return to Fancy's Bistro and had hoped for a much better dining experience for a place that had such potential. I suggest the management focuses on improving customer service and food quality to ensure a better experience for future patrons. --- Step 6: Proofread and finalize the review I will now reread the review to ensure it's grammatically correct, coherent, and achieves the objective of presenting a negative experience. If the review doesn't need any further changes, I will consider the task complete."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer. Question: What is probably true about Puskas?

The 1984 Oakland Athletics season drafted this future superstar, currently a bench coach in which league? Answer:","output":"The 1984 Oakland Athletics season was key in the team's history as it led to the drafting of future superstar Mark McGwire in that year's Major League Baseball (MLB) draft. During his career, he became one of the most prominent sluggers of his time, setting records and earning numerous accolades, including a World Series championship and multiple All-Star appearances. Mark McGwire, initially starting his professional career as a pitcher before switching to a position as a first baseman, was the 10th overall pick in the 1984 MLB draft. After spending some time in the minor leagues, he made his MLB debut in 1986 with the Oakland Athletics and quickly gained fame for his outstanding power-hitting abilities. Over his 16-year career, McGwire played for the Oakland Athletics and the St. Louis Cardinals, smashing 583 home runs and retiring with a then-record of 70 home runs in a single season, set in 1998. Following his retirement, McGwire pursued a career in coaching. He began as a hitting coach for the St. Louis Cardinals in 2010, and his coaching tenure included time with the Los Angeles Dodgers (hitting coach from 2013 to 2015) and the San Diego Padres (bench coach from 2016 to 2018). At present, Mark McGwire is not coaching in any league. After serving three years as a bench coach for the San Diego Padres, he decided to step away from his coaching career in 2018 to spend more time with his family. However, his coaching experience and unique contributions to the sport are still well-regarded in the world of baseball, and he remains a prominent figure in the MLB community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: When we talk about superstitious beliefs , the beliefs associated with Friday the 13th , no doubt , deserve a special mention . In fact , such is the fear associated with this date that people just can't seem to stick to their daily routine on this day . The data from Stress Management Center and Phobia Institute suggests that somewhere around 17 to 21 million Americans are affected by the fear associated with this day , i.e. the combination of Friday and 13 . Even worse , the financial losses caused on this day amounts to as much as US800 million every year . As we flipped through the pages of history , we realized that Friday the 13th bears the brunt of bad luck associated with number 13 , the unluckiest number , and Friday , the unluckiest day of the week . Number 13 has always been considered unlucky , mainly as a result of it being associated with various occurrences in mythology . While some associate it with the instance of Norse mythology , in which the god of joy and gladness - Balter , was killed in a dishonest manner by Loki - the god of discord and mischief , who was the 13th guest , others associate it with the Last Supper , in which the 13th guest was Judas , who betrayed Jesus to his enemies for 30 pieces of silver . Similarly , Friday has also been a sign of bad luck to many people , with incidents like Jesus being crucified on this unfaithful day , contributing to this belief . It is also widely believed that Cain killed Able on this very day of the week . The fear of Friday the 13th is known as friggatriskaidekaphobia and paraskevidekatriaphobia , the former combining the words frigga , meaning Friday , and triskaidekaphobia , meaning the phobia of number 13 . Over the period , the belief that Friday the 13th is an unlucky day has just become one of the most widely accepted superstitions , which consequently causes much blind panic and unreasonable fear in the world . Question: What is the passage mainly about? Answer: Answer:","output":"The passage is mainly about the superstitious beliefs associated with Friday the 13th, the fear it causes among people, its historical roots, and its impact on society, including financial losses. The passage also explains the fear's name - friggatriskaidekaphobia and paraskevidekatriaphobia - and how it has become one of the most widely accepted superstitions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: A). No; B). Yes; A:","output":"A: No, an \\"Acoustic coupler modem\\" would not be a reasonable answer for the location of a modem on WAN radio internet.  WAN (Wide Area Network) radio internet refers to a communication network that spans a wide geographic area and typically uses wireless technologies such as radio frequencies to transmit data. This system connects multiple LANs (Local Area Networks) and can be a part of the broader Internet infrastructure. A modem is a device that modulates and demodulates signals to enable communication between different devices, often converting analog signals into digital ones or vice versa. In the context of WAN radio internet, the modem could be a part of a radio base station that communicates with user devices via radio waves or other wireless communication methods. An Acoustic coupler modem is an older type of modem used to connect devices (like computers and telecommunication equipment) to a telephone line via an acoustic connection.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: While General George Washington is conducting the struggle against the British Empire on the battlefield, the Continental Congress in Philadelphia piddles away its time over trivial matters and continually refuses to begin debating the question of American independence. The leader of the independence faction is the abrasive John Adams of Massachusetts, whose continuous pushing of the issue has brought their cause to a complete standstill. John Dickinson of Pennsylvania leads the opposition that hopes for reconciliation with England. During his quieter moments, Adams calls up the image of his wife Abigail Adams, who resides in Massachusetts and gives him insight and encouragement (these conversations are based on letters between the couple). Dr. Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania suggests another colony that supports independence should submit a proposal. Richard Henry Lee of Virginia voluntarily rides off to Williamsburg, Virginia to get authorization from the Virginia Colony to propose independence. Dr. Lyman Hall arrives to represent Georgia, and immediately, he is interrogated by his fellow delegates regarding his views on independence (with Dickinson framing it as \\"treason\\"). Weeks later, Lee returns with the resolution, and debate on the question begins.

Question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — The U.S. election calendar could be a key factor in determining the scope and timing of a potential deal to end the North Korean nuclear program. Planning is progressing for both the upcoming summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the end of April and the expected meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim in late May or early June. President Trump said Tuesday that there had been talks at “extremely high levels” between his administration and the North Korean government. Later it was reported that Mike Pompeo, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency and a secretary of state nominee, met recently with Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang. Trump also noted the talks have been marked by “a lot of goodwill” and that “there has been a major change in terms of North Korea’s behavior,” since Kim’s Olympic outreach this year, in which he sent a large delegation to the Pyeongchang Winter games in South Korea, suspended nuclear and missile tests, and expressed a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. The turn toward diplomacy has reduced, for now, the potential for conflict over the North’s accelerated efforts last year to develop an operational nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. The North Korean leader’s decision to engage in denuclearization talks was likely motivated by both Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, which increased sanctions and the threat of military action against the North, and by South Korean President Moon’s reassuring outreach efforts to improve inter-Korean relations. Trump’s motivation in pursuing a nuclear deal with North Korea, in addition to resolving a growing national security threat, could also have a political component. According to North Korea analysts at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, the Trump administration is likely calculating how achieving such an agreement could help boost the president’s chances for re-election in 2020. “If I were Trump, I...

Louis van Gaal said he had no option but to substitute Paddy McNair in the first half against Southampton because the defender's 'confidence' was shot - but believes that it will benefit the youngster in the long run. The 19-year-old was hooked by Van Gaal after only 39 minutes at St Mary's Stadium on Monday night during Manchester United's 2-1 victory over the Saints. McNair was struggling to contain Southampton strikers Shane Long and Graziano Pelle, forcing Van Gaal into replacing him prematurely. Paddy McNair (centre) was substituted after only 39 minutes for Manchester United against Southampton. McNair (centre) takes his seat in the stands having been replaced by his manager on Monday night. United boss Louis van Gaal admitted he 'had to' substitute McNair against Southampton. McNair shakes Van Gaal's hand as he leaves the field having been replaced during United's 2-1 victory. Speaking to Sky Sports after the match, Van Gaal explained: 'He (McNair) hadn't any confidence. He had already given three big chances away. 'I had to (substitute him), it's very disappointing for me and also for Paddy, but I had to because as a manager, I'm responsible to win. 'And I think, after the change, we played a little better.' Robin van Persie's brace, either side of a Pelle strike, ensured United left the south coast with three points. McNair (right) slices the ball forward off his foot during the early stages of the Southampton clash. Robin van Persie scored what turned out to be the winning goal for Manchester United. But in spite of the fact United won the game, McNair was exposed time after time in defence and was substituted - even though Chris Smalling had already departed early with an injury. Jonny Evans came on to replace Smalling, before McNair made way for midfielder Ander Herrera as Michael Carrick dropped back in to the centre of defence in Van Gaal's 3-5-2 system. And, despite admitting it will be difficult for McNair to accept being replaced so early, Van Gaal insisted that it was a necessity which will serve the Northern Irishman well long term. Van Gaal continued: 'Of course, it's tough (for McNair), but it's also in his best interests.' The victory moved United up to third in the Premier League - their highest position since they claimed the title in 2012-13 under Sir Alex Ferguson.

The struggling Web pioneer said Thursday the stolen info included names, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. Yahoo’s probe of the breach — the biggest ever in terms of the number of accounts affected — turned up no evidence that hackers got credit-card data or bank account information, it said, noting it doesn’t store that on the affected network. “The investigation has found no evidence that the state-sponsored actor is currently in Yahoo’s network,” the company said in a statement, without naming the country. Yahoo is working “closely with law enforcement” as a probe of the incident continues, it said. Analysts said the breach could end up lowering the 4.8 billion price that Verizon Communications agreed to pay to acquire Yahoo this summer. “We understand that Yahoo is conducting an active investigation of this matter, but we otherwise have limited information and understanding of the impact,” Verizon said, adding it had learned of the breach two days earlier. Yahoo said it’s notifying affected users and has taken steps to secure their accounts, including asking potentially affected users to change their passwords. Yahoo said earlier this summer that it was investigating a data breach after hackers boasted about the attack. A hacker named “Peace” claimed to have stolen info from 200 million Yahoo users from 2012 and, on the so-called “dark Web,” was demanding 1,800 from every affected user. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Yahoo was hacked in a big way back in 2014, and it's believed that a country (or \\"state\\") was behind it. This attack got some personal information of 500 million people who used Yahoo. The good news is, the hackers didn't get any creditcard or bank account information. Yahoo didn't say which country was behind the hack, but they are working with the police to figure everything out."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:\\"Slow City\\" -- a recently launched project focused on preserving the traditional quality of life enjoyed in some of Italy's smaller cities and towns. The project was born from the idea of the \\"Slow Food\\" movement -- started in Italy in the 1980s -- which promotes leisurely eating and the growing of local, healthy products to fight against the American fast-food style. \\"The American urban model has invaded our cities, making Italian towns look the same. We want to stop this kind of globalization,\\" says Paolo Saturnini, an Italian mayor. The \\"Slow City\\" project plans to emphasize the rich, cultural, culinary  and artistic local traditions of each community. Walking areas will be enlarged and squares and parks will be made greener with more plants. Car alarms and other noise that disturbs the peace will be banned, and ugly TV aerials , advertising posters, and signs will be taken down. City councils will also insist on the use of recycling and renewable energy sources, and will also introduce ecological transport systems. Parking will be made stress-free by creating more public parking areas, and easily accessible walkways and bike lanes will cross the city. But in the \\"Slow City\\" way, all improvements will probably come about slowly. Thirty-two Italian city councils, which joined the \\"Slow City\\" program, have decided to take further steps in this direction by increasing the numbers of traditional family-style eating establishments, reducing noise pollution, and concentrating on making their towns friendlier for people to live in. Organic local produce will be promoted in all restaurants and genetically modified foods  will be banned. \\"We can't stop large, fast-food chains from coming here, but we hope that people who come to our towns will not want to eat exactly the same hamburger they can eat in Melbourne, London or Paris, but want something genuine and different,\\" said Saturnini. According to the passage, the \\"Slow City\\" project aims at   _  . A) preventing Italy from being affected by America B) beautifying the environment of small Italian cities and towns C) calling on Italians to enjoy stress-free life D) protecting the traditional Italian lifestyle A:","output":"D) protecting the traditional Italian lifestyle"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He picked up a dish from a table, and suddenly a snake appeared and bit him on the hand. A few days earlier, the snake came to the restaurant from Asia in a box of bananas. It climbed out of the box and hid under the dish. \\" I tried to pick it up and it bit me. I threw it away, but it landed in the fridge. So I closed the door.\\" Jackson said.

Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Paul  for the following movie plot:  A British ghostwriter (Ewan McGregor) is hired to complete the autobiography of former Prime Minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan). His predecessor and Lang's aide, Mike McAra, has recently died in an apparent drowning accident. The writer travels to Old Haven on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, where Lang and his wife Ruth (Olivia Williams) are staying, along with Lang's personal assistant (and implied mistress), Amelia Bly (Kim Cattrall). Amelia forbids the writer to take McAra's manuscript outside, emphasizing that it is a security risk. Shortly after the writer's arrival, former Foreign Secretary Richard Rycart (Robert Pugh) accuses Lang of authorizing the illegal seizure of suspected terrorists and handing them over for torture by the CIA, a possible war crime. Lang faces prosecution by the International Criminal Court unless he stays in the U.S. (or one of the few other countries that does not recognise the court's jurisdiction). While Lang is in Washington, the writer finds items in McAra's room suggesting he might have stumbled across a dark secret. Among them is an envelope containing photographs and a phone number the writer discovers is Rycart's. During a bike ride, the writer encounters an old man (Eli Wallach) who tells him the current couldn't have taken McAra's body from the ferry where he disappeared to the beach where it was discovered. He also reveals a neighbour saw flashlights on the beach the night McAra died, but later fell down the stairs and went into a coma. Later, Ruth admits to the writer Lang had never been very political, and until recently always took her advice. When he tells her the old man's story, she suddenly rushes out into the rainy night to \\"clear her head.\\" Upon returning, she reveals Lang and McAra had argued the night before his death.

A:","output":"Given the situation you described, Ash has started the engine of a lawnmower to mow the lawn. Considering the potential steps that Ash might take next, I would like to break it down into a few categories: 1. Safety measures 2. Ensuring equipment is working efficiently 3. Lawn mowing techniques 4. Lawn care and maintenance. 1. Safety measures: Before starting the actual mowing process, Ash would want to ensure they are taking all necessary safety precautions to avoid accidents and injuries. Some steps they might follow include:    a) Wearing proper protective equipment, such as close-toed shoes, gloves, long pants, and, if needed, safety glasses and earmuffs.    b) Checking the lawn for any debris, rocks, or hazards that could be thrown by the lawnmower or possibly damage the machine.    c) Ensuring no children or pets are in the vicinity before starting to mow 2. Ensuring equipment is working efficiently: Ash may want to examine the lawnmower and ensure everything is in working order to avoid potential malfunctions or breakdowns. Some steps they could follow include:    a) Ensuring the fuel tank is filled with the appropriate fuel.    b) Checking the oil levels and topping off if necessary.    c) Inspecting the mower blades for sharpness and damage, and replacing or sharpening if required.    d) Confirming that the lawnmower setting is adjusted to the desired grass height.    e) Inspecting the wheels and wheel height adjusters.    f) Verifying that all the nuts, bolts, and fastenings are tightened securely.    g) Checking the air filter for dirt and debris. 3. Lawn mowing techniques: To achieve an even and visually appealing cut, Ash might want to adopt certain lawn mowing techniques that can optimize efficiency as well as improve the health of the grass. Some strategies they could follow include:    a) Mowing in straight lines by selecting a point in the distance to focus on and maintain that consistent direction for each row.    b) Changing the mowing pattern with each session to avoid the grass being depressed or matted in a specific direction.    c) Avoiding mowing the lawn when it's wet to ensure better control and prevent clumping of grass clippings.    d) Adjusting the mowing speed based on the grass type, terrain, and overall mower efficiency.    e) Mowing around the edges of the property first and then working on the interior. 4. Lawn care and maintenance: After the mowing process, Ash may want to follow good lawn maintenance practices to keep the yard healthy and visually appealing. Some steps they could follow include:    a) Using a grass catcher or bag attachment to collect clippings or, alternatively, using a leaf blower or rake to remove any leftover clippings from the lawn.    b) Watering the lawn after mowing, especially during dry spells or in hot weather.    c) Applying fertilizer as needed for optimal nutrient distribution and growth.    d) Edging along sidewalks, driveways, and garden beds to maintain a clean and polished appearance.    e) Aerating the soil to improve oxygen flow and support root growth.    f) Regularly inspecting the lawn for any weeds or pests and treating them accordingly. In conclusion, once Ash has started the lawnmower engine and is ready to mow, they would first want to consider safety measures, inspect the equipment to ensure it is working efficiently, follow proper lawn mowing techniques, and perform lawn care and maintenance. This comprehensive approach will not only result in a well-manicured lawn but also contribute to the overall health and appearance of the yard."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Photo: SnapChat)      LEESVILLE, La. — A pickup truck hit and killed a 31-year-old black man who was being a Good Samaritan as he tried to remove dangerous debris from a roadway in a community south of here.      His name was Sherell \\"Rell\\" Lewis of Leesville. Tuesday, the day of the accident, was his birthday.      He was a barber who was well known here for his generosity with local youth. His death was devastating.      But what happened next sent shock waves across social media.      Matthew Martin, 18, of Hineston, La. was the driver of the 2003 Chevy truck that hit Lewis on U.S. 171 north of Pickering, according to the Louisiana State Police. The area is about 200 miles northwest of New Orleans.      ► June 1: Public reacts on social media, calls for justice for Sherell Lewis Jr.      ► May 30: Snapchat post sparks outrage after 'Good Samaritan' killed in crash      ► May 29: Leesville man removing road debris hit, killed      After the collision, Martin reportedly posted a social media video of his dented truck, using several laughing emojis and the caption, “y’all i just hit a whole guy on the highway.” Police have not confirmed that Martin was behind the posts, but the account was in his name.      When asked what Martin hit, in a Snapchat conversation, he responded:      Martin: Some ni--er      Friend: How did the chevy take it?      Martin: F---ed it up pretty good lol      Friend: It’ll buff out. Did the guy die on impact or what      Martin: No he died otw to the hospital      Vernon Parish Sheriff Sam Craft said his office has been contacted numerous times about the posts. He addressed concerns over social media posts allegedly from Martin.      In a Facebook post, Craft said he was \\"appalled\\" by the posts, which contain a racial slur and show a shockingly cavalier attitude about the fatality. But such \\"morally and socially unacceptable\\" language does not constitute a crime.      ► May 2: White nationalist convicted of beating during Charlottesville rally      ► Dec. 14: Driver charged with first-degree murder in Charlottesville car attack      Lewis was pronounced dead at Byrd Regional Hospital in Leesville.

Snapchat posts that the driver of the truck, Matthew Martin, apparently made have created a social-media furor because he used a racial slur to describe Lewis and appeared more concerned about his vehicle than the man's death.

Your goal is to examine every number in the list and filter out all non-integer numbers. This means that the final list should only contain whole numbers, with no fractions or decimals. Here are the guidelines to accomplish the task: 1. Start by reviewing the given list of numbers.  2. Identify which numbers are integers (whole numbers) and which are not. Recall that an integer is a whole number without a decimal point. For example, -62 is an integer whereas 8.404 is not.  3. Remove all numbers that are not integers from the list. In our given list, we need to remove 8.404 and -42.909.  4. If every number in the list is found to be a non-integer, return an empty list, represented by \\"[]\\".  5. But, if there are integers in the list, return the list in brackets with each integer separated by a comma. This means that if after our filtering, we're left with the integer -62, our response should be \\"[-62]\\".  Based on above guidelines, let's apply these steps to the list [-62, 8.404, -42.909]: 1. After reviewing the list, we identify -62 as an integer and 8.404 & -42.909 as non-integers. 2. We remove the non-integers, leaving us with just -62. 3. As such, our final result is \\"[-62]\\".

This view is commonly contrasted with rationalism, which states that knowledge may be derived from reason independently of the senses. For example, John Locke held that some knowledge (e.g. knowledge of God's existence) could be arrived at through intuition and reasoning alone.

Given the question: Today, I want to share why I think you should interview real estate agents before hiring one. Why You Should Interview Real Estate Agents Truth be told, I have only purchased one house and I’m in the process of selling it. My husband and I thought long and hard about whether we would try to sell our property on our own or hire someone to represent us. In the end, we chose the latter. If you have ever shared with friends or family that you’re looking for a home or thinking of selling your own, most everyone says something along the lines of, “Oh! I know a realtor I can recommend!” Many of you may know a real estate agent personally as well. I still think it makes sense to interview any prospective agents because they are being paid by you. When you hire someone to do work on your home, you get estimates and gather information about how and when the work will be done. When you are looking for babysitters, you meet them and see how they’ll interact with your child. When you’re an employer, you interview any potential employees. Don’t Take The Easy Route with Previous Agents and Friends Just because a friend is a realtor, doesn’t mean they’ll be the best real estate agent for you. Just because a friend recommends their realtor to you, doesn’t mean you have to hire him/her. It’s business and nobody should take it personally. Interviewing real estate agents just makes sense. Oftentimes, people don’t. Why not just use the realtor that sold you the house you’re currently in? Well, you can. But do you know how that realtor handles business when they are the listing agent versus the buyer’s agent? Do you know if they’ll want to pursue the option to be a dual agent (and double their commission)? Why not interview them while interviewing others? It won’t hurt.

Article: Police have charged a man with trespassing at Sunday's Berlin marathon after breaking the finish-tape ahead of winner and new world-record holder Wilson Kipsang.            As Kenya's Kipsang, 31, approached the finish in front of Berlin's iconic Brandenburg Gate, for a new world record of 2 hrs 3 mins and 23 secs, he was briefly joined by a man in running kit and a race number.Having leapt from the crowd, the intruder, an ambush marketer wearing a t-shirt promoting an escort website, broke the tape just before the bemused Kipsang.The intruder was chased by race staff in the finish area before being handed over to police.A Berlin police spokesman confirmed that the man has been charged with trespassing and has subsequently been banned from future events run by the Berlin marathon's organizers.Security had been tightened at this year's Berlin race in the wake of April's bomb attack on the Boston marathon which left three dead and 250 injured and for the first time the Berlin finish area was closed off.Kipsang's new mark was the ninth time a world marathon record has been set in Berlin. The Kenyan shaved 15 seconds off compatriot Patrick Makau's mark set two years ago in the German capital. ||||| “And now I have achieved the dream,” Kipsang said.      Although security in Berlin had been increased after the bombings at the Boston Marathon in April, a man wearing a yellow T-shirt stepped out of the crowd near the finish line and raised his arms, breaking the tape just ahead of Kipsang in an apparent stunt of ambush marketing.      According to Agence France-Presse, the man was promoting a Web site for an escort service. He was intercepted by race staff, handed over to the police and charged with trespassing, the news agency reported.      Video showed Kipsang steering clear to the man’s left and also raising his arms in victory, then smiling as he wrapped himself in the Kenyan flag.      Photo      Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya finished second in 2:04:05 in only his second marathon, and Geoffrey Kipsang of Kenya — no relation to Wilson — took third in 2:06:26.      Florence Kiplagat of Kenya won the women’s race in 2:21:13.      As Sunday’s race unfolded, Kipsang patiently hung near the rear of the lead pack of 8 to 10 runners, assured in knowing that the pacesetters were part of his training group.

At about 35 kilometers, or 21.7 miles, with the pace now about 20 seconds slower than Makau’s record time, Kipsang surged to the front and eventually subdued all challengers. After two years of trying, he had the world record to himself.      Running elegantly and carrying his arms low, Kipsang challenged Makau’s record in the fall of 2011 at the Frankfurt Marathon and missed by only four seconds with a finish of 2:04:42. At the time, it was the second-fastest marathon ever run.      Kipsang then won the 2012 London Marathon and became a favorite at the London Games. But the Olympic race came on a hot and humid day on a course with so many turns it must have seemed at times like a Formula One race. Kipsang settled for a bronze medal while Stephen Kiprotich, a Ugandan who trains in Kenya, won the gold.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Kipsang was scheduled to run the 2012 New York City Marathon last November and had arrived in the city along with tens of thousands of other runners, only to learn that the race had been canceled after Hurricane Sandy.      Elite marathon runners generally run only two marathons a year, which means each race is hugely important to their potential earnings. Kipsang was attempting his third marathon in an Olympic year. He missed out on a chance at the 130,000 prize for first place.      “I was a little disappointed when there was no race, but we saw on TV that there was a lot of destruction and loss of life,” Kipsang said in an interview at the time. “We understand.”      On Sunday, Kipsang won 54,000 in prize money and 68,000 in bonus money for the world record. And he prevailed in front of previous world-record holders from Berlin on hand to mark the race’s 40th year.      “Looking at my marathon progress and career so far, I still think I have the potential to run faster,” Kipsang told reporters. “Anything under 2:03:23 would do.” ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A man trespassed at the Berlin marathon and broke the finish tape ahead of the winner and world-record holder Wilson Kipsang.

Additionally, the tweet is targeting a specific individual (Tim Scott) and anticipating negative reactions from the \\"liberal left.\\" Step 2: Analyze the context and nuances of the language used. While the tweet does use a racially-charged term and target a specific individual, it seems to focus more on criticizing the anticipated behavior of a political group rather than promoting hate speech directly. Step 3: Compare the tweet's content with the provided label. The provided label is \\"Hate Speech.\\" However, the tweet seems more focused on criticizing a political group's potential behavior rather than promoting hate speech directly. Although the tweet contains offensive language, it does not reach the level of being categorized as hate speech. Step 4: Determine if the provided label is correct. As the tweet doesn't appear to promote hate speech directly, the provided label of \\"Hate Speech\\" is not the most accurate label for this content.

Choices:  - desk - house - at hotel - bedroom - library  The rationale to choose \\"library\\" as the answer is that:","output":"A library is a public institution that is designed to provide shared resources and access to information for a wide range of community members. One of the main purposes of a library is facilitating access to a variety of information sources and materials, including telephone books, that may not be available in other places. The rationale for choosing \\"library\\" as the answer among the given choices are as follows: 1. Universality: Libraries cater to the needs of the general public, regardless of their age, socio-economic background, or educational status. This means that a library would be more likely to house resources like a single telephone book that can be used by many people. 2. Accessibility: Libraries often have publicly accessible computers and internet access, allowing individuals who may not have these resources at home or work to access information, including telephone directories, with ease. 3. Reference Materials: Libraries serve as a repository for many reference materials, such as encyclopedias, dictionaries, and telephone books, to help users access information they may not have at home. 4. Assistance: Libraries usually have knowledgeable staff members who can assist users in locating resources, including telephone books, and guiding them in their usage. 5. Free Usage: Most libraries offer free access to their resources, making them an ideal place for people to use a communal telephone book without incurring any costs. Contrarily, a desk, house, bedroom, or hotel would not be suitable for providing public access to resources like a telephone book, as they are all private spaces designated for specific individuals or groups and do not function as resource centers for the general public.

The Ravens scored quickly on their first drive, when only three plays into the game, Baltimore wide receiver Anquan Boldin caught a 27-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Joe Flacco. The Ravens scored again on the ensuing drive when running back Ray Rice ran in a 1-yard touchdown, putting Baltimore on top 14-0 early in the first quarter. The Steelers battled back on the next drive, driving down to the Ravens 11-yard line. Pittsburgh scored on a third-and-goal play when wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders caught a touchdown in the back of the end zone from quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. The Ravens responded by scoring again, this time on an 11-yard pass from Flacco to Rice. At halftime the Ravens led 21-7, just like in the 2010 playoffs. But unlike that game, the Ravens did not let up their dominance in the second half. On Pittsburgh's first play from scrimmage in the second quarter, Ravens defensive lineman Haloti Ngata stripped Roethlisberger of the football and recovered it at the Steelers 18-yard line. The Ravens scored yet again when tight end Ed Dickson caught an 18-yard touchdown pass from Joe Flacco. A two-point conversion by punter/holder Sam Koch put the Ravens on top 29-7. The Ravens never looked back, and put up two more Billy Cundiff field goals to close out the game 35-7. The Steelers finished with 7 turnovers in the game. The loss marked the Steelers first opening day loss in 8 years, and left Pittsburgh at the bottom of the division with an 0-1 record.

It is the fourth and final of Disney's original theatrical featurettes adapted from the Pooh books by A. A. Milne. Hypothesis: A. A. Milne was an Author","output":"Based on the given context, yes, we can draw the following hypothesis: A. A. Milne was an author.  In the provided information, we learn that the Disney animated featurette, \\"Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore,\\" is based on two chapters from the books \\"Winnie-the-Pooh\\" and \\"The House at Pooh Corner.\\" These books are attributed to A. A. Milne in the context, which implies that he is the author of these books.  A. A. Milne, or Alan Alexander Milne, was indeed an English author known for his classic children's literature works, particularly the Winnie-the-Pooh series. Born in 1882, Milne was a prolific writer, producing novels, short stories, plays, and poetry, in addition to his beloved children's books. The first book in the Winnie-the-Pooh series, \\"Winnie-the-Pooh,\\" was published in 1926, followed by \\"The House at Pooh Corner\\" in 1928. The context also mentions Disney's adaptation of Milne's work in the form of theatrical featurettes. Disney produced a series of four original featurettes during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s that were inspired by A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh stories. These adaptations brought the classic tales and characters to life on the big screen and introduced them to new audiences worldwide. \\"Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore\\" is the fourth and final featurette in this original series. In summary, based on the information provided, we can confidently hypothesize that A. A. Milne was an author, as well as ascertain that he is best known for his Winnie-the-Pooh books and their subsequent adaptations into Disney featurettes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his previously timid \\"foreign man\\" character puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them. He catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro, who signs Kaufman as a client and immediately lands him a network TV series, Taxi, much to Kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit. Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on Taxi. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a \\"villain character\\" created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda. Once again, the gag is on the audience. Kaufman's profile increases with appearances on Saturday Night Live, but he has problems with his newfound fame. When performing live, audiences dislike his strange anti-humor and demand that he perform as Latka.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (August 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) is released from a mental institution after spending 22 years in confinement. Lila Loomis (Vera Miles), sister of Marion Crane, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the seven people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home behind the Bates Motel by Dr. Bill Raymond (Robert Loggia), who assures him everything will be fine. Norman is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey (Dennis Franz). The following day, Norman reports to a prearranged job as a dishwasher and busboy at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named Emma Spool (Claudia Bryar). One of his co-workers there is Mary Samuels (Meg Tilly), a young waitress. After work, Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned what had been a shabby but respectable motel into a sleazy adult one. Norman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \\"Mother\\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \\"Mother\\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. The next day, a drunk Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. As Norman begins to reconstruct his motel, he begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. At the same time, a... A:","output":"In \\"Psycho II,\\" the mysterious notes to Norman Bates are sent by \\"Mother.\\" Throughout the movie, Norman receives notes and phone calls from someone claiming to be his mother, causing him to question his sanity and whether \\"Mother\\" is still controlling his actions. The notes and other incidents seem to imply that Norman's mother is still a presence in his life, even after his release from the mental institution. However, as the story unfolds, it is revealed that there are other forces at work, attempting to manipulate Norman and drive him back to his former psychotic state. Emma Spool, the kindly old lady who runs the nearby diner where Norman works, is eventually revealed to be behind these mysterious incidents. She claims to be Norman's biological mother, and through her actions, she sets in motion a series of events that push Norman to the edge. Emma Spool had ulterior motives to manipulate Norman in an attempt to regain control over her lost son. She was creating an illusion of \\"Mother\\" to confuse and deceive him. However, it is worth noting that there is a possibility that Emma may not have been the only person involved in manipulating Norman with the mysterious notes, as Mary Samuels, a young waitress who becomes Norman's friend, is also aware of the truth about \\"Mother\\" and is working with Dr. Bill Raymond to try to keep Norman's sanity in check. In conclusion, the primary sender of the mysterious notes to Norman Bates in \\"Psycho II\\" is Emma Spool, who claims to be his real mother. Her actions are an effort to manipulate Norman and drive him back to his former psychotic state, believing that they can be a family again. This reveal adds a layer of complexity to an already intricate plot full of suspense, mystery, and psychological manipulation. When considering whether to invest in a film proposal like this, it is essential to examine the depth of the characters, the intricacy of the plot, and its potential to engage audiences with intense suspense and thought-provoking themes."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a news article: A zoo in southwestern Japan was forced to backpedal on its decision to name a baby Japanese monkey “Charlotte” in honour of the newborn British princess after protests that the move was disrespectful to the royal family.      The Takasakiyama Natural Zoological Garden, popular among visitors as a feeding ground for wild macaques inhabiting the surrounding area, launches a public poll for naming the first macaque born each year.      The name had been inspired by Charlotte Elizabeth Diana, the newborn second child of Britain’s Prince William and his wife Catherine. She is the younger sister to Prince George, who is in line to inherit the British throne.      It was the top choice with 59 of 853 total votes. Also in the running were Kei, after Japanese tennis player Kei Nishikori, and Elsa, a character in the Disney film Frozen.      ”The name was publicly solicited and Charlotte suddenly became the most popular choice – with 59 votes out of the total 853 – after the British baby princess’s name was announced,” a zoo official said. “There was no vote for ‘Charlotte’ before the Monday night announcement.”      The zoo announced the naming after a zookeeper spotted this year’s firstborn, a healthy baby girl, clinging to her mother yesterday.      But the zoo soon met a barrage of phone calls and emails demanding a retraction and asking the zoo to imagine what the Japanese people would think if a British monkey were named after a member of Japan’s imperial family.      “Since we announced the name we’ve been receiving calls and emails from people mostly complaining that it is rude to British people” to give a monkey the same name as a member of their royal family, the zoo official said.      “This morning a TV commentator said he thinks it is alright, but most voices are against the idea,” he added.      A zoo official reached for comment said they are discussing a possible name change for the baby macaque.      Princess Charlotte’s birth caused an outbreak of patriotic fervour in Britain, where the press and public lauded her names, seen as a triple homage to her grandfather Prince Charles, great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II and William’s late mother Diana.      Britain’s royals are immensely popular in Japan, where their easy familiarity with the public stands in marked contrast to the austere image of the country’s own imperial clan.      A recent visit by Prince William – who left heavily pregnant Kate at home – was followed in minute detail by Japan’s media, which revelled in the chance to show pictures of him dressed as a samurai lord. ||||| TOKYO (AP) — A Japanese zoo has apologized for naming a baby monkey Charlotte after the newborn British princess following complaints at home.

The Japanese... (Associated Press)      The Takasakiyama Natural Zoological Garden said Thursday it was considering renaming the macaque. It was flooded with angry calls and emails Wednesday hours after announcing the name for its first monkey born this year, a tradition at the city-run zoo in southern Japan.      Charlotte was the favorite in a public ballot, receiving 59 out of 853 votes in just over a month until Wednesday, when the female monkey was born.      Opponents largely said giving the princess' name to a monkey is disrespectful to British royals. According to zoo official Akira Asano, some of them said that the Japanese people would feel offended if a monkey were named after Japanese princesses.      He said the zoo has also received support for Charlotte, and the views are now largely divided.      \\"We deeply apologize for causing trouble to many people over the naming of the first baby (monkey),\\" said a statement posted on the zoo website. \\"We take these opinions seriously.\\"      Asano said he was not aware of any complaints from British citizens.      Officials of the zoo and the city of Oita were still discussing what to do with the monkey's name.      The British Embassy in Tokyo declined to comment, while Japan's foreign ministry said it was not involved with the issue. ||||| Image copyright AFP Image caption More than 1,300 monkeys roam freely at the zoo in southern Japan      A Japanese zoo has apologised after naming a baby monkey Charlotte in honour of the newborn British princess, it's reported.      The Takasakiyama Zoo, in southern Japan, was inundated with complaints after announcing the female macaque monkey's name on Wednesday, the Kyodo news agency reports. The zoo says the name was chosen after a public vote, a tradition for their first newborn macaque monkey each year. Charlotte received the most votes, although it wasn't exactly a runaway winner, with 59 out of 853 people choosing it.      But other members of the public felt that it was disrespectful to the British royal family to name a monkey after a princess.

Q: China’s Defense Ministry said Thursday that a U.S. decision to disinvite China from a major international maritime exercise is “unconstructive.” A ministry statement said despite the decision, China will continue playing a role in “maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.” The United States announced its move Wednesday, saying Beijing’s “destabilizing behavior” in the South China Sea is inconsistent with the principles of the U.S.-led drill. “China’s continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serve to raise tensions and destabilize the region,” read a statement from Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Since 2014, China has taken part in RIMPAC, the world’s largest international maritime drill, which is held every two years in Hawaii.

Assertive: China's Defense Ministry has referred to the U.S. decision as \\"unconstructive\\" and reaffirmed China's commitment to playing a role in maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. 2. Expanding its military presence: The text highlights China's construction of man-made islands in the South China Sea, some of which have been militarized. This could indicate China's intent to expand its military presence. 3. Concerning in terms of regional stability: The U.S. has accused China of \\"destabilizing behavior\\" in the South China Sea. Additionally, the Pentagon's statement claims that China's deployment of anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missile systems, and electronic jammers to contested features in the South China Sea raises tensions and destabilizes the region. 4. Not necessarily seeking confrontation: Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has stated that China's activity in the South China Sea is for self-defense and on a much smaller scale compared to the United States' military actions in Hawaii and Guam.

Here is an article: Obama Remembers 2008 Economic Collapse: The president said that the recovery needed more help and that Republicans in Congress did not seem focused on growing the economy and building the middle class. WASHINGTON â President Obama on Monday seized on the fifth anniversary of the 2008 financial collapse to warn that House Republicans would reverse the gains made and willfully cause âeconomic chaosâ with the uncompromising stands they have staked out on looming budget deadlines. âBudget battles and debates, those are as old as the republic,â Mr. Obama said before a friendly audience assembled in a White House annex. But, he added, âI cannot remember a time when one faction of one party promises economic chaos if it canât get 100 percent of what it wants.â A bloc of conservative House Republicans have said that unless Mr. Obamaâs signature health insurance law is delayed or repealed, they will not support financing for government operations in the new fiscal year starting Oct. 1 or an essential increase in the nationâs borrowing limit in mid-October. Failure to act on federal funding would provoke a government shutdown; even worse, failing to increase the debt limit would leave the government unable to pay bills and creditors and ultimately threaten the nationâs default. âThe last time the same crew threatened this course of action back in 2011, even the mere suggestion of default slowed our economic growth,â Mr. Obama said, recalling that summerâs market-rattling showdown. Mr. Obamaâs remarks followed his administrationâs release of a report chronicling the actions taken since 2008 to encourage job creation, save the auto industry, revive and regulate banking, and expand education opportunities. But he spoke at a time when the economy, as he acknowledged, is still struggling to create enough jobs and his agenda faces opposition mostly from Republicans but also from some Democrats increasingly emboldened against a second-term lame-duck president. Still, on the budget fight, most Democrats in Congress support the president, and with his comments he sought to rally them and to set up Republicans for blame should the fiscal fights end badly. Mr. Obama noted that in the past Republicans fought for more spending cuts to reduce deficits but that now, with annual deficits declining, they were making their fight over the health care law. âThe Affordable Care Act has been the law for three and a half years now,â Mr. Obama said. âIt passed both houses of Congress. The Supreme Court ruled it constitutional. It was an issue in last yearâs election, and the candidate who called for repeal lost. The Republicans in the House have tried to repeal or sabotage it about 40 times. They failed every time. Meanwhile the law has already helped millions of Americans.â The president repeated his warning against âself-inflicted woundsâ at the event, which was moved from the Rose Garden to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building because of rain. He proceeded with the event even as a shooting unfolded at a naval office building in Southeast Washington. Mr. Obama was joined onstage by a group of people that White House officials said included âsmall-business owners, construction workers, homeowners, consumers and tax cut recipients.â The president has struggled for years to balance the desire to claim credit for a slowly improving economy against the need to make sure he acknowledges the pain that many people still feel. At the event on Monday, Mr. Obama recalled how close the country, and the world, came to another depression after the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008. The Lehman bankruptcy caused the credit markets to seize up, the unemployment rate to sour and economic activity to plummet. Mr. Obama and his allies have for a long time said that the administrationâs actions in early 2009, while extremely unpopular, were critical to holding off a worse collapse. Those include the decision to support President George W. Bushâs bailout of Wall Street, Mr. Obamaâs own bailout for the auto industry and the passage of the economic stimulus program. But while the unemployment rate has fallen to 7.3 percent â down from a high of 10.1 percent in late 2009 â millions of Americans are still struggling to find a job, and millions more are working at low-wage or part-time jobs and having trouble making ends meet. That has been Mr. Obamaâs message in the last several months as he has delivered speeches arguing for what he calls a âbetter bargain for the middle class.â In those speeches, he argues for investments in infrastructure, education, college aid and housing as a way to help middle-class Americans and those trying to get into the middle class. The president is scheduled to deliver another one of his âbetter bargainâ speeches in Kansas City, Mo., on Friday when he visits a Ford Motor Company assembly plant.

Andrew Cuomo says a storm-related travel ban will go into effect on all New York City-area roads at 11 p.m., along with a shutdown of the city's subway system and commuter rails.      People walk in a light snowfall, Monday, Jan. 26, 2015 in New York. The National Weather Service says accumulations of 18 to 24 inches are possible by Tuesday afternoon. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) (Associated Press)      Cuomo says only emergency personnel will be allowed on roadways in 13 counties, including New York City and Long Island, after that point. Anyone else caught driving will get a summons for up to 300.      The governor says the ban is a safety precaution, to avoid potential dangerous situations of people getting stranded in their vehicles in the snow.      The subway system shutdown allows subway cars to be put away safely in places where they can be put back in service more quickly when the storm is over. ||||| BLIZZARD '15: THE LATEST      Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York have implemented overnight travel restrictions.      Seven states have made emergency declarations.      New York's LaGuardia Airport will shut down Tuesday.      Facebook      Twitter      Google Plus      Embed autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog      —      BY ERIN McCLAM      Tens of millions of people in the Northeast hunkered down on Monday for a historic blizzard that was expected to drop more than 2 feet of snow, whipped around by winds approaching hurricane force — enough to bring New York, Boston and most of the northeast corridor to an eerie standstill.      More than 7,000 flights were scrapped, and the major airlines warned that practically nothing would take off or land in New York, Boston and Philadelphia as the worst of the storm sweeps in overnight and Tuesday morning.      Store shelves emptied, schools shut their doors, and authorities either pleaded with people to stay home or outright closed the roads to all but emergency vehicles.      The snow began to lighten up in New York around 8 p.m., but Mayor Bill de Blasio warned residents not to drop their vigilance. He cited forecasts for snow to fall at a rate of 2 to 4 inches per hour overnight, although meteorologists later predicted only about 1- 2 inches per hour in the city around midnight.      By 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, there was 5.5 inches on the ground in New York's Central Park, with forecasts for an additional 5 to 8 inches, according to The Weather Channel. Boston's Logan Airport had 2.3 inches after midnight with 15-24\\" more expected, and Hartford, Conn., had 2 inches with another 10-16\\" on the way.      \\"This snow is going to come in very fast. There'll be fast accumulation, there'll be drifts, there'll be visibility problems, there'll be high winds,\\" de Blasio said, adding that gusts in the city could surpass 60 mph. \\"That is a dangerous situation.\\"      City subways and suburban commuter rails stopped running at 11 p.m. ET Monday under orders from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. A road travel restriction began at the same time, meaning that all cars other than emergency vehicles were banned in 13 counties, including those in New York City and Long Island.      \\"It's dangerous to be out there now. It's going to get more dangerous. And at one point it's irresponsible,\\" Cuomo said.      A similar travel ban in New Jersey began at 11 p.m. ET, Gov. Chris Christie announced. The move excludes emergency and public safety personnel, utility companies and others assisting in storm recovery. It will be \\"subject to revocation at daybreak depending on conditions then,\\" Christie said on Twitter.      Boston suspended all public transit for Tuesday and Massachusetts officials pleaded for people to go home and keep put. \\"The bottom line is it's going to be the kind of night where the best thing anyone can do is to stay inside,\\" Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said.

No flights will arrive at or depart from LaGuardia Airport in New York on Tuesday, while \\"minimal flight activity\\" is expected at the region's other airports, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said.      At John F. Kennedy Airport, passengers on at least one outbound Virgin Atlantic flight had to sit on the tarmac for about 6 hours before being stuck back at the terminal.      \\"There's nothing to drink, nothing to eat. It's a disaster,\\" said Alexis Dehasse, a music producer who was aboard Flight VS4 to London, which was supposed to take off at 6:30 p.m. but dumped passengers back at the gate after midnight after dealing with de-icing and a sick passenger.      Travelers wait at JFK airport early Tuesday, Jan. 27 after a Virgin Atlantic flight was cancelled after six hours on the tarmac. Alexis Dehasse      Dehasse said he had a friend in town he could stay with — but road closures meant there was no way to leave the airport. \\"I'm coming down with the flu,\\" he told NBC News. \\"It's a nightmare.\\"      Another passenger, Felix Kunze, 29, a Brooklyn photographer going to England for a visit, said the airline just handed out 15 vouchers for McDonald's, the only thing open.      \\"I can't even get back to Brooklyn. I have friends who will come get me but they can't because the roads are closed.\\" Asked to sum up the experience he said, \\"It was hopeful, hopeful, hopeful right up until the last minute with the most crushing final defeat of horror.\\"      we're stuck at JFK, no roads, no cabs, no stores open, no hotel rooms.

It's going to pack a punch. What you're going to see in a few hours is something that hits very hard and very fast.\\"      Related:      At least 60 million people were under a winter weather alert, and 28 million were in the possible path of blizzard conditions — heavy snow whipped around by ferocious wind. Seven states — Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire — declared emergencies.      Rush hour came early in many places, as commuters raced home before the brunt of the storm hit. New York's Penn Station was jammed with riders trying to board the day's last trains. Broadway went dark, and Central Park was closed. Banks branches shuttered early. Power crews from as far as Michigan traveled east to help deal with likely outages.      At least one town in Massachusetts turned off power preemptively, while at least 3000 customers in the Bay state and hundreds of people in Connecticut lost electricity overnight, utility officials said..      Forecast snow totals were changing quickly, but The Weather Channel said some places outside Boston and on Long Island, New York, could get more than 2 feet of snow. The Massachusetts coast and eastern Long Island could each see 30 inches, The Weather Channel reported.      Bill Karins, a meteorologist for NBC News, called for snow totals of 20 inches in Hartford, Connecticut, 18 inches in New York and 10 inches in Philadelphia.      The wind forecasts were nightmarish: The Weather Channel called for gusts of 65 mph in Plymouth, Massachusetts, just shy of hurricane force, 60 mph in Boston and 50 mph in New York.      The worst of it was expected Monday overnight and Tuesday morning. Blizzard warnings covered 250 miles of the Northeast while snow fell steadily for most of the day Monday across the region and authorities warned that it would get much heavier.      \\"Don't panic. Let's get this thing right,\\" Mayor Marty Walsh of Boston told The Weather Channel. \\"Keep an eye on the news, keep an eye on the forecast.\\"      It the snowstorm intensifies, it could threaten Boston's record — 27.6 inches, over two days in February 2003. It could also be among the biggest in history in New York, where the record is 26.9 inches, set in February 2006.      New York City Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia said that keeping people off the roads would help her crews clear them as efficiently as possible overnight. But she warned residents not to expect things to be in great condition in the early morning. \\"It will not be done when you wake up in the morning. It's going to keep going,\\" Garcia said.

He noted that people were already descending on grocery stores.      \\"Don't know why the rush on bread, but what the heck,\\" he told reporters.      Travel was treacherous. Part of Interstate 81 was shut down near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania after a tractor-trailer jack-knifed and a beer truck crashed into the median. No injuries were reported.      Schools in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Connecticut announced they were closing early or altogether and Boston officials canceled school through Wednesday.      The state of Massachusetts had 250,000 tons of salt and 420,000 gallons of deicing liquid at the ready. Boston had 700 pieces of equipment to prepare the roads and plow them later.      \\"Very highly populated areas of the Northeast are going to get crushed with snow,\\" said Tom Moore, coordinating meteorologist for The Weather Channel. \\"Everywhere ... you're going to get hit very hard by this storm.\\"      Coastal Massachusetts braced for wind gusts that could reach 75 mph, enough when paired with the snow to create whiteout conditions.      With a big sendoff from the city of Boston, the Super Bowl-bound New England Patriots got out of town just before the storm arrived. The team was headed for Phoenix, where the temperature will reach the high 60s.      The blizzard threat came after millions of Americans across the Northeast awoke Saturday to a blanket of snow that was later doused with rain, leaving New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania a sloppy mess.      Scott Flath, general manager of Long Island Hardware in Bohemia, New York, said his store is well-stocked but that many of his customers are making their first winter supply runs of the season.

The travel restrictions only permit emergency personnel on the roads of 13 counties which feature New York City and Long Island. Anyone else caught driving could face a summons of up to 300. It is a preventative measure to avert possible hazardous situations, like people getting stranded in snow-covered vehicles. The public transportation shutdown enables safer storage of subway cars and their quicker transition back into service post-storm. Essential travel bans have also been observed in Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York overnight. Seven states have declared emergencies, and LaGuardia Airport in New York is planning to close down on Tuesday.  The blizzard caused significant disruptions, with over 7,000 flights cancelled, and major airlines advised that no flights would take off or land in cities such as New York, Boston, and Philadelphia owing to the escalating severity of the storm. The snowstorm is expected to persist, with a forecast for heavy snowfall at a rate of around 2-4 inches per hour overnight, contributing to the already present 5.5 inches of snow on the ground in New York's Central Park. Cities imposed strict restrictions on all non-emergency travel, and closures of public transport and suburban rail services were enforced under orders from Governor Cuomo. New Jersey announced a similar ban on travel, excluding emergency and utility personnel. As the storm intensified, Massachusetts officials appealed to the public to stay indoors. Amtrak suspended its Northeast Regional and Acela Express services between New York and Boston. Even LaGuardia Airport announced no flight movement for Tuesday. In addition, scores of passengers were stranded at the airport due to road closures.

Context: A 2006 study found Ashkenazi Jews to be a clear, homogeneous genetic subgroup. Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort – that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews. This trend keeps Ashkenazi genes prevalent and also helps researchers further study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease. It is noteworthy that these Haredi Jews often have extremely large families.

Superferry 14 was a large ferry destroyed by a bomb on 27 February 2004, killing 116 people in the Philippines' worst terrorist attack and the world's deadliest terrorist attack at sea. On that day, the 10,192 ton ferry sailed out of Manila with about 900 passengers and crew on board. A television set filled with 8 lb.  of TNT had been placed on board. 90 minutes out of port, the bomb exploded. 63 people were killed instantly and 53 were missing and presumed dead. Despite claims from terrorist groups, the blast was initially thought to have been an accident caused by a gas explosion. However, after divers righted the ferry five months after it had sunk, they found evidence of a bomb blast. A man called Redendo Cain Dellosa admitted to planting the bomb for Abu Sayyaf. Six suspects were arrested in connection with the bombing while the masterminds, Khadaffy Janjalani and Abu Sulaiman, were killed. Answer this question based on the article: How many passenger and crew survived Philippines worst terrorist attack on the Superferry 14?","output":"On the Superferry 14, there were about 900 passengers and crew on board. 63 people were killed instantly, and 53 people were missing and presumed dead, which makes a total of 116 people. To find out how many people survived, we will subtract the number of people who died from the total number of people on board: 900 - 116 = 784 people.

He  was soon performing around 120 concerts a year, generally to great critical acclaim, and in  April 1921 reached a wider audience by performing in a cinema, New York's Capitol Theatre. Grainger  commented that the huge audiences at these cinema concerts often showed greater appreciation for his playing than those at established concert venues such as Carnegie Hall and the Aeolian. In the summer of 1919 he led a course in piano technique at Chicago Musical College, the first of many such educational duties he would undertake in later years.Amid his concert and teaching duties, Grainger found time to re-score many of his works (a habit he continued throughout his life) and also to compose new pieces: his Children's March: Over the Hills and Far Away, and the orchestral version of The Power of Rome and the Christian Heart both originated in this period.   He also began to develop the technique of elastic scoring, a form of flexible orchestration  which enabled works to be  performed by different numbers of players and instrument types, from small chamber groups  up to full orchestral strength.In April 1921 Grainger moved with his mother to a large house in White Plains, New York.

The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores).  - Slovenia, officially the Republic of Slovenia (Slovene: , abbr.: \\"RS\\"), is a nation state in southern Central Europe, located at the crossroads of main European cultural and trade routes. It is bordered by Italy to the west, Austria to the north, Hungary to the northeast, Croatia to the south and southeast, and the Adriatic Sea to the southwest. It covers and has a population of 2.06 million. It is a parliamentary republic and a member of the United Nations, European Union, and NATO. The capital and largest city is Ljubljana.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - Dragotin Cvetko ( 19 September 1911 -- 2 September 1993 ) was a Slovenian composer and musicologist .  - Sheet music is a handwritten or printed form of music notation that uses modern musical symbols to indicate the pitches (melodies), rhythms and/or chords of a song or instrumental musical piece. Like its analogs  printed books or pamphlets in English, Arabic or other languages  the medium of sheet music typically is paper (or, in earlier centuries, papyrus or parchment), although the access to musical notation since the 1980s has included the presentation of musical notation on computer screens and the development of scorewriter computer programs that can notate a song or piece electronically, and, in some cases, \\"play back\\" the notated music using a synthesizer or virtual instruments.  - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor.

The term -0*f equals 0 because any number multiplied by zero always equals zero. So, now the equation transforms from f - 1 = -0*f to f - 1 = 0. Afterward, let's isolate the variable \\"f\\" by using the simple algebraic manipulation. To do this, add 1 to both sides of the equation. The \\"+ 1\\" on the left side cancels out the \\"- 1\\" on the left side, so the \\"f\\" alone remains on the left side of the equation: f - 1 + 1 = 0 + 1  This simplifies to: f = 1  Therefore, the solution to the equation f - 1 = -0*f is f = 1. This means that the value of f that makes the original equation true is 1. Whenever you substitute 1 for f back into the equation, it should satisfy the given equation. Therefore, let's check our solution: f - 1 = -0*f Substitute f = 1, 1 - 1 = -0 * 1 0 = 0 Both the left hand side equals the right hand side, therefore the solution f = 1 is correct.

What is the answer?","output":"A boomslang (Dispholidus typus) is a type of creature belonging to the reptile class, specifically a venomous snake. The name 'boomslang' originates from the Afrikaans and Dutch languages, in which the words 'boom' means 'tree' and 'slang' means 'snake,' essentially translating to \\"tree snake.\\" The boomslang is native to sub-Saharan Africa and is predominantly found in regions such as South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Swaziland. The boomslang is a medium-sized snake, typically ranging from 3.3 to 5.2 feet (1 to 1.6 meters) in length. The snake exhibits sexual dimorphism, with males usually exhibiting vibrant green hues, while females and juveniles display a more subdued brown coloration. These colors enable the boomslang to camouflage itself effectively amongst the trees and bushes in its typical habitat. As an arboreal snake, the boomslang spends most of its time in trees and shrubs in search of prey, which usually consists of chameleons, small mammals, birds, and eggs. It is well-adapted for climbing, showcasing incredible agility as it navigates the tops of trees and uses its keen eyesight to spot potential prey from a distance. The boomslang possesses a potent hemotoxic venom, which impacts the blood clotting process and leads to uncontrolled, potentially fatal internal and external bleeding in its victims. This snake has rear fangs set far back in its mouth, requiring it to chew on its prey to effectively introduce venom into the wound. While not generally aggressive, the boomslang may become defensive if harassed or threatened, and its venom can be dangerous to humans. In the event of a bite, the victim should seek immediate medical attention. Despite its dangerous reputation, the boomslang plays an essential role in its ecosystem by maintaining the balance of its prey populations and acting as a food source for predators such as birds of prey and other larger snakes. This fascinating reptile showcases the beauty and diversity of ambushing predators in the natural world and provides a glimpse into the incredible adaptations of the animal kingdom."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was, of course, Pete. Pete was the night shift guy at Crossroads Detox across town. Ray called it the Jesus Shop because it was wholly supported by a contingent of local churches who saw addicts as a potential ministry. Apparently Jesus saved--not only from sin and hell, but also from Dark Eyed Jim Beam. Pete was a relatively innocuous born again fundie who volunteered his time two or three nights a week. When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block. He'd been pulling shifts for about six months, knew nothing about drugs beyond that bad people used them to escape their problems and that they were tools of Satan, and he always needed Ray's advice about one thing or another. This arrangement was not problematic as Pete had long ago given up trying to convert him. Pete was also the only guy in the city who was, as Ray figured it, making less money than he was at such an hour. In return for Ray's magnanimity, Pete had done Ray's taxes for free last year. They had never actually met, though Ray had faxed him the tax forms and Pete had faxed back a photo of his two pre-teen daughters and his geriatric Lab. \\"What's the problem?\\" Ray asked. \\"I have a recalcitrant.\\" That's what he called them, the drunk and definitely disorderly.

Context: The War of Jenkins' Ear  was a conflict between Britain and Spain lasting from 1739 to 1748, with major operations largely ended by 1742. Its unusual name, coined by Thomas Carlyle in 1858, refers to an ear severed from Robert Jenkins, a captain of a British merchant ship. There is no evidence of the stories that the severed ear was exhibited before the British Parliament. The seeds of conflict began with the separation of an ear from Jenkins following the boarding of his vessel by Spanish coast guards in 1731, eight years before the war began. Popular response to the incident was tepid until several years later when opposition politicians and the British South Sea Company hoped to spur outrage against Spain, believing that a victorious war would improve Britain's trading opportunities in the Caribbean. Also ostensibly providing the impetus to war against the Spanish Empire was a desire to pressure the Spanish not to renege on the lucrative asiento contract, which gave British slavers permission to sell slaves in Spanish America. The war resulted in heavy British casualties in North America. After 1742, the war was subsumed by the wider War of the Austrian Succession, which involved most of the powers of Europe. Peace arrived with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. From the British perspective, the war was notable because it was the first time that a regiment of colonial American troops  was raised and placed \\"on the Establishment\\" - made a part of the regular British Army - and sent to fight outside North America. Question: How many more years after major operations largely ended did The War of Jenkins' Ear last for? Answer:","output":"After the major operations of The War of Jenkins' Ear largely ended in 1742, the conflict continued for six more years until its conclusion in 1748 with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. It is important to note that during this period, the war became subsumed by the wider War of the Austrian Succession, which involved most of the powers of Europe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Kilauea and Marina Kea, Hawaii Hawaii's volcanoes are known for their active eruptions and extraordinary scenes. Mauna Kea is around one million years old, while Kilauea is the youngest volcano in Hawaii and has been erupting continuously since 1983. The lava falls straight into the sea, creating fantastic forms of black rocks and smoke clouds. Mount Kelimutu, Indonesia Kelimutu's three mysterious crater lakes attract both scientists and tourists to the island of Flores in Indonesia's East Nusa Tenggara province.

Instead, it provides information about the consequence of the scandal (his resignation) without explaining the specific accusations against him. A more accurate and detailed answer would be: Richard Nixon was accused of being involved in the Watergate scandal, which was a major political scandal in the United States during the early 1970s. It began when five men were arrested for breaking into the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C., on June 17, 1972. The investigations that followed uncovered evidence of a massive cover-up within the Nixon administration. This cover-up involved multiple illegal activities, including abuse of power, bribery, obstruction of justice, and illegal wiretapping of political opponents. As a result, it was discovered that Nixon and his administration conspired to cover up their involvement in the break-in and to obstruct the subsequent investigation.

Fact 2: Birds have a high metabolic rate and a high energy requirement.  Given the two facts above, what mammals have a high energy requirement and generate heat? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the criteria for the answer. Based on the given facts, we need to find mammals that have a high energy requirement and generate heat. Step 2: Make a connection between the facts provided. Fact 1 states that mammals generate heat mainly by keeping their metabolic rate high. Fact 2 states that birds have a high metabolic rate and a high energy requirement. We can infer that in mammals, a high metabolic rate may also be associated with a high energy requirement. Step 3: Apply the connection to the mammals. Mammals with a high metabolic rate are likely to have a high energy requirement and generate heat.  Step 4: Provide examples of mammals that meet the criteria. Some examples of mammals with high energy requirements and generate heat are: 1. Bats: Bats have a high metabolic rate due to their active flight and need to maintain their body temperature, particularly during cold nights. 2. Shrews: Shrews have a very high metabolic rate because of their small size and need to eat almost constantly to maintain their energy levels. 3. Arctic mammals like the polar bear and Arctic fox: These mammals need to maintain a high metabolic rate to keep warm in extremely cold environments. 4. Endothermic marine mammals like whales, dolphins, and seals: These mammals need to maintain a high energy requirement to generate heat to survive in cold water temperatures. In conclusion, mammals that have a high energy requirement and generate heat are those with high metabolic rates, usually due to their size, activity level, or living in extreme environmental conditions.

Question: suppose a lot of bacteria will enter happens, how will it affect LESS SEVERE disease occurring.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","output":"B: less Step 1: Analyze the question The question asks how the presence of a large amount of bacteria entering a wound will affect the occurrence of a LESS SEVERE disease. We will look at the relationship between the amount of bacteria and the severity of the disease. Step 2: Recall the process The given process describes how a skin cut or damage can lead to a bacterial infection, which can cause symptoms and eventually develop into a disease. The key point to note here is that the severity of the disease is most likely related to the number of bacteria and how fast they reproduce and spread. Step 3: Relate the quantity of bacteria to disease severity If a large number of bacteria enter the wound, it is reasonable to assume that the infection may become more severe, as there will be more bacteria initially reproducing and spreading throughout the body. This would likely lead to a more severe disease. Step 4: Determine the effect on less severe disease occurrence Given that a higher number of bacteria increases the severity of infection, it is likely that the occurrence of a less severe disease will be decreased. This is because the large amount of bacteria would make it more difficult for the body to effectively fight off the infection, resulting in a more severe disease. Step 5: Choose the appropriate answer The answer is B: less. The presence of a large amount of bacteria entering a wound will likely lead to a decreased occurrence of less severe disease, as the body may struggle to effectively fight off the increased bacterial load, resulting in a more severe disease overall."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. This week, fundamental disagreements over what kind of turn it will take are centre stage in Washington, Tehran and many other capitals. The document is now in the public domain, being carefully perused and passionately picked apart. Battle lines are being drawn by lawmakers at the US Congress, who have 60 days to review the deal. In Iran, too, opponents and advocates in parliament are vociferously taking sides. A growing swirl of reaction underlines that an agreement to significantly curb Iran's nuclear programme for 10 to 15 years in exchange for the lifting of sanctions - as momentous as that is - is being widely seen as much more than an arms control accord. US President Barack Obama's constant refrain is that this deal \\"solves one particular problem, which is making sure they don't have a bomb\\". But for many, it is also a moment laced with both political potential as well as peril. It could amount not just to a turning point, but a possible \\"transformation\\" of Iran and its place in the region and beyond. The issue matters because even before the deal enters into force, many are asking what kind of Iran will there be a decade on, when many of the restrictions on its nuclear programme expire. Will an Iran emerge that has resolved its enmities with regional rivals and opened up at home, or a nuclear threshold state still be seen in many capitals as a threat? For Iran, the change, at least on the level of significant symbols, is already in train. This week began with the unanimous vote at the UN Security Council on a new resolution that paves the way for the eventual lifting of most international sanctions once Iran complies with its obligations under the nuclear agreement. \\"Iran never got a fair treatment from â€ª#UNSC in the last 35 yrs,\\" wrote Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Twitter. \\"Expect to see evidence of 'fundamental shift' promised in today's resolution.\\" For Mr Zarif, who was the permanent representative to the UN in New York when sanctions were first imposed by the Security Council in 2006, removing the stigma embodied in seven punishing UN resolutions was a crucial step towards recognition of Iran's rightful place at the world's top tables. And for Iran's negotiators, there is more to it than that. \\"Our biggest achievement is the stamp by the UN Security Council confirming [uranium] enrichment in Iran,\\" Mr Zarif told the Iranian parliament on Tuesday when he urged MPs to back what he called a \\"balanced\\" deal. The accord severely diminishes Iran's nuclear infrastructure, including its level of uranium enrichment. But it does not completely dismantle its programme or achieve the \\"zero enrichment\\" the deal's strongest critics in the US and Israel argue should still be the goal. But while a chorus of criticism rises, Iran's place on the geopolitical map is already changing. There is a diplomatic dash to visit this newest must-see destination. No sooner was the news announced in Vienna then Germany's Vice-Chancellor and Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel was on his way to Tehran, along with a 100-member delegation, including leading business executives, for the highest level visit in 13 years. France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius is heading there next week with French firms keen to take advantage of a new opening. On Monday, the European Union also approved the Iran deal, paving the way for the end of European sanctions. But restrictions linked to human rights issues will remain in place as well as an arms embargo which, under the nuclear accord, will not be lifted for the next five to eight years. Europe's agenda is not just about the opportunities which now emerge but also the risks. Mr Gabriel, mindful of his country's close ties to Israel, also used his visit to emphasise that \\"there can be no political questioning of the right of Israel to exist\\". Regional worries are what drive the post-deal travel diaries of top American officials. Defence Secretary Ashton Carter immediately set off for Israel with pledges of military support to an ally that has vowed to do all in its power to destroy the Iran deal. Secretary of State John Kerry will soon be travelling to the Gulf to reassure Arab leaders of Washington's backing to help them \\"push back\\" against Iranian involvement in the region. In public, Arab officials have given the deal a guarded welcome. In private many are sharply critical of what they view as the destabilising prospect of a resurgent Iran, freed from punishing sanctions with money to spend in what are seen as proxy wars in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. \\"The choice belongs, now, to Iran,\\" wrote UAE Foreign Minister Anwar Gargash in an op-ed for the Financial Times. \\"On our list of priorities, our region is our highest priority,\\" Mr Zarif told me in an interview in Vienna after the deal was announced. But he placed the onus to start this new dialogue on the other side. \\"We call on our neighbours to set aside illusions about being able to portray Iran as a threat and start engaging seriously,\\" he said. If Iran can make a deal with the \\"The Great Satan\\", could it not do the same with regional heavyweights like Saudi Arabia, especially when threats like the rise of the so-called Islamic State pose dangers to all? Poisonous sectarian fault lines in the region and conflicting political agendas on battlefields like Syria make a dialogue that much harder closer to home. \\"We'll be watching Iran over the next year to see if this is a new face or just a new phase,\\" is how one Arab ambassador put it. Those hoping for change point to the possibilities offered in a keynote speech in April by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. \\"If the other side [the US] sets aside its bad behaviour, this will become a new experience for us that will tell us we can also negotiate with them about other issues,\\" he said. Others hold up his more strident comments this week - in a speech marked by crowds chanting the old slogans of \\"Death to America and Israel\\"- that \\"US policies in the region are 180 degrees in contrast to Iran's policies\\". Iranians who spilled onto the streets in joyous celebration last week see in this deal the prospect of greater political and personal freedoms. Iranian business executives, relieved to once again have access to international markets, are pushing for economic reform and a crackdown on corruption to make this new opening even wider. They know all too well that as their country moves forward, it could also lurch back as conservative elements retaliate against this greater engagement with the West. \\"In the Middle East, a decade is an eternity,\\" remarked former Israeli spy chief Efraim Halevy in an op-ed in Yedioth Ahronoth that urged Israeli officials not to make \\"a rush at Washington\\" to try to destroy the deal. For now, negotiators for the world powers who bargained long and hard insist there is now one main question: \\"Does it stop Iran from producing a bomb?\\" Their answer is a resounding \\"yes\\". Iran's reply is that it never intended to produce one. Many other questions will continue to be asked, and, like the main question, will soon be answered. This article was about:","output":"This article talks about how a recent agreement to limit Iran's nuclear program has made a significant impact in the world.

Whether you are starting a business from the ground up or are managing an existing business, you need to examine your staffing needs. You need to think about the tasks that get done and decide how much one person can do. This analysis may show you that you need more people than you have, or it may tell you that you need to reassign staff that you already have. Focus on the tasks rather than individual people and personalities.  For example, suppose you are managing a store that employs sales clerks. You could analyze your sales records and find when your busy periods occur. Then hire an additional clerk for the busiest times of the day. If you observe an employee who seems to have too much free time, you should consider increasing that employee's duties. If you don't have additional work for that employee, you may need to cut back the hours or eliminate the position completely. Develop written job descriptions for each role in your business. The job description should include an outline of the tasks to be performed, the expected working hours, the person supervising the role, and a general statement of goals for the position. Advertise, interview, and hire staff members who will best serve each position.  For more help on hiring, you may want to read this helpful article. As part of your hiring process, if you are starting a new business, you must attend to certain federal and state regulations. You need to get a federal employer identification number (FEIN), register with your state’s labor office, and obtain worker’s compensation insurance. Having employees requires you to pay your employees, on time and correctly. You need a reliable payroll system that accounts for employee hours and pay rates. You must withhold the proper amounts for federal, state and local taxes, and deposit those as required with the taxing authorities. Establish a consistent system for payment, whether weekly or bi-weekly. For help with federal tax requirements, the IRS has put out two publications, the Employer’s Tax Guide, Publication 15, and the Employer’s Supplemental Tax Guide, Publication 15a. You can find both publications at the IRS publications page, at www.irs.gov/forms-pubs. An employee handbook is a written collection of all the rules and expectations for your staff. It should also set out what the staff can expect from the company. It will explain the employees’ rights as well as the legal obligations for both employees and the employer. You should include the following topics in a well-designed employee handbook:  Anti-discrimination policies. Compensation and payroll schedules. Work schedules. Expected standards of conduct. Safety and security. Acceptable computer/technology use policy. Media relations. Leave policies and other employee benefits. A good manager will communicate regularly with staff. You need to know what they are observing in the business, how they feel about their jobs, and whether any problems are brewing. It also helps for the staff to hear from you and know, in advance, if any changes are coming or anything else that will affect their work. Regular communication can resolve many problems before they even start. Depending on the size of the business and your position as a manager, you may communicate through any or all of the following:  Regularly scheduled staff meetings. Written newsletter or other bulletins. Regular informal email communications. A company bulletin board (either a real physical bulletin board or an online virtual site). A shared calendar of events.

Although it might not be possible to wait to break a habit until you go on vacation, you might at least want to choose a time when you are not too stressed to work on breaking a bad habit. Try to be patient. Keep in mind that it can take anywhere from 18 to 66 days to break a habit. Don’t become discouraged if you find it difficult to break the habit at first. Remember to reward yourself. If you’ve had a great day where you did really well in your new habits and routines, praise yourself and give yourself a reward. Maybe eat a bowl of ice cream or go see a movie. Little rewards can affirm your progress, and they teach your brain to associate these new routines with pleasure. Perhaps you are struggling in a new career or you want to make a difference in your community. Ask an experienced person in that area to mentor you. Meet once a week or month to discuss your goals. Your mentor will share the struggles that they faced getting to the point where they are now. They can give you advice on your own hurdles and help you realize your potential. As you reinvent yourself, talk to your close friends about your progress. Tell them the kind of person you want to be, and as you face success and failure, talk through your thoughts and feelings. Good friends will provide positive affirmation, and a strong support group can increase your chances of success. If your friends tell you that you don’t need to change, try not to listen to them. They may have good intentions, but if you are unhappy with your current state of being, such advice can be discouraging. Thank them for their concern, but emphasize that this is something you want to continue. True friends will remain with you through the journey.","output":"Breaking bad habits involves a deep examination of one's behavior, identifying triggers, and implementing strategies to break the cycle.

Barbara Lee called the proposed platform of the Democratic party a \\"truly progressive platform draft.\\" | AP Photo Former Progressive Caucus co-chair hails DNC draft as 'imperfect' but 'truly progressive'      Rep. Barbara Lee, a former co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, is praising the draft of the 2016 Democratic Party platform as a \\"truly progressive platform draft\\" even though it doesn't include everything she wanted.      Lee's comments, shared first with POLITICO on Monday, follow the Democratic National Convention Drafting Committee approving the draft early Saturday. Fourteen of the 15 members of the committee supported the draft. Cornel West, a Sanders-backed member on the committee, abstained. The draft now goes before the entire platform committee in July during a meeting in Orlando.      Both former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders lauded the committee, made up of members picked mostly by the two candidates, for producing a draft satisfying most of their policy goals. Clinton senior policy adviser Maya Harris called the draft \\"the most ambitious and progressive platform our party has ever seen.\\"      The draft includes language opposing the death penalty (which Clinton supports under certain circumstances), supporting a 15 minimum wage, and calls for new legislation similar to the Glass-Steagall Wall Street reform Act, all of which have been priorities for Sanders and his liberal allies. It also pushes for expanding Social Security and improving the nation's infrastructure.      \\"We were able to unite around many progressive issues including the need to make sure all Americans earn at least 15 an hour and can join a union; asking the wealthy pay their fair share through a multi-millionaire surtax; breaking up too big to fail financial institutions that pose a systemic risk to the stability of our economy; expanding social security; helping those in poverty, in part through an expansion of the earned income tax credit for childless workers and expanding the child tax credit to lift more children out of poverty; increasing resources for community health centers; declaring our opposition to the Hyde and Helms amendments which restrict women’s access to safe abortions at home and abroad; and abolishing the death penalty,\\" Lee said in the statement set to go out Monday morning.      Sanders himself praised the draft as a \\"very good start\\" but said there's still more changes to be made.      \\"The platform drafted in St. Louis is a very good start, but there is no question that much more work remains to be done by the full Platform Committee when it meets in Orlando on July 8 and 9,\\" Sanders said in a statement on Sunday. Sanders also noted that the Clinton-backed allies on the drafting committee voted down a provision opposing Congress vote on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\\"      Lee conceded that the draft wasn't perfect as well and noted she opposed TPP but that overall it was a move in the right direction.      \\"I recognize there are bound to be some who are disappointed with the outcome. But our Party’s platform has always been both aspirational and imperfect. In fact, on issues like climate change, I voted with Senator Sanders, and didn't get everything I was hoping for. This is how our democracy functions. Additionally, as a member of Congress, I will continue to oppose TPP,\\" Lee said.             ||||| Just 24 hours after Bernie Sanders' big win in Michigan, he and Hillary Clinton are battling it out in the Sunshine State.      The two Democratic hopefuls are offering their final pitches to Florida voters before they hit the polls next Tuesday.      Here are the best lines of tonight's debate hosted by Univision and the Washington Post:      ON THE MICHIGAN PRIMARIES      CLINTON: “I was pleased that I got 100,000 more votes last night than my opponent and more delegates. So this is a marathon, and it's a marathon that can only be carried out by the kind of inclusive campaign that I'm running.\\"      “It was a very close race. We've had some of those. I've won some. I've lost some,” she added.      SANDERS: “We have come a long way in 10 months.”      “I believe that our message of the need for people to stand up and tell corporate America and Wall Street that they cannot have it all is resonating across this country.”      ON HILLARY CLINTON’S EMAIL CONTROVERSY      CLINTON: “There's a lot of questions in there. And I'm going to give the same answer I've been giving for many months.”      When asked by Univision’s Jorge Ramos whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted, Clinton fired back: “Oh, that's not going to happen. I'm not even answering that question.”      ON DONALD TRUMP      CLINTON: “I called him out when he was calling Mexicans rapists, when he was engaging in rhetoric that I found deeply offensive. I said, ‘Basta [enough].”      SANDERS: “I think that the American people are never going to elect a president who insults Mexicans, who insults Muslims, who insults women, who insults African-Americans and let us not forget that several years ago, Trump was in the middle of the so-called birther movement trying to delegitimize the president of the United States of America.      “My dad was born in Poland. I know a little bit about the immigrant experience. Nobody has ever asked me for my birth certificate. Maybe it has something to do with the color of my skin,” the Vermont senator added.      ON BERNIE SANDERS’ FLIP-FLOPPING ON IMMIGRATION      SANDERS: “What I believe right now is not only that we need comprehensive immigration reform. If the Congress does not do its job, as president of the United States I will use the executive powers of that office to do what has to be done to do what President Obama did and expand on that.”      ON DEPORTING UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS      CLINTON: “I will not deport children. I would not deport children. I do not want to deport family members, either. I want to prioritize who would be deported: violent criminals, people planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us.”      SANDERS: “I will not deport children from the United States of America.”      “I can make that promise,” Sanders repeated.      SANDERS vs. CLINTON’S RECORD      SANDERS: “I will stand -- my career, political career fighting for workers, fighting for the poorest people in this country. Madam Secretary, I will match my record against yours any day of the week.”      ON TRUMP’S WALL PROPOSAL      CLINTON: “He's talking about a very tall wall, a beautiful tall wall, the most beautiful tall wall, better than the Great Wall of China that would run the entire border, that he would somehow magically get the Mexican government to pay for, and, you know, it's just fantasy.”      ON CLINTON’S RELATIONSHIP WITH WALL STREET      SANDERS: “Secretary's words to Wall Street has really intimidated them, and that is why they have given her 15 million in campaign contributions.”      “Wait a minute. I just think it's worth pointing out that the leaders of the fossil fuel industry, the Koch brothers, have just paid to put up an ad praising senator Sanders,” Clinton interjected.      ON BENGHAZI      CLINTON: “This is not the first time we lost Americans in a terrorist attack. We lost 3,000 people on 9/11. We lost Americans serving in embassies in Tanzania and Kenya when my husband was president. We lost 250 Americans when Ronald Reagan was president in Beirut. At no other time were those tragedies politicized. Instead people said let's learn the lesson and save lives.”      ON COLLEGE TUITION      CLINTON: “The government has to quit making money off of lending money to young people to get their education.”      Sanders responded saying: “What secretary Clinton said is absolutely right. I think I said it many months before she said it, but thanks for copying a very good idea.”      Clinton touted back, “Senator Sanders has talked about free college for everybody, he's talked about universal single payer health care for everybody, and yet when you ask questions it's very hard to get answers.”      ON SANDERS      CLINTON: “I wish he would criticize and join me in criticizing George W. Bush, who I think wrecked the economy and created the conditions for the great recession.”      SANDERS: “I gather Secretary Clinton hasn't listened to too many of my speeches or followed my work in the congress because very few people stood up to George W. Bush, whether it was the war in Iraq or any other of his policies.”      ON US INTERVENTIONS IN LATIN AMERICA      SANDERS: “The United States was wrong to try to invade Cuba. The United States was wrong trying to support people to overthrow the Nicaraguan government, the United States was wrong to try to overthrow the democratically elected government of Guatemala. Throughout the history of our relationship with Latin America we've operated under the so-called Monroe doctrine, and that said the United States had the right do anything they wanted do in Latin America.” ||||| Never miss the best of FiveThirtyEight.

Information:  - Watling Street is the name given to an ancient trackway in England and Wales that was first used by the Britons mainly between the areas of modern Canterbury and using a natural ford near Westminster. The Romans later paved the route, which then connected the Kentish ports of Dubris (Dover), Rutupiae (Richborough), Lemanis (Lympne), and Regulbium (Reculver) to their bridge over the Thames at Londinium (London). The continuation northwest passed Verulamium (St Albans) on its way to Viroconium (Wroxeter). The Romans considered the continuation on to Blatobulgium (Birrens) beyond Hadrian's Wall to be part of the same route, leading some scholars to call this Watling Street as well, although others restrict it to the southern leg. Watling Street was the site of Boudica's defeat by the Romans and the southwestern border of the Danelaw. In the early 19th century, the course between London and the sea was paved and became known as the Great Dover Road. Today, the route from Dover to London forms part of the A2 road and the route from London to Wroxeter forms much of the A5 road.  - Loughborough (or ) is a town within the Charnwood borough of Leicestershire, England.

I had a great experience the last time I served jury duty , sitting for a murder trial , so I ' m hoping I land something just as fascinating . The only problem I have is the waiting . Why is the narrator waiting around ?","output":"The narrator, who happens to be in the Queens County Supreme Court jury room, is waiting around because he or she has been selected for jury duty. Jury duty is the civil obligation of every eligible citizen to potentially serve as a juror in a legal proceeding. Jurors are selected randomly from the community and are required to appear in court on the specified date. Part of the jury duty process involves waiting. From the alluding text, it seems like the narrator is currently at the stage of jury selection, also known as \\"voir dire.\\" This is a preliminary examination to determine whether prospective jurors are qualified to serve on a jury. The judge and the attorneys for both sides will start questioning the prospective jurors. They aim to uncover any biases that could interfere with a juror's ability to decide the case impartially or any specific conditions that could prevent them from serving. This practice, in some cases, can be time-consuming, thus leading to periods of waiting.  The requirement to wait also arises because the courtroom needs to arrange all the elements needed for the trial. It includes getting all parties, including the defense and prosecution attorneys, plaintiffs, defendants, court reporters, and in many cases, witnesses, all in one place at the same time and ready to proceed. There may also be delays due to last-minute discussions, negotiations, or legal arguments before the trial commences.  Additionally, there could be a dozen to hundreds of people called for jury duty on any given day. The waiting allows the court to process everyone effectively, from conducting an initial roll call to instructions about the day, and finally, the jury selection process for different trials. As such, the waiting time can be variable and lengthy. The narrator's comment about hoping to land something \\"fascinating\\" suggests that he or she is waiting to be potentially selected in a trial after the voir dire process. The mention of the \\"murder trial\\" implies a preference for complex, high-stakes cases. In summary, the combination of all these processes is why the narrator is waiting around in the jury room."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Choices:  - stationary fluid  - hydrothermal fluid  - impregnation fluid  - supercritical fluid  A: The answer to this question is:","output":"- Supercritical Fluid A supercritical fluid is the phase that exists when all the water in a container has physical properties intermediate between those of the gaseous and liquid states. In this unique state, the supercritical fluid possesses properties of both liquids and gases, making it highly valuable in scientific and industrial applications. To understand the concept of supercritical fluids, it's essential to know the critical points of a substance. The critical point is the temperature and pressure at which the distinction between the liquid and gaseous phases of a substance ceases to exist. Above the critical point, a substance is in its supercritical state, commonly referred to as a supercritical fluid. For water, the critical point occurs at a temperature of 647.1 kelvins (374°C or 705.2°F) and a pressure of 22.1 MPa (3,206 psi or 218.3 atm). When water is heated and pressurized above these values, it becomes a supercritical fluid and exhibits properties of both liquids and gases.  Some key properties shared by supercritical fluids include: 1. Density: While not as dense as liquids, supercritical fluids are denser than gases, allowing them to dissolve and transport substances more effectively than gases. This property makes supercritical fluids ideal for use in processes like extraction, where solvents are required to dissolve and carry substances from one phase to another. 2. Viscosity: Supercritical fluids have lower viscosity than liquids, enabling them to flow through porous materials more efficiently. This characteristic enables supercritical fluids to be used in enhanced oil recovery, where they can penetrate and recover oil from reservoirs that would be difficult for conventional liquid solvents. 3. Diffusivity: The rate at which substances diffuse in supercritical fluids is higher than in liquids, but lower than in gases. This means that substances can move more freely within supercritical fluids, making them excellent for applications like chemical reactions where efficient mixing of reactants is necessary. 4. Compressibility: Supercritical fluids are highly compressible, meaning their density can be significantly altered by changes in pressure. This property allows researchers and engineers to fine-tune the solubility and transport capabilities of supercritical fluids, optimizing them for specific applications. Some common applications of supercritical fluids include: - Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE): A widely-used technique for extracting and purifying substances from natural sources, plant materials, and food products. Common examples include the extraction of essential oils, caffeine removal from coffee beans, and producing decaffeinated tea. - Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC): A separation technique that uses supercritical fluids as the mobile phase. SFC is particularly useful for separating complex mixtures of compounds, such as pharmaceuticals and chemical substances. - Enhanced oil recovery: In this application, supercritical fluids are injected into oil reservoirs to improve the recovery of petroleum products. The low viscosity, high diffusivity, and solubility properties of supercritical fluids allow them to improve the flow of oil and enhance extraction efficiency. - Supercritical fluid dyeing: A process that uses supercritical fluids, typically carbon dioxide, to dye textiles, while reducing the environmental impact of traditional dyeing methods. In summary, a supercritical fluid is the phase that occurs when water reaches a temperature and pressure beyond its critical point, exhibiting properties intermediate between those of liquids and gases. Supercritical fluids possess unique properties that make them invaluable in various scientific and industrial applications, such as extraction, chromatography, and enhanced oil recovery."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Process: - Rock begins as magma from a volcano - The magma cools - Crystals form and the magma become igneous rocks - The igneous rocks break down into sediment - Become sedimentary rocks - If subjected to heat and/or pressure from plate-tectonic activity the sedimentary rocks become metamorphic rock - The metamorphic rocks melt - Become magma again.  Question: suppose more magma cools happens, how will it affect more magma become igneous rocks.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"The process described outlines the rock cycle, a series of geological processes that continually transform rocks from one type to another. Magma plays a critical role in this cycle, as it is the source of all igneous rocks. If there were more instances of magma cooling, it would contribute to an increase in the formation of igneous rocks. To further elaborate on the impact of more magma cooling, let's examine each step of the process: 1. Magma forms through various geological processes, including volcanic eruptions and the melting of the Earth's crust or mantle due to tectonic activity. 2. When magma cools, it solidifies into igneous rocks. This process can occur either on the Earth's surface (as in volcanic eruptions) or below the surface (as in the formation of intrusive igneous rocks). The rate and the conditions at which the magma cools determine the size and types of crystals formed in these igneous rocks. 3. Over time, weathering and erosion break down these igneous rocks into smaller fragments or sediments. These sediments accumulate in layers, eventually becoming compacted and cemented together to form sedimentary rocks. 4. The combination of heat and pressure from plate tectonic movements can alter the mineral composition and structure of sedimentary rocks, transforming them into metamorphic rocks. 5. As metamorphic rocks are subjected to even more extreme temperatures and pressures, they may eventually melt and return to their original state as magma, completing the rock cycle. So, if there were more instances of magma cooling, it would result in an increase in the formation of igneous rocks (Answer A: more). This could potentially lead to a higher rate of weathering and erosion, which would break down more igneous rocks into sediments. As these sediments accumulate and become compacted, more sedimentary rocks would form. Additionally, with more plate tectonic activity generating heat and pressure, the increased number of sedimentary rocks could lead to more instances of metamorphic rock formation. In the extreme, some of these metamorphic rocks may even return to the magma state, contributing to more occurrences of magma cooling and igneous rock formation. In summary, an increased magma cooling rate would directly contribute to greater formation of igneous rocks, with a possible cascading effect on the other types of rocks involved in the rock cycle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Lee put the book in the pocket of Casey's coat.  Given the context: How would Casey feel as a result?  Possible answers: scared, guilty, Good that Lee was helpful A:","output":"In order to provide a detailed answer, it is essential to consider the context in which Lee placed the book in the pocket of Casey's coat. As the given information does not offer much context, we need to explore different scenarios and analyze Casey's feelings in each of them. 1. Scenario: Lee is helping Casey In this situation, Lee could be helping Casey by putting the book in the coat pocket to ensure that they won't forget it. In this case, Casey would feel good and appreciative of Lee's helpfulness. They might even express gratitude for the assistance and think that Lee is a reliable friend or family member. 2. Scenario: Lee is trying to hide the book from Casey On the other hand, Lee might be trying to conceal the book from Casey for some reason. The book could contain sensitive information or be something that Casey is not supposed to see. In this case, if Casey finds out about the book, they might feel scared. They might worry about the repercussions of Lee's actions, and it could strain their relationship with Lee. 3. Scenario: Lee is secretly returning the book to Casey If Lee is returning something to Casey discreetly, which Casey is not supposed to have in the first place, then Casey might feel guilty upon finding the book. In this scenario, they could feel guilty about their actions that led to the situation and may ponder over the consequences of their actions. They may decide to confront Lee about it or keep it between them. 4. Scenario: Lee put the book randomly without any intention It might also be possible that Lee placed the book in the coat pocket without any specific intentions. Lee could have found the book lying around and thought that the coat pocket would be a safe place for it. In this situation, Casey might not feel any strong emotion, but might feel mildly surprised or curious about how the book ended up in their coat pocket. In conclusion, without additional context, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact emotion that Casey would feel as a result of Lee putting the book in their coat pocket. It could range from gratitude or feeling good about Lee being helpful, to fear, guilt, or surprise, depending on the circumstances and the relationship between the two individuals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We have the equation: -66 * k = 26 * k - 17 * k + 450 First, let's simplify it by combining the terms with \\"k\\" on the right side: 26 * k - 17 * k = 9 * k (Because 26 minus 17 is 9) So now the equation looks like this: -66 * k = 9 * k + 450 Now let's move all \\"k\\" terms to one side by adding 66*k to both sides: -66 * k + 66 * k = 9 * k + 66 * k + 450 This simplifies to: 0 = 75 * k + 450 (Because -66 plus 66 is 0, and 9 plus 66 is 75) Now we want to get \\"k\\" all by itself on one side of the equation, so let's subtract 450 from both sides: 0 - 450 = 75 * k + 450 - 450 This becomes: -450 = 75 * k Now to find the value of \\"k\\", let's divide both sides of the equation by 75: -450 ÷ 75 = 75 * k ÷ 75 This gives us: -6 = k (Because -450 divided by 75 is -6) So there you go, the value of \\"k\\" is -6!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bob was a regular guy, but he believed in doing the right thing. He was rightly recognized as an epitome of decency and loyalty within his community.

It wasn't a surprise to Lakeside residents when one day she was pulled over by Herman for speeding through a pedestrian zone. Herman was a highly-respected policeman in the town. Known for his adept problem-solving skills, he was cherished for the fact that he bolstered a sense of security and peace. Coincidentally, on the same day they had a prominent visitor, a keenly anticipated dignitary was visiting Lakeside. Due to his notable stature, a superior level of security was required. Indeed, who better than Herman and Bob, Lakeside's very own dynamic duo, to shoulder this responsibility? Their unquestionable loyalty and sense of duty were sure to keep the dignitary safe.

Members sit for staggered six-year terms, with one third of the members retiring every two years.  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast.

Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - The Legislature of the State of Oklahoma is the state legislative branch of the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The Oklahoma House of Representatives and Oklahoma Senate are the two houses that make up the bicameral state legislature. There are 101 state representatives, each serving a two-year term, and 48 state senators, who serve four-year terms that are staggered so only half of the Oklahoma Senate districts are eligible in each election year. Legislators are elected directly by the people from single member districts of equal population. The Oklahoma Legislature meets annually in the Oklahoma State Capitol in Oklahoma City.  - Oklahoma (Cherokee: \\"Asgaya gigageyi\\" /  ; or transliterated from English as  (\\"òàlàhoma\\"), Pawnee: \\"Uukuhuúwa\\", Cayuga: \\"Gahnawiyogeh\\") is a state located in the South Central United States. Oklahoma is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States. The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words \\"okla\\" and \\"humma\\", meaning \\"red people\\". It is also known informally by its nickname, \\"The Sooner State\\", in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on the choicest pieces of land before the official opening date, and the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which opened the door for white settlement in America's Indian Territory. The name was settled upon statehood, Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged and Indian was dropped from the name. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union. Its residents are known as \\"Oklahomans\\", or informally \\"Okies\\", and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City.  - As general terms, Indian Territory, the Indian Territories, or Indian country describe an evolving land area set aside by the United States Government for the relocation of Native Americans who held aboriginal title to their land. In general, the tribes ceded land they occupied in exchange for land grants in an area purchased by the United States federal government from Napoleonic France, the Louisiana Purchase. The concept of an Indian Territory was an outcome of the 18th- and 19th-century policy of Indian removal. After the Civil War, the policy of the government was one of assimilation.  - The House of Lords of the United Kingdom, referred to ceremonially as the House of Peers, is the upper house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Like the House of Commons, it meets in the Palace of Westminster. Officially, the full name of the house is: \\"The Right Honourable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled\\".  - The Oklahoma House of Representatives is the lower house of the legislature of the U.S. state of Oklahoma. Its members introduce and vote on bills and resolutions, provide legislative oversight for state agencies, and help to craft the state's budget. The upper house of the Oklahoma Legislature is the Oklahoma Senate.  - The Choctaw (In the Choctaw language, Chahta) are Native American people originally from the Southeastern United States (modern-day Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, and Louisiana). The Choctaw language belongs to the Muskogean language family group. The Choctaw are descendants of the peoples of the Hopewell and Mississippian cultures, who lived throughout the east of the Mississippi River valley and its tributaries. About 1,700 years ago, the Hopewell people built Nanih Waiya, a great earthwork mound, which is still considered sacred by the Choctaw. The early Spanish explorers of the mid-16th century encountered Mississippian-culture villages and chiefs. The anthropologist John Swanton suggested that the Choctaw derived their name from an early leader. Henry Halbert, a historian, suggests that their name is derived from the Choctaw phrase \\"Hacha hatak\\" (river people).  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - The United States Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress which, along with the House of Representatives, the lower chamber, composes the legislature of the United States.  - An upper house, sometimes called a Senate, is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature (or one of three chambers of a tricameral legislature), the other chamber being the lower house. The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller, and often has more restricted power, than the lower house. Examples of upper houses in countries include the UK's House of Lords, Canada's Senate, India's Rajya Sabha, Russia's Federation Council, Ireland's Seanad, Germany's Bundesrat and the United States Senate.  - An Okie is a resident, native, or cultural descendant of Oklahoma. Like most terms that disparage specific groups, it was first applied by the dominant cultural group. It is derived from the name of the state, similar to \\"Texan\\" or \\"Tex\\" for someone from Texas, or \\"Arkie\\" or \\"Arkansawyer\\" for a native of Arkansas.  - A senate is a deliberative assembly, often the upper house or chamber of a bicameral legislature or parliament. The name comes from the ancient Roman Senate (Latin: \\"Senatus\\"), so-called as an assembly of the senior (Latin: \\"senex\\" meaning \\"the elder\\" or \\"the old one\\") and therefore allegedly wiser and more experienced members of the society or ruling class.  - A lower house is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature, the other chamber being the upper house.  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016.

There are said to be one billion people learning English now and about 80% of the information on the Internet is in English. Is this a good thing, or a bad thing? Should we celebrate the fact that more and more of us can communicate, using a common language, across countries and cultures?

Does it matter if an increasing number of people speak the same language? I would have thought the other way around  although I have never accepted the argument that if only we all understood each other better, there would be fewer wars. _ ... If we all speak English, will we then all start eating McDonalds burgers? Surely not. If English becomes more dominant , it will kill other languages? I doubt it. When I travel in Africa or Asia, I am always surprised by how many people can speak not only their own language but often one or more other related languages, as well as English and perhaps some French or German as well. When we discussed this on Talking Point a couple of years ago, we received a wonderfully poetic email from a listener in Ireland. \\"The English language is a beautiful language.

Although Calais is by far the largest city in Pas-de-Calais, the department's prefecture is its third-largest city of Arras. The population of the metropolitan area at the 2010 census was 126,395. Calais overlooks the Strait of Dover, the narrowest point in the English Channel, which is only wide here, and is the closest French town to England. The White Cliffs of Dover can easily be seen on a clear day from Calais. Calais is a major port for ferries between France and England, and since 1994, the Channel Tunnel has linked nearby Coquelles to Folkestone by rail.  - The London Stock Exchange (LSE) is a stock exchange located in the City of London in the United Kingdom. , the Exchange had a market capitalisation of US6.06 trillion (short scale), making it the third-largest stock exchange in the world by this measurement (the largest in Europe, ahead of Euronext). The Exchange was founded in 1801 and its current premises are situated in Paternoster Square close to St Paul's Cathedral in the City of London. The Exchange is part of the London Stock Exchange Group.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean.

France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - Folkestone is a port town on the English Channel, in Kent, south-east England. The town lies on the southern edge of the North Downs at a valley between two cliffs. It was an important harbour and shipping port for most of the 19th and 20th century.  - A tunnel is an underground passageway, dug through the surrounding soil/earth/rock and enclosed except for entrance and exit, commonly at each end. A pipeline is not a tunnel, though some recent tunnels have used immersed tube construction techniques rather than traditional tunnel boring methods.  - Euronext Paris is France's securities market, formerly known as the Paris Bourse, which merged with the Amsterdam, Lisbon and Brussels exchanges in September 2000 to form Euronext NV, which is the second largest exchange in Europe behind the UK's London Stock Exchange Group.   - Groupe Eurotunnel SE manages and operates the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France including the vehicle shuttle services, and earns revenue on other trains (DB Schenker freight and Eurostar passenger) through the tunnel.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

These people are called \\"unemployed\\". Economists made predictions about how many people would be unemployed, but their guess wasn't perfect.  To understand the difference between their guess and the real number of unemployed people, we'll need to know two things:  1. The number of unemployed people that economists thought there would be in 2011 (their estimate). 2. The actual number of unemployed people in 2011 (the real number). Unfortunately, without knowing the specific estimate and real number for 2011, I can't tell you the exact difference. However, I can help you understand why there might have been a difference between the economists' estimate and the real number. Economists base their estimates on lots of factors, like how businesses are doing and how many people usually have jobs. But sometimes, things happen that are hard to predict, or guess. For example, if a big company suddenly closes and many people lose their jobs, that might lead to more people being unemployed than the economists had guessed. In short, the number of \\"shorts\\" or the difference between economists' estimates and the actual number of unemployed people in 2011 depends on the specific numbers. Remember, it's tricky to make perfect guesses about the future, but economists do their best to come up with an estimate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Waterlogged archaeological wood can be severely damaged if it is allowed to dry and therefore must be kept constantly wet during its excavation (Photo courtesy of the Institute of Nautical Archaeology at Texas A&M; University /M. Jones)      Archaeological excavations in Turkey that began in 2004 have yielded a unique historical treasure — 37 shipwrecks from the Byzantine Empire, eight of which are now described in a new report.      The shipwrecks were discovered at a site called Yenikapi, in Istanbul, in what was a port of the ancient city, then called Constantinople. The ships date back to the fifth to 11th centuries, and are in exceptionally good condition, archaeologists say.      \\"Never before has such a large number and types of well-preserved vessels been found at a single location,\\" said study author Cemal Pulak, of the Institute of Nautical Archaeology at Texas A&M University.      The eight shipwrecks highlighted in the new report, which date from the seventh to 10th centuries, show that the shipbuilders at the time were using a more complex process than previously thought, according to the researchers. [Photos: 8 Byzantine Empire Era Shipwrecks Excavated in Turkey]      Each of the ships the researchers examined in the report incorporated elements characteristic of two ship-building methods. In one method, the shell of a ship was built first, and in the other, the ship's skeleton was constructed first, and then the planks were attached. The researchers' analysis showed that a transition from a shell-first to a skeleton-first approach was already well underway by the seventh century.      \\"It is through meticulous and time-consuming detective work that we slowly begin to understand how these ships were built, modified, overhauled and used,\\" Pulak told Live Science.\\"By such means, we try to understand the minds of the shipbuilders and their design and conceptualization processes, in order to better comprehend the history of science and engineering.\\"      Of the eight ships that the researchers examined for the report, six were classified as \\"round ships,\\" which means that they were propelled primarily or entirely by sail. The length of the round ships ranged from 26 to 48 feet (8 to 14.7 meters), and they were between 8 and 16 feet (2.5 and 5 m) wide.      The other two ships the researchers examined were galleys — long, oared ships, about 100 feet (30 m) long and 13 feet (4 m) wide. Among all of the 37 shipwrecks discovered at Yenikapi, there were a total of six Byzantine galleys, \\"notably the first shipwrecks of this type discovered from the Byzantine period,\\" the researchers wrote in their report.      Previously, Byzantine galleys were known only from books and artwork dating to the time period, and such sources tend to be difficult to interpret. Therefore the well-preserved remains of these vessels at Yenikapi play a crucial role in archaeologists' study of Byzantine ships, the researchers said.      Until recently, much of the information about Byzantine ships had come from the several medium-size seagoing ships that had been excavated in the Mediterranean, Pulak said. \\"Yenikapi has yielded a wide array of small rowboats, fishing boats, utility vessels and even naval ships, all directly from Constantinople itself, the capital of the Byzantine Empire,\\" he added.      A large museum in Istanbul is being planned to exhibit many of the wrecks, Pulak said. But it could take several years to restore the timbers of each ship's hull, he said.      The report was published online Dec. 8 in the International Journal of Nautical Archeology.      Follow Agata Blaszczak-Boxe on Twitter. Follow Live Science @livescience, Facebook& Google+. Originally published on Live Science. ||||| Yenikapı Byzantine Shipwrecks Excavation and Study – Istanbul, Turkey      The Yenikapı site, located in the Istanbul neighborhood of the same name, was first revealed in 2004 during the construction of a subterranean rail line and station for a new rail link between Europe and Asia. Archaeologists from the Istanbul Archaeological Museums quickly realized they had discovered the ancient harbor of Theodosius, one of Constantinople's trade harbors, built during the reign of Theodosius I (AD 379-395). A major trade center from the 4th century AD until river silt filled it in around 1500, the harbor, its stone walls, and amazingly well-preserved remnants of the port’s activities lay forgotten for centuries.      Since 2004, the site has been one of the world’s largest archaeological digs. Each day, hundreds of laborers dug under the direction of the Istanbul Archeological Museums. Yenikapı’s wet soils have revealed everything from the foundations of wattle-and-daub mud huts and burials from the Neolithic period (approximately 6000 BC) to Ottoman structures, and myriad artifacts including Byzantine wooden combs and leather shoes, the bones of hard-worked dockside horses and camels, and even human skulls that may have come from criminals whose severed heads were tossed in the harbor.      Archaeologists also uncovered dozens of shipwrecks and hundreds of anchors from what was once the harbor floor. Now that these excavations are nearing completion, the remains of 37 separate vessels dating from the 5th to the 11th centuries AD have emerged from the mud. The first archaeological examples of Byzantine rowed ships—almost certainly warships—as well as merchant vessels, some with cargoes, were preserved thanks to their burial in a thick layer of wet mud.      The removal, documentation, conservation, and reconstruction of the Yenikapı shipwrecks have been divided between Istanbul University’s Conservation Department and the Institute of Nautical Archaeology. Eight shipwreck hulls dating from the early 7th to the late 10th centuries were turned over to INA Vice President and Texas A&M University professor Cemal Pulak by the Istanbul Archaeological Museums. With his characteristic attention to detail and meticulous scholarship, Cemal approached this formidable project with the aid of nautical archaeologists Sheila Matthews, Rebecca Ingram, Michael Jones, and Orkan Köyağasıoğlu, along with other experienced archaeologists and graduate students. This hard-working team labored for over three years through the heat and dust of summer as well as the sleet and mud of winter in an active construction site, carefully documenting and recovering the ship remains in tent-covered pits. While many of the timbers are solid and well preserved, with original tool marks and fine surface detail visible, others are weak and fragile, having the consistency of wet cardboard. It makes the job even more challenging, and yet the patience and persistence of Cemal’s team made a significant difference.      Although the eight shipwrecks have been removed from the work site, research into the construction, repair, and use of these fascinating vessels continues. INA staff archaeologist Köyağasıoğlu continues his meticulous documentation of the timbers of galley YK 4 and is creating scale drawings of hundreds of stone anchors from the site. Ingram and Jones recently completed doctoral dissertations on merchantmen YK 11 (early 7th century) and YK 14 (9th century), respectively. Some of the INA team’s work is featured in the 2013 Istanbul Archaeological Museums’ exhibition, Stories from the Hidden Harbor.      The Yenikapı dig was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work with a diverse collection of hulls from this period.

The ships, dating from the fifth to 11th centuries, were found at the Yenikapi site in Istanbul, which was a major trade center during the Byzantine period. The discovery is significant due to the number and condition of the ships, revealing shipbuilders utilized more complex processes than previously thought and showing a shift in ship-building methods.

Sentence 1: \\"Trifle highhanded, ain't he?\\"  Sentence 2: He's highhanded, right? Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Step 1: Analyzing the meaning of both sentences. Sentence 1: \\"Trifle highhanded, ain't he?\\" - The speaker is asking if someone is slightly highhanded (arrogant or behaving with a sense of superiority). Sentence 2: \\"He's highhanded, right?\\" - The speaker is asking if someone is highhanded (arrogant or behaving with a sense of superiority). Step 2: Comparing the meanings. In Sentence 1, the speaker is questioning if someone is slightly highhanded, implying that the degree of highhandedness being referred to is minimal. In Sentence 2, the speaker is questioning if someone is highhanded without specifying the degree of highhandedness. Therefore, the implication in Sentence 2 is more general than that of Sentence 1. Step 3: Drawing conclusions. Since the second sentence carries a more general implication than the first sentence, it is not strictly entailed by the first sentence. While both sentences imply that the person being referred to may be highhanded, the degree of highhandedness is not the same, making the relationship between the two sentences hard to draw a definitive conclusion.

Write an article based on this summary: – Theories surrounding the 2001 death of Kathleen Peterson range from the accidental (a fall down the stairs) to the horrifying (killed by home intruders) to the bizarre (an owl attack). But the one that took center stage Friday in Durham, NC, focused on her husband, novelist Mike Peterson, who filed what's called an Alford plea on a voluntary manslaughter charge, more than 15 years after his wife's body was found at the bottom of the stairs in their home, the News & Observer reports. The case, which became the subject of a lengthy documentary, features intriguing details, including family members who've switched sides and even a family friend in Germany who, like Kathleen, was found dead at the bottom of the stairs a few years before Kathleen (and whose daughters Mike Peterson ended up raising). Peterson, 73, was originally convicted in 2003 of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole, but he was released in 2011 after the judge who'd presided over the original case ruled that a main prosecution witness had lied, WRAL and the AP report. A new trial was ordered. The Alford plea entered by Peterson Friday allows him to still claim innocence while conceding the prosecution has enough evidence to get a guilty verdict. He walked out free afterward, though his wife's sister declared in court, \\"You will be a convicted felon forever.\\" Peterson had said earlier he didn't want to take the plea, but he didn't think he'd ever get a fair second trial by prosecutors. \\"I am not going to put my life and my freedom in their hands.\\" (Prison inmates say a fellow inmate was thrown down the stairs and killed by the \\"Beat Up Squad.\\")","output":"Once upon a time, a lady named Kathleen Peterson was found at the bottom of the stairs in her house, and no one was sure how she got there. People had many ideas: maybe she fell, maybe someone bad came into her house and hurt her, or maybe a big bird called an owl attacked her. Her husband, Mike Peterson, who liked to write stories, was blamed for her death. Many, many years ago, another lady in Germany was also found at the bottom of the stairs, and Mike helped take care of her daughters. Some people thought this was really strange. Mike was said to be guilty in 2003, but later, someone figured out that a person who spoke in the trial wasn't telling the truth. So, they decided to have another trial. Mike was then able to say \\"I didn't do it, but I understand there is a chance I could be found guilty.\\" They let him go free, but some people still think he's a bad person.

Information:  - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects.   - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form.  - Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its periodthe time interval between beatsis half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats). Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio (sound) signals, radio waves, and light.  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish. The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function.  - Ernie Manouse ( born September 1 , 1969 , in Binghamton , New York ) is an American television host , radio personality , writer and producer . He currently hosts the interview show InnerVIEWS with Ernie Manouse , produced by HoustonPBS . His work with HoustonPBS has met critical acclaim in the southern United States , earning him numerous KATIE awards and regional Emmy Awards  - The amplitude of a periodic variable is a measure of its change over a single period (such as time or spatial period). There are various definitions of amplitude (see below), which are all functions of the magnitude of the difference between the variable's extreme values. In older texts the phase is sometimes called the amplitude.  - Binghamton is a city in, and the county seat of, Broome County, New York, United States. It lies in the state's Southern Tier region near the Pennsylvania border, in a bowl-shaped valley at the confluence of the Susquehanna and Chenango Rivers. Binghamton is the principal city and cultural center of the Binghamton metropolitan area (also known as Greater Binghamton, or historically the Triple Cities), home to a quarter million people. The population of the city itself, according to the 2010 census, is 47,376.  - The Southern Tier is the counties of New York west of the Catskill Mountains along the northern border of Pennsylvania. It generally includes the counties that border Pennsylvania west of Delaware County, but definitions of the region vary widely.  - Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German: \\"Pennsylvaani\\"), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. The commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east.  - The Binghamton Metropolitan Statistical Area, also called Greater Binghamton or the Triple Cities, is a region of southern upstate New York in the Northeastern United States, anchored by the city of Binghamton. The MSA encompasses Broome and Tioga counties, which together had a population of 251,725 as of the 2010 census. From 1963 to 1983, the MSA also included neighboring Susquehanna County in Pennsylvania, part of which still falls in the Binghamton, NYPA Urban Area. In addition to these three counties, the greater region includes parts of Delaware and Chenango counties in New York; portions of Cortland and Otsego counties in New York and Wayne County, Pennsylvania are sometimes considered part of the region as well.

Context: The sighting of a killer whale (or orca) can be rare, but they do love to hunt and play in the waters between Vancouver and Seattle, so one of the activities we absolutely wanted to do (in addition to the harbour seaplane flight) was to go whale watching. Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. Honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the NHS. Forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from Vancouver. Not having much success closer to the British Columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the Canadian/American border. Incredibly, the resident killer whales of the San Juan Islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. Stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human. Much of what is known about the orca whale’s highly-organized social life has been learned from the resident pods in the San Juan Islands of Washington.

One of the men inquires as to what ship they will sail on, and the press gang leader informs him that it is the HMSÂ Bounty. Upon inquiring as to who the captain is, another of the men is told the captain is William Bligh (Charles Laughton), and attempts to escape, as Bligh is a brutal tyrant who routinely administers harsh punishment to officers and crew alike who lack discipline, cause any infraction on board the ship, or in any manner defy his authority. The Bounty leaves England several days later on a two-year voyage over the Pacific Ocean. Fletcher Christian (Clark Gable), the ship's lieutenant, is a formidable yet compassionate man who disapproves of Bligh's treatment of the crew. Roger Byam (Franchot Tone) is an idealistic midshipman who is divided between his loyalty to Bligh, owing to his family's naval tradition, and his friendship with Christian. During the voyage, the enmity between Christian and Bligh grows after Christian openly challenges Bligh's unjust practices aboard the ship. When the ship arrives at the island of Tahiti, where the crew acquires breadfruit plants to take home, Bligh punishes Christian by refusing to let him leave the ship during their stay.

Greece: Agios Vasilis (Saint Basil) (gifts are given on New Year's Day) 15. Austria, Hungary, and Switzerland: Christkind (Christ Child) or Weihnachtsmann The two questions have different meanings. While the first question asks about Santa Claus's different names and how he is known around the world, the second question is about the variations of Santa Claus across different countries and cultures. The names of Santa Claus vary according to local languages, traditions, and folklore. The variations of Santa Claus not only include the names but also the appearances, customs, and the nature of the celebrations. For example, in the Netherlands and Belgium, Sinterklaas is based on Saint Nicholas, who was a 4th-century Christian bishop. Sinterklaas has a long white beard, wears red and white attire and is often accompanied by helpers called 'Zwarte Pieten' (Black Peters).  In Russia, Ded Moroz is a figure with a long white beard, a coat of red, blue or white color, and carries a magical staff. He is also assisted by his granddaughter Snegurochka (The Snow Maiden). Ded Moroz and Snegurochka visit houses and distribute presents to children during the New Year celebrations. Moreover, celebrations may not necessarily occur on the same date as Christmas Day. For example, in Greece, Agios Vasilis visits homes on New Year's Day instead of Christmas Day, bringing presents to children. In conclusion, the two questions have a different focus. One asks about the different names of Santa Claus and the second seeks to understand the variations in appearance, customs, and celebrations in various countries and regions worldwide."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  The spores fall to the ground - The spores germinate - The spores begin to grow mycelium - The mycelium begin to sprout a bud - A new mushroom is formed. The answer is:","output":"The missing first step of the process is: The mature mushroom releases its spores.  To provide a detailed and in-depth understanding, let's take a look at the entire life cycle of a mushroom: 1. The mature mushroom releases its spores: When a mushroom reaches maturity, it is ready to reproduce. The mushroom's cap produces millions of tiny spores, which are designed for dispersal to promote the chances of successful reproduction. In many mushroom species, the spores are released in response to specific environmental factors, such as changes in humidity, temperature, or light levels. Once the conditions are optimal, the mature mushroom releases the spores from its gills, pores, or other specialized spore-producing structures. 2. The spores fall to the ground: Following their release, the spores are dispersed by various means, including wind, water, or through animal interactions. The vast majority of these microscopic spores will never find a suitable environment to grow, while some will travel great distances before settling down. Eventually, the spores will land on the ground or on a suitable substrate where they can thrive if conditions are right. 3. The spores germinate: Once a spore finds a suitable environment, it goes through a process called germination. During this process, the spores take in water and nutrients from their surroundings, and the cells within the spore begin to divide. These newly formed cells start to grow hyphae, which are the individual strands that make up mycelium. 4. The spores begin to grow mycelium: As the individual hyphae continue to grow, they form a network of interconnected strands called mycelium. These mycelial networks serve as the root-like structure for the mushroom, absorbing nutrients and water from the surrounding substrate. The mycelium may grow beneath the soil or within decaying wood or other organic material, gradually breaking down and consuming the nutrients within the substrate. 5. The mycelium begins to sprout a bud: When environmental conditions and available nutrients align, the mycelium begins to form a small, compact mass called a primordium. The primordium eventually develops into a recognizable mushroom structure, consisting of a stem, cap, and gills or pores. 6. A new mushroom is formed: As the bud continues to grow and develop, it takes on the recognizable form of a mature mushroom. The mushroom expands and releases more spores, completing the life cycle and starting the process over again. This intricate and fascinating process highlights the complex life cycle of mushrooms, demonstrating the importance of each step in the successful growth and reproduction of these unique organisms."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In mid-2012, The Wiggles announced that Page, Fatt, and Cook would be retiring from touring with the group; Emma Watkins, the first female member of The Wiggles, replaced Page, Lachlan Gillespie replaced Fatt, and Simon Pryce, who was initially supposed to replace Page in August, replaced Cook.  Anthony Field remained in the group because he found it too difficult to give up and because he still had a passion for educating children.  According to Paul Field, his brother staying in the band \\"was a vital decision to placate American, British and Canadian business partners\\".  Page, Fatt, and Cook remained involved with the creative and production aspects of the group.  Fatt and Cook had been talking about quitting touring for many years; Cook announced his intention to retire first, citing a desire to spend more time with his family, and then Fatt announced his own retirement shortly thereafter.  Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed.  Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce.  The new members, like Moran, who was not approached to return, were salaried employees.The group, for their farewell tour, visited 8 countries and 141 cities, for a total of almost 250 shows in over 200 days for 640,000 people.  Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce wore \\"In Training\\" T-shirts, and debuted the song \\"Do the Propeller!\\" during these concerts.

Instead, it's purposeful practice. Top performers spend more hours practising their craft. If you wanted to picture how a typical genius might develop, you'd take a girl who possessed a slightly above average language ability. It wouldn't have to be a big talent, just enough so that she might gain some sense of distinction. Then you would want her to meet, say, a novelist, who coincidentally shared some similar qualities. Maybe the writer was from the same town, had the same family background, or shared the same birthday.  This contact would give the girl a vision of her future self. It would give her some idea of a fascinating circle who might someday join. It would also help if one of her parents died when she was 12, giving her a strong sense of insecurity and fuelling a desperate need for success. Armed with this ambition, she would read novels and life stories of writers without end. This would give her a primary knowledge of her field. She would be able to see new writing in deeper ways and quickly understand its inner workings.  Then she would practise writing. Her practice would be slow, painstaking and error-focused. By practising in this way, she delays the automating process. Her mind wants to turn conscious, newly learned skills into unconscious, automatically performed skills.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: People have always wanted to speak with animals. There are many books about this, especially children books. Now there are also movies, such as Dr. Doolittle. When you watch animals, it seems clear that they can communicate with each other. Many people wonder why people can't also communicate with them.    Scientists know how some animals communicate. Bees, for example, use their bodies. They do a kind of dance to give information about food. Birds, on the other hand, share information with sounds. They use certain sounds to protect their homes and to stay together when they fly. Some male birds use lovely songs to attract a female . Other animals communicate with both body movements and sounds. For example, dogs wag their tails when they are happy, and they bark when they are excited.    People used to think it was possible to teach human language to animals. Parrots and other birds, for example, can learn to say words. But the birds just repeat the words. They don't understand them. Some American scientists tried to teach English to chimpanzees , close  s of human beings. However, this was impossible. Chimpanzees can't move their mouths the right way. They could never learn to speak like people.    Then scientists tried to teach human language to chimpanzees in other ways. Some tried with American Sign Language (ASL). Others tried with a simple computer. But chimpanzees could only learn to use a few words. They could never learn to use grammar. Their brains are very different from the brains of human beings.    Now some scientists are studying the same points between human and animal language. In fact, some animals use sounds like people do. Dogs, for example, use an unpleasant, low sound to tell other dogs to stay away. People, too, use that kind of voice to say the same things. A dog's noisy bark communicate that something is happening. People use the same high tone when they shout, \\"Watch out!\\"    Scientists want to understand the language of other animals, such as whales and bears. To do this, they go...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Justin is conducting a chemical experiment involving sodium hydroxide. A key part of the reaction is ensuring that the sodium hydroxide is dissolved in water before adding the other materials. Justin adds the sodium hydroxide to reaction A, and sets the heat to high. Justin can't use high heat for his second reaction, though, because the electricity supply is too weak to have both burners on high. Because of this, Justin adds the sodium hydroxide to reaction B and sets the heat to low.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   In which reaction will the sodium hydroxide dissolve faster?  Hint: When you add sugar to a cold drink, you may stir it to help the sugar dissolve. If you don’t stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube. That’s because granulated sugar has much more surface area than a cube of sugar. You can see videos of all three factors at these URLs Answer:","output":"In the given scenario, the sodium hydroxide will dissolve faster in reaction A compared to reaction B. The reason behind this is the temperature factor mentioned in the hint. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. In reaction A, the heat is set to high, which means the sodium hydroxide will be exposed to a higher temperature. This will cause the sodium hydroxide to dissolve more quickly than in reaction B, where the heat is set to low, resulting in a lower temperature. This principle is similar to the example of sugar dissolving faster in hot tea compared to iced tea. Just like sugar, sodium hydroxide is a solid solute that dissolves faster when exposed to a higher temperature. In both reactions, the sodium hydroxide is being dissolved in water, which acts as the solvent. The other factors affecting the rate of dissolving - stirring and surface area – are not specified in the given information; hence, the primary factor determining the dissolving rate in this case is the temperature. Therefore, based on the information provided and the factors affecting the rate of dissolving, the sodium hydroxide will dissolve faster in reaction A, where the heat is set to high."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is make used to mean the same thing in the next two sentences? She may not make the grade. We made it!","output":"To determine the meaning of \\"make\\" in both sentences, let's investigate the context and analyze the usage of the word. Sentence 1: She may not make the grade. Here, \\"make\\" refers to achieving or attaining a particular level or grade. The sentence is about someone potentially not achieving a certain academic or performance standard. Step 1: Identify the context which is about achieving a level or grade. Step 2: Understand \\"make\\" as a verb that signifies reaching or attaining that level or grade. Sentence 2: We made it! In this sentence, \\"make\\" is used to express success or accomplishment of reaching a destination or completing a task. The context of this sentence is about achieving something and expressing that with excitement. Step 1: Identify the context which is about success or accomplishment. Step 2: Understand \\"make\\" as a verb that signifies succeeding or achieving the set goal. In conclusion, while \\"make\\" in both sentences refers to a sense of achievement, the specific meaning is not exactly the same: - In the first sentence, \\"make\\" refers to achieving a particular level or standard, which is about meeting a specific requirement. - In the second sentence, \\"make\\" conveys the idea of success or completion, which is more general and focuses more on the process of accomplishing something.

Harry Jones, 20, was found dead in Blackpool, Lancashire last January after taking a concoction of Tramadol painkillers, Valium and alcohol. A babysitter who was addicted to painkillers died in his sleep after taking a concoction of Valium, Tramadol pain relief and alcohol at a notorious drug house, an inquest heard. Harry Jones, 20, was found dead on the sofa of Sharon Nuttall’s home in Blackpool, Lancashire, after spending the night babysitting her two young children. An inquest heard the college student, who was an aspiring film producer, was given the Valium by drug dealer Nuttall on the evening of January 13 in last year, but secretly took the Tramadol painkillers after swiping them from her collection while she was out partying. He was found unconscious the following morning by friends and pronounced dead after attempts to resuscitate him failed. A coroner recorded a verdict of misadventure at the hearing in Blackpool yesterday, and said it was clear Mr Jones had voluntarily taken the alcohol and medication but hadn’t intended to die as a result. The inquest came just over a year after mother-of-four Nuttall was sentenced to 18 months in prison for supplying Class B and C drugs and permitting her house to be used for smoking and supplying drugs. The 41-year-old, whose children at the time were five, seven, 10 and 15, turned her family home into a ‘magnet’ for young people by using it as a drugs den to sell amphetamines, cannabis, prescription drugs and the former legal high ‘bubble’. Over a three-year period, she allowed up to 20 youngsters into her home at once to take drugs - often introducing them to new tablets and dangerous concoctions. Following yesterday’s inquest, Mr Jones’ mother, Lorraine, 48, condemned Nuttall for introducing youngsters in the area to drugs and making them so readily available. The bank worker, from Blackpool, said: ‘There are so many kids’ lives that she ruined from what she was doing. ‘She wasn’t charged directly with Harry’s death but if he had never met her he might not have started on the route he did. Mr Jones, a Grade A media student who attended Blackpool and The Fylde College, was an aspiring film producer and was in the process of applying to Leeds University at the time of his death in January last year. Tests revealed Mr Jones (pictured as a child) died as a result of a massive ingestion of Tramadol pain relief, which had been prescribed to Sharon Nuttall by doctors for back pain, plus Diazepam and alcohol. ‘Harry was a good boy but he came across these tablets at her house when he was about 17 and he changed. ‘She was in her 40s with small children and yet she was having 16 and 17-year-olds round her house doing “bubble”. You can’t get your head around how a mother would do something like that.’ Mr Jones, a Grade A media student who attended Blackpool and The Fylde College, was described by his family as ‘the life and soul of parties’. However, the inquest heard how the student, who was in the process of applying to study at Leeds University at the time of his death, had been battling an addiction to painkillers which even saw him tell doctors that he suffered from severe back pain in order to get repeated prescriptions for painkillers. Mrs Jones said: ‘From the end of October 2012 to the time of his death he appeared to be ok. ‘He wasn’t going out and had his head down at college and we had a really great Christmas where he was the life and soul as usual. ‘He was saving up to go on holiday. It was always one week at a time with Harry. He had had a really good couple of months.’ However, on the night of his death, he. went to Nuttall’s house with a friend to babysit her children and,. despite being armed with two bottles of wine, asked her for a Valium. tablet. Mr Jones was babysitting for mother-of-four Sharon Nuttall (pictured) on the night of his death and had taken Tramadol and Valium from her home before mixing the painkillers with alcohol. He was found dead on her sofa. Mother-of-four Nuttall (pictured outside Preston Crown Court in May last year) was sentenced to 18 months in prison for supplying Class B and C drugs and permitting her house to be used for smoking and supplying drugs. She gave both Mr Jones and his friend a Valium tablet each before leaving the property and later exchanging text messages with them, after they asked her for more tablets. The 17-year-old friend, who cannot be named for legal reasons, relayed the course of events in a statement read out at the inquest. It read: ‘Harry came upstairs at about 2.30am and I would describe him as pretty wasted. ‘He told me to get up so I did and went downstairs to watch TV. He was slurring his words and kept talking to himself. ‘He started to root through his pockets and pulled out eight Tramadol with two missing. My friend grabbed them and asked what he was doing with them. ‘He gave them to me and I hid them in the bathroom because I knew he had problems with prescription drugs in the past. At about 4am my friend got up and said he was leaving and I went to sleep. ‘As I left the room Harry was lying. down on his back on the sofa snoring and asleep. At 11am a friend let. himself in as the door was open and woke me up and said “Harry looks. dead”. ‘We both tried to wake him up, shook him and listened to his breathing and then we rang an ambulance.’ Tests revealed Mr Jones was less than twice the legal drink-drive limit at the time of his death and had taken a small amount of Valium. But the level of Tramadol in his system was 'within a range associated with fatalities' Mr Jones (pictured on a family holiday) was described by his family and friends as the 'life and soul of parties' Tests revealed Mr Jones died as a result of a massive ingestion of Tramadol pain relief, which had been prescribed to Nuttall by doctors for back pain, plus Diazepam and alcohol. In a statement Nuttall said Mr Jones was a ‘good friend’ who she had known since he was 14. She said that two months before his death she had gone to take Tramadol for her back pain but found they were missing. She confronted him and he admitted taking the medication but apologised. Speaking about the evening before his death, she said: ‘We all had a drink. At about 11.35pm I went to my boyfriend’s and left Harry and his friend watching TV. When I left he had a couple of glasses of wine and was fine. I told him he could stay over. Mother-of-four Sharon Nuttall, 41, was sentenced to 18 months in prison last May for supplying Class B and C drugs and permitting her house to be used for smoking and supplying drugs. At the time, the judge Mr Recorder Stephen Bedford at Preston Crown Court, said: ‘Your house became something of a magnet for young vulnerable people you seem to have been unable to keep away. ‘But such was your priority, was your social life over the welfare of young people in your house - particularly your children - that you left the house that night. ‘I’m looking at you being the adult here, you being the parent at home. Allowing them to behave in this way, not just on a one-off but over a period of time. ‘That must have had some corrupting effect upon them.’ A 17-year old boy who helped Nuttall also admitted to being concerned in the supply of Class B drugs last May and was sentenced to a 12-month youth rehabilitation and supervision order. ‘I did not think he had Tramadol when I left but he texted me several times in the early hours asking about it. ‘I was told in the morning he was deceased. I checked my medication and there was some Tramadol missing. I can’t say exactly how many but about 40 to 60. It’s hard to say the exact number.’ A post-mortem revealed that Mr Jones was less than twice the legal drink-drive limit at the time of his death and had taken just a small amount of Valium. But the level of Tramadol in his system was ‘within a range associated with fatalities’ and combined with the other factors meant he would have ‘slept into death’. Coroner Alan Wilson returned a verdict of misadventure and described his death as tragic’. He said: ‘He was the life and soul of parties - opinionated, outgoing, frustrating - but always caring and loved. ‘He was passionate about meteorology and an animal lover. He was working part time in a hotel on weekends and was saving or a holiday with friends. ‘His friends and family are devastated by tragic death and struggle to come to terms with it. 'Everyone who knew him remembers his big smile and he will be sorely missed by all whose lives he shared.’ After the hearing Mr Jones’ father, Darren, 48, paid tribute to his son and said he would’ve excelled in his dream job of being a film producer. The double glazing installer said: ‘At Christmas he had everyone in stitches. He would have been perfect in front of the camera but he was brilliant behind it. ‘He was amazing at everything he turned his hand to.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Harry Jones, a 20-year-old college student and aspiring film producer, was found dead in Blackpool, Lancashire after ingesting a mixture of Tramadol painkillers, Valium, and alcohol. The tragedy unfolded while Jones was babysitting the two young children of Sharon Nuttall, who was known to have a house notorious for drug use. Jones was given Valium by Nuttall and secretly took the Tramadol painkillers from her collection. As a Grade A media student attending Blackpool and The Fylde College, Jones was described as the \\"life and soul of parties.\\" However, he struggled with an addiction to painkillers, going so far as to deceive doctors in order to receive prescription painkillers for a fictitious back pain issue. On the night of his death, Jones went to Nuttall's house to babysit her children, and despite having brought two bottles of wine, asked Nuttall for a Valium tablet. Nuttall gave him one, but Jones later asked her for more in a text message exchange. In the morning, a friend found Jones unconscious on Nuttall's sofa and called emergency services. Tests revealed that Jones had taken a lethal mixture of Tramadol pain relief, Diazepam, and alcohol. The level of Tramadol in his system was within a range associated with fatalities, according to the post-mortem results. A coroner recorded a verdict of misadventure at the inquest. Though it was clear Mr. Jones voluntarily consumed the alcohol and medication, there was no evidence suggesting he intended to die as a result. Sharon Nuttall had previously been sentenced to 18 months in prison for supplying Class B and C drugs and permitting her house to be used for smoking and supplying drugs. Having turned her family home into a \\"magnet\\" for young people by using it as a drug den, she allowed up to 20 youngsters into her home at once, often introducing them to new and dangerous drug combinations. Following the inquest, Mr. Jones' mother, Lorraine, condemned Nuttall for introducing young people in the area to drugs and making them so readily available, stating that many kids' lives were ruined due to her actions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Weekly Standard 's John Podhoretz compares Horowitz's conversion to conservatism to Whittaker Chambers' magisterial tale of apostasy, Witness . Leftists dismiss the book as score-settling and name-calling. Does it follow that \\"Mr. Podhoretz could not find anything to compare Horowitz's conversion to. \\"?","output":"John Podhoretz's comparison of David Horowitz's conversion to conservatism with Whittaker Chambers' apostasy is an attempt to contextualize and evaluate the significance of Horowitz's ideological shift. Whittaker Chambers, a prominent former communist, famously documented his rejection of communism and embracement of conservatism in his book \\"Witness.\\" By comparing Horowitz's conversion to Chambers', Podhoretz is elevating Horowitz's political transformation to a similar level of importance and seriousness in the conservative ideological canon. However, leftists criticize Horowitz's book, \\"Radical Son,\\" as motivated primarily by personal grievances and score-settling, rather than genuine philosophical introspection and epiphany. They accuse Horowitz of using his book as a platform for name-calling and attacking those who he perceives as ideological enemies, rather than engaging in substantive political debate or offering a comprehensive explanation of his new conservative beliefs. In this context, one could argue that Mr. Podhoretz had difficulty finding a truly apt analogy for Horowitz's conversion, and thus opted for the comparison with Chambers' \\"Witness\\" to emphasize the importance and weight of Horowitz's ideological shift. The implication is that, despite the left's dismissal of the book as mere score-settling and name-calling, Podhoretz believes that Horowitz's transformation carries significant weight and should be examined seriously. It is important to note that the efficacy of Podhoretz's comparison ultimately depends on the reader's interpretation of \\"Radical Son\\" and their viewpoint on David Horowitz's conversion to conservatism. Those who regard Horowitz's change as genuine and significant may find the comparison with Chambers' \\"Witness\\" to be valid, while those who perceive his transformation as shallow or self-serving may dismiss the analogy as unfounded and misleading. In conclusion, John Podhoretz's comparison of David Horowitz's conversion to conservatism with Whittaker Chambers' apostasy in \\"Witness\\" is an attempt to underscore the significance and impact of Horowitz's ideological shift. However, leftists criticize \\"Radical Son\\" as a vehicle for personal vendettas and condemnation, casting doubt on the validity of the comparison. While it may not necessarily follow that Mr. Podhoretz could not find anything to compare Horowitz's conversion to, the effectiveness of his analogy relies on the reader's perception and evaluation of Horowitz's political transformation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The treatment goals for polyarthritis are to reduce joint inflammation and treat the underlying trigger (if there is one) causing the immune response. Achieving these goals will allow your beagle to be in remission-free from any signs of polyarthritis.  A. Many scientific studies show that treating polyarthritis in a dog requires additional patient participation and greater care. Accordingly, it is important to determine if you should involve a vet in treating the condition of your beagle. B. Your vet will refer you to a specialist trained to recognize and treat polyarthritis. Bathe your pup once a week. C. These conditions can be treated with: andoscopy.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Norwegian Bratvaag expedition, studying the glaciers and seas of the Svalbard archipelago from the Norwegian sealing vessel Bratvaag of Ålesund, found the remains of the Andrée expedition on 5 August 1930. Kvitøya was usually inaccessible to the sealing or whaling ships of the time, as it is typically surrounded by a wide belt of thick polar ice and often hidden by thick ice fogs. However, summer in 1930 had been particularly warm, and the surrounding sea was practically free of ice. As Kvitøya was known to be a prime hunting ground for walrus and the fogs over the island on that day were comparatively thin, some of the crew of the Bratvaag took this rare opportunity to land on what they called the \\"inaccessible island\\".Two of the sealers in search of water, Olav Salen and Karl Tusvick, discovered Andrée's boat near a small stream, frozen under a mound of snow and full of equipment, including a boathook engraved with the words \\"Andrée's Polar Expedition, 1896\\". Presented with this hook, the Bratvaag's captain, Peder Eliassen, assigned the crew to search the site together with the expedition members. Among other finds, they uncovered a journal and two skeletons, identified as Andrée's and Strindberg's remains by monograms found on their clothing.The Bratvaag left the island to continue its scheduled hunting and observations, with the intent of coming back later to see if the ice had melted further and uncovered more artifacts. Further discoveries were made by the M/K Isbjørn of Tromsø, a sealing sloop chartered by news reporters to waylay the Bratvaag. Unsuccessful in this, the reporters and the Isbjørn crew made instead for Kvitøya, landing on the island on 5 September in fine weather and finding even less ice than the Bratvaag had. After photographing the area, they searched for and found Frænkel's body, and additional artifacts, including a tin box containing Strindberg's photographic film, his logbook, and maps. The crews of both ships turned over their finds to a scientific commission of the Swedish...","output":"The three explorers whose bodies were transported to Stockholm were S. A.

One year later, the Skynet system is activated, perceives humans as a threat to its own existence, and eradicates much of humanity in the event known as Judgment Day (see Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines). In 2018, John Connor (Christian Bale) leads an attack by the Resistance on a Skynet base. John discovers human prisoners and the plans for the development of a new type of Terminator incorporating living tissue, but is the only apparent survivor of the attack after the base is destroyed in a small nuclear explosion. However, Marcus emerges from the wreckage of the base and proceeds on foot to Los Angeles.John returns to Resistance headquarters located aboard a nuclear submarine and tells General Ashdown (Michael Ironside), the current leader, of his discovery. Meanwhile, the Resistance has discovered a radio frequency capable of shutting down Skynet machines.

Nesnáším tě.\\" Let me provide you with more information about the translation: 1. \\"Mmm.\\" remains the same in Czech, as it is an onomatopoeic expression and is used similarly in many languages to express various emotions depending on the context. In this case, it could be used to express discontent or disapproval. 2. \\"I hate you\\" is translated to \\"Nesnáším tě\\" in Czech. Here's a breakdown of the translation: - \\"I hate\\" is translated to \\"Nesnáším.\\" This word in Czech is a combination of the negative \\"ne-\\" and the verb \\"snášet\\" (to bear, to stand, to put up with). The ending \\"-ím\\" is from the 1st person singular present tense, which translates to \\"I\\" in English. - \\"you\\" is translated to \\"tě\\" in Czech. This is an informal way to say \\"you\\" and is appropriate for conversations between friends or family members. In a more formal situation, \\"vás\\" would be used. So, \\"Mmm.

(C) is incorrect because it describes a motion more similar to a backflip, which is not a beginner skill in gymnastics. A forward roll is a much simpler motion that involves rolling forward on the ground. (D) is incorrect because it suggests positioning your chest on the ground with your back towards the floor, which inaccurately describes the body position for a forward roll.

Article: It has been long rumored that Donald Trump will attempt to start some type of media organization if he loses on Election Day, and it might already be hiring.      An organization billed as an “up-and-coming conservative media network currently in development” is looking for employees, according to Fox News.      A casting notice says the network is looking for hosts, reporters and right-leaning, well-spoken panelists — exactly what a potential Trump TV would need.      Also Read: Trump Campaign CEO Steve Bannon to Return to Breitbart Post-Election      The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment.      Auditions are being held at an undisclosed New York City studio on Monday. The casting call suggests that initial programming will be streamed on the internet, according to Fox News. This makes sense, as Trump already has an evening newscast that streams daily on Facebook Live.      Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, recently contacted media banker Aryeh Bourkoff about the possibility of setting up a Trump television network after the election, the Financial Times reported last month.      Also Read: Hillary Clinton Email Scandals: A Guide From Wikileaks to Anthony Weiner's PC      Trump has also worked closely with former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes and Breitbart guru Stephen Bannon, leading to speculation that his backup plan to becoming POTUS is launching a right-leaning news organization.      “I want to win the presidency and I want to make America great again. It’s very simple. I have no interest in a media company,” Trump recently told the Washington Post, but it doesn’t appear that anyone believes him.      Maybe this is a casting call for Trump TV. Or Trump News. Maybe it isn’t. But it might be your only chance to work for The Donald. ||||| Donald Trump (Joseph Sohm / Shutterstock.com)      Donald Trump denies that he’s looking into founding his on TV news network, but a leaked casting notice obtained by Fox News hints that a “Trump TV”-like network is one someone’s radar.      The casting notice says that it’s looking to hire people for an “up-and-coming conservative media network currently in development,” although it doesn’t specify who is doing the developing.      More specifically, the casting notice says that it wants on-air hosts and reporters who are “knowledgeable about conservative viewpoints, current events and the presidential election,” and who also look “upscale and intelligent” and are “outspoken and energetic.” The audition also specifies that the network’s content will be streamed over the web, which suggests it might not be a traditional cable news network.      One issue for the Trump campaign this election cycle has been the low quality of its surrogates — after all, very few people think that Katrina Pierson or Corey Lewandowski are “knowledgeable about current events.” In other words, it sounds like the network is looking to cast people of a higher caliber than the ones who currently represent the Trump campaign on national TV.      Auditions for the network are being held in New York on Nov. 7, the day before the presidential election. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Donald Trump is speculated to be behind an emerging conservative media network which is currently recruiting staff, including hosts, reporters and articulate, right-leaning panelists. A leaked casting notice indicates the network will stream its initial programming over the internet, hinting towards a non-traditional format less reliant on cable TV. This aligns with Trump's existing foray into online media - evening newscasts streamed daily via Facebook Live. The auditions are to be held in a New York City studio. Although Trump denied plans to start a media company, his son-in-law has previously looked into launching a Trump television network.

I heard that Ash was tested for a breast cancer gene, so Ash reduced their risk by getting a mastectomy.  And I was wondering Why did Ash do this? Available options: (1). do some research. (2). talk to a doctor. (3). ensure she would live a long, cancer-free life.","output":"Based on the information provided and the available options, it seems Ash has acted upon her knowledge of carrying a gene that predisposes her to breast cancer. The decision to get a mastectomy can involve multiple factors. Here's a step-by-step rationale: 1. Genetic testing: First, Ash has done a genetic test which revealed that she carries a gene for breast cancer. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most common genes involved in hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. People with these gene mutations have a higher risk of developing these cancers. 2. Counselling: Ash must have been counseled by a genetic counselor or doctor who explained the risks associated with the presence of the gene mutation. This session probably included discussions about preventive measures and risk-reducing strategies. 3. Consideration: Ash must have considered all the implications, including her personal and family medical history, the likelihood of cancer occurrence, and the effects of a mastectomy. This is a personal decision, taking into account the emotional, mental, and physical impacts. 4. Decision: Ash decided for a preventive mastectomy. This is a surgery to remove one or both breasts in an attempt to prevent or reduce the risk of breast cancer in women at high risk of developing the disease. 5. Objective: Ash mainly did this to ensure she would live a long, cancer-free life. This preventive measure drastically reduces the risk of developing breast cancer in women with a very high risk. 6. Long-term perspective: Even though this is a drastic measure, Ash has taken a longer-term view of her health and well-being to reduce her risk of breast cancer which was potentially highly likely due to the gene mutation. In summary, Ash chose option (3). Her decision was based on test results, potential risk, and likely advice from healthcare professionals, with the aim of living a long, cancer-free life. It's important to remember that this choice can vary for individuals based on personal circumstances and preferences, and it's a very personal decision to make."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Chew softer foods such as berries, fruit, or cooked vegetables at least 5 times so your saliva and digestive enzymes can mix with your food to aid in digestion. Focus on chewing all of the food in your mouth to help form a bolus, which is a round mass of food that makes swallowing safer and easier.  Some fruits, like watermelon, may only take 4-5 chews before it’s broken down enough to be easily digested. Avoid taking 1-2 bites and then swallowing your food or it won’t be properly digested, and you can experience gas, bloating, and intestinal discomfort. Count each of your bites as you chew tougher or crunchier foods such as cooked meat and vegetables like celery, radishes, or carrots to help break them down into more easily digestible pieces. Some foods may not need to be chewed as many times before they’re broken down enough to be swallowed easily, but aim for 30 chews. Take your time and count each of your chews to help slow yourself down and chew your food properly. Take your bites of food and chew them slowly, focusing on each chew so you can properly break the food down and mix it with digestive enzymes in your saliva. Avoid using quick, choppy bites, which won’t properly grind up your food. Eating more slowly also gives your stomach time to signal to your brain that you’re full, which will help you avoid overeating. Move harder or tougher foods such as nuts, seeds, and crunchy vegetables to the back of your mouth where your molars are so they can be properly chewed and broken up to make swallowing and digesting them easier. Avoid swallowing hard or tough pieces of food whole to reduce digestive issues. Your molars are designed to help you chew up tougher foods, so use them! As you’re chewing your food and breaking it down, use your tongue to move the pieces around your mouth so all of the food is evenly and properly chewed. Feel for pieces of food in your mouth with your tongue and move unchewed bits over to your teeth so it can be properly chewed. Be careful not to bite your tongue! Continue chewing your food until it’s liquid and there aren’t any pieces that are still crunchy or tough. When the food is evenly chewed and broken down, you can swallow it and take another bite. Some foods will require more chewing than others, so make sure your food is smooth and liquid before you swallow. Summary:","output":"1.

When Francis Benali arrives at St Mary's on Saturday, he'll be emotional. The former Southampton hardman may even shed a tear, perhaps not something you would expect from a man of his reputation. But consider this. How would you feel after running close to 1,000 miles in three weeks? Pretty emotional, probably. Test: Benali (left) is running the 1000 miles between every Premier League ground in just 21 days. Power: The former Southampton full-back poses by the pitch after reaching Leicester's King Power stadium. Well, when Benali reaches the final stop of his tour of all 20 Barclays Premier League grounds ahead of Southampton's clash against West Ham this weekend, that's exactly what he would have achieved. Twenty-one days of agony, ice-baths and sleep deprivation - all in aid of Cancer Research UK. 'I've always been interested in extreme challenges such as this and the idea to do something like this has been floating around in my head for about three years now,' Benali told Sportsmail. 'And then came the moment where I just thought: \\"It's now or never\\". I always wanted a challenge to be based around football given I used to be professional, so this sounded like a perfect idea - though halfway through, I'm not so sure now! Emotional: Although the physical pain is tough, it's the mental test that Benali is finding hardest. 'The idea of seeing how far you can push yourself has always intrigued me.' Benali, now 45, knows a thing or two about putting his body through the mill. Over 300 league appearances for the Saints between 1988 and 2004 speaks for itself. But the former Saints full-back is quick to point out that his years as a Premier League footballer pales in comparison to his current challenge of running, on average, 50 miles a day. Helping out: Benali battles with Alan Shearer but his former teammate is helping him along the way. 'Obviously the pain threshold is the biggest difficulty you face,' said Benali. 'It's a different type of fitness to playing football professionally, this is more about the mind when you can barely put one foot in front of the other. 'Nothing can prepare you for that. The extent of my training was going on a 40 miler, but I had two days off after that. 'So you know you can run the distance, it' just having the mindset to tell yourself you have to do it everyday. That's the hardest thing. 'Some days you get through it, some days you can hardly put one foot in front of each other. Stretching the limits: Running an average of 50 miles a day, some days Benali runs longer than he sleeps. 'Some days I finish running, take an ice bath, eat and fall straight into bed and have to do it all over again. Some days I'm running longer in a day than I'm sleeping at night. 'Some days I just can't eat anything, I have no appetite. Obviously my support team are keen for me to stay sufficiently refuelled for the next day, but some days I just can't physically eat anything. 'That is perhaps the hardest thing. The running, yes, it's painful but you get through it. 'But it's the mental and emotional battle that is the hardest to deal with. All the days are blurring into one at the moment. 'The other day I just burst into tears when I finished for the day after seeing my family. You don't expect that to happen. Mental strength: 'It's a different type of fitness to playing football professionally,' says Benali. 'You can prepare physically, but it's the emotional side you can't prepare for. But that was part of the intrigue for me, how far you can push yourself, what your limits are.' Thankfully, Benali has been helped along the way during his gruelling personal battle across England's footballing landscape. He's managed to rope former team-mates Alan Shearer, Matt Le Tissier and James Beattie into helping him along on certain legs, while current top-flight stars Dean Hammond and Danny Ings have also lent their support. Southampton's promising start to the season will have also helped Benali's mood along the way. Many had tipped the south-coast club as relegation contenders following the departure of manager Mauricio Pochettino to Tottenham, as well as the likes of Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Calum Chambers and Dejan Lovren. But under the guidance of new manager Ronald Koeman, Southampton have lost just one from their opening three game - a narrow defeat at Liverpool. Exhausted: By the time he arrives at St Mary's on Saturday Benali will have been to all 20 grounds. Hardman: The fullback had a reputation as a tough guy but he admits to breaking down during this journey. Staying positive: Benali believes that Koeman's men can have a good season despite a tough summer. 'People had Saints tagged as relegation candidates, but I was always pretty confident, I suppose I'm always a confident and positive person,' added Benali. 'People were questioning why were selling so many players, in many ways we were victims of our own success. But Koeman needed time to get his players in and he looks to have signed some real real quality there. 'So I was never one who feared the worst.' You'll need all that positive thinking this week, Francis.

City.  Let's scrutinize all options for a clear understanding: A. Field: While outdoor markets are common in many places, an enclosed market suggests a permanent structure typically seen in more urban settings. Fields are usually open spaces primarily used for agriculture or sports, and thus, are less likely to harbor enclosed markets. B. Village: Villages sometimes might have outdoor markets or small shops, but they are less likely to possess large enclosed markets. These are common in densely populated areas with a wide variety of goods and services to offer.  C. Rural Area: A rural area often has less population density, and people living here are more likely to rely on farming and local produce selling. Due to the lack of substantial commercial demand and less densely populated areas, enclosed markets are less frequent here. D. City: Enclosed markets entail more significant structure, variety, and they are designed to cater to the diverse needs of a highly populated area. These characteristics align with the general features of a city. Subsequently, cities provide the infrastructure, population, and demand for a diverse range of products that make large, enclosed markets viable and lucrative. Enclosed markets in cities can offer everything from food to clothing, technology and other services. Therefore, we can say that a city is the place where a market is likely to be enclosed. E. Mexico: This is not an appropriate answer, as Mexico is an entire country and markets can vary vastly depending on whether they're in larger cities or smaller towns or villages.

Her daily routine was not fascinating.She did everything from sweeping the floor to cooking the meals.If someone had asked Cinderella, \\"Are there any kinds of household work that you particularly hate?\\" she probably would have answered, \\"Why, none, of course.Housework is my duty!\\" In the real world, however, most people have definite dislikes for certain sorts of household work.Two of these tasks are ironing clothes and washing dishes. Ironing clothes is most hated because it is not a task that can be completed quickly or thoughtlessly. Each piece of clothing must be handled individually, so ironing a basket of laundry can take hours! After ironing a piece of clothing with great caution, which-requires smoothing out the fabric, and following the seams   ,you need to place it on a hanger as soon as possible.If you do not follow these directions carefully, it might become wrinkled   and you have to start over.Perhaps that is why ironing is not a favorite thing to do.It calls for extreme attention to detail from beginning to end. Another household job that many people dislike is washing dishes.Of course, some people claim that this work is no longer a problem because we have dishwashers now! However, no one would argue that dishes, silverware, and especially pots and pans washed in a dishwasher don't come out as clean as they do when washed by hand.For this reason, many of us continues to wash our dishes by hand, but we are not necessarily happy doing it.Cleaning dishes is a job that not only takes a lot of energy but also requires the patience to wash and dry them.In addition, unlike ironing clothes, washing dishes is a thing that usually must be done every day.I don't know how Cinderella felt about this particular task, but I believe that most people hate it as much as I do.

In addition to El Mariachi, Sands persuades former FBI agent Jorge Ramírez to come out of retirement and kill Barillo, who had murdered his partner Archuleta in the past. Furthermore, AFN operative Ajedrez is assigned by Sands to tail Barillo. While monitoring Barillo's activities, Ramírez meets Billy Chambers, an American fugitive who has been living under the protection of Barillo, but can no longer stomach the horrible tasks he's been forced to carry out for him. Ramírez convinces Chambers he will provide him protection in exchange for getting closer to Barillo by tagging Chambers' pet chihuahua with a hidden microphone, and Chambers agrees to complete the deal by surrendering to U.S. authorities once Barillo has been taken down. Sands' assistant, Cucuy, originally hired to keep an eye on El Mariachi, instead tranquilizes El Mariachi and turns him over to Barillo, also offering to reveal the details of Sands's plan. Cucuy, however, is promptly killed by Chambers while El Mariachi escapes from captivity and calls his friends Lorenzo and Fideo to assist him in his mission. The answer is:","output":"Sands. CIA agent Sheldon Jeffrey Sands is the person who hires someone (El Mariachi) to kill the corrupt Mexican army officer, General Emiliano Marquez."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Q: Makes Me Want to Go Build a New House . I review a lot of architecture books, and this one more than most makes me want to go out and build a new house. The subject of the book is small houses. It consists of pictures and the story of some fifty houses, all of which are less than 1,300 square feet. Many of them are much less than 1,300 feet, indeed down into the 300-400 square foot size.     I live in a small house -- 900 square feet or so -- that's about a hundred years old. But compared to the layout, the beauty the simplicity of design, mine's a dump. I'm getting the urge to go visit a realtor friend. One thing about these houses is that many of them are on what would be considered hard to build on lots. And such lots tend to be cheap. There's a new architect in town that's fresh out of school and may have more originality than the older guys. Maybe if I give her this book, with a few houses marked. Hmmmmm!     One thing I didn't like, most of the bed rooms are on the second floor. I was in a house once that had a fire. The amount of smoke generated in just a minute or two was incredible. I don't want a bed room upstairs, if necessary I want to be able to close the door to keep the smoke out and get out through a wondow or emergency door.     Other than that, this is a great idea book. The pictures are beautiful. There's not as much detail as I would like, but adding detail would have to mean either fewer houses or bigger book, so I guess it's a nice balance A:","output":"Part #1: Classify the review as \\"POS\\" or \\"NEG\\" Usage: \\"POS\\" The given review is positive as the reviewer mostly praises the architecture book, its ideas and images. They express their desire to build a new house inspired by the book, and even though they mention a small negative aspect (regarding bedrooms being on the second floor), the overall sentiment is positive. Part #2: Determining the overall sentiment Usage: Positive sentiment. The reviewer states that the book \\"makes me want to go out and build a new house\\" and calls it \\"a great idea book.\\" These statements reflect a positive sentiment towards the book. Part #3: Identifying a negative aspect Usage: Bedrooms on the second floor. The reviewer specifically mentions they don't like that most of the bedrooms in the book's houses are on the second floor due to smoke concerns in case of a fire. This is a negative aspect, but it does not outweigh the overall positive sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1607, English Chief Justice Sir Edward Coke said in the Case of Prohibitions (according to his own report) \\"that the law was the golden met-wand and measure to try the causes of the subjects; and which protected His Majesty in safety and peace: with which the King was greatly offended, and said, that then he should be under the law, which was treason to affirm, as he said; to which I said, that Bracton saith, quod Rex non debed esse sub homine, sed sub Deo et lege (That the King ought not to be under any man but under God and the law.).\\" According to Coke what should kings be above?","output":"According to Sir Edward Coke, kings should not be above the law, but should be subject to it. He quoted Bracton's statement, \\"quod Rex non debet esse sub homine, sed sub Deo et lege\\" which means, \\"The King ought not to be under any man but under God and the law.\\" This highlights the idea that while the king may hold significant power, he is still bound by the rule of law and ultimately accountable to a higher power, which is God.

This is the moment a pensioner had to be rescued after 'deliberately' driving into the sea in front of tourists at millionaires' resort Sandbanks. The woman sat motionlessly as the water poured into her Volkswagen Golf off the Dorset coast today. Witnesses described how she wound down both front windows of her car before speeding down a ferry slipway and into the water at around midday. The silver car was swept 100 yards out to sea by the fast tide the unnamed woman refused to move despite cries from the quayside to get out as it went down. Scroll down for video. Rescue: This is the moment a woman had to be rescued after apparently driving deliberately into the sea off Sandbanks. Submerged: The VW sank  yards from the home of Premier League football manager Harry Redknapp on the Sandbanks peninsula. Rescue: The woman is led away to safety by RNLI and emergency workers after she was freed from the sinking car. Drama: The woman's car had to be dragged from the water shortly after she herself was pulled from the car. Lucky to be alive: The unnamed woman was rescued by fishermen who jumped into the sea and dragged her out. But the crew  of a passing fishing boat then dived into the water and pulled the woman free just moments before her vehicle sank. The soaked casualty was lifted on board next to the Sandbanks to Studland chain ferry - which sits yards from the home of Premier League football manager Harry Redknapp. After being pulled to safety  her rescuers went back to the sinking vehicle to retrieve the woman's handbag. Witness Steve Chater-Lea, 45, said the woman drove past a queue of cars waiting for the ferry before heading down the slope at speed. He said: 'She drove past the ferry queue and accelerated down the ramp. It was definitely deliberate, you could tell from the way she revved the engine and the force with which she hit she the water. 'Both her windows were down and you could see her just sat there oblivious to people shouting out to her to get out. She made no movement or attempt to leave the car. 'There were 20 or 30 people stood on the quay about 15 feet away shouting for her to get out. 'There was a strong outgoing tide and the car went about 100 yards towards the sea, getting lower and lower in the water. 'A fishing boat came alongside the car but she still wouldn't get out and one of the crew dived in and pulled her out of the passenger side. 'She was alive and taken to the jetty for the Brownsea Island ferry and into an ambulance.' Shock: Witnesses described how the motorists sped down this ferry ramp and crashed into the water. Fear: This picture was taken shortly after the car went into the sea and quickly it was swept 100 yards out. Witnesses: People on the busy ferry crossing the estuary also captured the moment the boat began to sink. Brave: Workers on a passing fishing vessel saw the woman and dived in to save her from the deep water. This barge with a lifting crane on arrived on the scene about an hour later and hoisted the sunken vehicle out of the water. Damage: The car's bumper and windscreen were both smashed  in the impact with the water. Holidaymaker Bob Smallman said: 'I saw the car in the water and we were all screaming for her to get out but she was just holding on to the steering wheel. 'A fishing boat went round to get her out but she didn't want to go, she looked frightened. They were dragging her in the water for a bit. 'They managed to get her out before the car went completely underwater. 'An inflatable boat that took her to safety then went back to the car and rescued her handbag before it sunk. She must have told them about her bag and been adamant they needed to get it.' Witness Ash Naik said 'I was on the phone talking to my friend ad just said 'I have to go'. 'I saw her flying down the ferry jetty really fast. She jumped the queue of traffic and just shot off the end. She was going so fast one of her wipers came off. 'The car windows were open and the car started to sink when it hit the water but she just sat there and didn't move. 'Someone threw a life-ring in the water but she didn't try to get it. One guy jumped in but she was clung onto the door. They pulled her into the boat.' The woman was taken to hospital where she was treated for shock and the effects of hyperthermia. The woman was taken to hospital where she was treated for shock and the effects of hyperthermia. Busy: Numerous families with children on school half-term and other tourists were on the quayside and surrounding area when the woman drove in. Solent coastguard said they were called in and the woman and the car were both recovered safely. The roof of the submerged car could be seen a few inches beneath the surface of the water. A barge with a lifting crane on arrived on the scene about an hour later and hoisted the sunken vehicle out of the water. Numerous families with children on school half-term were on the quayside and witnessed the incident at 11.58am today. A spokesman for Solent coastguard said: 'A lady driving a Volkswagen car managed to go into the water off the slipway. 'She has been recovered safely. The car was located 30 metres offshore and collected by a local fishing vessel. A spokesman for the Bournemouth-Swanage Motor Road and Ferry Company, which operates the chain ferry, confirmed the ferry had left the Sandbanks slipway and was halfway across the entrance to Poole Harbour at the time.

The equation we have is: 718 = -18 * o + 502 First, we need to get the -18 * o by itself, so we'll move the 502 to the other side of the equal sign by subtracting it from both sides. Then it will look like this: 718 - 502 = -18 * o Now, if we do the subtraction: 216 = -18 * o Next, we need to figure out what number \\"o\\" is by canceling the -18. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -18: 216 / -18 = (-18 * o) / -18 After dividing, we get: -12 = o So there you have it! The solution to the math problem is o = -12."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

A good Samaritan braved the freezing waters of Lake Michigan risking his own safety to rescue a confused dog wandering on ice floats. Spotting Pifas, a three-year-old stranded golden retriever mix half-a-mile out on the lake, Dave Kehnast, 37, didn't think twice about donning his wetsuit and jumping aboard his kayak to rescue the stricken dog on Friday. As the Chicago Fire Department went through safety procedures, Kehnast cut through the ice with his raft and herded the dog back to shore through the perishing waters of the lake off the Loyola Park section of Chicago. Scroll Down for Video. Pifas is filmed by news cameras adrift on ice floats in the freezing waters of Lake Michigan. Dave Kehnast tried to get the dog to listen to his commands - but Pifas was scared and confused. Rescued: Pifas the dog was reunited with his owner at a Chicago Animal Care and Control center on Friday evening - he will be allowed home on Sunday. News cameras captured the heartwarming rescue at 4.30 p.m. on Friday - which included hand-in-mouth moments as Pifas the dog fell into the water on occasion, clearly struggling with exhaustion. 'I was up on the fire escape there on the seventh floor up there and I saw him way out there and so I grabbed the kayak over here and I know that the lake is only a couple of feet deep all the way out to where the ice shelf ends so I knew I'd be fine,; Kehnast explained to Fox News. More... 100 people rescued after being stranded on Dallas Zoo monorail for an hour. 'It is like with a child': Meet the Colombian woman raising an orphaned monkey by keeping it nuzzled next to her 24 hours a day. 'And so I grabbed the kayak and went out there.' Lost by owner Nerijus Steponavicius over a week before while out on a walk, Pifas was hungry and confused when Kehnast made his rescue. Watched by a news camera onboard a helicopter - Dave Kehnast and Pifas made their way to the sure together. Chicago Fire Department officers also attempted to encourage Pifas the dog to make his way to shore. 'I just kept encouraging him, ‘here boy, here boy, here boy' said Kehnast. 'I got really close to him and he wanted to bite me so I just stayed on me and at that point I could get into the water and just hustled him along. 'I wanted to just grab him because it was shallow enough where I could stand, and I just wanted to get my hands on him but he wanted to bite me, it looked like. He didn't want anyone touching him.' In fact, once the dog reached safe ground after the hour-long ordeal, he took off running. He took off from there, escaping authorities as he ran around nearby apartment complexes. Eventually crews caught up with the exhausted dog and ushered it into the back of a white utility van - from where it was taken to an animal shelter. Hero (left) Dave Kehnast saved Pifas the dog from the freezing waters of Lake Michigan. Owner Nerijus Steponavicius had lost his dog over a week before the dramatic rescue on Friday. 'We responded and found the dog quite a distance offshore, maybe close to half a mile off shore, running around on the icebergs out there and falling through to the open water,' said Chicago Fire Department Deputy District Chief Ron Dorneker to NBC News. 'We used a helicopter to try and move the dog a little closer to shoreline, we brought a boat in.' Dog and owner are due to reunited on Sunday after Steponavicius heard from family that his dog had starred on the afternoon news. As the rescue attempt was caught on live television, Steponavicius, of Wicker Park, said his cell phone was ringing non-stop, from calls from people who recognized the dog. Rushing to the Department of Animal Care and Control, Steponavicius was told he couldn't be reunited with Pifas because he was not neutered, an operation carried out yesterday. Once he was back on shore - Pifas was still so confused that he made off and went running around - and had to be caught be emergency workers. However, Pifas was pleased to see his owner. 'He’s really shy, so when he saw me he started jumping around in the cage,' said Steponavicius with a huge smile. 'The biggest lesson, once again: keep those dogs on leashes along the lakefront in the wintertime,' said Chicago Fire Department Deputy District Chief Ron Dorneker. 'This is what can happen when they get out there on that ice and they fall through and they get a distance off-shore.' For hero Kehnast, he said he simply could not have just watched the dog flounder on the ice. 'I wanted the dog to live just like any other person out here watching him,' said Kehnast. 'I have the gear, I have the equipment, I would have been beating myself up if I had just sat there.' What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Greg and Frank were two friends that studied natural sciences. One day, Greg decided to start reading about natural selection. His friend Frank decided to read more about populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly. They both learned lots of new interesting facts.  But I can use this background: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks.  What is an answer for this question: Which friend studied less about the natural development of species? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, it seems that Frank studied less about the natural development of species compared to Greg. While both friends focused on aspects of natural sciences, their topics of study were quite different in terms of how they related to the development of new species. Greg chose to read about natural selection, which is directly linked to the development of new species. Natural selection is the process by which organisms with traits that are better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, this results in the beneficial traits becoming more common in the population. Ultimately, this process drives the natural development of species as organisms adapt to changing environments and evolve. On the other hand, Frank decided to read more about populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly. This topic, while still within the realm of natural sciences, does not directly address the natural development of new species in the same way that natural selection does. In focusing on populations with less prevalent instances of natural selection, Frank's studies may have involved factors that slow down or suppress the process, rather than the key driving forces that lead to the development of new species. Given their respective areas of study, it can be concluded that Frank studied less about the natural development of species compared to Greg."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To provide more detail: 1. Blood enters the kidney through the renal artery, which branches off from the aorta. 2. In the kidney, nephrons – which are the functional units of the kidney – filter the blood. The filtering process involves glomerulus (a network of capillaries) and Bowman's capsule, where the filtration of water, waste products, and essential nutrients happens. 3. Next, the filtrate flows through the renal tubules (proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, and distal convoluted tubule). During this process, necessary molecules and ions (such as glucose, amino acids, sodium, and water) are reabsorbed back into the bloodstream, while waste products and excess substances remain in the tubule. 4. The waste that is filtered out mixes with water and forms urine. This urine is collected in the renal pelvis, a funnel-shaped structure that helps in the transportation of urine. 5. The final step is the transportation of urine to the bladder via the ureters. The urine is temporarily stored in the bladder until it is expelled from the body through the urethra during the process of urination. So, the final step is the transportation of urine out of the kidney to the bladder and its eventual excretion from the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton. These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China. In the area that is now India, massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.\\"?

People living in Scotland and Northern Ireland can expect to spend a smaller proportion of their lives in good health than their English and Welsh neighbours, new figures suggest. The amount of life spent in good general health is increasing in England and Wales but falling in Scotland and Northern Ireland, according to data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS). Could diet be to blame? Scottish youngsters can expect to enjoy fewer healthy years compared to the English and Welsh (file picture) And health authorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland should expect increasing demands on services, researchers concluded. Boys born in England between 2008 and 2010, who are expected to live to the age of 78, are estimated to spend 64 years in good health. Those born in Scotland, who are expected to live for almost 76 years, have a 'health life expectancy' of just under 60 years, data shows. Similarly, girls born in Wales between 2008 and 2012 can expect to live 63 of their estimated 81.7 years of life in good health. The number of years spent in good health for girls born in Northern Ireland is 61.9. The authors said: 'These findings indicate that Scotland and Northern Ireland may face proportionally greater future demands on health services than England and Wales due to the well established link between self-rated health and subsequent mortality and health service use.' While life expectancy continues to increase across the UK, researchers wanted to assess whether the additional years were spent in good or bad health. Across the UK as a whole, people can expect to spend more than 80 per cent of their lives in good or very good general health. For boys born between 2008 and 2010, they could expect to live 63.5 years in good health - 81% of the life expectancy of 78.1. The average time for girls to live in good health was 65.7 years - 80 per cent of the female life expectancy of 82.1. Dr Ros Altmann, Director-General of Saga, comments: 'The latest figures showing that more of us are staying healthy into later life these days are really something to celebrate.  Medical advances have brought such success in helping people live longer. That does also mean re-evaluating our lives too. 'Working longer, keeping active - and saving more if you can - are vital ingredients of managing the ageing population. We need to help older people look after themselves where possible and help younger people appreciate the value of elders.'","output":"1.

Her journey to work that day from her new flat in the Barbican complex in the City of London ended in tragedy on the Circle line near Aldgate. Miss Stevenson had dreamed of becoming a lawyer ever since she did some work with a local firm of solicitors at the age of 14 and harboured a long-term ambition to work for the UN. That determination was driven by a strong sense of human injustice which burned brightly within her, according to her boss Colin Reynolds, of central London law firm Reynolds Dawson. \\"Her entire career history was a testament to her dedication to representing those ensnared in the criminal justice system, but unable to defend themselves,\\" he said. \\"Fiona was a hard-working, conscientious and supremely able criminal lawyer. The firm will forever be the poorer for her loss. \\"Within a small practice her bubbly personality, care and compassion for colleagues, as well as clients, were cherished qualities, which will be sorely missed.\\" In a statement to the inquest her family said: \\"She had a wonderful zest for life. As far as she was concerned, life was not a dress rehearsal, and she was determined to live it to the full.\\" They had last heard from her on the evening of 6 July. He family said she was \\"happy and contented, full of optimism for the future\\" and was looking forward to coming home a couple of days later at the weekend. Then, on the following day, when there was no response from her mobile, the family received the tragic news from her employer that she was missing. Bruce Lait, a professional dancer, who was on the train when the bomb exploded, told the inquest how he became aware of the injured Miss Stevenson lying across his lap as the dust settled. Mr Lait said he held her hand felt her squeeze his as she slipped away. 'Superb company' Miss Stevenson was born in Cheshire on 22 June 1976. In 1986, she moved with her parents, Ivan and Emer, and younger sister Andrea, to Little Baddow, Essex, and attended New Hall School in Chelmsford and King Edward VI Grammar School in Chelmsford. Her schoolfriend Oliver Nash recalled her \\"infectious laugh whenever she caught the bus to secondary school\\" and said she \\"was polite and superb company\\". Miss Stevenson went on to Sussex University where she studied law and then took a gap year working for several organisations including the Medical Defence Union and in Paris. She joined the north London firm of Galbraith Branley in 1999 as a trainee solicitor and after qualification in 2001 worked mainly on criminal cases. She also represented clients at Mental Health Tribunals and early in her career was said to have felt great pride in preparing a judicial review and successful appeal at the Court of Appeal. Miss Stevenson joined Reynolds Dawson in 2003. There, she worked as a duty solicitor in court and police stations, and become involved in the firm's main area of expertise - representing clients in fraud and extradition cases and undertook regulatory work. Unpaid sabbatical Spurred on by her desire to apply these skills in a different way, Miss Stevenson took a four-month unpaid sabbatical to Belize in 2005. As a volunteer for Challenges World Wide, she worked with the government to develop a staff training manual for child care proceedings there. This opportunity meant she could also indulge her passion for diving, and she completed two qualifications and a dive in the Blue Hole while in Belize. She also competed in the 180-mile long, Ruta Maya four-day kayak race and on arriving back in UK in May 2005, announced that her next project was to climb Mount Kilimanjaro. Miss Stevenson returned \\"refreshed and energised\\" from her sabbatical. She was interested in gaining higher court rights and also expressed a desire to do a masters in Human Rights. In her spare time, she liked music and dance, played the piano and enjoyed golf. In a statement issued through police in 2005, Miss Stevenson's family said: \\"Fiona's tragic loss is immeasurable to her family, friends and colleagues. She is so greatly missed and irreplaceable and words cannot express the continued loss. \\"She has been described as articulate, strong-willed, vibrant, energetic, caring, generous and, as her friends and sister always said, she never held a grudge.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"This article is about a lady named Fiona Stevenson who was 29 years old and worked as a lawyer in London.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . .  that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens... Question: How long can someone multitask for before becoming stressed out?

Movie, Oliver Stone, Privacy Edward Snowden appeared via video chat during the first-ever screening of Snowden, Oliver Stone’s new film about the NSA leaker, at a San Diego theater down the street from Comic-Con Thursday night. Snowden, who has a cameo in the film (though we won’t spoil when or how) was projected onto the film screen during a Q&A with the director and stars, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Shailene Woodley. Audience members asked him to weigh in on the current election. “We have become something of a legalistic society where people parse, is it lawful or is it unlawful? When someone’s defense for their activities is this was legal, ‘I didn’t break any laws,’ that’s a very weak defense. The legality of a thing is entirely distinct from the morality of it,” Snowden said. “If we become afraid to point that out and challenge people who are running for leadership roles on here, we’ve lost something uniquely American that’s been a rudder on our ship.” Snowden, who is currently in exile in Russia, also received questions about a scene in the film (also in the trailer) in which he sneaks information past government security using a Rubik’s Cube. He said that that wasn’t really how he did it, but he did come up with that trick for the movie. He wouldn’t reveal the actual way he accomplished that feat in real life: “This the part where we remember the FBI would get a copy of the Google Hangout.” Stone joked that the time spent filming Snowden (who said, “I’m not an actor”) was arduous and compared it to his sessions filming Donald Trump for what became outtakes of Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. “The difference between Donald and Ed, and I love the man in a weird way, is that [Donald Trump] jumped up after every take and said, ‘Wasn’t that great?'” Stone said. The director had said at a panel earlier that day that Snowden had been hesitant to come onboard the film, and it took three covert meetings abroad for Stone to convince Snowden. At the Q&A, Snowden confirmed he didn’t relish the idea of a fictional version of himself onscreen. “I don’t think anyone looks forward to having a movie made about themselves, particularly someone who is a privacy advocate,” said Snowden. But he said he came around once he saw the value of “avatars” telling his story in a narrative, digestible form for a bigger audience. He even admitted that Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s impression was spot-on. “Some of my family members have said ‘he sounds just like you.'” Finally, an audience member asked what Snowden’s quality of life is like today. “I can confirm that I am not living in a box,” he said. “I actually live a surprisingly free life.” He went on to say that he was happy in the sense that he does work that he is proud of every day now working with freedom of information organizations and the ACLU.

Cold or oxygen-rich atmospheres can sustain life at pressures much lower than atmospheric, as long as the density of oxygen is similar to that of standard sea-level atmosphere.

His limousine driver and a witness to the arrest, Louis Goldblatt, described him as \\"genuinely dumbfounded by the whole affair.\\" Tour manager Eric Barrett said that he looked \\"as if there had been a plane crash\\". Hendrix biographers Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek described the incident as \\"a nightmare which ... plagued\\" him for seven months.

Act I: The film opens up in a small mining town called Redglen, set in the heart of California in 1852. We meet Dean Jagger, a skilled and hardworking prospector struggling to make ends meet while providing for his pregnant wife, Emma, and their son, Jacob. The townspeople hold a deep admiration for Dean since he single-handedly constructed several crucial infrastructures around the town as the community leader. In his quest for gold, Dean teams up with two other miners, Samuel and Murphy. They begin to hear stories of an undiscovered gold vein that can transform the fortunes of Redglen and all its residents. Quickly, the trio sets out on an adventurous journey driven by ambition, hope, and curiosity. Act II: The miners' search goes deeper into the wilderness while they come across several unique characters. Among them is Grace, a young and mysterious woman who saves Dean from a dangerous situation near a waterfall. Clearly smitten, Dean is torn between his growing attraction to Grace and his unwavering love for Emma. As they continue their quest, Samuel and Murphy are quickly revealed to have ulterior motives. They plan to betray Dean and take the promised gold vein for themselves. Daniel, a savvy Native American warrior, warns Dean of their malicious intentions. The second act reaches a climactic point when the miners discover the concealed entrance to a cave believed to hold the gold vein. Samuel and Murphy betray Dean, leaving him stranded and alone. Grace and Daniel come to his aid, banding together to retrieve the gold and foil Samuel and Murphy's plans. Act III: Together, Dean, Grace, and Daniel navigate the cave, facing various obstacles and hidden dangers. Eventually, they reach the gold vein and find it to be more prosperous than they could have imagined. In a twist of events, they also uncover an ancient burial chamber that holds a far greater treasure — rare materials and artifacts important to Daniel's tribe. During their escape from the cave, Dean fulfills his dream of striking gold and, at the same time, experiences an epiphany. The value of family, friendship, and redemption far exceed the worldly desires of wealth. The film concludes with Dean and his team returning to Redglen to build a thriving and more equitable community. Dreams of Gold is a riveting journey that celebrates the virtues of loyalty and love, while exploring the transformative power of good fortune when put to altruistic use. In a story filled with deceit, vengeance, and newfound solidarity, Dean Jagger evolves from a dream-driven prospector into a symbol of hope and unity in his community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Vancouver is the largest city in the province and the third largest in Canada. It covers an area of 113 sq km. It is surrounded by water on three sides and overlooked by the Coast Range. Its climate is one of the mildest in Canada. Temperatures average 3degC in January and 18degC in July. Vancouver's most rainfall occurs in winter.               Archaeological evidence shows that coastal Indians had settled the Vancouver area by 500 BC. British naval   captain George Vancouver explored the area in 1792. Vancouver was founded as a sawmill settlement called Granville in the 1870s. The city was united in 1886 and renamed after Captain Vancouver.               As the main western terminus of Canada's transcontinental highway and rail routes, Vancouver is the primary city of western Canada, as well as one of the nation's largest industrial centers.               The Port of Vancouver is Canada's largest and most various port, trading more than 43 billion in goods with more than 90 trading economies annually. Port activities generate 69,200 jobs in total with 4 billion in gross domestic product (GDP) and 8.9 billion in economic output.                Vancouver is a major tourist place.

The logic behind the \\"stand right, walk left\\" escalator etiquette  seems obvious. Even though you may want to catch your breath while you're transported up or down, you should still consider others and leave enough space for people in a hurry, so that they can run and catch the train. Many cities' escalators, including London's and Beijing's, use the \\"stand right, walk left\\" system to speed up the flow of people. (Australia is an exception and you should stand on the left side instead.) But some cities discourage people from moving on escalators out of safety reasons.

In conclusion, based on the existing information, we cannot conclude that \\"Two dogs biting another dog in a field.\\" We would require additional data to either support or refute the statement."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:Y},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],D={key:0},N={key:1};function j(n,e,h,m,i,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>i.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,i.searchQuery]]),i.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>i.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(i.searchQuery)+'".
