Article: The world, in painter Chen Xiao's eyes, is as colorful and sweet as ice cream. At the opening of his latest exhibition, Colorful World in the Eyes of Sean Chen, at the National Museum of China recently, the artist told his story. Chen left China for Australia in 1986 to seek artistic freedom, and like many new immigrants then, he had little money in his pocket. To make ends meet, he drew portraits of people in the street. Every day, he saw people buy ice cream from a shop. Chen couldn't help wondering: \\"It must taste great, that's why so many people buy it.\\" But he didn't buy one for himself because he had to save money to support his studies. After four months of painting there and watching people eat ice cream, Chen didn't resist the temptation --- he bought an ice cream. \\"The first bite took me to heaven,\\" Chen recalls while laughing. \\"You know, as a poor young man in a new country, an ice cream was too expensive then.\\" Since then, he kept the taste of the ice cream in his heart and included the happy feelings in his paintings, which turn out to be colorful and sweet. His current exhibition is part of his nationwide tour that began at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing in 2011. He plans to take his artworks to 24 cities around China by 2016. The exhibition at the National Art Museum of China will last until April 22. After the exhibition tour, he will sell his works through an auction , and all the money will be donated to protection of the environment in China. \\"The natural environment of New Zealand has inspired my artwork and brought me enjoyment. I hope people in my home country can enjoy the same beautiful environment as I do,\\" says Chen, who has made New Zealand his home for the last 26 years.

Eastbourne is immediately to the east of Beachy Head, the highest chalk sea cliff in Great Britain. With a seafront consisting largely of Victorian hotels, a pier and a Napoleonic era fort and military museum, Eastbourne was developed by the Duke of Devonshire from 1859 from four separate hamlets. It has a growing population, a broad economic base and is home to companies in a wide range of industries.  - Alfriston is a village and civil parish in the Sussex district of Wealden , England . The village lies in the valley of the River Cuckmere , about four miles ( 6 km ) north - east of Seaford and south of the main A27 trunk road and part of the large area of Polegate . The parish has a population of 769 ( 2001 census ) , increasing to 829 at the 2011 census .  - Polegate is a town and civil parish in the Wealden District of East Sussex, England, United Kingdom. It is located five miles (8 km) north of the seaside resort of Eastbourne, and is part of the greater area of that town. Although once a railway settlement, its importance as such has now waned with closures of routes. The parish of Polegate had a population of 8586 on the 2011 census of which 41.2% were aged 65 and over.  - A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount).  - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority. It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an ecclesiastical parish.  - The River Cuckmere rises near Heathfield in East Sussex, England on the southern slopes of the Weald. The name of the river probably comes from an Old English word meaning \\"fast-flowing\\", since it descends over 100 m (328 ft) in its initial four miles (6.4 km). It flows into the English Channel, and has the only undeveloped river mouth on the Sussex coast.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean.  - The Weald is an area in South East England situated between the parallel chalk escarpments of the North and the South Downs. It crosses the counties of Sussex, Hampshire, Kent and Surrey. It has three separate parts: the sandstone \\"High Weald\\" in the centre; the clay \\"Low Weald\\" periphery; and the Greensand Ridge, which stretches around the north and west of the Weald and includes its highest points. The Weald once was covered with forest, and its name, Old English in origin, signifies \\"woodland.\\" The term is still used today, as scattered farms and villages sometimes refer to the Weald in their names.  - East Sussex is a county in South East England. It is bordered by the counties of Kent to the north and east, Surrey to the north west and West Sussex to the west, and to the south by the English Channel.  - A unitary authority is a type of local authority that has a single tier and is responsible for all local government functions within its area or performs additional functions which elsewhere in the relevant country are usually performed by national government or a higher level of sub-national government.  - Wealden is a local government district in East Sussex, England: its name comes from the Weald, the remnant forest which was once unbroken and occupies much of the centre and north of this area. The term is cognate with \\"Wald\\", forest or wood in German.    What object entity has the relation of 'located in the administrative territorial entity' with the subject 'alfriston'?

It grow along cracks in stone walls and along the roadside near my home in Settignano, which is blooming with spring goodness right now: robinia (black locust) trees, wild garlic (three-cornered leek) and even elderflowers are already bursting. I asked the vendor just to double check, “Is this borage?” “Si,” Came the answer, “Borragine.” He confirmed. “I’ve had it in ravioli,” I started to say, “Brava!” He said, as if we were about to start a guessing game on what could be done with it. Actually, there’s a lot that can be done with it. If you can use it as a ravioli filling with ricotta, then you can imagine it taking the place of spinach in gnudi, too, but also soups or frittata or stirred through polenta. I learned that the flowers are just as delicious, if not more interesting, for their delicate cucumber-like flavour — people told me of their use in salads or cocktails like Pimms, and someone even mentioned she freezes them in ice cubes, what a pretty idea for those first warm nights when you can dine al fresco, homemade cocktail in hand. Then there’s risotto and of course the fritters, much like these ones.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.  - Telmatosaurus (meaning \\"marsh lizard\\") is a genus of basal hadrosaurid dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous. It was a relatively small hadrosaur, approximately five meters (16 ft) long, found in what is now Romania.   - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the TriassicJurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago.  - Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe.  - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes  they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes.  - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.  - Romania is a sovereign state located in Southeastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, and Moldova. It has an area of and a temperate-continental climate. With 19.94 million inhabitants, the country is the seventh-most-populous member state of the European Union. The capital and largest city, Bucharest, with its 1,883,425 inhabitants is the sixth-largest city in the EU.  - The Late Cretaceous (100.566 Ma) is the younger of two epochs into which the Cretaceous period is divided in the geologic timescale. Rock strata from this epoch form the Upper Cretaceous series. The Cretaceous is named after the white limestone known as chalk which occurs widely in northern France and is seen in the white cliffs of south-eastern England, and which dates from this time.  - The tibia (plural tibiae or tibias), also known as the shinbone or shankbone, is the larger and stronger of the two bones in the leg below the knee in vertebrates (the other being the fibula), and it connects the knee with the ankle bones. The tibia is found on the medial side of the leg next to the fibula, and closer to the median plane or centre-line. The tibia is connected to the fibula by the interosseous membrane of the leg, forming a type of fibrous joint called a syndesmosis with very little movement. The tibia is named for the flute \\"tibia\\". It is the second largest bone in the human body next to the femur. The leg bones are the strongest long bones as they support the rest of the body.  - The femur (pl. \\"femurs\\" or \\"femora\\" ) or thigh bone, is the most proximal (closest to the hip joint) bone of the [leg] in tetrapod vertebrates capable of walking or jumping, such as most land mammals, birds, many reptiles such as lizards, and amphibians such as frogs. In vertebrates with four legs such as dogs and horses, the femur is found only in the hindlimbs. The head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum in the pelvic bone forming the hip joint, while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia and kneecap forming the knee joint. By most measures the femur is the strongest bone in the body. The femur is also the longest bone in the body.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk).  - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - Orthomerus ( meaning \`\` straight femur '' ) is a genus of duckbill dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of The Netherlands and Belgium . It is today an obscure genus , but in the past was conflated with the much better known Telmatosaurus .  - The domestic dog (\\"Canis lupus familiaris\\" or \\"Canis familiaris\\") is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.  - A hindlimb is a posterior limb on an animal, especially the quadrupeds. When referring to quadrupeds, the term hind leg is often instead used.  - In humans, the thigh is the area between the pelvis and the knee. Anatomically, it is part of the lower limb.  - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish.   - Hadrosaurids (\\"hadrós\\", \\"stout, thick\\"), or duck-billed dinosaurs, are members of the ornithischian family Hadrosauridae. This group is also known as the duck-billed dinosaurs, for the flat, duck-bill appearance of their mouths. The family, which includes ornithopods such as \\"Edmontosaurus\\" and \\"Parasaurolophus\\", was a common herbivore in the Upper Cretaceous Period of what is now Asia, Europe, Antarctica, South America and North America. Hadrosaurids are descendants of the Upper Jurassic/Lower Cretaceous iguanodontian dinosaurs and had a similar body layout. Like the rest of the ornithischians, these animals had a predentary bone and a pubic bone which was positioned backwards in the pelvis. Hadrosaurids are divided into two principal subfamilies: the lambeosaurines (\\"Lambeosaurinae\\"), which had hollow cranial crests or tubes, and the saurolophines, identified as hadrosaurines in most pre-2010 works (\\"Saurolophinae\\" or\\" Hadrosaurinae\\"), which lacked hollow cranial crests (solid crests were present in some forms). Saurolophines tended to be bulkier than lambeosaurines. Lambeosaurines are divided into Aralosaurines, Lambeosaurines, Parasaurolophines and Tsintaosaurines, while Saurolophines include Saurolophus, Brachylophosaurines and Kritosaurines.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period.   - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions.  - The TriassicJurassic extinction event marks the boundary between the Triassic and Jurassic periods, , and is one of the major extinction events of the Phanerozoic eon, profoundly affecting life on land and in the oceans. In the seas, a whole class (conodonts) and 34% of marine genera disappeared. On land, all pseudosuchians (non-ornithodiran archosaurs) other than crocodylomorphs (Sphenosuchia and Crocodyliformes), some remaining therapsids, and many of the large amphibians became extinct.  - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.  - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\".  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.  - The High Fens , which were declared a nature reserve in 1957, are an upland area, a plateau region in the province of Liège, in the east of Belgium and adjoining parts of Germany, between the Ardennes and the Eifel highlands. The High Fens are the largest nature reserve or park in Belgium, with an area of ; it lies within the German-Belgian natural park \\"Hohes Venn-Eifel\\", in the Ardennes. Its highest point, at above sea level, is the Signal de Botrange near Eupen, and also the highest point in Belgium. A tower high was built here that reaches above sea level. The reserve is a rich ecological endowment of Belgium covered with alpine sphagnum raised bogs (not \\"fens\\" as the name would imply) both on the plateau and in the valley basin; the bogs, which are over 10,000 years old, with their unique subalpine flora, fauna and microclimate, are key to the conservation work of the park.  - The knee joint joins the thigh with the leg and consists of two articulations: one between the femur and tibia (tibiofemoral joint), and one between the femur and patella (patellofemoral joint). It is the largest joint in the human body. The knee is a modified hinge joint, which permits flexion and extension as well as slight internal and external rotation. The knee joint is vulnerable to injury and to the development of osteoarthritis.    Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'parent taxon'.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Your doctor can provide direction, specific to your body and your situation, that can help you choose the best way to increase your progesterone levels. Your doctor is your best resource to understanding the changes or problems you are experiencing. Discuss supplements and lifestyle adjustments with your doctor to be sure that is the best option for you. Vitamin C, vitamin E, l-arginine, vitamin B6, selenium, and beta carotene have all been shown to increase progesterone levels. While natural sources of these supplements are part of a healthy diet, the vitamin or supplement content found in natural sources is not enough to make a difference in increasing your progesterone levels. Consider using manufactured products that contain higher concentrations of vitamins and supplements. Studies have shown the following amounts to be beneficial in increasing progesterone levels:  Consume 750mg of Vitamin C per day (increased progesterone levels by as much as 77%).  Consume 600mg of Vitamin E per day (Increased progesterone in 67% of patients studied) .  Take 6gm per day of L-arginine (improved serum progesterone in 71% of patients) .  Take 200mg to 800mg per day of vitamin B6 (reduces blood levels of estrogen and improves concentrations of progesterone) .  Add selenium to your daily vitamin doses (consuming selenium at any dose was shown to improve progesterone levels) .  Consume more beta-carotene (studies in animals showed improvement in progesterone levels and fertility) . Losing weight, avoiding large meals, eating a high protein and low carbohydrate diet, decreasing saturated fat intake, and increasing consumption of unsaturated fats, are recommended to improve your levels of progesterone.  Studies in overweight women show that losing as little as 5% of your body weight improves your progesterone levels.  In an animal study, the amount of available food was controlled during early pregnancy, resulting in higher levels of hormones needed to support pregnancy in the group that was not allowed to over eat.  Dietary changes that included higher amounts of protein and lower amounts of carbohydrates were positively correlated to improving progesterone levels in the women studied.  One animal study showed significant increases in progesterone when the diet was higher in omega 3 and omega 6 products contained in flaxseed, combined with a lower intake of saturated fats. While dairy products contain only small amounts of progesterone, research has shown a significant increase in progesterone levels in men when they consumed three servings per day of high-fat dairy products. The nicotine found in cigarettes can interfere with the way your ovaries naturally produce hormones, which disrupts processes involved with normal cyclic functioning. Cigarette smoking also adds to the risk of serious, and possibly life-threatening, adverse events when combined with products that contain estrogen or progesterone. Stress only adds to the complications that are already at work as you are trying to provide a healthy hormonal balance.  Use relaxation techniques that help you to breathe more deeply and stretch your muscles to reduce tension.  Take time out for a massage, and routinely take part in activities you enjoy.  Take care of your body by getting enough sleep, eating healthy, and participate in physical activity on a regular basis.

Instead, he spends his time reading and sharing dozens of news stories each week about tech companies more successful than his own. On any given day, you might see Abrams tweet articles about aging entrepreneurs, the latest billion dollar tech startup or Facebook's evolving ad efforts. He finds these articles through Nuzzel, a social news aggregator that he built and launched in beta in September 2012. \\"Starting Nuzzel was about my own personal problem of having cool stuff that my friends are doing on Facebook and Twitter, but not keeping on top of it all,\\" he told Mashable in an interview last month. That sentiment is common enough. There are, after all, no shortage of people building and using social news readers for precisely that reason. But those people are not Jonathan Abrams. Twelve years ago, he founded Friendster and helped kick off the era of social networks. Ten years ago, he watched as Facebook launched and gradually became the market leader. A little more than one year ago, he released Nuzzel to make the most of the new crop of social networks that have surpassed his own. His role at the new venture has effectively turned him into an unofficial media critic. \\"Right now, running Nuzzel, I read a lot of online news,\\" he says. \\"I see stuff everyday that isn't true.\\" This extends to stories written over the years about the reasons for Friendster's launch and eventual decline. \\"There was the idea that I started Friendster to meet girls, to get dates, which was never true,\\" he says. \\"There was the idea that Friendster's problem was fake profiles.\\" The real story, as he tells it, is more complicated and full of even more missed opportunities than you might assume for a tech company that missed one of the biggest opportunities in recent memory. Friendster's website in late 2004, a few months after Facebook launched. Abrams doesn't remember the exact moment he heard about Facebook, but it wasn't long after it launched in February 2004. Not quite two years old then, Friendster had already come up against many new competitors and clones. Michael Birch, best known for selling Bebo to AOL and later buying it back, launched Ringo.com three days after hearing about Friendster, later describing it as \\"a copycat site of Friendster.\\" Google launched Orkut, a failed early attempt at a social network, in January 2004 after attempting a Friendster acquisition. Even one of Friendster's investors, future Zynga founder Mark Pincus, launched a social networking competitor in 2003 called Tribe.net. If all that wasn't enough, there was MySpace, which was founded in late 2003. According to Abrams, the team at MySpace would spam Friendster's message boards, trying to poach users. \\"It was a really weird time. Friendster at the time was still a very small company,\\" he says. \\"We viewed ourselves as the David, not the Goliath. There were the Yahoos and the AOLs and we were this tiny, little startup. But the moment Friendster got the publicity, people started to copy it. Of course we were aware of all of them.\\" Even with all that competition, Abrams recognized early on that Facebook might pose a unique threat. On Friendster, users could set up profiles, connect with friends and family, search for new contacts (and, yes, potential dates) based on the people you were already connected to and interact with people on the social network through messages and groups. It was essentially a more pared down version of Facebook and the latter had the added benefit of quickly gaining popularity among college students. In response, Abrams claims now that he suggested Friendster should launch a \\"Friendster College\\" initiative to establish itself on 20 college campuses before Facebook could scale to that level. He says he had wanted to build the equivalent of a news feed even before Facebook launched, and that he had plans to build tools on top of the \\"Friendster social graph,\\" including one for sharing music playlists. In short, he wanted to take Friendster and evolve it to become what we now know as Facebook. \\"The problem,\\" he says, \\"was that Friendster was having a lot of technology problems.\\" Friendster had raised an additional 13 million in funding in 2003 and, according to Abrams, investors weren't focused on patching up the service properly, let alone responding to the threats posed by upstarts like Facebook. \\"The fact that we didn't launch those products was a problem, but even more fundamentally, people could barely log into the website for two years,\\" he says. \\"By the time Facebook and MySpace was doing those things, Friendster had lost a lot of market share in the U.S. for stability issues.\\" In April 2004, two months after Facebook launched, Friendster's board replaced Abrams as CEO and moved him in the mostly powerless chairman role. \\"I'm not very close to Mark Zuckerberg,\\" Abrams says, in a huge understatement. \\"But we've met.\\" That meeting, according to Abrams, occurred later in 2004 while he was chairman of Friendster and Scott Sassa was its president and CEO. Friendster wanted to buy Facebook. Abrams declined to provide a precise acquisition offer, but suggested it wasn't large enough to interest Zuckerberg and his team at the time. \\"I never thought he would sell to Friendster, but one of the CEOs was interested in trying to pursue it,\\" Abrams says, referring to Sassa. Some six years later, the two businesses entered into an acquisition agreement of a different sort: Facebook bought Friendster's entire portfolio of social networking patents for a reported 40 million. By this time, Facebook was on the cusp of hitting 500 million users worldwide, and Friendster had drifted into irrelevance — at least in the western hemisphere. Like minidisc players and QR codes, Friendster made its last stand in Asia. The social network was acquired in 2009 — not by \\"goliaths\\" like Yahoo or AOL, or Google, which had offered to buy it years earlier — by MOL Global, an online payments provider based in Malaysia. Friendster had 115 million members at the time of the acquisition, the vast majority of which (more than 75 million) lived in Asia. A little more than a year later, Friendster started again from scratch, deleting its users' data and pivoting to become a gaming service. Friendster.com still exists today, though it bares little resemblance to the Friendster of old. It's currently ranked as the 20,815th most popular site in the world, according to data from Alexa, with most of its visitors coming from India, Malaysia and the Philippines. Facebook is the second most popular site the world. The inside of Slide, a San Francisco nightclub that Abrams co-owns. It takes some effort to find references to Friendster today on Nuzzel's website, despite the fact that the startup has several former Friendster employees on staff. The word isn't listed on the main page of the beta site; it first appears below the fold on the About page as part of Abrams' bio, sandwiched between two other startups he's worked on. Abrams is still proud of Friendster, but he prefers not to talk about those days, noting in the first of several curt email exchanges that he doesn't have time for \\"old stuff about Friendster.\\" Shortly after leaving the social network he founded in 2005, Abrams launched Socializr, an online tool for sharing events, which later laid off its team in 2009 and was acquired the following year. He is the cofounder of Founders Den, which provides shared office space, and occasionally does some angel investing. He even co-owns a nightclub in San Francisco called Slide, though he says he doesn't go out to nightclubs much anymore for the same reason he doesn't use Snapchat. \\"Part of it is where I'm at with my personal life right now. I'm not single, I'm a parent. I'm not using Tinder and Snapchat; I'm just not there in my life,\\" he says. \\"When I started Friendster 11 years ago, I was not in my 20s, but in my 30s, and I was single and it was a different stage for me.\\" Abrams does have accounts on Facebook and Twitter, though he prefers the latter and rarely uses either for personal purposes. Mostly he prefers email. Friendster may be relegated to punchline-status these days, but Abrams argues the startup had a positive impact on his life overall. \\"Whenever you step out and do something, you are going to get both positive and negative feedback. That's just what happens when you create things,\\" he says. \\"Absolutely there are people who have criticized me for things involving Friendster — sometimes things that are not true. But overall, most of the legacy of Friendster is pretty positive. And there are a lot of connections and relationships that I have that may have been started because of Friendster.\\" For now, Abrams continues to work on developing Nuzzel and suggests the news reader may finally come out of beta in the near future. As it so happens, though, Facebook just launched a social news reader of its own. Ten years later, Abrams may end up competing with Facebook all over again. Have something to add to this story?

It happened at the new store located at One Bellevue Place around 9 a.m.      Metro Animal Care and Control said the raid came after they received information, photos and videos of \\"what appeared to be inadequate care for injured animals at the PetSmart location in Bellevue.\\"      Animal control officers confiscated six animals from the store - a guinea pig, mice and hamsters. All six animals were taken to a local vet to be checked out.      PETA alleges managers at the Bellevue store were \\"observed repeatedly refusing to provide sick, injured and dying animals with veterinary care in order to 'keep costs down' so they would receive bonuses.\\"      PETA also claims a Nashville supervisor was recorded instructing staff not to tell customers that PetSmart buys animals from Sun Pet Ltd., a warehouse in Atlanta that was put on probation by the Georgia Department of Agriculture after a PETA investigation in 2010.      A PetSmart employee, who has worked for the company for several years, told News 2 off-camera she completely refutes the allegations made by PETA.      She said she's never seen animals abused or mistreated when they're sick. She told News 2 if animals get sick, the staff cares for them.      District Attorney Glenn Funk's office is overseeing the investigation led by animal control. The store reopened Thursday afternoon.      PetSmart released the following statement to News 2.      We are always committed to putting the needs of the pets in our care first. We empower our store associates to do what’s right for all pets, which includes instruction to have any sick animal immediately seen by a veterinarian if needed. There is no adverse effect on a store team that takes every step possible to care for pets. We take these allegations very seriously, and are working closely with the Bellevue authorities to obtain the relevant facts. Additionally, we are investigating the validity of the video, given some of the footage is several years old.

Metro Animal Control took away six rodents from the One Bellevue Place PetSmart store, including hamsters, mice and a guinea pig.      “They sell these as companion animals, and we strongly believe that these animals big or small that if there is a complaint, that’s what we’re here for. We’re here to investigate that,” said Lauren Bluestone, the Metro Animal Care and Control Director.      A PetSmart employee sent PETA and Metro authorities photos and video of the animals, alleging they were sick and not cared for by the store.      “These small animals, whether they’re reptiles, fish, hamsters, guinea pigs, they suffer the same as do dogs and cats, which most Americans are more familiar with and share their homes with,” said Dan Paden, a PETA representative.      The popular pet store is under investigation by Metro police and the district attorney’s office for animal cruelty, and those agencies will decide whether any charges should be filed.      “I shop here all the time. I won’t be shopping here now if this is the case,” said Brenda Post, a cat owner. “They have to have some type of evidence or else they wouldn’t have a raid.”      Customers said they were surprised and shocked to hear about the allegations from the new store location.      “That’s crazy. You wouldn’t think that there’d be such a big deal, but people really care about the animals which is great. It really makes me sad that that happened,” said Erica Van Tassel, a pet owner.      PetSmart Senior Corporate Communications sent News 4 the following statement:      \\"We are always committed to putting the needs of the pets in our care first. We empower our store associates to do what’s right for all pets, which includes instruction to have any sick animal immediately seen by a veterinarian if needed. There is no adverse effect on a store team that takes every step possible to care for pets. We take these allegations very seriously, and are working closely with the Bellevue authorities to obtain the relevant facts. Additionally, we are investigating the validity of the video, given some of the footage is several years old.”      The animals are now in the hands of a local veterinarian.      MACC said it asked for PetSmart's policies on animal care.      \\"Moving forward, we will use what we find today and work with Metro Law and the D.A.'s office to determine any potential charges,\\" MACC said in a statement.      PETA's investigation also included stores in Florida and Arizona. Click here to read more.      Copyright 2018 WSMV (Meredith Corporation).

Some people said that the store didn't help sick or injured animals get better because they wanted to save money. A group that cares about animals, called PETA, sent the authorities some pictures and videos that showed the animals were not being treated well. The people who check on animals (animal control officers) took six animals from the store, like a guinea pig, mice, and hamsters. These animals were taken to a doctor that helps animals (a veterinarian) to make sure they are okay. The PetSmart store said that they really care about the animals and are working with the people who are looking into this problem. The investigation is still going on, and the store may be charged with animal cruelty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Crematoria, known for its relentless heat during daytime, pitch-black darkness at night, and torturous living conditions, is built underground to offer prisoners a small degree of shelter from the harsh environment above. The prison's fortress-like structure is controlled by Warden Luna Stark (played by Helen Mirren), who rules with an iron fist. On a mission to uncover the truth behind Jack's puzzling connection with a rebellious group seeking to overthrow the Intergalactic Federation, investigative journalist Elara Matthews (played by Lupita Nyong'o) infiltrates Crematoria by posing as a nurse. She discovers that Jack has been framed for his crimes by a high-ranking Federation official, Victor Grayson (played by Idris Elba), who seeks to maintain the status quo and keep the truth hidden from the masses. As Elara delves deeper into the conspiracy, she knows she must break Jack out of Crematoria in order to expose Grayson and the Federation's crimes. Forming an alliance with a group of inmates, Jack and Elara devise a daring and near-impossible escape plan that will require them to orchestrate a riot, navigate treacherous underground tunnels, and utilize their individual strengths and skills to overcome the heavily fortified defenses of the prison.

What is the first name of the person that tries out his father's fishing rod?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  It's Christmas Eve and Richie Rich, the world's richest kid, is all excited to spend the day with his friends. While racing wildly with his friends in the snow, Richie's butler, Herbert Cadbury, controls the cars using a remote and guides the children back to Richie's house. He then reminds him about his responsibilities that are due to be executed on Christmas Eve, and instructs him to change his clothes and get ready for tea. Before going to do so, he visits his home scientist, Professor Keanbean, who shows him his recent invention, a wishing machine which works only on Christmas Eve. The day being that, Richie wishes for a \\"big pie\\" from it, and is given a \\"pig sty\\" instead. Cadbury is disgusted seeing this, and sends him off to change his clothes. He meets his parents, Richard and Regina Rich, to ask what they would like to have for Christmas. While with them, he also tries out his father's new fishing rod invented by Keanbean, which hooks on to a tuna sandwich in the vicinity. He then goes on to change his clothes. During tea, Richie meets his spoiled cousin, Reggie Van Dough, who wishes that he was as rich as Richie. Later, he dresses up like an elf with Cadbury as Santa Claus to distribute Christmas presents to the orphanage.

When they take off in the sleigh with Richie driving it, Reggie takes control of it using the remote invented by Keanbean that Cadbury used earlier. He guides it through streets by shops, houses, and people, thus nearly destroying everything in the whole process.

Keep an eye out for these tweets to remain informed about their latest endeavors.   - Personal opinions: Some celebrities use Twitter to express their opinions on various subjects, ranging from popular culture and politics to environmental matters and philanthropy. Monitoring these tweets can help you better understand their values and beliefs.   - Fan interaction: Celebrities may interact with their fans by replying to tweets, participating in live chats, or retweeting followers' content. Observe how the celebrity interacts with their fans, as this can serve as a model for your own engagement with them.   - Trending topics: Celebrities often weigh in on trending topics, contributing their individual perspectives or responding to current events. Following celebrity discussions on these subjects can provide greater context or exposure to alternative viewpoints. 3. Engage with the Celebrity To maximize your experience on Twitter, consider engaging with the celebrity directly by liking, retweeting, or responding to their tweets. This can increase the likelihood of the celebrity noticing your account and potentially strengthening your connection with them.

This can include their management, personal relations, or other celebrities within their social circles. Keeping track of these individuals can provide additional insights and context about the celebrity's life, work, and values. Conclusion Twitter has introduced new opportunities for fans to connect with and follow their favorite celebrities in a manner that was once unattainable. By following a celebrity's account, monitoring their Twitter usage patterns, engaging with their content, sharing high-quality material, and staying informed about their professional circles, fans can gain a more comprehensive understanding of their idols while fostering stronger connections with them on the platform."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A taxi driver at the airport immediately gets word to Frank Ginetta (Kirk Douglas), who hides, armed with a gun, until he realizes that the visitor he's been warned about is actually his kid brother, Vinnie (Alex Cord). Frank happily welcomes his brother and takes him home, catching up on old times. But his wife, Ida (Irene Papas), reminds him that \\"they're going to send someone,\\" suggesting that perhaps Vinnie is the one. In a flashback, Frank recalls better times in New York, beginning with Vinnie's homecoming from military service and subsequent marriage to Emma Bertolo (Susan Strasberg). The father of the bride, Dominick Bertolo (Luther Adler) is a Mafia don, as is the groom's brother, Frank. And among those paying their respects as guests at the wedding are mob leaders like Egan (Murray Hamilton), Rotherman (Val Avery) and Levin (Alan Hewitt), who are the equals of Frank and Dominick in the New York region's organized crime. These capos within the Organization meet as a board to coordinate their business. The majority becomes increasingly unhappy with Frank's position, as he seems opposed to every new idea. Frank also dispenses justice on his own in the old Sicilian fashion, without seeking approval from the others. They, not being of Sicilian origin, are trying to leave behind the old traditional methods, such as when two of Frank's hit men kill a stool pigeon in the marshes and leave him tied to a chair with a canary stuffed in his mouth â as a warning to others who might talk too much. Frank still fondly remembers his father, who also was a mafioso who was assassinated in a hit. Vinnie is more of a businessman, and takes sides with the other board members in ventures they intend to pursue without his brother. Frank resents this, striking Vinnie for defying him and insisting to the board that Vinnie will have no part in what they have planned. Older members of the organization who are no longer involved in decision-making tell Frank that it was Dom... Answer:","output":"The Brotherhood is a movie centered around a Mafia family and the relationship between two brothers, Frank and Vinnie Ginetta. The plot follows Frank, an old-school Mafioso who prefers traditional methods, as he navigates the changing world of organized crime along with his younger brother, Vinnie, who is more business-minded. When Vinnie arrives in Palermo, there is an initial suspicion that he might be sent by the mob to target Frank, but it turns out he is there as family. As the story unfolds, it becomes apparent that there is a growing divide between Frank and the other Mafia leaders in the New York region, as they clash over differing ideas and methods. Frank is resistant to change and wants to maintain the old ways of doing things, whereas the majority of the board wants to leave those methods behind and modernize their operations. Vinnie finds himself siding with the board and getting caught in the middle of Frank's power struggle, leading to resentment and tension between the brothers. The older members of the organization who are no longer involved in decision-making warn Frank about potential threats to his leadership. The movie deals with themes of loyalty, betrayal, family dynamics, and the tension between tradition and modernization in the world of organized crime."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that’s it’s not too late to take great care of you. The narrator was thankful:  A. during the time she treated her body badly  B. not enough information  C. after she treated her body badly  D. before she treated her body badly A:","output":"C. after she treated her body badly"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Originally thought to be a traitor who informed the Germans about Miller and Mallory during the Navarone mission, Nicolai is now known to be Colonel von Ingorslebon, a dedicated German spy believed to have infiltrated the Yugoslav Partisans as \\"Captain Lescovar\\" (Franco Nero). To get to Yugoslavia, the two men pair with \\"Force 10\\", an American sabotage unit, led by Colonel Mike Barnsby (Harrison Ford), which has its own mission there. To maximise security, Force 10 steals a Lancaster bomber from a British air base in Termoli, Italy, rather than requisitioning one; but they are spotted by Military Police MPs before they can take off. Weaver (Carl Weathers), a US Army sergeant under arrest by the MPs, joins with Force 10 and forces his way onto the plane.

Force 10's rescuers are soon revealed to be collaborationist Chetniks (nationalist Serb guerrillas) under German control. The Germans take the team into custody but do not know their mission, so Mallory and Barnsby tell the commander, Major Schroeder (Michael Byrne), that they are criminals fleeing Allied authorities. To keep Schroeder from opening Miller's suitcase, which contains his special explosives, Mallory tells him that it contains a new wonder drug called \\"penicillin\\" which will spoil if exposed to air.

In urban locations, a commercial building often combines functions, such as an office on levels 2-10, with retail on floor 1. When space allocated to multiple functions is significant, these buildings can be called multi-use. Local authorities commonly maintain strict regulations on commercial zoning, and have the authority to designate any zoned area as such. A business must be located in a commercial area or area zoned at least partially for commerce.  - Hong Kong Island is an island in the southern part of Hong Kong.

Translate to English","output":"This sentence in English translates to: \\"It is therefore essential to strictly prohibit its use in all animals destined for human consumption, and to monitor all meat imports from third countries.\\" When we break it down, we can further elaborate on the nuances and implications of this statement.  The given phrase emphasizes a sense of necessity or urgency in implementing regulations related to the usage of something, possibly a substance or a procedure, in the farming of animals raised for meat. It may be talking about a harmful drug or a controversial farming method that poses health risks to consumers, ethical issues, or environmental concerns.  The phrase highlights two key actions: prohibition and monitoring. The call for a firm prohibition suggests there is concern that using the unidentified substance or method could be harmful or risky if it continues - from either a human health perspective, an animal welfare perspective, or both. The strict ban underscores the importance of preventing the substance or method from being used in the first place. The reference to \\"third countries\\" suggests concerns about international standards and regulations. There is an explicit mention of monitoring all meat imports from these countries. This underscores the need for vigilance in food safety practices and points to a lack of confidence in the standards or oversight in these countries.  It implies that the country where this is being enforced should not only concentrate on its internal agricultural practices but also pay attention to the global market. The focus on 'monitoring' underscores the need for an active approach to maintain food safety standards - this could involve regular inspections, stricter import regulations, or more thorough testing of imported meat products.  In essence, reinventing food safety measures and ensuring rigorous implementation should be a priority to protect consumer health, maintain ethical livestock farming practices, and ensure highest food quality in the face of globalization."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - magazines - phone book - carpeting - town - city  The rationale to choose \\"carpeting\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"Carpeting is the most appropriate choice when considering the items listed that would typically not be for sale in a bookstore. The rationale for choosing \\"carpeting\\" as the answer can be explained by examining each of the options provided: 1. Magazines: Magazines are often found in bookstores for sale. They cover a wide range of topics, such as current events, popular culture, science, history, and many more. Most bookstores stock their shelves with an extensive variety of magazines for browsing and purchasing. Therefore, magazines would not be an accurate answer because they are generally available for sale. 2. Phone book: While phone books may be found in some bookstores, they are generally not a focus for sales. Many bookstores may maintain a copy of a local phone book for reference purposes or provide them for free to customers; however, this answer does not completely rule out the sale of phone books, since specialized directories and address books are sometimes sold within a bookstore. Thus, the phone book option is less compelling than the carpeting option. 3. Carpeting: Most brick-and-mortar bookstores are furnished with carpeting to create a welcoming, comfortable, and quiet atmosphere. Carpeting absorbs sound, adds visual appeal, and can help keep the premises clean. However, carpeting in a bookstore serves a functional purpose and is not typically available for sale. It is a part of the store's infrastructure and decor rather than a product offering. This makes carpeting the most suitable answer to the given question. 4. Town and City: Both of these options are irrelevant to the context of a bookstore. A town and city are geographical locations or communities that encompass multiple businesses, residences, and other establishments. While bookstores may carry literature and guides about specific towns or cities, these locations themselves are not objects that can be purchased from a bookstore. In conclusion, carpeting is the most accurate answer to the question of what could be found in a bookstore that is not for sale. While the other options may be found within or related to a bookstore, they either represent typical sales items (magazines), do not categorically exclude being sold (phone book), or are entirely unrelated to the context of a bookstore (town and city). Carpeting, as a functional and non-sale element of a bookstore's environment, provides the most compelling rationale to be selected as the correct answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the title of the person that the gun was illegally taken from after it was paid for? , can you please find it?   A series of interweaving stories tell the journey of a handgun — specifically, a .38 special revolver — as it passes from one owner to another. In all the time it passes between its various owners, it is never actually fired (aside from the one test-firing it underwent at the factory) and is never shown actually to discharge any ammunition.The opening credits run over scenes of the manufacture of the weapon. It is shipped to a gun store, where it is purchased by an older business owner whose home was recently burglarized. His wife is uncomfortable with the weapon in the house and convinces him to get rid of it. He gives it away to a security guard at his company, who pawns the gun. A young professional asks for a gun at the pawn shop. He is displeased when told there is a five-day waiting period required by law. When the pawnbroker turns to get the blank paperwork, he loads the gun with his own bullets and departs at gunpoint after paying for the pistol. At his place of employment, he is given the news that because he has the least seniority, he is being laid off. He considers shooting his supervisor before walking outside to the building's plaza during lunchtime, making mock shooting motions at random bystanders with the gun. They are alarmed and call the police. When the police arrive, he throws the gun through the open window of a parked car before he is arrested.

Movie title: Condemned to Live Movie plot: The film opens with a trio of explorers in Africa who are hiding in a cave. One of the explorers, a pregnant woman, is bitten by a vampire bat. The film then cuts forward in time to a small European village where a series of mysterious murders are taking place. The villagers readily assemble in mob form, with torches, at the house of Professor Kristan (Ralph Morgan) after every murder. The villagers suspect that a giant bat is to blame for the murders. Kristan gives the villagers advice on staying safe, and assures them a scientific explanation exists. However, in subsequent scenes, Kristan himself is revealed to be the murderer. He is seized by attacks (triggered by darkness) which transform him into a trance-like state of murderousness. After he commits a murder, he awakens from the trance with no memory of the deed, believing himself merely to have fainted. Kristan's obliviousness is further enabled by the intervention of his loyal hunchback Zan, the only person aware of Kristan's condition. Zan follows Kristan when he is in his trances, ensuring the professor is not discovered. An old friend of Kristan's named Dr. Bizet arrives to visit, and soon suspects what is happening. Bizet discloses to Kristan that his mother was bitten by a vampire bat, and that traits of vampirism have likely been passed down to him per Lamarckism. (The audience now understands the pregnant explorer in the opening flashback to have been Kristan's mother.) After Kristan's fiance (Maxine Doyle) is attacked by an entranced Kristan, the mob of villagers assumes Zan is culpable and chases him to the edge of a cliff inside a cave. Kristan arrives and confesses to the murders, despite Zan's protestations (aimed at saving the professor) that he, the hunchback, is in fact the murderer. As the mob watches, Kristan throws himself over the edge of the cliff and Zan follows.","output":"Professor Kristan (Ralph Morgan) confessed to the murders."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By 390 BC, several Gallic tribes were invading Italy from the north as their culture expanded throughout Europe. The Romans were alerted to this when a particularly warlike tribe invaded two Etruscan towns close to Rome's sphere of influence. These towns, overwhelmed by the enemy's numbers and ferocity, called on Rome for help. The Romans met the Gauls in pitched battle at the Battle of Allia River around 390–387 BC. The Gauls, led by chieftain Brennus, defeated the Roman army of approximately 15,000 troops, pursued the fleeing Romans back to Rome, and sacked the city before being either driven off or bought off.

Input: Passage: Since about 560, the Avars had ruled over large parts of the Pannonian Basin and Carantania southeast of Francia, though in the last decades, the Avar Khaganate had to deal with Bulgarian and Croat incursions. To secure the frontier of his empire and the traffic on the trade routes to the east, Charlemagne allied with Khan Krum of Bulgaria and the Croatian duke Vojnomir, and from 791 launched several campaigns against the Avars, where he, according to the Vita Karoli Magni, encountered only modest opposition. In 796 Carolingian forces under Charlemagne's son Pepin of Italy destroyed the main Avar fortress called the Ring of the Avars and made the Khagan a Frankish vassal, while the remaining Avars retreated behind the Tisza River. The victory is perpetuated by the poem De Pippini regis Victoria Avarica.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? make dandelion root tea","output":"Absolutely, I would love to help you understand how to make dandelion root tea! Here's an easy explanation: 1. **Find some dandelions**: Dandelions are often seen as weeds, but did you know we can make tea from their roots? These are those yellow flowers you see in gardens or parks. Make sure they haven't been sprayed with any chemicals. 2. **Dig up the roots**: Ask an adult for help. With a small shovel, you can dig up the dandelion. The root is the part that's under the ground. It's long and looks a little bit like a thin carrot. 3. **Wash and chop**: The roots will be dirty, so you need to wash them really well. After they are clean, with the help of an adult, chop the roots into small pieces, kind of like cutting up vegetables for dinner. 4. **Dry the roots**: This can take some time. Spread out the chopped roots on a baking sheet and put them in a dry, warm place for about 2 weeks. They should feel hard and dry when they're ready, kind of like tiny pieces of wood. 5. **Roast the roots**: This step should definitely be done by an adult. They will put the pieces on a baking tray in the oven for about 2 hours. This will turn the roots into a dark brown color and give them a sweet scent. 6. **Make the tea**: Finally, the fun part! The adult can then put the roasted dandelion root pieces in a pot of boiling water. Let it simmer for about 10 minutes. The water will become a light brown color. 7. **Strain and enjoy**: Before you drink the tea, you need to use a strainer to catch the little pieces of root. This leaves you with only the liquid, the dandelion root tea, which you can drink! You can even add a bit of honey or a squeeze of lemon to taste, if you want. Remember, it's like telling a slow, careful story with each step. And no matter what, safety first. Always have an adult around to help."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cold War tensions are heightened, and when the Sutherlands attempt to leave, Marya is detained. Philip flies home alone and is unable to get permission to return. He travels to London, where he and Joe Brooks (Bernard Miles), an experienced boatman, hatch a scheme to sail to a Baltic coast town Tallinn where the Bolshoi is scheduled to perform, in order to clandestinely leave with Marya.

Background: Alice in Chains is an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1987 by guitarist/vocalist Jerry Cantrell and drummer Sean Kinney, who then recruited bassist Mike Starr and lead vocalist Layne Staley. Mike Starr was replaced in 1993 by Mike Inez. The band took its name from Staley's previous group, the glam metal band Alice N' Chains. Although widely associated with grunge music, the band's sound incorporates heavy metal elements. Context: In March 1992, the band returned to the studio. With new songs written primarily on the road, the material has an overall darker feel than Facelift, with six of the album's thirteen songs dealing with the subject of addiction. \\"We did a lot of soul searching on this album. There's a lot of intense feelings.\\" Cantrell said, \\"We deal with our daily demons through music. All of the poison that builds up during the day we cleanse when we play\\".  On September 29, 1992, Alice in Chains released its second album, Dirt. The album peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 and since its release has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA, making Dirt the band's highest selling album to date. The album was a critical success, with Steve Huey of Allmusic praising the album as a \\"major artistic statement, and the closest they ever came to recording a flat-out masterpiece\\". Chris Gill of Guitar World called Dirt \\"huge and foreboding, yet eerie and intimate\\", and \\"sublimely dark and brutally honest\\". Dirt spawned five top 30 singles, \\"Would?\\", \\"Rooster\\", \\"Them Bones\\", \\"Angry Chair\\", and \\"Down in a Hole\\", and remained on the charts for nearly two years. Alice in Chains was added as openers to Ozzy Osbourne's No More Tours tour. Days before the tour began, Layne Staley broke his foot in an ATV accident, forcing him to use crutches on stage.  Starr left the band shortly after the Hollywood Rock concert in Rio de Janeiro in January 1993, stating that he wanted to spend more time with his family. Staley told Rolling Stone in 1994 about Starr leaving the band, \\"It was just a difference in priorities. We wanted to continue intense touring and press. Mike was ready to go home.\\" Years later, Starr claimed that he was fired due to his drug addiction. Starr was replaced by former Ozzy Osbourne bassist Mike Inez.  In 1993, the band recorded two songs with Inez, \\"What the Hell Have I\\" and \\"A Little Bitter\\", for the Last Action Hero soundtrack. During the summer of 1993, Alice in Chains toured with the alternative music festival Lollapalooza, their last major tour with Staley. Question: Did it reach bill board charts>? Answer:","output":"Yes, Alice in Chains' second album, Dirt, released on September 29, 1992, was successful in reaching the Billboard charts. The album peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 chart, a notable accomplishment for the band. Since its release, Dirt has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA, making it the band's highest-selling album to date. Additionally, the album produced five top 30 singles, specifically \\"Would?\\", \\"Rooster\\", \\"Them Bones\\", \\"Angry Chair\\", and \\"Down in a Hole,\\" further solidifying its impact on the charts and the band's success. The album's chart longevity is also worth mentioning, as it remained on the charts for nearly two years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Plot title: Courageous Movie plot: When his truck is stolen at a Gas Station, Nathan Hayes chases it and manages to apprehend the driver and reclaim the truck. Though he is injured, he crawls back to the car, and sees that his little baby boy in the back is okay. When the police arrive, Adam Mitchell and Shane Fuller meet Hayes, discovering he is a new deputy, having recently moved. The personal lives of these officers are observed: Mitchell adores his nine-year-old daughter, Emily, but is distant from his fifteen-year-old son, Dylan, because Mitchell doesn't share Dylan's interest in 5k runs. Hayes never knew his biological father, instead treating a neighbor as his father (even giving him Father's Day cards annually), but would risk his life to save his three children; however, his teenage daughter Jade (Taylor Hutcherson), resents him because he has a strict policy about dating. Fuller is divorced, as were his parents, and has joint custody of his son. Thomson is young and single. Javier Martinez (Robert Amaya), an immigrant struggling to provide for his family, is walking down an alley asking God what He wants him to do after being laid off when a construction company went over budget and Mitchell calls him over to help with his shed, thinking he is a different Javier that Mitchell's friends said would help him.

Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.  Two groups of patients were under observation for heart disease. The Red group was composed of people with low cholesterol, while the Yellow group was comprised of people with very high cholesterol.  Which group had more people with high blood pressure? The answer to this question is:","output":"Based on the information provided, one could infer that the Yellow group, comprised of people with very high cholesterol, had more people with high blood pressure. This inference is drawn from the fact that high cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades and is a major contributing factor to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a condition where cholesterol, along with other materials, are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall, leading to the formation of plaques. These plaques can consequently restrict or block the flow of blood through the blood vessels. As a result, a decrease in blood flow could lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. In situations where there is a complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart, it can result in a heart attack, causing significant damage from oxygen deprivation, and in some cases, even death. Since the Yellow group consists of people with very high cholesterol, it is reasonable to assume that this group would have a higher rate of atherosclerosis development and thus, higher incidences of high blood pressure compared to the Red group, which is composed of people with low cholesterol. However, it is essential to take into consideration other factors such as age, lifestyle choices, family history, and medical conditions when examining the relationship between cholesterol and high blood pressure. In summary, the Yellow group, with very high cholesterol levels, is more likely to have a higher number of people with high blood pressure due to the increased risk of atherosclerosis development. However, it is important to remember that there are other factors at play in determining an individual's risk of high blood pressure and heart disease."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Select from: (a). negative (b). positive","output":"To predict the sentiment of this tweet, let's analyze it step-by-step. Step 1: Identify sentiment-indicating words or phrases - love: This expression indicates a positive feeling. - hate: This expression indicates a negative feeling. - annoying: This adjective has a negative connotation. Step 2: Determine the context of the sentiment-indicating words or phrases - \\"i love you\\": Directed towards @terruh, shows affection, suggesting a positive sentiment. - \\"I hate annoying high schoolers\\": Shows dislike or frustration towards a group of people, suggesting a negative sentiment. Step 3: Weigh the sentiment-indicating words or phrases As there are both positive (love) and negative (hate, annoying) sentiments expressed, we will weigh them based on intensity and relevance. - Love (positive) has a more direct and intimate connotation as it is directed towards a specific person (@terruh). - Hate (negative), combined with annoying (negative), targets a general group of people (high schoolers). Based on the analysis, we can conclude: The tweet has a mix of sentiments - a positive sentiment towards @terruh, and a negative sentiment towards high schoolers. However, the expression of love towards a specific individual (@terruh) holds more weight than the general negative sentiment.

The individual speaks from a position of limited knowledge and understanding regarding the subject's personal life. In light of this evidence, the hypothesis \\"They knew him intimately\\" cannot be considered true, as the speaker explicitly states that they were not intimately familiar with the person.

In conclusion, based on the given premise, it can be deduced that the hypothesis \\"They knew him intimately\\" is not true.

Well, for the previous, it is better than daytime television....though I'm not sure how much.

Options：  A. downtown area  B. city hall  C. toun  D. united states  E. downtown district A:","output":"A. Downtown Area In a metropolitan area, you would most likely find a dance club in the downtown area. The downtown area is typically characterized by a high concentration of business, retail, dining, and entertainment establishments, making it an ideal location for a dance club. Dance clubs tend to attract a diverse crowd and rely on the density of people looking to socialize, have fun, and enjoy nightlife options. Several factors contribute to the downtown area being the most suitable location for a dance club: 1. Accessibility: Downtown areas have good transportation options, such as public transit, buses, trains, and taxi services. People attending dance clubs often prefer to avoid driving to enjoy events without worrying about parking and drink-and-drive-related issues. 2. Visibility: Dance clubs thrive on the vibrant nightlife and foot traffic typically found in downtown areas. High visibility ensures that potential patrons are aware of the club and contributing to its popularity. 3. Synergy with other establishments: A downtown area usually has a variety of bars, restaurants, and entertainment options. People often visit multiple venues during a night out, so having a dance club in close proximity to other nightlife establishments increases the chances that patrons will visit the club. 4. Population density: Downtown areas generally have a high concentration of people living, working, and visiting throughout the day. This density is especially important for attracting a diverse and vibrant clientele who might be interested in attending dance club events. 5. Late-night operations: Dance clubs often operate late into the night, which can be disruptive to residential areas. The downtown area, on the other hand, is usually a hub of activity, and the presence of other businesses and nightlife options limits the impact that a dance club's noise and crowd might have on its surroundings. In conclusion, it is the availability of good infrastructure, a vibrant crowd, and synergy with other establishments that make the downtown area the most suitable location for a dance club in a metropolitan area."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This river is next to Hilda's farm that she has lived on for decades. Ever since she was a child, she was taught that it's important to dump excess fertilizer into the river. So, that's what she does whenever she has leftover fertilizer she isn't going to use. The Dundrin Ocean is connected to many rivers. However, these rivers are located primarily in uninhabited and natural areas of the world. There is one farm near the Dundrin, though, which is owned by Luke. Luke never disposes of any of his garbage in the ocean or rivers near his farm, and he chooses instead to store excess fertilizer for the future or properly dispose of his trash.  Who is causing less marine pollution?  Hint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. A:","output":"Based on the description given, Luke is causing less marine pollution.  Here is the step-by-step reasoning: 1. Hilda and Luke are both farmers who are situated near bodies of water that eventually connect to oceans - Hilda near a river linked to the Malegese Ocean, and Luke near various rivers that flow into the Dundrin Ocean. 2. As both are engaged in farming activities, it can be assumed they utilize fertilizers in their work, substances known to contribute to marine pollution when they enter bodies of water. 3. Hilda, following her childhood teachings, dumps excess fertilizer into the river. These substances are then carried by the river into the Malegese Ocean, contributing to its pollution by releasing potentially hazardous chemicals. This can lead to marine issues such as hypoxia and dead zones. 4. On the other hand, the Dundrin Ocean is connected to rivers located in uninhabited and natural areas - implying less human activity and therefore, less possibility of pollution from human activities. Luke, the one human actor we know is near these rivers, specifically avoids disposing of his garbage and excess fertilizer in a way which would contaminate the rivers. He either stores his excess fertilizer for future use or disposes of it properly, showing a conscious effort to prevent contributing to marine pollution.  5. Therefore, considering their respective practices, we can conclude that Luke is causing less marine pollution compared to Hilda."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","output":"Based on the given review, I would say \\"Not at all\\" in recommending this app to a friend. The reasoning behind this answer can be broken down into several key points: 1. Compatibility Issues: The review explicitly mentions that the app is crashing on Android Nougat (Android 7), which indicates potential compatibility issues. As a user, you would want an app that runs smoothly on different versions of the operating system to ensure a seamless experience across devices. 2. Reliability and Stability: The app appears to be crashing regularly, suggesting a lack of stability and reliability in its performance. This is a critical factor when considering an app, as users expect a smooth and uninterrupted experience. Crashing can lead to frustration and ultimately discourages users from continuing to use the app. 3. User Interface and Experience: The review states that \\"tapping set wallpaper just takes you back to the activate screen and on and on.\\" This suggests a subpar user interface and experience, as users may become confused and frustrated by the app's lack of expected functionality. A well-designed app should have a clear, user-friendly interface that enables users to efficiently navigate and utilize the app's features. 4. Negative Word of Mouth: Given the negative experience detailed in the review, it is likely that the user would not recommend this app to their friends or colleagues. In the age of social media and online reviews, negative word of mouth can have a significant impact on an app's reputation and ultimately its user base. As a friend, you would want to recommend apps that have a positive impact on others and provide a quality user experience. In conclusion, taking into consideration the compatibility issues, lack of reliability and stability, poor user interface and experience, and potential negative word of mouth, I would not recommend this app to a friend at all. It is essential to prioritize user satisfaction and ensure an app is capable of meeting the needs and expectations of its target audience before recommending it to others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Some boys like wearing the same kinds of clothes as girls, and some of them have long hair. So sometimes it's hard to tell whether  they are boys or girls. Today is Sunday. I have a walk with my grandmother in the park. My grandmother is 80 years old and she can't see well. After some time, my grandmother is tired , so she sits down on a chair. There is another person sitting on the chair, too. \\"Hello,\\" my grandmother says to the person with long hair next to her. \\"Can you see the girl with long hair under the big tree?\\"\\"The girl?\\" says the person, \\"No, he's my brother Mike.\\" \\"Oh, sorry. I don't know you are his sister.\\" Says my grandmother. \\"No, I'm not his sister, I'm his brother!\\" Why does the writer's grandmother think the person next to her is a girl? A) Because he has long hair. B) Because he walks like a girl. C) Because he speaks like a girl. D) Because he wears girls' clothes Answer:","output":"A) Because he has long hair. In the given scenario, the writer's grandmother is an elderly woman who cannot see well. As she sits down and starts a conversation with the person next to her, she quickly assumes that the person is a girl based on their long hair. Apart from the long hair, there isn't any mention of the person's way of walking, speaking, or choice of clothing being similar to that of a girl's. In many cultures and societies, long hair is often stereotypically associated with women, while short hair is typically linked to men. However, this isn't universally valid, and individuals across the gender spectrum might have varying hair lengths to suit their preferences and personal styles. In this case, the writer's grandmother mistakenly assumes that the person with long hair is a girl, primarily based on this stereotype. The person with long hair corrects the grandmother by informing her that the person under the tree is not a girl, but rather their brother, Mike. Further, when the grandmother assumes the person she is talking to is the sister, they clarify that they are, in fact, also a brother. This highlights how relying solely on superficial aspects such as hair length can lead to misinterpretations and incorrect assumptions about someone's gender."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Question: Where did the farmer send the heifer to make money when she was no longer useful to the farm? Options: - sanctuary farm - cow pasture - countryside - cattle ranch - slaughterhouse  Explain why a human would choose \\"slaughterhouse\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","output":"Slaughterhouse A human would choose \\"slaughterhouse\\" as the answer to the question because it is the most logical option among the given choices, considering the context provided. When the heifer is no longer useful to the farm, it implies that she can no longer provide services or financial benefits in terms of milk production, breeding, or labor. Thus, the farmer would seek alternative means to make money from the heifer. Here's a brief analysis of the options to better understand why \\"slaughterhouse\\" is the most appropriate choice: 1. Sanctuary farm: Sanctuary farms primarily serve as safe havens for animals, where they are not exploited for profit. They rescue and provide a home for injured or abused animals. In this case, the farmer is looking to make money from the heifer, which wouldn't happen at a sanctuary farm. 2. Cow pasture: A cow pasture is just a grazing area for cows to feed on grass or hay. While the heifer could still graze in a pasture, this would not generate any income for the farmer when she's deemed \\"no longer useful\\" to the farm operation-wise. 3. Countryside: The countryside refers to the rural areas outside urban settings. Simply sending the heifer to the countryside would not guarantee any financial gain for the farmer, as it would probably live freely, without any sale or productive purpose. 4. Cattle ranch: A cattle ranch primarily focuses on breeding and raising cattle for various agricultural purposes. In the given context, the farmer has already deemed the heifer no longer useful; hence, it would not contribute significantly to the cattle ranch operations or the farmer's financial objectives. 5. Slaughterhouse: A slaughterhouse is a facility where animals are processed and turned into meat products. When the heifer is no longer useful to the farm in other aspects, the farmer could sell the heifer to a slaughterhouse to make money from the sale of meat and other byproducts, such as leather and bones. This option directly fulfills the farmer's intention of generating income from the heifer in an alternative way. Therefore, given these explanations, a human would choose \\"slaughterhouse\\" as the most appropriate answer to the question because it aligns with the objective of making money from the heifer when she no longer serves her original purpose on the farm."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: Amid the warm waters of the Blue Lagoon spa in a lava field in south-west Iceland, Lee Cattermole relaxes and reflects with his girlfriend. Three years ago, it was he who was erupting, the then Sunderland captain arrested and later accepting a police caution for damaging five vehicles in Newcastle during a night out with team-mates. Earlier that day, Martin O’Neill had been confirmed as his new manager; it was hardly Cattermole’s wisest move and merely served to vandalise his own character. Sunderland midfielder Lee Cattermole insists he has calmed down from the unpredictable player he once was. Gus Poyet readily admits Cattermole is among the first names on his Sunderland team sheet. Current Sunderland boss Gus Poyet was certainly sceptical upon his arrival one year ago. ‘If somebody tells me this guy is a b*****d and I need to be careful, then I will be. I was told he was impossible to control, that he will get sent off a hundred times and he will let you down,’ says Poyet. ‘I was told he could not play football like I want to. I was told he was training on his own away from everybody else. I thought I’d meet Lee and he’d have a gun and he’d shoot me in the head.’ Twelve months on and Poyet readily admits that Cattermole is the first name on his team sheet. The 26-year-old has just been voted North East Football Writers’ Player of 2014 and the manager is backing his on-field lieutenant for an England call-up — ‘In Uruguay, he would be the hero, the captain,’ he says. The respect is mutual. Cattermole says he has come a long way in 12 months under Poyet. ‘In the last year I have learned a hell of a lot,’ says the anchorman. Poyet took over as manager of Sunderland in October 2013 and continues to work with Cattermole. ‘Gus coming in has been a massive factor in winning the award, which I’m chuffed about. Gus is very much my kind of person, very English minded. ‘It is totally different playing under Gus than any other manager. I think he played street football a lot more. He almost taught himself, which is why he was a very natural player. ‘And he has told me in no uncertain terms that, in the position I play, if I don’t do what he wants then I won’t play. On and off the pitch this is as good as I have ever felt. The manager has stuck with me.’ As Cattermole suggests, off the pitch was a big issue — there was a three-year ban from pubs in his hometown of Stockton in 2008. ‘I have calmed down off the pitch as well as on it,’ he says. ‘I had a couple of incidents during my career which people have read too much into. ‘I have just matured and I even have a girlfriend now. When anyone is 26 they look back to when they were 18 and there is a world of difference — and I am no different.’ Indeed, pubs have made way for geothermal spas and romantic getaways in Nordic lava land. Cattermole — and Poyet — will be hoping his days of boiling over are a thing of the past. Cattermole says he has 'matured' at Sunderland and puts it in no small way down to Poyet's management.","output":"The article highlights Sunderland midfielder Lee Cattermole's transformation under manager Gus Poyet, showcasing how he has evolved from an unpredictable, troubled player to one of the first names on the team sheet. It recounts an incident from three years ago, where Cattermole was arrested for damaging vehicles during a night out after the confirmation of Martin O'Neill as his manager. However, his turnaround is evident from the fact that he was voted North East Football Writers' Player of 2014, and Poyet even backs him for an England call-up. Cattermole credits his growth to Poyet, saying that he has learned a lot under his management, both on and off the field. He describes Poyet's influence as a \\"massive factor\\" in winning the award, calling him very \\"English-minded,\\" and notes that playing under Poyet is a completely different experience compared to other managers. Cattermole mentions how Poyet has instilled discipline in him as well, stating that if he does not do what Poyet wants in his playing position, he will not play. As for his personal life, Cattermole acknowledges his past off-field problems, such as a three-year ban from pubs in his hometown in 2008, but shares that he has calmed down and matured since then. According to him, people have read too much into his past incidents, but as a 26-year-old now, he sees a world of difference in his behavior compared to when he was 18, even having a girlfriend currently. The article concludes with a reflection on how Cattermole's troubled days seem to be in the past, with romantic getaways to places like the Blue Lagoon spa in Iceland replacing nights out at pubs, alluding to the positive difference Gus Poyet's management has made in his life and career."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

As he and his men ride away from their latest visit, Calvera promises to return to loot the village again. Taking what meager goods they have, the village leaders ride to a town just inside the United States hoping to barter for weapons to defend themselves. While there, they encounter Chris Adams (Yul Brynner), a veteran Cajun gunslinger. After listening to their tale, Chris suggests that the village hire gunfighters, which would be cheaper than guns and ammunition. The village men relentlessly try to convince him to be their gunman. At first he agrees only to help them find men, but later he decides to recruit six other men to help him defend the village, despite the poor pay offered. The other men include hotheaded, inexperienced Chico (Horst Buchholz); Chris's friend Harry Luck (Brad Dexter), who believes Chris is seeking treasure; the drifter Vin Tanner (Steve McQueen), who has gone broke after a round of gambling and is loath to accept a position as a store clerk; Bernardo O'Reilly (Charles Bronson), a gunfighter of Irish-Mexican heritage who has fallen on hard times; a cowboy, Britt (James Coburn), interested only in further perfecting his already high skills in both knife and gun, who joins purely for the challenge involved to test those skills; and an on-the-run gunman Lee (Robert Vaughn) struggling with a crisis of confidence.

Having read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are it would become less dense or it would become more dense ):   What would happen to the atmosphere as Jim climbed lower down a mountain it would become less dense or it would become more dense? A:","output":"As Jim climbed lower down a mountain, the atmosphere would become more dense.  To explain this in detail, let's first understand the composition and structure of Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere is a mixture of various gases that surround the Earth, held in place by gravity. It consists primarily of nitrogen (about 78%), oxygen (about 21%), and other trace gases such as argon, carbon dioxide, and water vapor.  The atmosphere is divided into layers based on temperature and pressure variations. These layers are the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere. The troposphere is the lowest layer, extending to an altitude of approximately 7 to 20 kilometers (4 to 12 miles) above sea level, depending on the location and time of year. This is the layer where weather and human activities primarily occur.  Air pressure and density are related to altitude. At higher altitudes, the air pressure and density decrease due to the lesser volume of air above that point. This is because the Earth's gravitational force is weaker at greater distances from the surface, which causes the atmosphere to expand and become less dense. As you go further up in the atmosphere – that is, as you increase in altitude – the density of the atmosphere decreases, leading to thinner air that contains fewer air molecules. Now, consider Jim's situation, in which he is climbing down a mountain. As he descends, he is moving towards a lower altitude, closer to the Earth's surface. Consequently, the air pressure increases, as there is a larger volume of air above him. This leads to a denser atmosphere, with more air molecules per unit volume.  In conclusion, as Jim climbs lower down a mountain, the atmosphere would become more dense due to the increase in air pressure and the greater volume of air above him. This has significant implications for various factors such as temperature, weather conditions, and human physical capacities at different altitudes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Deeb Salem reportedly filed papers in Manhattan Supreme Court seeking 8.25 million more from Goldman Sachs. The bank's headquarters pictured right. A former Goldman Sachs trader angry that he got a bonus of only 8.25 million has gone to court to get the millions of dollars that he says his bosses still owe him. Deeb Amin Salem, 35, claims he helped Goldman Sachs make billions of dollars in profits by betting against the mortgage market and he expected a bonus of roughly 13 million for 2010, Bloomberg News reported. Salem says that Goldman Sachs executives shortchanged him because he had discussed the firm’s lucrative mortgage-hedging bets in writing and his comments became the focus of ire in the U.S. Senate, according to Manhattan Supreme Court papers filed last week. As a result, Goldman Sachs was deeply embarrassed. Salem had earned a 15 million bonus in 2009 and had told his mother after her house burned down on Christmas 2010 that she shouldn’t worry because he was expecting 13 million, Bloomberg reported. Salem left Goldman Sachs in 2012 after his 2011 bonus dropped to 3 million and then challenged his bosses’ 2010 bonus decision by asking for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to arbitrate the dispute. FINRA recently sided with Goldman Sachs. A spokeswoman for the investment bank said, “These claims are utterly ridiculous, which is why they were rejected by a FINRA panel, and unworthy of any further response.” Salem is asking the state court to overturn the FINRA decision and award him 16.5 million.

Salem had previously earned a 15 million bonus in 2009 and anticipated a similar payout in 2010. However, after his 2011 bonus dropped to 3 million, he left the company in 2012. Salem sought arbitration through the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to dispute the bonus granted to him for 2010, which ultimately sided with Goldman Sachs. In response, Salem filed papers in Manhattan Supreme Court, asking the court to overturn FINRA's decision and award him 16.5 million. Goldman Sachs said these claims are \\"utterly ridiculous,\\" while also pointing out that they were rejected by FINRA and not deserving of any additional consideration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They have released five studio albums and six extended plays. The band is composed of vocalist Liam Cormier, guitarist Scott Middleton, drummer Mike Peters and bassist Jaye R. Schwarzer. Cancer Bats take a wide variety of influences from heavy metal subgenres and fuse them into hardcore and punk rock, and also include elements of Southern rock. Cancer Bats was founded in May 2004 by singer Liam Cormier and guitarist Scott Middleton, a former member of Toronto heavy metal band At the Mercy of Inspiration. The two wanted to form a project that combined their favorite parts of bands like Entombed, Refused, Black Flag, Led Zeppelin and Down, among others. The lineup was completed with the addition of Andrew McCracken on bass and Joel Bath on drums, with Cormier moving to vocals. The four-piece wrote and recorded songs for a self-released demo that saw light in January 2005, and led to Canadian independent record label Distort Entertainment signing the band.  The story is that the band considered the names Cancer Bats and Pneumonia Hawk after deciding that a combination of illness and animal name would give the best band name. Soon after, Mike Peters replaced Bath on the drums and the band began playing throughout Southern Ontario, playing live shows with bands like Billy Talent, Every Time I Die, Nora, Alexisonfire, Haste the Day, It Dies Today, Bane, Comeback Kid, Buried Inside, Attack in Black, Misery Signals, This Is Hell, Rise Against, The Bronx and Gallows.  On June 2, 2006, the band took part in a short interview and then played a free CD release show at The Edge 102.1 (CFNY-FM) and then on June 6 Birthing the Giant was released into major record stores. The album includes guest vocals by George Pettit of Alexisonfire. On June 7, 2006 they hosted All Things Rock, a show on MTV Canada, and had their own video played at the end of the show. when was the band formed?","output":"The band Cancer Bats was formed in May 2004 by singer Liam Cormier and guitarist Scott Middleton."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Middle Ages Charlemagne planned to continue the Frankish tradition of dividing his kingdom between all his heirs, but was unable to do so as only one son, Louis the Pious (r. 814–840), was still alive by 813. Just before Charlemagne died in 814, he crowned Louis as his successor. Louis's reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and, after 829, civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire. Eventually, Louis recognised his eldest son Lothair I (d. 855) as emperor and gave him Italy. Louis divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and Charles the Bald (d. 877), his youngest son. Lothair took East Francia, comprising both banks of the Rhine and eastwards, leaving Charles West Francia with the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps. Louis the German (d. 876), the middle child, who had been rebellious to the last, was allowed to keep Bavaria under the suzerainty of his elder brother. The division was disputed. Pepin II of Aquitaine (d. after 864), the emperor's grandson, rebelled in a contest for Aquitaine, while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia. Louis the Pious died in 840, with the empire still in chaos. Q: Who ruled Italy after Louis the Pious?","output":"Lothair I, the eldest son of Louis the Pious, ruled Italy after his father.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: I teach geography at UNLV three times per week. Last Monday, at the beginning of class, I cheerfully asked my students how their weekend had been. One young man said that his weekend had not been so good. He had his wisdom teeth removed. The young man then asked me why I always seemed to be so cheerful. \\"I choose to be cheerful.\\" I said. Then I told them a story. In addition to teaching here at UNLV, I also teach out at the community college in Henderson, 17 miles down the freeway from where I live. One day I drove those 17 miles to Henderson. I exited the freeway and turned onto College Drive. I only had to drive another quarter mile down the road to the college. But just then my car died and wouldn't start again. So I left my car there and marched down the road to the college. As soon as I got there I called AAA  and arranged for a tow truck   to meet me at my car after class. The secretary in the office asked me what had happened. \\"This is my lucky day.\\" I replied, smiling. \\"Your car breaks down and today is your lucky day?\\" She was puzzled. \\"What do you mean?\\" \\"My car could have broken down anywhere along the freeway but it didn't.\\" I replied, \\"Instead, it broke down in the perfect place: off the freeway, within walking distance from here. I'm still able to teach my class, and I've been able to arrange for the tow truck to meet me after class.\\" The secretary's eyes opened wide, and then she smiled. I smiled back and headed for class. So ended my story. I scanned the sixty faces in my class at UNLV. Despite the early hour, no one seemed to be asleep. Somehow, my story had touched them. Or maybe _ In fact, it had all started with a student's observation that I was cheerful.

What is the full name of the person who wants a Jaguar XJ6?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In his first leading role Ben Mendelsohn plays Danny Clark, a bumbling eighteen-year-old guy. He knows what it takes to be cool and have some style, it is just that he seems to struggle to get there. Danny has enthusiasm and passion and only wants two things more than anything in the world. A Jaguar XJ6 and a date with the gorgeous Joanna Johnson (an early role for then 17-year-old Claudia Karvan). Get these and his life will be complete. Unfortunately for Danny, when he finally gets the courage up to ask Joanna out, he somehow manages to promise her a ride in his new Jaguar. She is not particularly impressed by cars, but still agrees to his invitation. The problem is, Danny does not own a Jaguar. His form of transport is his recently received birthday present - and it most certainly is not a Jaguar. His eccentric parents have decided to pass on their pride and joy to Danny for his use. Their 1963 Nissan Cedric has been in the family for years and is immaculate  but extremely uncool. Danny is aghast at the thought of driving around in a car as dorky as a Cedric and, with the promise of a date with Joanna and the need for a Jaguar in a hurry, decides to trade in the old Nissan.

Article: A team of British surgeons has carried out Gaza's first organ transplants for a long-term plan to train local medical staff to perform the operations. Two patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital. Ziad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. \\"We were desperate,\\" said Matouk. The UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. \\"We are very satisfied with the results,\\" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital. Skaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians... Question: What is the beginning of the cooperation between the Royal Liverpool hospital and Gaza? Options: A: A UK doctor contacted Gaza hospital. B: The Shifa imported medical machines from UK. C: Ziad Matouk's condition seemed to get worse. D: A Shifa doctor turned to Royal Liverpool hospital for help.

Good about the choices they made Based on the context provided, Jordan can be described as being good about the choices they made. Eating healthy food by cooking from scratch and meal planning indicates that Jordan is proactive and mindful about their nutrition and overall well-being. By making a conscious effort to prepare meals with wholesome ingredients and planning their meals in advance, Jordan displays commitment and dedication towards maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Although the term \\"on a diet\\" (A) might imply that someone is pursuing healthier eating habits, it often refers to a temporary or structured plan to achieve a specific goal, such as losing weight. In Jordan's case, they appear to be focused on long-term, sustainable habits rather than a short-term diet.

The contractor wanted to build a new building on the land but the  Pick from: + land was too small. + building was too small.","output":"The contractor wanted to build a new building on the land, but the land was too small. Despite the limited space, the contractor was determined to make the best use of the available area. He called for a meeting with his team of architects and engineers to brainstorm possible solutions. As the team gathered around the conference table, they explored various ideas to maximize space usage. One architect suggested building taller structures to add more stories, increasing the number of occupiable units. Another engineer put forth the idea of creating an underground parking system, freeing up valuable real estate for the actual building itself. During the discussions, a junior engineer proposed a novel concept that piqued everyone's interest. He suggested designing a mixed-use building, combining residential and commercial use in the same structure. By doing so, they could generate more income for the client, and it would be quite attractive to potential investors. The contractor was intrigued by the idea and asked the team to research and develop detailed plans. As they delved deeper into the mixed-use concept, they realized that the land's strategic location was perfect for this kind of development. It was close to a busy commercial hub and a burgeoning residential community. In addition, the area had easy access to public transportation, making it even more desirable for potential occupants. The team of architects and engineers began working tirelessly on drafting the plans. They incorporated energy-efficient techniques into the building's design, aiming for it to be environmentally sustainable. They decided to use materials like cross-laminated timber, known for its strength and low carbon footprint. The building would also have green features like a rooftop garden and rainwater harvesting system. The team carefully considered the needs of future occupants. In the residential section, they designed multi-bedroom units for families, as well as smaller, one-bedroom apartments for single occupants and couples. There would be ample green spaces throughout the development, with walking and biking trails, playgrounds, and a shared community garden. The commercial section of the building would accommodate shops, cafes, and restaurants on the ground floor, allowing both residents and visitors easy access to retail and dining options. The building would also house offices and co-working spaces, as well as conference rooms and shared amenities. With the final plans in place, the contractor excitedly presented the proposal to the client, who was thrilled by the thought of such an innovative and profitable project. Since the mixed-use building proposal addressed the limitations imposed by the small size of the land, the client readily agreed to move forward with construction. During the building process, the contractor and his team regularly collaborated with the local authorities to ensure all zoning regulations and building codes were being met. As a result, the construction proceeded smoothly and on schedule, leading to the completion of the project within the stipulated time and budget. In the end, the contractor's determination to overcome the challenges posed by the small piece of land resulted in a cutting-edge, mixed-use building that significantly enhanced the neighborhood's appeal. It provided a dynamic and sustainable living environment for residents and supported the local economy through commercial establishments. The project's success cemented the contractor's reputation in the industry, as clients flocked to him for innovative solutions to their own development challenges. Meanwhile, the junior engineer's career took off, thanks to his groundbreaking idea that turned a limitation into an opportunity. The mixed-use building became a source of inspiration, serving as a model for sustainable urban construction in densely populated areas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: Where does the painting that not get distribution of reproductions reside today? from the following article ?  Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed, occasionally formerly known as The Imprudence of Candaules, is a 45.1 by 55.9 cm (17.8 by 22.0 in) oil painting on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1830. It shows a scene from the Histories by Herodotus, in which Candaules, king of Lydia, invites his bodyguard Gyges to hide in the couple's bedroom and watch his wife Nyssia undress, to prove to him her beauty. Nyssia notices Gyges spying and challenges him to either accept his own execution or to kill Candaules as a punishment. Gyges chooses to kill Candaules and take his place as king. The painting shows the moment at which Nyssia, still unaware that she is being watched by anyone other than her husband, removes the last of her clothes. Etty hoped that his audience would take from the painting the moral lesson that women are not chattels and that men infringing on their rights should justly be punished, but he made little effort to explain this to audiences. The painting was immediately controversial and perceived as a cynical combination of a pornographic image and a violent and unpleasant narrative, and it was condemned as an immoral piece of the type one would expect from a foreign, not a British, artist. It was bought by Robert Vernon on its exhibition, and in 1847 was one of a number of paintings given by Vernon to the nation. The work retained its controversial reputation in later years, and when The Art Journal bought the reproduction rights to Vernon's former collection in 1849 they did not distribute reproductions of Candaules. In 1929 it was among several paintings transferred to the newly expanded Tate Gallery, where as of 2018 it remains.","output":"The painting \\"Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed\\" by William Etty, which did not have reproductions distributed, resides in the Tate Gallery.

A:","output":"The review provided for the film \\"Bandkok Love Story\\" seems to paint a mixture of both flattering and unflattering light on the product. It is evident that the reviewer appreciates certain aspects of the film while expressing dissatisfaction with others. On the flattering side, the review highlights the good acting and the impressive action sequences (referred to as \\"shoot-em-up specials\\"). These positive remarks reflect the reviewer's appreciation for the performance of the actors and the thrilling, adrenaline-pumping scenes that are often a major draw for film enthusiasts. Such feedback can attract potential viewers who enjoy quality acting and captivating action. The reviewer also acknowledges the film's narrative and plot but uses terms like \\"a little disjointed\\" and \\"ok\\" to describe it. This mirrors a lukewarm response to the structure of the story, which could be perceived as neither overwhelmingly negative nor strongly positive. It might indicate that the film does not excel in this area but also does not fail to deliver a decent story. As for the unflattering aspects, the review mentions certain discrepancies between the theatrical release and the DVD version, suggesting that some aspects of the film may have been lost or altered during the transition. This can potentially raise concerns for potential viewers who might be interested in experiencing the original and complete version of the film. Furthermore, the reviewer expresses disappointment in the lack of personal story development between the lead actors. It implies that the film might miss out on opportunities to delve deeper into the characters' relationships, which could have added depth, layers, and emotional engagement for the audience. In conclusion, the review for \\"Bandkok Love Story\\" generally contains a blend of both complimentary and critical remarks, with the positive comments mostly focusing on the acting and action sequences, and the negative points addressing the plot and personal story development. Overall, however, the review leans slightly towards an unflattering light due to the dissatisfaction expressed towards the story and character relationships, along with the concerns related to differences between the theatrical and DVD releases. As a potential viewer, one must weigh in these factors and decide if the captivating acting and action scenes are enough to make up for the cited shortcomings in the story and characters' development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on earlier transmitted reports, in the year 632, after the demise of Muhammad a number of his companions who knew the Quran by heart were killed in a battle by Musaylimah, the first caliph Abu Bakr (d. 634) decided to collect the book in one volume so that it could be preserved. Zayd ibn Thabit (d. 655) was the person to collect the Quran since \\"he used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah's Apostle\\". Thus, a group of scribes, most importantly Zayd, collected the verses and produced a hand-written manuscript of the complete book. The manuscript according to Zayd remained with Abu Bakr until he died. Zayd's reaction to the task and the difficulties in collecting the Quranic material from parchments, palm-leaf stalks, thin stones and from men who knew it by heart is recorded in earlier narratives. After Abu Bakr, Hafsa bint Umar, Muhammad's widow, was entrusted with the manuscript. In about 650, the third Caliph Uthman ibn Affan (d. 656) began noticing slight differences in pronunciation of the Quran as Islam expanded beyond the Arabian Peninsula into Persia, the Levant, and North Africa. In order to preserve the sanctity of the text, he ordered a committee headed by Zayd to use Abu Bakr's copy and prepare a standard copy of the Quran. Thus, within 20 years of Muhammad's death, the Quran was committed to written form. That text became the model from which copies were made and promulgated throughout the urban centers of the Muslim world, and other versions are believed to have been destroyed. The present form of the Quran text is accepted by Muslim scholars to be the original version compiled by Abu Bakr.

But robins are in danger of wearing themselves out by singing too much. Robins are singing all nightas well as during the day, British-based researchers say. David Dominoni, of Glasgow University, said that light from street lamps, takeaway signs and homes is affecting the birds' biological clock, leading to them being wide awake when they should be asleep. Dr Dominoni, who is putting cameras inside nesting boxes to track sleeping patterns, said lack of sleep could put the birds' health at risk. His study shows that when robins are exposed to light at night in the lab, it leads to some genes being active at the wrong time of day. And the more birds are exposed to light, the more active they are at night. He told people at a conference, \\"There have been a couple of studies suggesting they are increasing their song output at night and during the day they are still singing. Singing is a costly behaviour and it takes energy. So by increasing their song output, there might be some costs of energy.\\" And it is not just robins that are being kept awake by artificial light. Blackoiids and seagulls are also being more nocturnal. Dr Dominoni said, \\"In Glasgow where I live, gulls are a serious problem. I have people coming to me saying \`You are the bird expert. Can you help us kill these gulls?'.During the breeding season, between April and June, they are very active at night and very noisy and people can't sleep.\\" Although Dr Dominoni has only studied light pollution, other research concluded that robins living in noisy cities have started to sing at night to make themselves heard over loud noise. However, some birds thrive in noisy environments. A study from California Polytechnic University found more hummingbirds in areas with heavy industrial machinery. It is thought that they are capitalising on their predators fleeing to quieter areas. According to Dr Dominoni's study, what cause robins to sing so much? A) The breeding season.

Article:The Treasury bailed out the bank by buying a 72% stake for £45bn, at 502p a share, at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. Shares in the loss-making lender are now trading at less than half that price at 223p. Philip Hammond told MPs on Tuesday: \\"We have to live in the real world.\\" He added: \\"Our policy remains to return the bank to private hands as soon as we can achieve fair value for the shares, recognising that fair value could well be below what the previous government paid for them. \\"We have to live in the real world and make decisions on the future of our holding in RBS in the best interests of taxpayers.\\" Simon Jack: Why is RBS still losing money? Mr Hammond has previously said the government did not expect to offload its stake in RBS until after 2020. He added: \\"We are making real progress in realising our holdings in the banking sector. \\"We continue the programme sale of our shareholding in Lloyds, which is now down from 43% to less than 2%, and just last month we sold £12bn worth of Bradford & Bingley mortgages in a highly competitive process.\\" It is understood that the Treasury will only start to sell its shares in RBS when \\"legacy\\" issues have been resolved. Those issues include a potentially huge fine by the US Department of Justice, which is pursuing the bank over the sale of mortgage-backed securities before the financial crisis. In February, RBS posted its ninth consecutive annual loss, with much of the £7bn accounted for by setting aside £5.9bn for fines and legal costs. The bank has racked up losses of more than £50bn since the government bailout. Chief executive Ross McEwan said in Feburary he expected RBS to return to profit by the end of 2018. When one-off charges were stripped out, the core business of the bank was making money, he added.

Input: ['e', 'E', 'R', '5485', '4683', '5625', 'e', 'g', '9607', 'g', '7589', '3015', 'T', 'Y', 'U', '4609', 'n', '3935', 'r', '8473', 'J', '1945', 'W'] Output:","output":"To complete this task, you can follow these steps using Python: 1. Create a function that converts a single alphabet character to its position in the English alphabet. 2. Loop through the input list A. 3. Check if the current list item is an alphabetical character. 4. If it is, convert it to its corresponding position in the English alphabet. 5. Replace the original character in the list with the converted position. Here's a Python code snippet to achieve this: \`\`\`python def char_to_number(char):     return ord(char.lower()) - 96 if char.isalpha() else char input_list = ['e', 'E', 'R', '5485', '4683', '5625', 'e', 'g', '9607', 'g', '7589', '3015', 'T', 'Y', 'U', '4609', 'n', '3935', 'r', '8473', 'J', '1945', 'W'] output_list = [char_to_number(char) for char in input_list] print(output_list) \`\`\` Output: \`\`\` [5, 5, 18, '5485', '4683', '5625', 5, 7, '9607', 7, '7589', '3015', 20, 25, 21, '4609', 14, '3935', 18, '8473', 10, '1945', 23] \`\`\` This code snippet creates a function \`char_to_number\` that takes a character as input and returns its position in the English alphabet if the character is an alphabet. The \`ord()\` function is used to get the Unicode value of the character, and then it is subtracted by 96 to get its position. The \`.lower()\` method ensures that the character is converted to lowercase before the subtraction, so both uppercase and lowercase letters are properly handled. Next, the code loops through the input list \`input_list\` and for each character, it calls the \`char_to_number\` function and stores the result in the output list \`output_list\`. Finally, the output list is printed."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers.  Two brothers owned two adjacent parcels of land.

Born into a large family from Charlemagne, Quebec, Dion emerged as a teen star in the French-speaking world after her manager and future husband Rene Angelil mortgaged his home to finance her first record. Dion first gained international recognition in the 1980s by winning both the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival and the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest where she represented Switzerland. Dion was born in Charlemagne, Quebec, the youngest of 14 children of Therese (nee Tanguay), a homemaker, and Adhemar Dion, a butcher, both of French-Canadian descent. Dion was raised a Roman Catholic in a poor, but, by her own account, happy home in Charlemagne. Music had always been a major part of the Dion family; indeed, Dion herself was named after the song \\"Celine,\\" which French singer Hugues Aufray had recorded two years before her own birth. On 13 August 1973, at the age of five, the young Celine made her first public appearance at her brother Michel's wedding, where she performed Christine Charbonneau's song \\"Du fil des aiguilles et du coton\\". She continued to perform with her siblings in her parents' small piano bar called Le Vieux Baril, \\"The Old Barrel.\\" From an early age, Dion had dreamed of being a performer. In a 1994 interview with People magazine, she recalled, \\"I missed my family and my home, but I don't regret having lost my adolescence. I had one dream: I wanted to be a singer.\\"  At age 12, Dion collaborated with her mother and her brother Jacques to write and compose her first song, \\"Ce n'etait qu'un reve,\\" whose title translates as \\"It Was Only a Dream\\" or \\"Nothing But A Dream.\\" Her brother Michel sent the recording to music manager Rene Angelil, whose name he discovered on the back of a Ginette Reno album. Angelil was moved to tears by Dion's voice and decided to make her a star. In 1981, he mortgaged his home to fund her first record, La voix du bon Dieu, which later became a local No. 1 hit and made Dion an instant star in Quebec. Her popularity spread to other parts of the world when she competed in the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival in Tokyo, Japan, and won the musician's award for \\"Top Performer\\" as well as the gold medal for \\"Best Song\\" with \\"Tellement j'ai d'amour pour toi\\".  By 1983, in addition to becoming the first Canadian artist to receive a gold record in France for the single \\"D'amour ou d'amitie\\" (\\"Of Love or of Friendship\\"), Dion had also won several Felix Awards, including \\"Best Female performer\\" and \\"Discovery of the Year\\". Further success came when Dion represented Switzerland in the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest with the song \\"Ne partez pas sans moi\\" and won the contest by a close margin in Dublin, Ireland.  At age eighteen, after seeing a Michael Jackson performance, Dion told Angelil that she wanted to be a star like Jackson. Though confident in her talent, Angelil realized that her image needed to be changed in order for her to be marketed worldwide. Dion receded from the spotlight for a number of months, during which she underwent dental surgery to improve her appearance, and was sent to the Ecole Berlitz in 1989 to polish her English.  In 1989, during a concert on the Incognito Tour, Dion injured her voice. She consulted the otorhinolaryngologist William Gould, who gave her an ultimatum: have immediate surgery on her vocal cords or do not utilize them at all for three weeks. Dion chose the latter and underwent vocal training with William Riley.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: When did she begin music?","output":"Celine Dion began her music journey at a very young age.

Translate from Spanish to English: Grabado al Aguafuerte y acuatinta original firmada y numerada 184/220","output":"The phrase \\"Grabado al Aguafuerte y acuatinta original firmada y numerada 184/220\\" translates to \\"Original etching and aquatint engraving, signed and numbered 184/220\\" in English.  For further clarification, let's break the sentence down a bit: 1. \\"Grabado al Aguafuerte y acuatinta\\" translates to \\"etching and aquatint engraving\\". Etching is a printmaking technique that uses chemicals, usually acid, to cut into the unprotected areas of a metal surface to create a design in relief in the metal. While aquatint is a form of etching that is used to produce tonal effects, rather than lines. 2. \\"Original\\" remains \\"original\\" in English. It's to assure the authenticity of the artwork and affirms it isn't a reproduction or copy. 3. \\"Firmada\\" translates to \\"signed\\". The artist themselves has authenticated it by putting their signature on it. In art, the signature of the artist is an important aspect as it confirms the authenticity of the work. 4. \\"Numerada 184/220\\" translates to \\"numbered 184/220\\". It typically indicates that the work is an element of a limited series. In this case, it's the 184th piece out of a possible 220. The lower the last number is, the more valuable and desirable the work tends to be since there are fewer of them.  So, \\"Grabado al Aguafuerte y acuatinta original firmada y numerada 184/220\\" refers to an original print (either etching or aquatint) verified by the artist's signature and serialized as 184 out of a limited 220 pieces."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

This is because in the wake of the destruction of his home, the numerous offers of help from friends and neighbors indicate that he is well-liked and respected within his community. It is important to note that his willingness to accept help during this time of crisis also demonstrates his humility and openness to relying on the support of his community. The relationships he has nurtured with those around him have resulted in a strong network of people who care about his well-being and are willing to go the extra mile to help him in his time of need. Moreover, a person's popularity can often be determined by the extent to which others are willing to provide assistance when they face difficulties. It's evident that Austin has polished positive connections with people around him, allowing them to feel comfortable reaching out to offer help when they hear about the disaster that befell him. The empathy and compassion shown towards Austin by his friends and neighbors signal a strong connection he shares with them, which is a testament to his sociable nature. The fact that Austin lost everything in the storm is a separate aspect of his situation that doesn't necessarily impact his popularity. The outpouring of support he has received in response to this tragedy is an indicator of how he is perceived by the people around him. The devastation he experienced can engender incredible sympathy, but the willingness of others to step up and offer their help speaks to their regard for Austin as a person.

In chapters 3 and 4 we described how the U.S. government adjusted its existing agencies and capacities to address the emerging threat from Usama  Bin Laden and his associates. After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting  Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of  Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about  Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on  Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about  Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing  Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of  Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I don't often give one star reviews, but the computer won't let me do negative numbers. The opening titles tell us we're in deep water already. Although this is a low budget exploitation film, there are 17 producers credited. No. No. At the beginning of the story abusive husband Kenneth comes home to his family in an upscale gated community. The house is a pigsty. His wife, Della (Kim Basinger) has let the children run amok all day. OK. We're already in deep water. Ms. Basinger was 55 years old when the film came out. Uh, are these her children or grandchildren? It's Christmas Eve. Della drives to the mall, a lengthy scene that could have been cut. To bludgeon home the idea of eeeeeeevil male aggression rampant in the universe she drives past football players in full uniform playing in pouring rain on Christmas Eve. Sure. For a bonus she sees a vehicle with a slaughtered deer tied to it. We get some actual suspense in the driving scenes, though. It's raining and traffic is bad. First we see Della try to drive and smoke at the same time. Then later Della tries to drive and talk on her cell phone at the same time, at one point turning completely around to check the cluttered back seat for the charger for the phone. She wanders the mall, sees an old friend from college, tries to buy stuff but her credit card is declined- gosh, maybe her husband is grumpy because he's going broke, but that's too complicated for the script to follow. In the parking lot she runs afoul of the most ludicrous gang in the history of films. One White boy (Lukas Hass watching his career go down the toilet), one Black, one Asian, and one Hispanic. Imagine a company of Up with People gone to the bad and you'll have the idea. Although they have a gun she gives them attitude. A mall cop comes to investigate the ruckus and they shoot him in the head, firing more than once. The parking lot is crowded as can be, people everywhere, and nobody notices. Della escapes in her car and rather than choosing a police station or well lighted safe area, she drives to a construction site, where she kills all four bad boys one at a time with simply the tools (literally) at hand. MAJOR spoiler ahead. She drives back home. The car poops out so she walks through the pouring rain. Checks on the children, goes downstairs, and when her husband petulantly asks what she got him at the mall shows him the gun and shoots him at point blank range. The experience with the four punks was supposed to result in personal empowerment for Della. Instead we know that her children will probably spend Christmas in foster care or a group home, because the State will collect them while she answers to murder one charges. The four punks can be classified as justifiable homicide in self defense. The husband, different story. I'm so glad I saw this on cable. If I'd seen it in a theater (did it get any release?) I'd have been furious. As is, I'm just sad seeing talents like Ms. Basinger and Mr. Haas waste themselves on garbage like this. One very good thing, though.

Please answer the following question: Question: How is constitutionalism used in the American Government today? I found the following answer on Google: Constitutionalism, in its most general meaning, is \\"a complex of ideas, attitudes, and patterns of behavior elaborating the principle that the authority of government derives from and is limited by a body of fundamental law\\". Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"Yes, the definition you found on Google about constitutionalism is correct. In the context of the American government today, constitutionalism is the idea that the government's authority and power are established, derived from, and limited by the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution outlines the structure and functions of the federal government, the rights that citizens possess, and the principles guiding the government. Constitutionalism in the American government today can be observed in several ways, including: 1. Separation of powers: The U.S. Constitution divides the powers of the federal government among three distinct but interrelated branches: the Legislative (Congress), the Executive (the President), and the Judicial (the Supreme Court and federal courts). This separation of powers prevents any single branch from becoming too powerful and encourages checks and balances to maintain a fair and functioning government. 2. Federalism: The U.S. Constitution establishes a system of federalism, in which power is divided between the federal government and state governments. This balance allows for the sharing of responsibilities and ensures that the federal government does not become too centralized and oppressive. 3. Bill of Rights: The first ten amendments to the U.S. Constitution, known as the Bill of Rights, protect individual liberties and rights. The existence of these rights reflects the principle that the government should be limited in its powers over citizens. 4. Judicial review: The U.S. Supreme Court, authorized by the Constitution, has the power to review whether the laws and actions of the government are constitutional. This process helps to ensure that the government abides by the Constitution and respects the limits placed on its powers. 5. Democratic elections and representation: The U.S. Constitution establishes a democratic system of government, with regular elections and representation in Congress. This allows for the people to have a voice in the government and helps ensure that the government remains accountable to its citizens. In summary, constitutionalism is an essential aspect of the American government today, as the Constitution serves as the foundation for the nation's entire political and legal system. The Constitution not only outlines the structure and functions of the government but also enshrines the principles of limited government, separation of powers, and respect for individual rights."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Mikaela Shiffrin’s Swift, if Unplanned, Ascent to World Champion EAGLE-VAIL, Colo. — Sprinting from her small trophy-filled bedroom, Mikaela Shiffrin, the youngest American skier to be a World Cup champion, dashed around the kitchen looking for a headset to attach to her laptop. In two minutes, a horde of European journalists would be linked via Skype to the Shiffrins’ home here in the mountains, eager for insight from Mikaela, an 18-year-old princess of precision and a gold medal favorite in next month’s Olympics in Sochi, Russia. It was just past 8 on a mid-September morning and she was sleepy after a rare late-night shopping spree with her mother, Eileen, two hours away in Denver. Mikaela hurriedly combed her hair at a kitchen table as she made the Skype connection while Eileen rushed to wash dishes in the sink so the background would not look messy. Mikaela, who graduated from high school a month earlier, was thoughtful and forthcoming with the reporters, but as soon as she finished and the laptop was shut, mother and daughter burst out laughing. “Because she skis so efficiently, everyone perceives Mikaela as this perfectly prepped, organized little machine,” Eileen said. “And here I am running around in the background as the world watches me clean my countertop and stove. If they only knew that we don’t know what we’re doing half the time. “People think we’ve had this master plan to produce a world champion. We have no plan.” Nevertheless, Shiffrin, who is often called the next Lindsey Vonn, will be a featured personality at the Sochi Games, especially on American television now that the injured Vonn has withdrawn. With a gleaming smile, long blond hair and no pretension, Shiffrin is a star in waiting. The only hard part may be waiting until the last few days of the Games for her events, giant slalom and slalom. But one of the final, lasting Alpine images of Sochi may be Shiffrin’s Olympic debut. She could become the face of a new generation of ski racing champions, a gold medalist raised in Colorado and New Hampshire who is already known throughout Europe by one name: Mikaela. As Roland Pfeifer, her Austrian-born coach, said: “Mikaela is a once-in-a-lifetime talent. One day, she could beat everyone at everything.” Shiffrin has already done a good job beating everyone in slalom, her best event. Racing in Europe since she was 15, she not only won last year’s world slalom championship before 30,000 screaming Austrian fans — most of whom were rooting for the second-place Austrian finisher — but also awed the ski community with her dominance in the World Cup slalom standings. In the last year, she has won six World Cup slalom races and finished second or third in two other races. In the last three months, she has stunned the World Cup circuit anew in giant slalom. With a second-place and a third-place finish in World Cup races, and two other top-10 finishes, she has demonstrated that she will also be a contender for Olympic gold in giant slalom. But the Shiffrin phenomenon is about more than winning races. It is about her rapid improvement. Although some of her competitors have 300 more World Cup starts, Shiffrin began winning by implausibly large margins last season. To put her accomplishments in perspective, consider that Shiffrin was a world champion at 17; Vonn was 24 when she won her first world championship gold medal. In a sport defined by the speed one can go downhill, Shiffrin’s ascent in women’s skiing has almost defied gravity. A wunderkind since she was 11, she is neither physically imposing (5 feet 7 inches, 145 pounds) nor especially aggressive nor intimidating (an aw-shucks smile seems to be her natural expression). On skis, she does not appear to be going that fast. Her upper body is virtually motionless, her eyes are quiet and she does not create particularly dynamic angles on the snow with her skis. The only thing that truly stands out about a Shiffrin race is her finish time. “It’s about the purity and serenity of her form,” said her teammate Ted Ligety, a four-time world champion. “At top speed on an icy, steep racecourse, the hardest thing in the world is making it look effortless. Mikaela does that.” That is why they call her the Mozart of ski racing. But that only adds to the mystery. Because how does one nurture a prodigy? “The question everyone asks me is: How did she get so good so soon?” Eileen said as Mikaela made scrambled eggs after the Skype interview. “There is no exact answer. People tell me I should write a book. I laugh, because you know what I would put in the book? How Mikaela got good because she had to shovel cow manure for weeks with me when we were replacing our lawn one summer. “It was 90 degrees and she was 10 years old and she worked so hard without complaining. So she’s a good ski racer because she did all kinds of different developmental things — like learning a good work ethic — but none of them were part of a plan to make a world champion.” To the Shiffrins — including her father, Jeff, and her older brother, Taylor, a college ski racer — Mikaela’s journey to the top of the mountain is what they call a succession of not mere coincidences. The family moved regularly for Jeff’s job as an anesthesiologist, shuttling between Vail Valley in Colorado and northern New England more than once. The relocations were fitful and sometimes distressing, with the children occasionally begging to leave one place or the other. But looking back, the Shiffrins insist that every step was essential to Mikaela’s development, even when mother and daughter helped to rebuild the lawn in front of their house in New Hampshire. “I really developed some shoulder definition from that,” Mikaela said with a laugh. Not surprisingly, any predetermined strategy was remarkably elemental and always focused on process, not results. Jeff and Eileen, former college-level racers, believed in basic tenets, like keeping a light race schedule for their children as they loaded up on practice days filled with deliberate, skills-based drills and exercises. And, they said, it was imperative to keep family close by. Yet, these were controversial theories in the ski racing community — both when Mikaela was starting out and when she advanced to the World Cup. Youth coaches were livid when Mikaela, faster than skiers several years older, chose to stay close to home to practice with her family instead of chasing the prestige of distant championships. Several years later, Eileen said, the United States ski team was adamantly against her accompaniment of Mikaela on the World Cup circuit in Europe. Eileen went anyway, and the Shiffrins paid for it for three years. “Our plan produced the first 17-year-old World Cup champion the U.S. has ever had,” Eileen said. “They should thank us for our 500,000 donation to the U.S. ski team.” The message, the Shiffrins insist, is that their approach, which stressed skill development and shunned goal setting, and always involved the family, has been the secret. If there was a secret. “If you look at it, what we always sought was normalcy,” Eileen said. Jeff recalled: “These top-level coaches would tell me that Mikaela was just ripping up a racecourse. And I would say: ‘Yeah, I agree, but she’s just 9 years old.’ And they’d say, ‘What are your plans for her?’ And I’d answer: ‘Plans? Well, tomorrow she’s trying out for a part as the angel in the Christmas play.’ “We didn’t have plans. A million things could have happened.” A million things did happen. They just seem to have produced the best 18-year-old skier, male or female, in United States history. To hear the Shiffrins speak of the many twists and turns in Mikaela’s path, it began when they left the ski mecca of Vail, Colo., and moved to a New Hampshire town they had virtually never seen and a remote new house that Eileen and Mikaela had trouble finding after a cross-country drive. “I hated it in the East at the start,” Mikaela said, sitting in a gym outside Vail after a workout in September. “My parents said the East and the West were totally different, so they wanted us to know both so we understood the diversity of places. But the differences were tough to adjust to. It rained a lot in New Hampshire, and when I skied the snow was icy and hard, and the mountains were small. The people, the schools, the clothes — everything was different.” Jeff Shiffrin took a job at the medical center in central New Hampshire operated by Dartmouth College, his alma mater. Eileen, a former intensive care unit nurse, turned her focus to raising Mikaela and Taylor. She said: “We had moved from a nice house in a Colorado resort town to a tiny house in the country, and while we had a lot of land, which was great, the New Hampshire house was in terrible shape. So we started working 14-hour days repainting the entire inside and outside of the house and fixing everything up.” From unicycles to inline skates, Mikaela Shiffrin spent plenty of time off skis, as when she played in the garage with her brother at age 6. Then grubs destroyed their lawn. “So we rebuilt the lawn, too,” Eileen said. Mikaela said: “The whole experience turned out to be really educational. We were on our own, and we found out there’s a way to fix everything — usually through hard work.” When Taylor did not make a travel soccer team with all his new friends, the reaction of the Shiffrins was emblematic of their approach to almost everything. “My mom went on Amazon and bought about 10 different World Cup soccer DVDs,” Mikaela said. “And she bought 12-foot-high rebound nets and bungee cords and all these contraptions so we could set up our own soccer complex in the backyard. Every day that summer, we had our own soccer camp for six or eight hours.” Mikaela recalled that they bought a unicycle because Eileen had read that it was good for balance, which she considered a pivotal athletic skill. The Shiffrin children also learned to juggle to improve their coordination. “We then started going around our block, which was two miles long, riding the unicycle and juggling at the same time,” Mikaela said. “And if I was doing that, then Taylor would be behind me dribbling a soccer ball as he ran around the block.” Eileen was confident it would pay off, even as she worried what people were saying about her children. “You would see the neighbors coming out to watch the Shiffrins going around the block juggling on a unicycle,” Eileen said. “I’m sure they thought we were completely nuts.” But the next summer, Taylor and Mikaela made their travel soccer teams. As Eileen recalled: “The coach said to me: ‘What did you do? They’re great now.’ And I said, ‘You don’t really want to know.’ ” Jeff said: “Some people might call our approach intense. But it’s not, because the motivation is not to be better than other people at something. The motivation comes from a belief that almost anything can be mastered if you’re willing to put in the hours to master it. If you’re going to do something, do it as best as you can.” “She was a happy little kid,” Rika Moore, a youth coach at Vail, said of Shiffrin, “but she was unbelievably focused on making perfect turns, one after another.” Mikaela and Taylor, who races for the University of Denver, insist they were never pushed in athletics. “I’d say it was the opposite,” Mikaela said. “I remember as a little girl in Vail, it would be a powder day and my parents would say, ‘Let’s go free ski in the back bowls.’ And I’d say: ‘No, I want to stay on the racecourse and train. I’m working on my pole plants.’ I wanted to get better at something every day.” Rika Moore, a longtime youth ski racing coach in Vail, recalled that Eileen coached on the race training hill when she was pregnant with Mikaela. “They’re all good athletes in that family, and they all love ski racing,” Moore said. “But from the time she was 7 years old, Mikaela was very determined to ski clean arcs in the snow. A lot of kids are in the race program to be with their friends or because their parents want them to do it. Not Mikaela. She was a happy little kid, but she was unbelievably focused on making perfect turns, one after another.” But when the Shiffrins moved east in 2003, they traded safe, dependable packed powder for what racers call boilerplate blue ice. It can be perilous; Mikaela eventually saw it as an advantage. “If you don’t have excellent technique, you won’t be upright on that hard ice for long,” she said. “Those East Coast racecourses prepared me for the World Cup circuit because the snow in Europe and the racecourses there are very much like the snow and the racecourses in the East. “If I hadn’t come east as a kid, I might still be a World Cup racer today, but I wouldn’t be the same World Cup racer. And there were cultural or geographic conditions in the East that helped me, too.” Mikaela had learned to be an all-around skier in Vail because of the vastness of its big-mountain experience. When she got to New Hampshire, she ended up at tiny Storrs Hill Ski Area. The vertical drop at Vail is about 3,500 feet. At Storrs Hill, it is 300 feet. But a long line of American champion ski racers cut their teeth at small mountains. One of them was Vonn, who learned to ski on a bump of a hill next to a Minnesota interstate. Jeff and Eileen Shiffrin were volunteer coaches at Storrs Hill along with Rick Colt, the Alpine director, and they sculptured Mikaela five days a week, including three weeknights. “We’d get out of school, do our homework on the 45-minute drive to Storrs Hill, then train on into the night,” Mikaela said. “When it’s a small place, you get up and down quickly. We’d get 25 runs through a course. You can’t get that many on a big mountain. I learned to love it in the East.” Mikaela continued to keep a light race schedule, but when she did get in the start house she usually won. Sometimes by a lot. In racing circles, news of her prowess spread. Youth coaches saw an evolving star in Mikaela, but the Shiffrins still strived for normalcy. She laughed off the renown, although when the local newspaper asked what she did to relax, Mikaela said she watched videos of World Cup championship skiers. In the summer, Mikaela and Taylor used in-line skates to simulate skis. Eileen turned broomsticks into slalom gates and taught her children the intricate rhythm and tempo of hand movements needed to block and push them away. Eventually, Mikaela and Taylor caught the eye of the best Eastern coaches. When Taylor enrolled at Burke Mountain Academy, a boarding school in northern Vermont for ski racers, Mikaela, then 11, went, too. Kirk Dwyer, the Burke headmaster and coach, saw in Mikaela a perfectly balanced and confident skier — riding the unicycle had benefits — with a rare outlook on competition. “She truly believed that the focus should be on the process of getting better and not race results,” Dwyer said. “She does that to this day. Everyone on the World Cup says they want to race like they practice, but how many actually do it? Mikaela can because she’s not thinking about trying to win. She’s thinking about getting better.” When Mikaela was 13, her father got a job in Denver and the family returned to Vail. “I love Vail, but at the same time I was depressed,” she said. “I missed my friends and I missed my coach at Burke.” So Mikaela went back east, as did Eileen, who rented a condominium near Burke, about 25 miles from the Canadian border. It was the first of several winters that Jeff and Eileen lived apart. “If I have to get on a plane to visit my family for the weekend, so be it,” Jeff said. “It was not a sacrifice because it was the right move for the kids.” But it was a costly decision, especially when Mikaela started leaving Burke to ski in Europe, with Eileen in tow. The Shiffrins’ house here is comfortable and homey, albeit nine miles from the pizazz of the Vail resort village. “Do I sometimes wish we had a bigger house and fancier cars?” Jeff said. “Yes, and sometimes there has been some material envy. But we’ve been willing to delay gratification knowing the return in the long run will be worth it.” Acclimating to World Cup life was not easy. The language and food were different, Eileen had to drive everywhere in Europe, and Mikaela was left out of the social scene. “She was 15 or 16, she wasn’t going to bars with the 28-year-olds,” Eileen said. Mother and daughter passed evenings watching romantic comedies on DVD, along with episodes of “Friends” and “Glee.” Many an afternoon was devoted to home schooling Mikaela, with Eileen as tutor and study partner. “But you know, it was all part of the growth experience,” Mikaela said. “It’s like getting down a tough racecourse. Things you don’t expect come up and you have to adapt. You can’t let it throw you off. You have to cope. Those are all really valuable skills, in life and racing.” Last year, Mikaela graduated from high school and brought a World Cup globe and world championship gold medal back to the United States. Others, especially Europeans, are astonished at what she has achieved in such a short time, but Mikaela appears unaffected by her success. “I believe there is always a faster way to do things,” she said in September after playing tennis with her mother. “Whether it’s learning to hit a backhand in tennis, learning high school chemistry or getting better at ski racing, I really believe with hard work and analytic preparation, you can skip a few steps and find the faster way.” It is something of a family motto: Be faster. Up next are the pressure and expectations of the Olympics, where she will be the odds-on favorite to win the slalom. Mikaela is not running from the attention. “I know that in the United States, the Olympics are the only time millions and millions of people watch ski racing, so it means a lot to the sport and the country,” she said. “So I understand the significance, but at the same time, it’s not the end of the world. “I will want to win. But the result of the race will not motivate me. I can honestly say that I am motivated by improvement, not results. That’s a core principle.” Mikaela exchanges Twitter messages with Missy Franklin, the Colorado swimmer who won four gold medals at the 2012 London Olympics as a 17-year-old. “I just think it’s cool that Missy even knows who I am,” Mikaela said, giggling. “But it is comforting knowing that someone has done it at 17 or 18. It makes me think that if she can do it, why can’t I? It proves that I don’t have to wait. Let’s get this show on the road right now.” Skiing’s Mozart is ready for the big stage. “I always roll my eyes at that Mozart stuff,” Eileen said at the end of a typically long day in her energetic household. (On what Mikaela called an off day, she still lifted weights at the gym for more than an hour and played nearly two hours of tennis.) “Did Mozart plan his achievements?” Eileen said. “Or did he maximize the opportunities in his life by working really hard? Did he just enjoy it? I feel like we’ve just stumbled upon some things and been in the right place at the right time with the right people helping us. But then we always made the most of those situations as they happened.” For someone so young, Mikaela takes the longer view. “I’m no superhero, and how I got here is a crazy path that probably could not be replicated,” she said. “But it doesn’t have to be replicated. I may have become a world champion quicker than most, but people should look at me and realize there are all kinds of ways to get where you want to go. “Because we didn’t plan it. We just did it.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text are about Mikaela Shiffrin, a young American skier who became a World Cup champion at the age of 18.

Summarize this article: His plane touched down in Panama City on Sunday evening after flying from Paris via Madrid. He was convicted in absentia of crimes committed during his time in power in the 1980s. The 77-year-old has already spent more than 20 years in prisons in France and the United States. Last month, a French court approved a request from Panama to send him back home to be jailed over his convictions for murder, corruption and embezzlement. He had the right to appeal, but his lawyers said he wanted to return to Panama. Foreign Minister Roberto Henriquez has said the government's priority is to guarantee Noriega's safety. Noriega travelled with a team of Panamanian officials, including the country's attorney-general and a doctor. After his arrival, he was escorted to El Renacer jail, south east of Panama City. Although he was never president, General Manuel Noriega served as Panama's de facto leader between 1983 to 1989. Once a US ally, he was arrested by invading American troops in January 1990, amid allegations he had turned the Central American nation into a drug-trafficking hub. He spent 20 years in prison in the US after being convicted there of the charges. In 2010, he was extradited from the US to France, where he had been convicted in absentia of laundering money from Colombian drug gangs through a French bank to buy property in Paris. He received a seven-year jail sentence from the French court. In Panama itself, he faces three 20-year jail terms for crimes committed during his rule, including the murders of political opponents. However, it remains unclear whether he will remain in prison, as Panama allows people aged 70 years and above to serve their sentences at home.","output":"General Manuel Noriega, who was a de facto leader of Panama during the 1980s, has been returned to his home country from France, following approval by a French court in response to a request from Panama.

First, let's look at all the \\"u\\" terms: 36*u - 53*u. Let's combine them.    It's like having 36 apples and then taking away 53 apples (think of 53 apples as negative apples!).    So that's 36 - 53 = -17 apples or -17*u. 2. Now, we have -30*u = -17*u - 273. 3. Let's move -17*u to the left side of the equation by adding 17*u to both sides.    So, we have (-30*u + 17*u) = -273.    Combining \\"u\\" terms now, we get (-13*u) = -273. 4. Now, to find \\"u,\\" we will divide both sides by -13.    So, u = -273 / -13. 5.

In this context, the flagbearers are being positioned on both sides by armed guards. This implies that the guards are present around or alongside the flagbearers, providing support and protection.  2. \\"While another soldier helps a wounded comrade\\": This part of the statement is detailing an additional event happening concurrently with the earlier part. There is a soldier (other than the armed guards and flagbearers) assisting an injured comrade. Now, examining the conclusion statement, \\"The flagbearers were the ones flanking the armed guards,\\" it is inaccurate given the information provided in the original statement. It reverses the positions of flagbearers and armed guards. In the original statement, it clearly mentions that the flagbearers are being flanked (supported or surrounded) by armed guards, rather than the flagbearers being the ones who surround the guards.

A fire in the boiler room is extinguished, but not before a boiler fuel supply valve is fused open. Before Chief Engineer Pringle can manually open a steam relief valve, a huge explosion rips through the boiler room and the many decks situated above it, killing him and some of the passengers and trapping Laurie under a steel beam in their state room, in addition to opening a huge hole in the side of the ship.

Containing the Sequel of the Midshipman's Disaster  Major Bagstock, after long and frequent observation of Paul, across Princess's Place, through his double-barrelled opera-glass; and after receiving many minute reports, daily, weekly, and monthly, on that subject, from the native who kept himself in constant communication with Miss Tox's maid for that purpose; came to the conclusion that Dombey, Sir, was a man to be known, and that J. B. was the boy to make his acquaintance.  Miss Tox, however, maintaining her reserved behaviour, and frigidly declining to understand the Major whenever he called (which he often did) on any little fishing excursion connected with this project, the Major, in spite of his constitutional toughness and slyness, was fain to leave the accomplishment of his desire in some measure to chance, 'which,' as he was used to observe with chuckles at his club, 'has been fifty to one in favour of Joey B., Sir, ever since his elder brother died of Yellow Jack in the West Indies.'  It was some time coming to his aid in the present instance, but it befriended him at last. When the dark servant, with full particulars, reported Miss Tox absent on Brighton service, the Major was suddenly touched with affectionate reminiscences of his friend Bill Bitherstone of Bengal, who had written to ask him, if he ever went that way, to bestow a call upon his only son. But when the same dark servant reported Paul at Mrs Pipchin's, and the Major, referring to the letter favoured by Master Bitherstone on his arrival in England--to which he had never had the least idea of paying any attention--saw the opening that presented itself, he was made so rabid by the gout, with which he happened to be then laid up, that he threw a footstool at the dark servant in return for his intelligence, and swore he would be the death of the rascal before he had done with him: which the dark servant was more than half disposed to believe.  1.

He is the eldest son of an ironworker and a home economics teacher. Kaine attended an all-boys Jesuit high school, joining spring mission drives to fund Jesuit activities in Honduras. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Missouri before entering Harvard Law School. Kaine took time off from his law studies to work with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Honduras for nine months in 1980-81, helping Jesuit missionaries who ran a Catholic school in El Progreso. His time there reportedly helped form his support for citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States – a stance likely to attract Latino voters. He also learned to speak fluent Spanish, seen as a possible advantage with Hispanic voters.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Olympic Genome Project Shows What You Share With Medal Hopefuls What do you have in common with Olympic athletes? Maybe you and a future star went to the same college, or maybe a world-class competitor in a little-known sport hails from your hometown. Exposing the connections between everyday fans and Olympians or Olympic hopefuls is the idea behind a Facebook app called the U.S. Olympic Genome Project from summer games sponsor Samsung. If you hit “like” on the app’s landing page, it uses information from your Facebook profile to cross reference facts about you against a database of some 3,000 athletes. Then it shows you who you share the most in common with and why. Ralph Santana, Samsung‘s chief marketing officer in North America, tells Mashable the idea behind the app is to in part bring more attention to athletes who often get overshadowed by media hype. “People don’t necessarily know how they’re connected to Olympic athletes, unlike other sports where people know more about how they’re connected to teams and players by hometown or area,” Santana says. “You lose a little bit of that in the Olympics, when you only hear about the real high-profile athletes being discussed while NBC is kind of curating the event.” The U.S. Olympic Genome Project also comes with a gamification layer to foster extended engagement. After seeing what they have in common with athletes, users can take trivia quizzes and answer questions about themselves to compete in rankings with their Facebook friends and earn tokens that can then be applied toward real-life rewards including discounted Samsung products. So what’s in it for Samsung? Santana says little more than good will, but hopefully some sales driving as well. “It backs into our overarching strategy, which is how do we tap into the cultural face of sports and make Samsung a culturally relevant brand,” he says. Do you think this is a cool idea by Samsung or not? Let us know in the comments.","output":"The U.S. Olympic Genome Project is a Facebook app made by Samsung.

Act 1: The film opens with a brief introduction of the Men in Black organization, which is responsible for working in the shadows to protect Earth from alien threats and maintain a facade of normal life for humans. The story begins with Agent J and Agent K working on a seemingly routine mission, hunting down a dangerous shape-shifting alien known as \\"The Imitator.\\" In the process, they stumble upon cryptic clues leading them to question the true identity of their newly appointed Chief, Zed. Act 2: With growing suspicion, Agent J and Agent K begin a covert investigation into Zed's past. Simultaneously, they must work together to stop an imminent and catastrophic intergalactic war that threatens Earth's existence. As they cultivate trust with one another, they uncover hidden clues that point toward Zed's potential secret - that he is not who he appears to be, and that his intentions may be more ominous than they had anticipated. During their investigation, they also become acquainted with double agents within the MIB organization and a human-alien hybrid who provides them with critical intel about a powerful artifact known as \\"The Omnistone.\\" The Omnistone has the ability to manipulate reality, and the story's antagonist is hell-bent on harnessing its power for their own sinister purposes. Act 3: The climax of the movie sees Agents J and K racing against time to locate the Omnistone before it falls into the wrong hands. Along the way, they must also confront Zed and expose him for who he truly is - the mastermind behind the shadowy organization that has infiltrated MIB at its highest levels.

Zed is revealed to be a double agent working for the mysterious organization, SYZYGY, which sought to use the Men in Black for their own agenda. As Zed is taken into custody, a new Chief is appointed, and the agents continue their duty of protecting Earth from alien threats.

If you have other pets in the house, keep the kitten in its own room (along with litter box, bed, food and water) for a week before introducing him to the other pets. If you have small children, instruct them to be very gentle when they pick up, hold, or play with the kitten to avoid injury to either the kitten or kid.

The hearing was the first for Matthew and Grace Huang since they were released from custody last month on bail. They have been ordered to remain in Doha. The couple deny charges of murdering Gloria, one of three children they adopted from Africa. She died in January. Both the defense and the prosecution presented written and oral arguments to the court Tuesday. In his statement, the prosecutor painted a picture of Grace and Matthew Huang as inhumane people who had been \\"cheaply sold\\" their adopted child. He called for both to be given the death penalty for the girl's death and, in colorful language, suggested that he could visualize her rushing up to the judges' bench, begging for justice. He said the Huangs kept Gloria locked in her room, deprived of food and water, and that a key was found on the outside of the door. The prosecutor argued that both the hospital and forensics reports on her death indicated that she died of starvation and that any witness statements should be discounted by the court. He also cited testimony from one of the girl's brothers, saying the child told prosecutors that their parents used to punish Gloria for stealing food by locking her into her room. Medical records. Defense lawyer Sami Abu Sheikha argued that there is no evidence to indicate the couple had wanted to kill their daughter. Witnesses had seen Gloria eating on the Friday and the Monday before her death in the early hours of Tuesday, January 15, the lawyer said, adding that two days without food would not have been enough for her to starve to death. He also pointed to hospital and forensic reports that showed she died of dehydration and cachexia, a wasting condition. This can result from causes other than starvation, Abu Sheikha said. The reports showed that her pancreas was inflamed, which could mean it wasn't working properly, and there was inflammation of the lungs, he said. The reports also showed that Gloria had ingested food and liquid that was still in her intestines and bladder, he said. The defense lawyer also cited Gloria's siblings as telling the prosecutor she had been playing with them outside her room before she died. Other witnesses had also seen her the day before her death, he said. Abu Sheikha added that photographs showed bottles of water beside the child's bed and that, in any case, her room had a bathroom where she could have drunk the water from the taps if she needed to. He said her medical records showed that she had a history of eating disorders. Defense effort. The judge ordered that the defense be given another chance to rebut the prosecution's arguments in a hearing February 5. The two defendants appeared more relaxed and better rested than in their previous court appearance, when they were still in detention. Grace, who had previously appeared in court with her head covered, was this time dressed in slacks and a blouse with her hair uncovered. No relatives of the Huangs' were in court Tuesday, but a handful of staff members from the U.S. Embassy in Doha were present. The David House Agency, an advocacy group for Americans overseas, has been coordinating the Huangs' defense effort. In August, the agency set up a website that describes the circumstances of their detention. Matthew and Grace Huang moved to Qatar in 2012 with their three adopted children. Matthew, a Stanford-educated engineer, was working on infrastructure projects related to the 2022 World Cup. But everything changed January 15, when he found his daughter dead. The parents were arrested, charged with murder and accused of starving their daughter to death. The David House Agency says Gloria's eating disorder involved starving herself and then bingeing on food. It says this disorder arose from her childhood in Ghana before she was adopted. CNN's Leone Lakhani, Schams Elwazer and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Merleau-Ponty distinguishes between primary and secondary modes of expression. This distinction appears in Phenomenology of Perception (p. 207, 2nd note [Fr. ed.]) and is sometimes repeated in terms of spoken and speaking language (le langage parle et le langage parlant) (The Prose of the World, p. 10). Spoken language (le langage parle), or secondary expression, returns to our linguistic baggage, to the cultural heritage that we have acquired, as well as the brute mass of relationships between signs and significations. Speaking language (le langage parlant), or primary expression, such as it is, is language in the production of a sense, language at the advent of a thought, at the moment where it makes itself an advent of sense.  It is speaking language, that is to say, primary expression, that interests Merleau-Ponty and which keeps his attention through his treatment of the nature of production and the reception of expressions, a subject which also overlaps with an analysis of action, of intentionality, of perception, as well as the links between freedom and external conditions.  The notion of style occupies an important place in \\"Indirect Language and the Voices of Silence\\". In spite of certain similarities with Andre Malraux, Merleau-Ponty distinguishes himself from Malraux in respect to three conceptions of style, the last of which is employed in Malraux's The Voices of Silence. Merleau-Ponty remarks that in this work \\"style\\" is sometimes used by Malraux in a highly subjective sense, understood as a projection of the artist's individuality. Sometimes it is used, on the contrary, in a very metaphysical sense (in Merleau-Ponty's opinion, a mystical sense), in which style is connected with a conception of an \\"uber-artist\\" expressing \\"the Spirit of Painting\\". Finally, it sometimes is reduced to simply designating a categorization of an artistic school or movement. (However, this account of Malraux's notion of style--a key element in his thinking--is open to serious question.)  For Merleau-Ponty, it is these uses of the notion of style that lead Malraux to postulate a cleavage between the objectivity of Italian Renaissance painting and the subjectivity of painting in his own time, a conclusion that Merleau-Ponty disputes. According to Merleau-Ponty, it is important to consider the heart of this problematic, by recognizing that style is first of all a demand owed to the primacy of perception, which also implies taking into consideration the dimensions of historicity and intersubjectivity. (However, Merleau-Ponty's reading of Malraux has been questioned in a recent major study of Malraux's theory of art which argues that Merleau-Ponty seriously misunderstood Malraux.) For Merleau-Ponty, style is born of the interaction between two or more fields of being. Rather than being exclusive to individual human consciousness, consciousness is born of the pre-conscious style of the world, of Nature. Answer this question \\"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects in the article, including: 1. The distinction between primary and secondary modes of expression, which are referred to as spoken and speaking language, is a key concept explored by Merleau-Ponty in his works. Primary expression, or speaking language, is particularly significant as it involves language in the production of a sense and the advent of thought. 2. Merleau-Ponty's analysis of expression also covers various interconnected subjects like action, intentionality, perception, and the relationship between freedom and external conditions. 3. The notion of style, as discussed in \\"Indirect Language and the Voices of Silence,\\" is another intriguing aspect. Merleau-Ponty differentiates his approach from André Malraux's conception of style, which can be seen in three ways: as a projection of the artist's individuality, as part of a metaphysical (or mystical) conception of an \\"über-artist,\\" or as a simple categorization of an artistic movement or school. 4. Merleau-Ponty challenges Malraux's idea of a split between the objectivity of Italian Renaissance painting and the subjectivity of modern painting by emphasizing the importance of considering perception, historicity, and intersubjectivity when analyzing style. 5. Finally, Merleau-Ponty's understanding of style revolves around the interaction between two or more fields of being. He proposes that consciousness arises not only from individual human experiences but also from the pre-conscious style of the world and nature. This perspective has led to some debate as it contrasts with Malraux's views, and some argue that Merleau-Ponty may have misunderstood Malraux's theory of art."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by  Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to  Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies.  Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him.  Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of  Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the  Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case,  Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely.  Question: \\"Who outraged Libyans of al Qaeda?\\" Response: \\"Bin Laden cutting his support\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question. The outraged Libyans of al Qaeda were upset because Bin Laden had to inform them that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave Sudan due to the Sudanese government yielding to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Coming off their road win over the Bengals, the Titans went home for a Week 3 duel with the Houston Texans. In the first quarter, Tennessee trailed early as Houston Texans kicker Kris Brown got a 44-yard field goal. The Titans responded with RB LenDale White getting a 2-yard TD run. Houston drew close as Brown kicked a 24-yard field goal, yet Tennessee answered with QB Kerry Collins completing a 9-yard TD pass to TE Bo Scaife. The Texans replied with RB Steve Slaton getting a 6-yard TD run (with a failed PAT), while the Titans closed out the half with White's 1-yard TD run. In the third quarter, Tennessee increased its lead with kicker Rob Bironas nailing a 44-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Titans closed out the game with CB Cortland Finnegan returning an interception 99 yards for a touchdown. With the win, Tennessee acquired its first 3-0 start since their Super Bowl run of 1999. How many yards longer was Cortland Finnegan's touchdown compared to all the other touchdowns in the game combined?","output":"To figure out the total yards of all the other touchdowns, I will add up the yards mentioned in the description of each touchdown.  Starting with LenDale White's touchdowns: He had a 2-yard TD run and a 1-yard TD run, contributing a total of 2+1=3 yards. Next is the touchdown by QB Kerry Collins and TE Bo Scaife, which was a 9-yard TD pass. So that contributes 9 yards. Finally, Steve Slaton's touchdown was a 6-yard TD run, so that's an additional 6 yards.  When we add all these together, we get a total of 3+9+6=18 yards. Cortland Finnegan's touchdown was a 99-yard interception return.  To find out how much longer this was compared to all other touchdowns combined, we subtract the total yards of the other touchdowns from Finnegan's touchdown.  This calculation is: 99-18=81 yards.  Therefore, Cortland Finnegan's touchdown was 81 yards longer than all the other touchdowns in the game combined."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In his first address since returning to Pakistan from self-exile, former President Pervez Musharraf declared his intention to run for office, saying he defied risks to \\"save\\" the country. Musharraf landed in Karachi on Sunday after more than four years in exile. He faces criminal charges, and the Taliban have vowed to unleash a \\"death squad\\" to assassinate him. However, he said, he does not plan to flee again. \\"I have put my life in danger and have come to Pakistan -- to you to be the savior of this country,\\" he said at the airport. \\"I have come to save Pakistan.\\" He chided people who had doubted that he would return. \\"There were rumors that I would not come -- where are those people now?\\" he asked. \\"I am here. I have returned.\\" At the airport, crowds danced, waved the nation's green flag and chanted Musharraf's name. Some people carried giant posters, plastered with his face. \\"Inshallah (God willing) we will be successful if I have your support,\\" he said. After his statement, he was whisked away to an undisclosed location for safety reasons. Police hovered nearby, guns slung from their shoulders. Complicated return. Musharraf resigned as president of the south Asian nation five years ago and went into exile in London and Dubai. He hopes to reassert his influence and lead his party in May elections. His return comes with complications. Government officials have said he would be arrested as soon as he sets foot in the nation while the Pakistani Taliban have vowed to assassinate him. However, his party says it has taken pre-emptive measures to ward off a potential arrest. \\"Musharraf has been granted bail in advance of his arrival to Pakistan. We have made sure that he is not arrested and his return home will be smooth,\\" said Jawed Siddiqui, a member of the former president's party, All Pakistan Muslim League. His lawyers paid an unknown amount of bail, which means Musharraf will not be arrested for at least 15 days, but must appear in court. Fear of the unknown. Musharraf's return home comes with a lot of uncertainties. As he boarded a flight from Dubai International Airport, Musharraf said he was not nervous, but was concerned about the unknown. His wife, Sehba, had a different answer when asked if she was worried. \\"Who wouldn't be?\\" she said. Last year, he scuttled plans to return home after the military warned him not to. \\"There were indications that they didn't want me to come, and my own colleagues told me not to come,\\" Musharraf said. \\"Therefore, I changed my mind.\\" This time, he said, he will be protected by government security and his private security agents. Musharraf landed in Karachi on a commercial airline. He said in a statement he would be accompanied by 200 expatriates from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. Arrest over Bhutto's killing. In 1999, Musharraf, then chief of Pakistan's army, became its president in a bloodless military coup. He remained in power until resigning five years ago, a period that included the U.S.-led invasion of neighboring Afghanistan. A few months before he left office, Benazir Bhutto -- who was Pakistan's first elected female prime minister -- was killed in a suicide bomb attack as she was wrapping up a campaign rally in Rawalpindi. The attack came months after she survived an assassination attempt in Karachi. Authorities want Musharraf arrested for not doing enough to protect Bhutto's life despite numerous threats. The former military ruler has denied having anything to do with the killing. A jail cell awaits. Last year, Pakistani authorities confiscated his property and froze his bank account. They have accused him of not declaring foreign bank accounts he had in his name. The Sindh province Home Ministry said last year that a jail cell awaited him in Karachi upon his return, . In Pakistan, the provincial Home Ministry, not the federal government, is responsible for such arrests. Musharraf defended his record last year, and said he did much to improve the nation's economy while he was in office. However, he has admitted to making mistakes. Disillusioned Pakistanis. Musharraf's popularity began declining in 2007 after he suspended the nation's Supreme Court chief justice for \\"misuse of authority.\\" The move resulted in protests and accusations that he was attempting to influence the court's ruling on whether he could seek another five-year term. Although the chief justice was reinstated, the damage was done. Pakistanis were also disillusioned with Musharraf's policies that led to shortages of essential food items, power cuts and skyrocketing inflation. However, under his leadership, Pakistan attained respectable economic growth rates and established a generally favorable investment climate. Along with that came a growing middle class, more aggressive news media, and a more assertive judiciary. 'Death squad' threat. Pakistan also disapproved of the way Musharraf carried out his end of the \\"war on terror\\" and used it as a crutch to explain away many of his unpopular moves. After the September 11, 2001, terror attacks against the United States, Musharraf supported the American war on terror and targeted the Taliban. The militants have accused him of pushing an American agenda in Pakistan. An opportune time. Musharraf's return comes at an opportune time. Last week, Pakistan marked the first time a democratically elected government has served a full five-year term in the country's 65-year history. While the ruling Pakistan People Party rode to power on the back of discontent with Musharraf, it had to deal with the same problems that plagued Musharraf: food shortages and power cuts. Five years is often enough time for a populace to forgive and forget. On Sunday, election officials named former chief justice Mir Hazar Khan Khoso as interim prime minister. He will head the caretaker administration through the May elections. It remains to be seen whether Pakistan, now soured by the PPP's reign, will welcome Musharraf back with open arms. Explosives-packed water tanker targets Pakistani military checkpoint; 17 killed. CNN's Leone Lakhani contributed to this report from Karachi. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"The significant elements in this article are numerous, and include the following: 1. Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf returns from self-exile, after living over four years in London and Dubai, with the intention of running for office as the head of his party, the All Pakistan Muslim League, in the May elections. 2. Upon his arrival in Karachi, Musharraf declares that he returned to \\"save\\" Pakistan, despite facing numerous legal challenges and threats to his life, including a death squad from the Taliban. 3. Negative public opinion towards Musharraf started to grow in 2007 due to his policies that led to essential food items' insufficiencies, inflation, and power cuts. Significantly, his decision to suspend the Supreme Court's chief justice for \\"misuse of authority\\" led to widespread protests. 4. Nevertheless, Musharraf's regime saw decent economic growth rates, a burgeoning middle class, vibrant news media, and an assertive judiciary. His policies, however, were often considered as being proxied by American interests, especially after he supported the 'war on terror' following the 9/11 terror attacks, provoking the wrath of the Taliban. 5. Musharraf is linked with the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, the country's first elected female prime minister, for allegedly failing to protect her despite numerous threats. However, he denies any involvement in her killing. 6. Musharraf believes it is an opportune time for his return, given that Pakistan recently marked the first time a democratically elected government served a full term in its 65-year history. Previously, the current ruling party, the Pakistan People's Party, capitalized on public discontent towards Musharraf, yet then faced similar problems around food shortages and power cuts. 7. Lastly, the election officials declared former chief justice Mir Hazar Khan Khoso as the interim prime minister, who would lead the administration through the May elections.

Movie title: Tron: Legacy Context: 1989: Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges), now CEO of ENCOM, tells his seven year-old son, Sam (Owen Best), about his adventures in the Grid, a completely digital world within the Tron computer system that Flynn created. Flynn explains to Sam that, with his counterpart Clu (Jeff Bridges, body performance; John Reardon) - the second of a Codified Likeness Utility modeled after Flynn - and the security program Tron (Bruce Boxleitner), he discovered something amazing within the Grid; a miracle. Sam asks what it is but Flynn holds the story for next time before putting Sam to bed and going to work. A series of newspaper articles and television reports follow announcing the mysterious disappearance of Kevin Flynn after that night. Since the passing of Sam's mother (Amy Esterle) several years prior, Flynn's absence leaves him effectively orphaned and puts ENCOM's future in a state of jeopardy. Sam is left to stay with his paternal grandparents (Donnelly Rhodes and Belinda Montgomery), questioning the nature of his father's disappearance.20 years later, Sam (Garrett Hedlund) rides his motorcycle through the night streets towards ENCOM tower. He hacks into the building and evades security cameras as he makes his way upstairs. Meanwhile, a board meeting is being held where Richard Mackey (Jeffrey Nordling) presents the new OS-12, a secure operating system. When Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) inquires about improvements to the system, given the high prices already charged, young Edward Dillinger II (Cillian Murphy: uncredited) says that the idea of sharing software for free disappeared with Kevin Flynn. Sam breaks into the control room and swaps out the OS-12 master file so that when Mackey attempts to run it, all he sees is a repetitive video of Sam's dog Marv (a Boston terrier).

Here is a question about this article: A watt balance is an instrument for comparing two powers, one of which is measured in SI watts and the other of which is measured in conventional electrical units. From the definition of the conventional watt W90, this gives a measure of the product KJ2RK in SI units, where RK is the von Klitzing constant which appears in the quantum Hall effect. If the theoretical treatments of the Josephson effect and the quantum Hall effect are valid, and in particular assuming that RK = h/e2, the measurement of KJ2RK is a direct determination of the Planck constant. What is the answer to this question: If the effects are valid, for RK = n/e2, what is the measurement of KJ2RK equal to?","output":"Well kiddo, think of the watt balance like a very special kind of balance scale, but instead of comparing the weight of apples and oranges, it's comparing different types of power. Now, in this case, if the effects the article talks about are valid and working , and we say that RK (which is a very important constant used in doing these comparisons) equals n (a number) divided by e2 (which is another very important constant), then the measurement of KJ2RK would be a direct determination of what we call the Planck constant. What's the Planck constant? Well, imagine if everything tiny like atoms and particles were dancing to music. The Planck constant would be kind of like the beat they all dance to. It's a super important number in the world of very small things, or what scientists call quantum mechanics.

His gas gauge seemed to stay full, not going down at all, which he chucked up to his car's great fuel efficiency. However, unknown to Tom, this was a clear indication of a problem with his gas gauge, but he didn't realize that something was wrong. As Tom continued to drive, his car eventually broke down, leaving him stranded in the middle of the road. After getting assistance to move his vehicle to a safe location, he investigated the issue and discovered that his car had run out of gas. Tom was confused and surprised, as his gas needle always showed his fuel tank as full, even though he had traveled a considerable distance. Determined to solve this issue, Tom refilled his fuel tank to see if the gas needle would respond accordingly. To his dismay, it still showed a full tank, signaling a malfunction with his gas gauge. Tom sought the help of a mechanic to figure out the cause of this problem. After a thorough inspection, the mechanic found that a blown fuse had caused Tom's gas gauge to malfunction, and he informed Tom that it was a relatively common issue in vehicles.  Once the blown fuse was replaced, Tom's gas gauge began functioning correctly, accurately displaying the fuel levels in his tank.

He assembles a team consisting of a corrupt cop (Ted de Corsia), a betting window teller (Elisha Cook Jr.) to gain access to the backroom, a sharpshooter (Timothy Carey) to shoot the favorite horse during the race to distract the crowd, a wrestler (Kola Kwariani) to provide another distraction by provoking a fight at the track bar, and a track bartender (Joe Sawyer). George Peatty, the teller, tells his wife Sherry (Marie Windsor) about the impending robbery. Sherry is bitter at George for not delivering on the promises of wealth he once made her, so George hopes telling her about the robbery will placate and impress her. Sherry does not believe him at first but, after learning that the robbery is real, enlists her lover Val Cannon (Vince Edwards) to steal the money from George and his associates. The heist is successful, although the sharpshooter is shot and killed by the police. The conspirators gather at the apartment where they are to meet Johnny and divide the money. Before Johnny arrives, Val appears and holds them up. A shootout ensues and a badly wounded George is the sole survivor. He goes home and shoots Sherry before dying. Johnny, on his way to the apartment, sees George staggering in the street and knows that something is wrong. He buys the biggest suitcase he can find to put the money in (and struggles to lock it properly). At the airport Johnny and Fay aren't allowed to take the suitcase along as hand luggage because of its size, and instead must check it in as regular luggage. Johnny reluctantly complies. While waiting to board their plane they watch as the suitcase falls off a cart onto the runway, breaks open, and the loose banknotes are swept away by the backdraft from the plane's propellers. Fay and Johnny leave the airport but are unable to hail a cab before officers...","output":"George Peatty holds the position of a betting window teller at the racetrack."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Because the AVSDU was not working, Greeneville's executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Gerald K. Pfeifer, entered the sonar room and observed the contacts on the sonar screens.  Pfeifer then stood in the doorway between the sonar and control rooms, but did not communicate any updated sonar information to Waddle in the control room.  At 13:34, sonar gained a new contact, designated S-14.  Because Greeneville had not maintained a steady, slow course for a sufficient amount of time, the sonar data available to the Fire Control Technician of the Watch did not allow  accurate determination on Ehime Maru's range or course.  Also, due to time constraints placed by Waddle, the ship did not perform normal maneuvers which would be used to obtain accurate course and range information on the sonar contacts prior to proceeding to periscope depth.At 13:38, Greeneville reached periscope depth (about 60 feet (18 m) below the surface).  At this time, Ehime Maru was about 2,315 yards (2.117 km) or 1.14 nautical miles (2.1 km) away from the submarine and heading in her direction.  Although sonar data began to more accurately depict Ehime Maru's true range and bearing at this point, this was not evident to the sonar operators.  Lieutenant, Junior Grade Michael J. Coen, the officer of the deck, conducted an initial low  magnification periscope search of the area and sighted no nearby ships.   Waddle then took the periscope before Coen could complete the normal high magnification search.

Read this: The elimination of wolves from Yellowstone National Park had profound impacts on the trophic pyramid. Without predation, herbivores began to over-graze many woody browse species, affecting the area's plant populations. In addition, wolves often kept animals from grazing in riparian areas, which protected beavers from having their food sources encroached upon. The removal of wolves had a direct effect on beaver populations, as their habitat became territory for grazing. Furthermore, predation keeps hydrological features such as creeks and streams in normal working order. Increased browsing on willows and conifers along Blacktail Creek due to a lack of predation caused channel incision because they helped slow the water down and hold the soil in place. What natural features work better when herbivores are present? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"The question asks about the natural features that work better when herbivores are present. Herbivores play an essential role in maintaining the balance and health of ecosystems. When herbivores are present, several natural features work better, including: 1. Plant diversity: Herbivores help maintain plant diversity by consuming dominant plant species, which gives less competitive plant species a chance to grow. This promotes a rich and diverse plant community.  2. Nutrient cycling: By feeding on plants, herbivores consume nutrients and return them to the soil in the form of waste. This process enhances nutrient cycling, leading to increased plant growth and overall ecosystem productivity. 3. Seed dispersal: Some herbivores contribute to seed dispersal by consuming fruits and seeds, which are later excreted at different locations. This spread of seeds promotes the regrowth and expansion of various plant species. 4. Predator-prey balance: Herbivores serve as a food source for predators, such as wolves or large birds of prey. The presence of herbivores ensures food availability for predators, thereby maintaining a stable predator-prey balance in the ecosystem. 5. Habitat creation and maintenance: Herbivores can create and maintain habitats for other organisms by generating disturbances when grazing or browsing. This activity can lead to the creation of open spaces, which allows sunlight to penetrate and support the growth of different plant species. Additionally, these disturbances can foster the development of diverse habitats that can support a wide array of species. 6. Facilitating symbiotic relationships: Herbivores can play a part in promoting symbiotic relationships, such as the ones between plants and pollinators. By consuming plants, herbivores can create an environment that encourages the growth of flowering plants, which attract pollinators. In summary, the presence of herbivores in an ecosystem leads to various natural features functioning at their best, including plant diversity, nutrient cycling, seed dispersal, predator-prey balance, habitat creation and maintenance, and facilitating symbiotic relationships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The dead, who once lived in the town, inexplicably return to life with an overwhelming desire to cast their votes in the election. As the living residents grapple with this shocking revelation, they must decide whether to give the returning dead their chance to vote or deny them the opportunity and risk an unimaginable supernatural uproar. Act I: The movie opens in the picturesque town of Willowbrook, where the residents are divided over their political views. Tensions run high, with friendships strained and families torn apart. With just a few weeks left before the election, the town is plastered with campaign posters and signs advocating for the two leading candidates.  On a quiet autumn evening, a grieving mother, Linda, visits the local cemetery to pay respect to her late teenage daughter, Sara, who passed away a year ago. As she leaves the cemetery, she witnesses the unthinkable: the dead rising from their graves. Act II: At first, the townspeople are terrified by the return of the dead, but soon they discover that the deceased only have one intention - to cast their votes in the election. The returning dead include influential figures from the town's history, some dating back several generations, as well as loved ones of the living residents. As word spreads about their singular mission, both political sides try to woo the newly reanimated voters. The town's administration, led by Mayor Simmons, is initially opposed to allowing the dead to vote, chaotically devising strategies and attempting to cover up the supernatural phenomena. However, Linda, along with her newfound friend - the local journalist David, decides to help the returning dead exercise their right to vote. Act III: With Linda and David's support, the issue of the dead's voting rights gains momentum. Together, they build a coalition of both living and dead citizens to pressure the Mayor and the oppositional forces to change the election rules and allow the deceased to cast their absentee ballots. The movie's climax occurs when the opposition, in a desperate attempt to suppress the rising supernatural vote, resorts to violence against Linda, David, and their supporters. In response, the ghostly citizens use their powers to intimidate and thwart the actions of the opposition. In the end, understanding the significance of democracy and the potential risks of denying the returning dead their right to participate, the election authorities accept the deceased's votes, and the town is brought together by this unexpected but unifying cause. The movie concludes with the returning dead fading back into the afterlife, having fulfilled their purpose. The experience leaves the town forever changed: a newfound respect for democracy, unity, and appreciation for life and voting rights."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Corrina, Corrina is a 1994 American feature film set in 1959 about a widower (Ray Liotta) who hires a housekeeper/nanny (Whoopi Goldberg) to care for his daughter (Tina Majorino). It was written and directed by Jessie Nelson, in her feature film directing debut. It was the final film in which Don Ameche starred; he died shortly after filming was completed. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Corrina, Corrina was set in an odd-numbered year.\\"?","output":"Yes, based on the information provided in the paragraph above, we can conclude that \\"Corrina, Corrina\\" was set in an odd-numbered year. The paragraph states that the film is set in the year 1959, which is an odd-numbered year. The year 1959 is odd because it cannot be evenly divided by 2, resulting in a remainder when divided (1959 ÷ 2 = 979.5). In contrast, even-numbered years are divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder. The film's setting is important to its storyline and the era in which the characters' lives unfold. Set in 1959, it presents a picture of the social and cultural norms of that time, which contribute to the film's narrative and create context for the audience to better understand and relate to the characters' experiences. The plot revolves around the protagonist, Ray Liotta, who plays a widower seeking a housekeeper and nanny to care for his daughter. This leads to Whoopi Goldberg's character, Corrina, entering their lives. Being set in the late 1950s, the social dynamics of the time are significant, as interracial relationships were less accepted and may have caused tension between characters and within their broader community. This adds depth to the story, making it more than simply the development of a personal bond between the characters. In summary, based on the information in the paragraph, we can indeed conclude that \\"Corrina, Corrina\\" was set in an odd-numbered year, specifically 1959. This setting shapes the storyline and provides a lens through which the audience can view and understand the characters' lives, relationships, and challenges they face in that era."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How is \\"We don't have a conventional bomb that'll penetrate that.\\"\\" said in Czech?","output":"In Czech, the phrase \\"We don't have a conventional bomb that'll penetrate that.\\" can be translated as: \\"Nemáme konvenční bombu, která by to prorazila.\\" Here's a detailed breakdown of the translation: - Nemáme (We don't have): \\"Ne-\\" is a prefix used for negation, and \\"máme\\" is the first person plural form of \\"mít\\" (to have). Together, they form \\"Nemáme,\\" meaning \\"We don't have.\\" - konvenční (conventional): This adjective stays the same in Czech as it is derived from similar roots. It means \\"conventional\\" or \\"regular,\\" referring to the type of bomb. - bombu (bomb): This word is the accusative form of the noun \\"bomba\\" (bomb), which is the same in both English and Czech. The accusative form \\"bombu\\" is used because it is the direct object of the verb \\"mít\\" (to have). - která by (that'll): \\"Která\\" is the feminine form of the relative pronoun \\"který\\" (which, that), and \\"by\\" is a conditional auxiliary verb that can be translated as \\"would\\" or \\"will\\" in English. Together, they mean \\"that'll\\" or \\"which would.\\" - to (that): This pronoun is translated as \\"to\\" in Czech and refers to the object, barrier, or structure that the bomb should penetrate. - prorazila (penetrate): This verb comes from \\"prorazit\\" (to penetrate), and \\"prorazila\\" is the past feminine form of the verb. This form corresponds to the gender of the word \\"bomba\\" (bomb), which is feminine in Czech. Putting all of these words together, we get the Czech translation: \\"Nemáme konvenční bombu, která by to prorazila.\\" This sentence has the same meaning and context as the original English phrase."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Because dizygotic twins develop from two eggs fertilized by two sperm, they are no more identical than siblings born at different times. Much less commonly, a zygote can divide into two separate offspring during early development. This results in the birth of monozygotic (or identical) twins. Although the zygote can split as early as the two-cell stage, splitting occurs most commonly during the early blastocyst stage, with roughly 70–100 cells present. These two scenarios are distinct from each other, in that the twin embryos that separated at the two-cell stage will have individual placentas, whereas twin embryos that form from separation at the blastocyst stage will share a placenta and a chorionic cavity.

He has three brothers: Billy (b. Vasilios), Tolis (b. Apostolos, 1975) and Nikos (b. Nikolaos, 1991). The family was poor, and Rouvas began taking care of his brothers at age five. At age four, he exhibited athletic ability and took ballet classes as a child. After moving to Patras, Rouvas continued to look for performance opportunities until he met Dakis (a popular Greek artist who was the first person to help him professionally). Rouvas moved to Athens, and made his first professional appearance in 1991 at the Show Centre. His showmanship attracted the attention of music executives such as Nikos Mouratidis, who encouraged songwriter Giorgos Pavrianos to produce him. Rouvas, singing Michael Jackson's \\"Man in the Mirror\\" was discovered by PolyGram executives who signed him to his first recording contract. After moving to Athens he lived with an older English woman named Sally, with whom he had begun a relationship on Corfu. Their relationship ended when Psinakis became Rouvas' manager, and the singer became more career-oriented. The media has speculated about Rouvas' personal life and relationships with model Zeta Logotheti, Sofi Kantarou (a Corfu bar manager) and singer Elli Kokkinou. Several months later he debuted at the Thessaloniki Song Festival, losing Best Vocal Performance to Giorgos Alkaios but singing the Best Composition (\\"Par'ta\\"; \\"Take Them\\", with music by Nikos Terzis and lyrics by Giorgos Pavrianos). There was a brief earthquake during the festival.  Rouvas released his eponymous debut album, which topped the Greek Albums Chart, the day after the festival. \\"Par'ta\\" became a radio hit, and other songs of the album such as \\"1992\\", \\"Ego S'agapo\\" (\\"I Love You\\") and \\"Gia Fantasou\\" (\\"Imagine\\") also became popular.

The album's success helped establish Rouvas at the top of the Greek music scene.  In October 1993 Rouvas released his third album, Gia Sena (For You), with music by Alexis Papadimitriou and lyrics by Eleni Giannatsoulia and Evi Droutsa. The single \\"Kane Me\\" (\\"Make Me\\") became a radio hit, with \\"To Xero Eisai Moni\\" (\\"I Know You Are Alone\\") and \\"Xehase To\\" (\\"Forget It\\") also receiving airplay.

George Lucas created the character in homage to the action heroes of 1930s film serials. The character first appeared in the 1981 film \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\", to be followed by \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\" in 1984, \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\" in 1989, \\"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\\" from 1992 to 1996, and \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" in 2008. The character is also featured in novels, comics, video games, and other media. Jones is also featured in the Disney theme park attraction, Indiana Jones Adventure at Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea, as well as the Disneyland Paris attraction Indiana Jones et le Temple du Péril.  - Arizona (O'odham: \\"Al onak\\" [ai onak]) is a state in the southwestern region of the United States. It is also part of the Western United States and the Mountain West states. It is the sixth largest and the 14th most populous of the 50 states. Its capital and largest city is Phoenix. Arizona is one of the Four Corners states. It has borders with New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, California, and Mexico, and one point in common with the southwestern corner of Colorado. Arizona's border with Mexico is 389 miles (626 km) long, on the northern border of the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County. Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over .  - Nevada (Spanish for \\"snowy\\"; see pronunciations) is a state in the Western, Mountain West, and Southwestern regions of the United States of America. Nevada is the 7th most extensive, the 34th most populous, and the 9th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \\"Silver State\\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \\"Battle Born State\\", because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words \\"Battle Born\\" also appear on the state flag); as the \\"Sage-brush State\\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \\"Sage-hen State\\". Nevada borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast and Utah to the east.  - William Erwin \\"Will\\" Eisner (March 6, 1917  January 3, 2005) was an American cartoonist, writer, and entrepreneur. He was one of the earliest cartoonists to work in the American comic book industry, and his series \\"The Spirit\\" (19401952) was noted for its experiments in content and form. In 1978, he popularized the term \\"graphic novel\\" with the publication of his book \\"A Contract with God\\". He was an early contributor to formal comics studies with his book \\"Comics and Sequential Art\\" (1985). The Eisner Award was named in his honor, and is given to recognize achievements each year in the comics medium; he was one of the three inaugural inductees to the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame.  - A video game developer is a software developer that specializes in video game development  the process and related disciplines of creating video games. A game developer can range from one person who undertakes all tasks to a large business with employee responsibilities split between individual disciplines, such as programming, design, art, testing, etc. Most game development companies have video game publisher financial and usually marketing support. Self-funded developers are known as independent or indie developers and usually make indie games.  - A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - A gag cartoon (a.k.a. panel cartoon or gag panel) is most often a single-panel cartoon, usually including a caption beneath the drawing. A pantomime cartoon carries no caption. In some cases, dialogue may appear in speech balloons, following the common convention of comic strips.  - A graphic novel is a book made up of comics content. Although the word \\"novel\\" normally refers to long fictional works, the term \\"graphic novel\\" is applied broadly and includes fiction, non-fiction, and anthologized work. It is distinguished from the term \\"comic book\\", which is used for comics periodicals.  - An animator is an artist who creates multiple images, known as frames, which give an illusion of movement called animation when displayed in rapid sequence. Animators can work in a variety of fields including film, television, and video games. Animation is closely related to filmmaking and like filmmaking is extremely labor-intensive, which means that most significant works require the collaboration of several animators. The methods of creating the images or frames for an animation piece depends on the animators' artistic styles and their field.  - The Walt Disney Company, commonly known as Disney, is an American diversified multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. It is the world's second largest media conglomerate in terms of revenue, after Comcast. Disney was founded on October 16, 1923, by brothers Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, and established itself as a leader in the American animation industry before diversifying into live-action film production, television, and theme parks. The company also operated under the names The Walt Disney Studio, then Walt Disney Productions. Taking on its current name in 1986, it expanded its existing operations and also started divisions focused upon theater, radio, music, publishing, and online media.  - Graphic design is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the use of typography, photography and illustration. The field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term \\"graphic design\\" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use typography, visual arts and page layout techniques to create visual compositions. Common uses of graphic design include corporate design (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), wayfinding or environmental design, advertising, web design, communication design, product packaging and signage.  - Filmmaking (or in an academic context, film production) is the process of making a film. Filmmaking involves a number of discrete stages including an initial story, idea, or commission, through screenwriting, casting, shooting, sound recording and reproduction, editing, and screening the finished product before an audience that may result in a film release and exhibition. Filmmaking takes place in many places around the world in a range of economic, social, and political contexts, and using a variety of technologies and cinematic techniques. Typically, it involves a large number of people, and can take from a few months to several years to complete.  - For the director , see Steve Purcell ( director ) .

Select the topic that this about: The White House releases new records relating to a row over President Bush's military service.","output":"The White House has recently released new records relating to a contentious issue involving President George W. Bush's military service. The issue comes from allegations that surfaced during his time in office, suggesting that President Bush may have benefited from special treatment or avoided certain obligations during his tenure in the Texas Air National Guard in the 1960s and 1970s. The controversy surrounding President Bush's military service has been a politically divisive topic for many years, with critics arguing that his connections and family influence allowed him to avoid serving in the Vietnam War. They believe that these new records may provide further insights or evidence, either supporting or refuting the claims made against President Bush. According to the documents released by the White House, President Bush enlisted in the Texas Air National Guard in 1968 and served until 1974, eventually attaining the rank of first lieutenant. The newly released records include payroll documents, medical records, and personal evaluations, shedding more light on President Bush's time in the National Guard. Several key points have been highlighted from these records: 1. The documents indicate that President Bush fulfilled the necessary training requirements and showed satisfactory performance during his time in the National Guard. They demonstrate that he was present for required weekend drills and annual training, despite claims that he had failed to meet these obligations. 2. The records also include a letter from Colonel Jerry B. Killian, commending President Bush for his service and expressing confidence in his abilities as a pilot. This challenges the allegations that Colonel Killian had previously criticized Bush's performance in the National Guard. 3. The medical records confirm that President Bush was grounded in 1972 for failing to complete a flight physical examination. However, they do not provide any indication that there was an ulterior motive for this grounding or that it was an attempt to avoid responsibilities. 4. The payroll documents released show that President Bush was paid for his service in the National Guard during the questioned period, further supporting the claim that he was present and fulfilled his duties. Critics of President Bush, however, remain unconvinced by these records, suggesting that they may have been selectively released or do not provide a comprehensive account of the former president's military service. They argue that questions still remain over Bush's failure to complete his flight physical examination, as well as his transfer to an Alabama National Guard unit while he was working on a political campaign, which some view as evidence of special treatment. The release of these new records relating to President Bush's military service has re-ignited the debate over his time in the Texas Air National Guard. While the documents provide additional information and seemingly support the claim that he met his obligations, critics maintain that the records do not definitively put the issue to rest. As such, the controversy surrounding the 43rd President of the United States' military service record is likely to continue for some time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Many complaints. ||||| Jack Dorsey.      The concept of the “shadowban” has existed practically since the inception of the web forum. The idea is simple: Instead of banning a user outright and informing them of such punishment, a shadowban makes a user’s post visible only to themselves. In other words, they think that they’re still part of a community, but nobody is able to see or interact with them. The shadowban is useful in that rather than someone immediately being locked out and possibly retaliating by, for example, making a new account, the user fades away gradually due to the lack of interaction from other users.      As forums have evolved into social-media platforms, the shadowban and its descendants have come along with them. Facebook argued that the best way to dispel misinformation from places like Infowars, which argues that the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting was a staged hoax, was to secretly minimize their distribution in the site’s News Feed — a similar but not identical tactic. I myself have previously argued — tongue in cheek — that Twitter should shadowban (or “hellban”) President Donald Trump, who most recently threatened a cataclysmic war against Iran — the idea being that he gets the feeling of communicating with his followers while his actual posts are hidden from the (volatile) world.      More than anywhere else, though, the shadowban has persisted among the conspiracy-minded, as a great weapon of censorship, generally thought to be perpetrated by liberal Silicon Valley operatives at the expense of conservatives. That right-wing voices are being “shadow banned” by Twitter and Facebook has become all but an article of faith among internet-native conservative activists and publishers — despite little evidence to support the claim.      It’s no surprise, then, that a Vice News article claiming that Twitter is “shadow banning” Republicans has already taken hold in the minds of the most online right-wingers. At issue, though, is not “banning” but Twitter’s search mechanism. Usually, Twitter will automatically complete a search query and suggest an account when a user begins typing in Twitter’s search bar. If you type in “Donald,” for example, Trump’s account is displayed as an easily accessible hyperlink, so that you don’t have to click through to the results page; if you type in “Hillary,” you’ll get a similar autocomplete suggestion of Hillary Clinton.      And what happens if you type in, as one so often does, “Andrew Surabian,” Donald Trump Jr.’s spokesperson and, in Vice’s words, a “prominent Republican”? According to Vice, Surabian and other “prominent Republicans” — like Republican Party chair Ronna McDaniel and a number of GOP lawmakers — are not being automatically suggested when you type in their names. All of these accounts, importantly, are still shown atop the actual search results page. The only problem is that you have to click through to it, instead of being given an easy autocomplete link. (Vice’s report is essentially a more partisan-focused repackaging of an article published by Gizmodo on Sunday, which covered how alt-right figures like Richard Spencer and Jason Kessler were also not appearing in auto-populated fields on Twitter. In some instances, parody accounts were featured in their stead.)      To start with, and to state the most obvious, this sort of moderation isn’t shadow banning. Users following the affected accounts will still see their tweets; those accounts still appear in search (just not in the search-bar auto-population). “Shadow banning,” as generally imagined and described by the activists who claim they’ve been affected, would actively suppress user content even to followers, not just make accounts one click more difficult to find.      Which is why, to the extent that this is even a problem, it’s pretty easy to come up with an alternate explanation: This is a side effect of a minimal measure designed to make sure that people aren’t preemptively encouraged to consume bad information from dubious sources. In May, Twitter announced that it would do what it could to ensure “people contributing to the healthy conversation will be more visible in conversations and search”; it seems eminently likely that an algorithmic strategy to make trolls and extremists less visible on the platform semi-accidentally ensnared some Republicans. (And can you blame it?) As HuffPost’s Ashley Feinberg pointed out on Twitter, well-known left-wing podcast hosts—surely, in the grand scheme of things, around the same level of “prominence” as Don Jr.’s spokesperson—are suffering from the same “problem” of being marginally more difficult to be searched out.      Vice quotes a Twitter spokesperson saying that the company is “shipping a change,” but that the “technology is based on account *behavior* not the content of Tweets.” New York Law School professor Ari Ezra Waldman told Vice that, “This isn’t evidence of a pattern of anti-conservative bias, since some Republicans still appear and some don’t. This just appears to be a cluster of conservatives who have been affected.” He added, “If anything, it appears that Twitter’s technology for minimizing accounts instead of banning them just isn’t very good.”      That’s a more likely scenario than a cabal of secretive Twitter employees trying to suppress the speech of … Donald Trump Jr.’s spokesperson. Is it bad? Sure, the way a hangnail is bad. But it’s not censorship, and it’s certainly not “shadow-banning.”      It’s well-established that right-wing media and personalities hew further to the right, and are consequently more likely than their left-wing counterparts to interact with fringe accounts (the kind of signal that would indicate to Twitter’s algorithm that an account is a troll or harasser), if not actually spread falsehoods and sensationalized outrage. But in framing this issue as the “Republicans being treated differently than Democrats” instead of “minimizing falsehoods and bad faith,” Vice has given conservatives even more ammo with which to claim oppression.      The notion that social media companies would suppress certain political points of view should concern every American. Twitter owes the public answers to what’s really going on. https://t.co/i9UtbxJrt0 — Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) July 25, 2018      Vice’s story feels an awful lot like one reported two years ago by Gizmodo, which claimed that Facebook was “suppressing conservatives.” In reality, Facebook’s editors were making the editorial judgment call that manufactured, misleading, and hyperpartisan stories from conservative outlets — such as ones about Benghazi, in 2016 — were less relevant to Facebook’s users than breaking stories from mainstream outlets. Similarly, Twitter’s new system seems less about suppressing conservative viewpoints and more about minimizing controversial figures whose primary tactic is to stoke outrage through heavy slant or outright distortion. ||||| Presented with screenshots of the searches, a Twitter spokesperson told VICE News: “We are aware that some accounts are not automatically populating in our search box and shipping a change to address this.” Asked why only conservative Republicans appear to be affected and not liberal Democrats, the spokesperson wrote: “I'd emphasize that our technology is based on account *behavior* not the content of Tweets.”      “The notion that social media companies would suppress certain political points of view should concern every American,” McDaniel told VICE News in a statement. “Twitter owes the public answers to what’s really going on.”      Democrats are not being “shadow banned” in the same way, according to a VICE News review. McDaniel’s counterpart, Democratic Party chair Tom Perez, and liberal members of Congress — including Reps. Maxine Waters, Joe Kennedy III, Keith Ellison, and Mark Pocan — all continue to appear in drop-down search results. Not a single member of the 78-person Progressive Caucus faces the same situation in Twitter’s search.      The Republican Party chair Ronna McDaniel, several conservative Republican congressmen, and Donald Trump Jr.’s spokesman no longer appear in the auto-populated drop-down search box on Twitter, VICE News has learned. It’s a shift that diminishes their reach on the platform — and it's the same one being deployed against prominent racists to limit their visibility. The profiles continue to appear when conducting a full search, but not in the more convenient and visible drop-down bar. (The accounts appear to also populate if you already follow the person.)

Twitter’s troll hunt, however, has ensnared some of the most prominent Republicans in the country. Type in the names of McDaniel, conservative members of Congress like Reps. Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan, and Matt Gaetz, and Trump Jr.’s spokesman Andrew Surabian, for example, and Twitter’s drop-down search bar does not show their profiles. The search menu also does not display the verified profile of Rep. Devin Nunes of California, only his unverified one that he seldom uses to post.      That limits their visibility and the ease of finding their profiles compared to their liberal counterparts.      The company’s drop-down search bar has also been excluding several prominent racist figures on the alt-right, such as Jason Kessler, who organized last year’s white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The platform has also demoted a smattering of far-right figures like Mike Cernovich, as Gizmodo reported earlier this week.      But the rationale determining which accounts auto-populate in search results and which don’t is unclear. InfoWars and its leader Alex Jones have not been demoted despite often spreading false news and right-wing conspiracy theories, for example. Republican Rep. Steve King — who has tweeted that immigration should be limited because “we can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies” — also appears to be unaffected by this change to the company’s search function. He retweeted a self-proclaimed “Nazi sympathizer” last month and declined to take it down when notified of the person’s history.      “This isn’t evidence of a pattern of anti-conservative bias since some Republicans still appear and some don’t. This just appears to be a cluster of conservatives who have been affected,” said New York Law School Professor Ari Ezra Waldman, who testified at the House Judiciary Committee’s April hearing on social media filtering and is the author of Privacy as Trust: Information Privacy for an Information Age. “If anything, it appears that Twitter’s technology for minimizing accounts instead of banning them just isn’t very good.”      Even if the shadow banning is more of a bug than a feature, the demotion of these prominent Republicans could be a political liability for the social media company.      Conservatives in and out of Congress have been claiming for months — with varying amounts of evidence — that Big Tech companies are censoring voices on the right. The Republican-led House Judiciary Committee convened not one but two hearings on the subject in recent months, including one with pro-Trump social media stars Diamond and Silk, who argued that Facebook had been intentionally diminishing the reach of their content. The second hearing went down just last week where representatives from Twitter, Google, and Facebook were subjected to grilling by conservatives.      “It is curious that these allegations would arise the week following Congressman Gaetz’s heated exchange with Twitter senior executives before the House Judiciary Committee,” a spokesman for Gaetz told VICE News.      The allegations of bias haven’t been limited to Congress either. McDaniel and President Donald Trump’s 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale wrote a letter to Facebook and Twitter in June asking for the companies to conduct public reviews of potential bias against conservative content on the platform.      “We are alarmed by numerous allegations that Facebook has blocked content from conservative journalists and groups, and Twitter has hidden such content from conservative users’ followers,” they wrote. An RNC spokesperson told VICE News that Twitter has yet to respond to McDaniel but that Facebook reached out to set up a meeting.      Democrats, for their part, have largely rolled their eyes at conservative claims of discrimination. At Diamond and Silk's hearing in April, the committee’s top-ranking Democrat Jerrold Nadler called the idea of Big Tech censorship of conservatives a “hoax” and a “tired narrative of imagined victimhood” that was eclipsing other priorities like election security and online privacy.      But Facebook and Twitter have appeared to take the conservative criticism seriously and have arranged a series of meetings and public reviews aimed to build up trust with influential figures on the right. Despite some evidence that Diamond and Silk were exaggerating their claims, Facebook publicly apologized to the duo in front of Congress last week.      And Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey convened a D.C. dinner on June 19 with prominent conservatives including White House advisor Mercedes Schlapp, Fox News commentator Guy Benson, and tax activist Grover Norquist, as the Washington Post first reported.

Twitter’s troll hunt, however, has ensnared some of the most prominent Republicans in the country. Type in the names of McDaniel, conservative members of Congress like Reps. Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan, and Matt Gaetz, and Trump Jr.’s spokesman Andrew Surabian, for example, and Twitter’s drop-down search bar does not show their profiles. The search menu also does not display the verified profile of Rep. Devin Nunes of California, only his unverified one that he seldom uses to post.      That limits their visibility and the ease of finding their profiles compared to their liberal counterparts.      The company’s drop-down search bar has also been excluding several prominent racist figures on the alt-right, such as Jason Kessler, who organized last year’s white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The platform has also demoted a smattering of far-right figures like Mike Cernovich, as Gizmodo reported earlier this week.      But the rationale determining which accounts auto-populate in search results and which don’t is unclear. InfoWars and its leader Alex Jones have not been demoted despite often spreading false news and right-wing conspiracy theories, for example. Republican Rep. Steve King — who has tweeted that immigration should be limited because “we can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies” — also appears to be unaffected by this change to the company’s search function. He retweeted a self-proclaimed “Nazi sympathizer” last month and declined to take it down when notified of the person’s history.      “This isn’t evidence of a pattern of anti-conservative bias since some Republicans still appear and some don’t. This just appears to be a cluster of conservatives who have been affected,” said New York Law School Professor Ari Ezra Waldman, who testified at the House Judiciary Committee’s April hearing on social media filtering and is the author of Privacy as Trust: Information Privacy for an Information Age. “If anything, it appears that Twitter’s technology for minimizing accounts instead of banning them just isn’t very good.”      Even if the shadow banning is more of a bug than a feature, the demotion of these prominent Republicans could be a political liability for the social media company.      Conservatives in and out of Congress have been claiming for months — with varying amounts of evidence — that Big Tech companies are censoring voices on the right. The Republican-led House Judiciary Committee convened not one but two hearings on the subject in recent months, including one with pro-Trump social media stars Diamond and Silk, who argued that Facebook had been intentionally diminishing the reach of their content. The second hearing went down just last week where representatives from Twitter, Google, and Facebook were subjected to grilling by conservatives.      “It is curious that these allegations would arise the week following Congressman Gaetz’s heated exchange with Twitter senior executives before the House Judiciary Committee,” a spokesman for Gaetz told VICE News.      The allegations of bias haven’t been limited to Congress either. McDaniel and President Donald Trump’s 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale wrote a letter to Facebook and Twitter in June asking for the companies to conduct public reviews of potential bias against conservative content on the platform.      “We are alarmed by numerous allegations that Facebook has blocked content from conservative journalists and groups, and Twitter has hidden such content from conservative users’ followers,” they wrote. An RNC spokesperson told VICE News that Twitter has yet to respond to McDaniel but that Facebook reached out to set up a meeting.      Democrats, for their part, have largely rolled their eyes at conservative claims of discrimination. At Diamond and Silk's hearing in April, the committee’s top-ranking Democrat Jerrold Nadler called the idea of Big Tech censorship of conservatives a “hoax” and a “tired narrative of imagined victimhood” that was eclipsing other priorities like election security and online privacy.      But Facebook and Twitter have appeared to take the conservative criticism seriously and have arranged a series of meetings and public reviews aimed to build up trust with influential figures on the right. Despite some evidence that Diamond and Silk were exaggerating their claims, Facebook publicly apologized to the duo in front of Congress last week.      And Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey convened a D.C. dinner on June 19 with prominent conservatives including White House advisor Mercedes Schlapp, Fox News commentator Guy Benson, and tax activist Grover Norquist, as the Washington Post first reported.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) |||||Summary:","output":"This long article talks about a big argument happening right now about a thing called \\"shadow banning.\\" Shadow banning is like a secret time out that some people say places like Twitter and Facebook are giving to people they don't agree with, stopping everyone else from seeing their posts. It's like they've become a ghost on the website, they can still post and do things, but no one else can see or interact with them. Usually, people say this time out is given without any warning or explanation, and it is said to make people lose interest and slowly stop using the website, without knowing they've been put in a time out.  The whole argument started because some people noticed that when they searched for some important people in the Republican party (which is one of the two main political parties in the U.S.), Twitter didn't suggest these people in their search bar dropdown. This made it harder for people to find these important accounts because they had to click into the search results page to see them. Some people say this is shadow banning because it makes these important people less visible, while others think it's not that serious and could just be due to a glitch or something else in Twitter's system. A lot of people in the Republican party are upset about this because they think Twitter and other big tech companies are purposefully hiding or pushing down their views. The Democrats (the other big political party in the U.S.) don't seem to be having the same issues, hence the accusations of bias. Twitter has said they're going to fix the issue and that this isn't because they disagree with what these people are saying, but because of how these accounts behave on the platform. They did not go into much detail on what \\"behavior\\" they mean though.  There's still a lot of discussion and disagreement about this, and some people don't even think this shadow banning thing is real. But a lot of people are watching closely to see what Twitter and other companies will do about it. In simple terms, it's like if you're at a playground and you're playing a game of tag, but the person who is \\"it\\" decides not to tag you and doesn't tell you why. You keep running around thinking you're still playing, but nobody else can tag you or interact with you in the game."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: The boy was too nervous to dance, so what was he doing progressively at the ball? Options: - dance like crazy - standing still - wallflower - stand still - like dancing  The answer is \\"standing still\\" because Answer:","output":"The boy was too nervous to dance at the ball, and the best option describing his behavior is \\"standing still.\\" The reason for this is due to a combination of social anxiety, feelings of self-consciousness, and the general pressure of participating in a large event. The other options provided do not accurately portray his actions given the situation. Dancing like crazy would not make sense as the boy is too nervous to dance at the ball. This option contradicts the premise of the question. Most people experiencing nervousness in social gatherings would not suddenly dance energetically, as it would draw attention and could potentially make them feel even more anxious. Being a wallflower is quite similar to standing still but is not an action in itself. A wallflower refers to someone who stands or sits quietly on the sidelines of an event, typically due to shyness or lack of skill in social interactions. However, the term is more of a descriptor rather than a specific action that the boy would be performing. Stating \\"stand still\\" is grammatically incorrect, as it should be \\"standing still,\\" which is the correct answer presented. When someone is too nervous, they are likely to stand still, avoiding eye contact and movements that might draw attention to them. Standing still suggests that the boy is so anxious about dancing that he chooses to remain immobile, not participating in the ball's activities. Finally, \\"like dancing\\" is also an inaccurate answer. If the boy was too nervous to dance, he would not be doing anything resembling dancing. In this case, \\"like dancing\\" could imply swaying or moving slightly to the music, which would not accurately represent the extreme nervousness the boy is experiencing. In conclusion, the answer is \\"standing still\\" because the boy's nervousness prevents him from participating in any form of dancing or engaging in social interactions during the ball. His anxiety results in immobility and withdrawn behavior as a coping mechanism. This option highlights the boy's reluctance to dance and how his feelings of trepidation impact his behavior at the event."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Paragraph: Independence with Partition: The British began to see India's independence as inevitable; however, only a few seemed to understand the vital role of the religious groups. Britain prepared a parliamentary democracy with majority rule, but the majority were Hindus — and Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs had been killing each other in war for many centuries. Nehru's Congress Party, largely Hindu with a socialist leadership, wanted a parliamentary democracy. As counterweight, British legislation reserved parliamentary seats for religious minorities, but the Punjab and Bengal had such a complicated mixture of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs that it was not possible to avoid fights over how separate constituencies were to be formed. The seeds of future trouble were sown. The legislation on reserving seats gave the Muslims the basis for an alternative to an India in which they were only a quarter of the population: Partition. In 1930, the poet Muhammad Iqbal proposed a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India. A small group of Indian Muslims at Cambridge came up with the name Pakistan, using the initials of the Punjab, Afghania (N.W. Frontier Province), Kashmir, and Sind (at the same time producing the word pak, meaning \\"pure\\"), and adding \\"stan,\\" the Persian suffix for the word \\"country. \\" The Muslim campaign for Partition was led by London-trained Bombay lawyer, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Meanwhile, Gandhi vehemently opposed any dismemberment of the country, and tried to keep people united by fasting to uphold the spirit of love, and by focussing on the common adversary: the British. Advocating civil disobedience, he led his famous Salt March to the sea, to scoop up salt and circumvent the hated British salt tax. This put more than 60,000 in jail. Against this militancy, World War II did not elicit the solidarity of the first. Indians courageously fought alongside the British troops, in Burma, the Middle East, and Europe, but Gandhi saw the British as a provocation for Japanese invasion and was jailed yet again, for launching a \\"Quit India\\" campaign in the year 1942. Some anti-British extremists saw the Japanese as an Asian liberator. Winston Churchill didn't want any Indian independence and so it was probably as well for India that he was defeated by Attlee's Labor Party in 1945. With riots growing ever more bloody in Bengal, Bihar, and the Punjab, India's last viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, kept a mandate to make the British departure as quick and as smooth as possible. Quick it was — six months after his arrival — but not smooth.  Question: \\"Who gave the Muslims the idea of partition?\\" Answer: \\"Muhammad Ali Jinnah\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"No, this answer is not entirely correct. While Muhammad Ali Jinnah played a leading role in the Muslim campaign for Partition, it was the poet Muhammad Iqbal who first proposed the idea of a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India in 1930. The concept of Pakistan was later coined by a small group of Indian Muslims at Cambridge. Jinnah, a London-trained Bombay lawyer, led the movement for Partition, but he did not originate the idea."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Această traducere susține ideea că o concurență justă pe plan internațional poate fi obținută numai atunci când economia globală respectă anumite principii fundamentale care să guverneze relațiile dintre diferitele părți interesate. Printre aceste principii se numără stabilirea unor reguli transparente și coerente pentru producători, exportatori și importatori, care să fie valabile la nivel mondial. Mai mult, este important de luat în considerare faptul că atingerea unei concurențe corecte ar trebui să cuprindă și preocupări legate de bunăstarea socială și de sustenabilitatea mediului. Astfel, normele sociale și de mediu comune ar trebui să fie un punct de referință în procesul de stabilire a normelor economice globale.

To do this, I closely analyze medical reports, interview patients, and even conduct on-site investigations where outbreaks are suspected. I work against the clock, because the more rapidly a disease spreads, the harder it will be to contain it. Once I've accumulated enough information, I share my findings with public health officials and medical professionals, who then take the appropriate steps to prevent further spread.

Your task is to generate answer \\"yes\\" when the tweet has that particular sentiment, otherwise generate answer \\"no\\". Review: For real film people, this film is a must, since it works as a perfect little allegory for the movies themselves. Janos Rukh/Boris Karloff's science has to do with capturing and projecting light from cosmic phenomena. This light can do harm, or it can be harnessed to do good. On the one hand it blinds his mother, on the other it is used to cure blindness (\\"I can see!\\" shouts a young girl on whose eyes this light is projected). When Rukh/Karloff is himself poisoned by the uncanny power of this light, we see him actually emitting a ghostly glow on his hands and face like a badly developed negative, drawing attention to the fact that the man we are watching is a projection, an entity viewed on film (only visible, as in a movie theater, when the lights are out).There is a wonderful passage near the beginning where Karloff/Rukh explains his research as being informed by the fact that everything that happens is captured in light which rolls through space for millions of years, as the light from Andromeda was emitted from that Galaxy at a time when the earth was still molten rock. There are passages in the film when this new science is juxtaposed to older cultural vehicles: that of the writer, in the persona of Beulah Bondi/Arabella Stevens; and religion, emblemized in the sculptural figures on the local cathedral Karloff blasts with his projector/ray gun. One has to wonder here if this film was meant to glance at what was going on in Germany at the time, and particularly at Riefenstall's use of film the year before to promote a regime that certainly would go on to do a lot of harm:Triumph of the Will. Happily in the end, Mother (Violet Kemble Cooper) intervenes, reminding Janos Rukh of the first rule of science. If only more movies made you want to stand up in the theater and shout: \\"I can see!\\" Question: is it a positive review?","output":"Yes, it is a positive review. The reviewer discusses various aspects of the film, and while it talks about both harm and good in the context of the film's story, the overall tone of the review is positive and appreciative.

Hemoglobin Hemoglobin, or Hb, is a protein molecule found in red blood cells (erythrocytes) made of four subunits: two alpha subunits and two beta subunits (Figure 39.19). Each subunit surrounds a central heme group that contains iron and binds one oxygen molecule, allowing each hemoglobin molecule to bind four oxygen molecules. Molecules with more oxygen bound to the heme groups are brighter red. As a result, oxygenated arterial blood where the Hb is carrying four oxygen molecules is bright red, while venous blood that is deoxygenated is darker red.

Step 1: Simplify the expression (4y) / 20 + (3y) / 10 (4y) / 20 can be simplified to y / 5 (by dividing numerator and denominator by 4) (3y) / 10 can be simplified to 3y / 10 (since numerator and denominator have no common factor) So the expression becomes y / 5 + 3y / 10. Step 2: Find a common denominator for the two terms and add them: The common denominator for 5 and 10 is 10.  Now, we convert the first term to have a denominator of 10: (y / 5) = (2y / 10). So, the expression becomes 2y / 10 + 3y / 10. Step 3: Add the two terms: We can add the two terms having a common denominator: (2y + 3y) / 10 = 5y / 10. Now, simplify the expression: 5y / 10 = y / 2. Step 4: Calculate the percent value of the expression with respect to y: To determine the percentage, divide the simplified expression by y and multiply by 100. Percent = (y / 2) / y * 100 Cancel out y from the numerator and denominator: (1 / 2) * 100 Percent = 50 % The correct answer is 50 % which corresponds to answer choice b.

(CNN) -- Canadian police on Friday identified the victim of a grisly killing in Montreal as a university student from China who was reported missing by a friend earlier this week. Jun Lin, 33, was attending Concordia University in Montreal, said Montreal police Commander Ian Lafreniere. He was last seen May 24. Police believe the murder took place May 24 or May 25 The Chinese consulate in Montreal said Lin was from the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Police believe Lin was killed and his body dismembered in a Montreal apartment. A massive international manhunt is ongoing for the prime suspect, Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, a self-professed porn star. In apartment 208, where","output":"the murder is believed to have taken place, a disturbing scene awaited investigators. Bloodstains covered the walls and floor, and the strong odor of decomposition filled the air. A grisly video on the internet of the alleged murder led police to the apartment, where they found human remains, including a torso in a suitcase, in the building's garbage area. As the manhunt for Magnotta continued, details of his life emerged, painting a picture of a deeply troubled and dangerous individual. Magnotta was known to have a history of animal abuse, posting videos of himself torturing kittens. He had also been linked to several online personas, each more bizarre and gruesome than the next. After an intense search by Canadian police, the international manhunt for Magnotta finally came to an end in a Berlin internet café. On June 4, 2012, an employee at the café recognized the wanted suspect and alerted the authorities. Magnotta tried to convince the police that he was someone else, but after fingerprint checks and his distinctive tattoos matched, it was confirmed that they had the prime suspect in their custody. Magnotta was soon extradited back to Canada to face justice for his crimes. He was charged with first-degree murder, committing an indignity to a dead body, and mailing obscene and indecent material. During his trial, the prosecution detailed the horrific nature of Lin's murder and dismemberment and provided evidence linking Magnotta to the crime, including the receipt of the package sent to several high-profile figures. As the trial went on, it became clear that Magnotta's defense would be centered around his mental state at the time of the murder. His defense counsel argued that their client was psychotic and suffering from a personality disorder, making him not criminally responsible for his actions. While the prosecution refuted this claim, stating that Magnotta meticulously planned and carefully executed this brutal crime. Following weeks of testimony and deliberation, on December 23, 2014, the jury ultimately found Luka Rocco Magnotta guilty of first-degree murder and the other charges brought against him. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 25 years. Additionally, he received 19 years for other crimes he committed, to be served concurrently. This case left a deep impact on the Chinese community, as well as the Canadian public and international community. Justice had been served, and Magnotta would spend a significant part of his life behind bars for the gruesome murder of Jun Lin. Meanwhile, the victim's family would have to carry on without their beloved family member, who was taken from them so tragically. The loss of Jun Lin and the horrifying events surrounding his murder continue to serve as a stark reminder of the darkness that can exist within some individuals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lancaster's career designing for the theatre began and ended with Gilbert and Sullivan.

His last were for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's revival of The Sorcerer (1973). In between, he designed more productions for the Royal Ballet, as well as for Glyndebourne Festival Opera, the Old Vic and the West End. It was a matter of mild regret to him that of the twenty plays, operas and ballets that he designed between the two, only one was for a thoroughly serious piece, Britten's Peter Grimes, for the Bulgarian National Opera in Sofia in 1964.Only two of Lancaster's theatre designs have remained in use in 21st-century productions, both by the Royal Ballet: Pineapple Poll and La fille mal gardée. In an article on the latter in 2016, Danielle Buckley wrote, \\"Lancaster's surrealist and stylized designs for Fille amplify the story's pantomime quality, and the exaggerated burlesque of its comedy – but the backdrops of fields that roll into the distance, bundles of hay, dreamy skies and village cottages provide the idealized, pastoral context that the story needs\\". Buckley adds that Lancaster’s designs have been criticised for locating the ballet in no particular time or place – \\"except, that is, of a 1960s London view of idyllic country life\\".Lancaster's stated view was that stage sets and costumes should reflect reality, but \\"through a lens, magnifying and slightly over-emphasising everything which it reflects\\".

These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.

In one intense scene, they come face-to-face with the manifestation of bigotry itself, a dark and fearsome creature who is intent on keeping the world divided. The climax of the film sees Ahmed and his friends find and unlock the hidden chamber containing the Chalice of Equality. As Ahmed retrieves the Chalice, its power floods through him, and he gains newfound abilities to heal and bring life to barren lands. Returning to his home town, Ahmed puts the Chalice to good use, cultivating fairness and unity within the once-divided community. In the closing scene, Ahmed reflects on his journey and the true meaning of fairness, acknowledging that change starts within oneself. Empowered by his experiences and the strength of his friends, Ahmed pledges to continue his fight for equality and justice at a national and global level, knowing that the power of the Chalice lies not just in the item itself, but in the hands of those who wield it with compassion. The film, \\"The Quest for Fair Play,\\" serves as an allegory for the power of unity, acceptance, and understanding in the face of prejudice and division. By portraying a diverse and inclusive group of characters on a hero's journey, the film delivers an inspiring and thought-provoking message about the importance of treating everyone fairly and working together to create a better world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. News article: Updated on July 26 at 5:00pm      Continue Reading Below      The Organic Consumers Association announced Tuesday that it found traces of glyphosate—a controversial herbicide found in Monsanto’s (MON) Roundup—in 10 of 11 samples of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, which was first reported by The New York Times.      The levels, however, are far below the ceiling set by the Environmental Protection Agency. But the news comes as a surprise to many consumers since the company has been marketing itself as non-GMO since 2014.      Though, according to Ben & Jerry’s website, they based their non-GMO standard on the “mandatory declaration requirements of European regulations and the GMO labeling law passed in [their] home state of Vermont,” which allows their dairy and egg suppliers to use conventional animal feeds that contain GMO grains.      Rob Michalak, global director of social mission at Ben & Jerry’s, told The New York Times, that while they are working to ensure all ingredients in its supply chain come from sources that do not include any GMOs, none of its plant-based ingredients come from any GMO crops, such as corn or soy. Additionally, the company is trying to figure out a more cost-effective way for dairy farms that supply its milk to use non-GMO feed.      “We’re working to transition away from GMO, as far away as we can get,” Michalak told The New York Times. “But then these tests come along, and we need to better understand where the glyphosate they’re finding is coming from. Maybe it’s from something that’s not even in our supply chain, and so we’re missing it.”      Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT      While the levels of glyphosate were well below the legal limit set by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Organic Consumers Association (OCA) argues that any presence of the pesticide product is misleading to the consumer.      \\"It's time for Ben & Jerry’s to announce it will immediately begin transitioning to 100 percent organic. Otherwise conscious consumers have no choice but to launch a national and, if necessary, international protest campaign and boycott,” the OCA said in a post on its website.      Additionally, the OCA says reports published by Regeneration Vermont reveal that Ben & Jerry’s suppliers—and Vermont and U.S. (non-organic) dairy farmers in general, “have gone backwards, rather than forward over the past 15 years in terms of environment sustainability, food safety, and nutrition and greenhouse gas pollution.” The organization has also called on the company to stop labeling its ice cream as “natural.”      GMOs, specifically glyphosate, have been a hot-button issue for consumers in recent years. In 2015, the World Health Organization classified glyphosate as a “probable carcinogen” and last month, California became the first state to require Roundup—because its main ingredient is glyphosate—to come with a label warning that it’s known to cause cancer.      However, Monsanto, the maker of Roundup, has hard-fought any criticisms regarding the herbicide.      \\"Hundreds of scientific studies over 40 years have determined that glyphosate is safe for use, and no regulatory agency in the world has concluded that glyphosate is carcinogenic. IARC's flawed classification is the sole outlier,\\" Monsanto's vice president of strategy, Scott Partridge, told FOX Business.      Additionally, a Ben & Jerry's spokesperson fired back and told FOX Business that while they're aware of the recent New York Times article, they have not yet seen the results, but they can confirm that \\"all Ben & Jerry's products are safe to consume.\\"      \\"Even if the reported results are accurate, as the laboratory that conducted the test stated, a person would have to conume 145,000 eight-ounce servings PER DAY to reach the limit set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),\\" a Ben & Jerry's spokesperson said. ||||| We’ve based our non-GMO standard on the mandatory declaration requirements of European regulations and the GMO labeling law passed in our home state of Vermont. Our dairy and egg suppliers still use conventional animal feeds that contain GMO grains. We are actively seeking cost-effective options for farmers within our supply chain to convert to non-GMO animal feed.      We reached this non-GMO milestone in 2014 when we completed the transition of all plant-based ingredients in all* of our ice cream flavors to non-GMO.      The Details      As a part of our commitment to transparency, and for those folks who really like to know the details, below is an explanation of exactly what we mean by 'non-GMO.'      Our Definitions      When we refer to a \\"GMO\\", we are using this term as most popularly used and widely understood in the US (though there are varying definitions). As such, a \\"GMO\\" (or \\"genetically modified organism\\") is an organism that has been created using gene-splicing techniques, which allow DNA from one species to be injected into another species in a laboratory. This creates combinations of plant, animal, bacteria, and viral genes that do not occur in nature or through traditional cross-breeding methods.      \\"Non-GMO by Origin\\" refers to non-GMO according to the original seed source. Either the crop is not commercially available as a GMO crop or, if the option is available, refers to the non-GMO version. Traceability to the original non-GMO seed source is key. This is the standard that Ben & Jerry's adheres to when sourcing our ingredients.      \\"Non-GMO by IP\\" refers to non-GMO Identity Preserved crops. Identity Preservation requires practices and processes for controlling contamination from at-risk GMO inputs and ingredients. Traceability, segregation, risk assessment, sampling techniques, quality control management and analytical testing are emphasized. Ben & Jerry's does not require this from our suppliers, but many choose to supply ingredients that meet this standard. This is a standard that is slightly more rigid than Non-GMO by Origin, and therefore anything considered Non-GMO IP is also considered Non-GMO by Origin.      \\"PCR Testing\\" refers to the Polymerase Chain Reaction test that can be used to detect genetic material (DNA) in a sample. PCR(-) refers to an ingredient that was derived from a GMO source, but the genetic material is not detectable in the finished product, likely due to it being a highly refined or processed product. PCR(-) alone is not an acceptable standard for Ben & Jerry's ingredients, but will be used as a verification tool when appropriate.      Ben & Jerry's \\"Non-GMO\\" standards:      Ben & Jerry's adheres to sourcing \\"Non-GMO by Origin\\" ingredients for use in our products based on the following standards. This means we rely primarily on traceability of ingredients through the supply chain back to a non-GMO seed, rather than relying on PCR testing.      Our suppliers use the following guidelines to ensure the ingredients they provide to us are \\"Non-GMO by Origin\\":      - All suppliers must use \\"Non-GMO by Origin\\" ingredients, (including any sub-components or excepients) in the manufacture of items they supply to Ben & Jerry's.      - \\"Non-GMO by IP\\" is also acceptable.      - For any plant-based raw material derived from sugar beets, corn, soy, canola, or other crop that is commercially available in GMO varieties, suppliers must source \\"Non-GMO by Origin\\" materials.      - Suppliers to Ben & Jerry's that also handle GMO raw materials or finished products in their production facilities must take appropriate measures to segregate GMO and Non-GMO materials at all times and ensure proper cleaning measures are employed. There may be no comingling of ingredients or finished products at any point during storage or processing. There is no tolerance for use of GMO ingredients in any product supplied to Ben & Jerry's.      - Suppliers may use ingredients obtained from fermentation and processing aids or enzymes that are derived from GMOs in some circumstances, to be approved on a case-by-case basis by Ben & Jerry's.      - Suppliers will be audited for \\"Non-GMO by Origin\\" traceability and segregation compliance as part of Ben & Jerry's audit procedures. Supportive documentation review, site visits, and PCR testing at any point in the supply chain, may be part of the audit protocol. Suppliers must provide documentation and certification that materials are \\"Non-GMO by Origin\\" upon request.      Our Dairy:      We've based our non-GMO standard on the mandatory declaration requirements of European regulations and the GMO labeling law passed by our home state of Vermont. This standard does not address animal feed. To be clear, the fresh milk and cream we source from family farmers is conventionally sourced. It is common practice for dairy cows' feed to contain GMO ingredients such as corn and soy.      We aspire to build a sustainable dairy supply chain in the Northeast region that does not use GMO feeds. We are working with numerous companies in the dairy industry and in the major commodity chains toward that goal through our participation in the Non-GMO Supply Working Group and Northeast Dairy Project. ||||| The Vermont brand has been built on a bucolic image of cows grazing on endless pastures . . . Ben & Jerry’s ice cream and other Vermont companies have used this idyllic imagery to sell their products. Gone are the days, however, when most of Vermont’s cows were grazing in spectacularly scenic landscapes. Now a majority of Vermont’s cows are locked up in . . . ‘confined animal feeding operations’ or CAFOs . . . grazing on concrete with a diet rich in GMO corn and pesticides. - “Vermont’s GMO Addiction: Pesticides, Polluted Water and Climate Destruction,” Regeneration Vermont      The most important thing we can do today as conscious consumers, farmers and food workers is to regenerate public health, the environment and climate stability. We can do this most readily by moving away from industrial, GMO and factory-farm food toward an organic, pasture-based, soil-regenerative, humane, carbon-sequestering and climate-friendly agriculture system.      What’s standing in the way of this life-or-death transformation? Rampant greenwashing. The proliferation of 90 billion worth of fraudulently labeled or advertised “natural” and “socially responsible” food products in the U.S. confuses even the most well-intentioned of consumers and lures them away from purchasing genuine organic or grass-fed products.      Perhaps no company personifies greenwashing more than Vermont-based Ben & Jerry’s. Ben & Jerry’s history—a start-up launched by two affable hippies, from a renovated gas station in Burlington, Vt., —is legendary. Despite selling out to Unilever in April 2000, the brand’s handlers have preserved its quirky, homespun image, and masterfully convinced consumers that Ben & Jerry’s has never strayed from its mission: “to make the world a better place.”      As the New York Times reports, the Organic Consumers Association (OCA) recently sent samples of Ben and Jerry’s top-selling ice cream brands to an independent testing lab for analysis. Ten out of 11 samples tested positive for Roundup (glyphosate and AMPA) herbicide contamination      So much for making the world a better place.      Compare the Ben & Jerry's test results with the results of our testing of organic brands, brands that use organic milk from farms that are actually making the world a better place. Three out of four nationally distributed organic ice cream brands tested negative for Roundup contamination (only Whole Foods “365” brand was contaminated).      A history of stalling on organic      Twenty-four years ago, anti-GMO food activists, including the Pure Food Campaign (OCA’s predecessor), successfully pressured Ben & Jerry’s and a number of other leading dairies to prohibit the use of America’s first genetically engineered food product, Monsanto’s recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone (rBGH). Now marketed by drug giant Elanco (Eli Lilly), rBGH is linked to increased risk of human breast and colon cancer, a greater use of antibiotics in animal feed, and damage to cow’s health.      Several groups, including the OCA, subsequently asked Ben & Jerry’s to move beyond just prohibiting their dairy cows from being injected with rBGH. We asked them to go 100 percent organic, which would have required the company to ban its dairy suppliers from feeding their cows GMO corn and grain, and to use only organic ingredients in its flavors. But even before Ben & Jerry’s was bought out by Unilever, company founder Ben Cohen told Vermont Food activist Michael Colby “that Ben & Jerry’s was not going to transition to organic because it wouldn’t allow them to ‘maximize profits.’ “      Since 1994, Ben & Jerry’s, the 1.5-billion-per-year flagship brand of the second-largest multinational food corporation in the world, Unilever (annual sales 60 billion), has cashed in big time on its “rBGH-free” policy, advertising its brand, over and over again, as “all natural,” “GMO-free,” “fair trade,” “climate-just,” and “socially responsible.”      Despite repeated calls from consumer groups to stop advertising its ice-cream as “natural” or “all natural,” given that it is derived from cows raised almost exclusively on GMO corn forage (grown with Roundup Ready, neonic-, and BT-spliced seeds), laced with non-organic ingredients, sprayed heavily with Roundup and other pesticides, Ben & Jerry’s continues to greenwash and lie. The company recently (June 18, 2017) described its mission as:      To make, distribute and sell the finest quality and euphoric concoctions with a continued commitment to incorporating wholesome, ingredients and promoting business practices that respect the Earth and the Environment.      After more than a decade of dodging consumer, farmer, animal welfare, environmental and farmworker pleas to stop greenwashing and to equitably source its milk from cows grazing on organic pasture, Ben & Jerry’s continues to stall. Instead, Ben & Jerry’s sources its milk from St. Alban’s, a 400-farmer dairy co-op that is increasingly dominated by large factory farm-type dairy operations. To feed their cows, farmers routinely spray tons of pesticides, including Roundup, atrazine and metolachlor, on fields of GMO corn grown from neonic-coated and BT toxin seeds. They also apply tons of soil-killing, climate-disrupting nitrogen fertilizers that pollute Vermont’s streams, rivers and lakes.      Petitions and protests calling for Ben & Jerry’s to stop its suppliers from exploiting farmworkers, confining dairy cows and driving small dairy farmers into bankruptcy, have produced nothing more than vague promises of “respecting the Earth” and supporting rural economic justice.      Enough is enough. Vermont and national public interest organizations have lost our patience. It’s time for Unilever and Ben & Jerry’s to move beyond greenwashing to decisive action. It’s time for Ben & Jerry’s to announce it will immediately begin transitioning to 100-percent organic. Otherwise conscious consumers have no choice but to launch a national and, if necessary, international protest campaign and boycott.      Vermont activists demand major changes from Ben and Jerry’s      Regeneration Vermont, a broad-based coalition of consumers and farmers, has repeatedly asked Ben & Jerry’s and Unilever to sign a six-point pledge to go 100-percent organic over a three-year transition period. Here's what the groups want Ben & Jerry's to pledge:      A transition away from GMO crops and toxic pesticides/fertilizers and toward regenerative organic agricultural methods. Fair wages for farmers, including premiums based on regeneration benchmarks and assistance in the transition toward regenerative methods. Economic justice for farm workers, fair and livable wages, decent housing and social and cultural dignity. Adoption of climate remediation techniques, beginning with an emphasis on healthy soils and cover-cropping for carbon sequestration and erosion control. Humane treatment of farm animals, a phase-out of confinement dairies and a transition back to grassland grazing and grass-based feed for ruminants. Cleaning up and protecting our watersheds, streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, and groundwater.      A trail of toxins      Recent reports published by Regeneration Vermont reveal that Ben & Jerry’s suppliers, and Vermont and U.S. (non-organic) dairy farmers in general, have gone backward, rather than forward over the past 15 years in terms of environmental sustainability, food safety, nutrition, greenhouse gas pollution, water pollution, animal welfare, farmworker justice, and preservation of family farms.      Chemical fertilizer use has also almost doubled in Vermont since GMOs began to dominate the market 15 years ago.      So much for Monsanto’s claims that GMO crops would reduce the use of toxic pesticides and water- polluting and climate-destabilizing nitrogen fertilizers. Not to mention Ben & Jerry’s claim that it is “non-GMO” and “environmentally responsible.”      Among Regeneration Vermont’s finding are the following:      An astounding 97 percent of Vermont’s field corn, the major component of a non-organic dairy cow’s diet, is now GMO (Roundup Ready, Bt-spliced, neonic seeds). This is the highest percentage of any state in the U.S.      Herbicide use has increased over 100 percent-per-acre in Vermont since Monsanto’s GMO corn came on the market, with recent heavy use of atrazine, metholachlor, simazine, pendimethlin, glyphosate (Roundup), acetochlor, dicamba and alachlor.      As Regeneration Vermont states in its report:      Regulators have determined that five of these eight most used herbicides [in Vermont] are possible or probable human carcinogens, the remaining three are suspected carcinogens. Seven of the eight are possible or probable endocrine disruptors (the other one is a suspected to be an endocrine disruptor). All eight have been determined by regulators and academics to cause birth or developmental defects and contaminate drinking water and public waters with dangerous chemicals that have long-term persistence. Atrazine, simazine, acetachlor, and alachlor have lost their registration in the EU, and are effectively banned.      The threat of #DirtyDairy and factory farms      Millions of health-minded Americans, especially parents of young children, now understand that cheap, non-organic, genetically engineered, industrial and factory farm food is hazardous. Not only does chemical- and energy-intensive factory farming destroy the environment, destabilize the climate, impoverish rural communities, exploit farm workers, inflict unnecessary cruelty on farm animals, and contaminate the water supply, but the end product itself is inevitably contaminated and inferior in nutritional terms, in this case in comparison to 100% grass-fed and organic milk and dairy.      America’s green-minded consumers understand that industrial agriculture poses a terminal threat to the environment and climate stability. A highly conscious and passionate segment of the population is beginning to understand that converting to non-chemical, non-genetically engineered, energy-efficient, carbon-sequestering organic/regenerative farming practices, and drastically reducing food miles by re-localizing the food chain, are essential preconditions for stabilizing our out-of-control climate and preparing our families and communities for future energy and resource shortages.      A critical mass of the global grassroots—consumers, farmers, activists—now realize that unless we act quickly, global warming and climate chaos will soon severely disrupt industrial agriculture and long-distance food transportation, leading to massive crop failures, food shortages, famine, war, and pestilence. Even more alarming, accelerating levels of greenhouse gases will soon push global warming to a tipping point that will melt the polar icecaps and possibly unleash a cataclysmic discharge of climate-destabilizing methane, now sequestered in the fragile arctic tundra.      Thanks to this growing consumer awareness—and four decades of hard work—the organic community has built up a 50-billion \\"certified organic\\" and 5-billion 100% grass-fed food and products sector that prohibits the use of genetic engineering and pesticides. The rapidly expanding organic products sector now constitutes more than 5 percent of total retail grocery sales (and 15 percent of fruits and vegetables), with an annual growth rate of 10-15 percent. Even taking into account a sluggish economy, the organic market, if we eliminate greenwashing and labeling fraud, could conceivably reach a “tipping point” of 20 percent of grocery sales in 2020.      The myth of \\"natural\\" remains a threat      As impressive as this 55 billion Organic and Grass-fed Alternative is, it remains overshadowed by an additional 90 billion in annual spending by consumers on products, such as B&J’s, fraudulently marketed as \\"natural,\\" “gmo-free,” “free range,” or “sustainable.”      Consumer surveys indicate that the overwhelming majority of Americans believe that “natural” products are “almost organic,” yet at the same time, much cheaper; the majority believes that “all natural” actually means that it is better than organics. Ben & Jerry’s is not the only brand greenwashing its products and impeding the growth of organic, 100% grass-fed and regenerative foods. But it is certainly among the most shameless.      In fact, all these \\"natural,\\" \\"all-natural\\" and \\"sustainable\\" products are neither backed up by rules and regulations, nor a third-party certifier. Most \\"natural\\" or conventional products—whether produce, dairy or canned or frozen goods—are produced on large industrial farms or in processing plants that are highly polluting, chemical-intensive and energy-intensive.      Perhaps fraudulently labeled “natural” foods such as Ben & Jerry’s wouldn't matter so much if we were living in normal times, with a relatively healthy population, environment and climate. Conventional products sold as \\"natural\\" or \\"nearly organic\\" would be just one more example of chicanery or unethical business practices.      But we are not living in normal times.      Demanding that fake natural brands and producers, such as Ben & Jerry’s, make the transition to organic is a matter of life or death. We’re tired of pleading and politely asking Ben & Jerry’s, Unilever and other greenwashers to please change their ways. It’s time to step up the pressure. Please join the growing boycott of Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream by signing this petition and by volunteering to join a local campaign team in your local community.      Ronnie Cummins is international director of the Organic Consumers Association. ||||| At Ben & Jerry's, we believe everyone should benefit from our ice cream, even the chickens.      The eggs we buy for Ben & Jerry’s ice cream in the United States come from hens on Certified Humane cage-free farms. Certified Humane cage-free standards ensure that laying hens have wholesome, nutritious food, access to clean water, and adequate space to engage in normal behaviors, among other criteria crafted by veterinary professionals. ||||| A growing number of foods commonly found in kitchens across America have tested positive for glyphosate, the herbicide that is the main ingredient in the popular consumer pesticide Roundup, which is widely used in agriculture. But few brands on that list are as startling as the latest: Ben & Jerry’s, the Vermont ice cream company known for its family-friendly image and environmental advocacy.      The Organic Consumers Association announced Tuesday that it found traces of glyphosate in 10 of 11 samples of the company’s ice creams — although at levels far below the ceiling set by the Environmental Protection Agency.      Rob Michalak, global director of social mission at Ben & Jerry’s, said the company was working to ensure that all the ingredients in its supply chain come from sources that do not include genetically modified organisms, known as G.M.O.s. None of its plant-based ingredients, for instance, come from a genetically engineered crop like corn or soy, where glyphosate is used in production. The company is also trying to figure out a cost-effective way for the dairy farms that supply its milk to use non-G.M.O. feed.      “We’re working to transition away from G.M.O., as far away as we can get,” Mr. Michalak said. “But then these tests come along, and we need to better understand where the glyphosate they’re finding is coming from. Maybe it’s from something that’s not even in our supply chain, and so we’re missing it.” ||||| Ben & Jerry's has always taken pains to be socially and environmentally responsible when sourcing ingredients. Back in 2005, we were the first ice cream maker in the world to use Fairtrade Certified ingredients. And in 2010, we decided to commit fully to the cause—across all our flavors and all the countries where our ice cream is sold. We made sure that every possible ingredient was Fairtrade Certified by 2011 in Europe, and did the same in the United States by 2014.      The trend worldwide in agriculture is all about getting bigger, a lot bigger. Fair trade is important because it assures a fair price for small-scale farmers' products—in the face of growth that could easily push them out of the market. That's great news for them, their families and their communities. But it's also great for us (and for you), because we get to use their amazing ingredients in our ice cream.      But there's more to the fair trade story. Linked prosperity, the idea that those who are successful should work to improve the world around them, is one of Ben & Jerry's founding principles. Fair trade puts this idea into action. All farmers in the Fairtrade system agree to use environmentally friendly farming practices, implement fair labor standards and invest in their communities. The Fairtrade social premium, an additional amount of money paid on top of the fair price that farmers receive, helps make those investments happen. ||||| There may be an ingredient found in weedkillers in your ice cream. Facebook/Ben & Jerry's Ben & Jerry's — a brand famous for its quality and eco-friendly practices — is under fire after a test uncovered a controversial ingredient in its ice cream.      The Organic Consumers Association (OCA) found glyphosate, the main ingredient in weedkillers like Roundup, in 10 out of 11 samples of the company's ice cream flavors, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.      While the levels of glyphosate were well below the legal limit set by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Organic Consumers Association argues that any presence of the pesticide product is misleading and potentially dangerous.      \\"It's time for Ben & Jerry's to announce it will immediately begin transitioning to 100-percent organic,\\" using zero pesticides in production, the OCA said in a post on its website. \\"Otherwise conscious consumers have no choice but to launch a national and, if necessary, international protest campaign and boycott.\\"      Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield Alberto Rodriguez / Getty      The OCA has called for Ben & Jerry's to stop labeling its ice creams as \\"natural\\" because the brand's dairy cows consume genetically-engineered corn (the brand told the Times that it is working to find all-natural alternatives). Add-ins, such as peanut butter or cookie dough, containing ingredients that have been sprayed with the weedkiller may also be the source of the glyphosate in the ice creams, according to the Times.      A Ben & Jerry's spokesperson said in a statement that the brand had not yet seen the results of the test, but could confirm that all ice cream flavors are safe to consume.      \\"Even if the reported results are accurate, as the laboratory that conducted the test stated, a person would have to consume 145,000 eight-ounce servings PER DAY to reach the limit set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),\\" the spokesperson said.      The question of if glyphosate is dangerous to consume is still hotly debated. While the World Health Organization said in 2015 that the weed killer was \\"probably carcinogenic,\\" Reuters reported in June that scientific data may not fully back that claim.      Despite the continued debate, many customers simply do not want to have a herbicide ingredient in their food. Soon after the Times published its article on the OCA's ice cream test, the brand began receiving complaints and boycott threats on social media.      \\"You are my favorite ice cream brand, but I CANNOT buy your ice cream again until it no longer comes up positive for MONSANTO'S GLYPHOSATE,\\" one person wrote on the brand's Facebook page, referring to Roundup's maker and leading G.M.O. seed producer, Monsanto.      Ben & Jerry's, which was founded by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield (who the OCA calls \\"two affable hippies\\") in 1978, did not immediately return Business Insider's request for comment. The company has long had a reputation for advocating for the environment and social justice, even after its acquisition by consumer goods giant Unilever in 2001. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"The Organic Consumers Association (OCA) has discovered traces of controversial herbicide glyphosate in samples of ice cream produced by Ben & Jerry’s.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Another thing we can see in this animation is that particles are constantly colliding with one another. One assumption that we make when talking about collisions between gas particles is that they are completely elastic collisions. In an elastic collision , momentum is conserved, which means that none of the kinetic energy of the colliding particles is lost in some other form (such as the emission of light). This makes sense, because if energy were lost in collisions, the speeds of the particles would gradually decrease over time, and eventually everything would condense down into a solid form.  I am facing a new situation today: Dan is in his physics lab. He is experimenting with colliding particles. He has two samples of particles, sample A and sample B. Sample A contains gas particles, but sample B does not contain gas particles.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In which sample the momentum would not be conserved, sample A or sample B? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify the key information from the background article. From the background article, we know that: - Gas particles undergo elastic collisions. - Elastic collisions conserve momentum, meaning none of the kinetic energy of the colliding particles is lost in some other form. Step 2: Analyze the new situation. In the new situation, we have: - Sample A contains gas particles. - Sample B does not contain gas particles. Step 3: Apply the knowledge from the background article to the new situation. - Sample A has gas particles, and we know from the article that gas particles undergo elastic collisions in which momentum is conserved. - Sample B does not have gas particles, and we don't have information regarding the conservation of momentum for these particles. Since they are not gas particles, we cannot assume they undergo elastic collisions and conserve momentum as gas particles do. Step 4: Answer the question. Based on the information we have, we can conclude that in sample A, the momentum would be conserved due to gas particles undergoing elastic collisions. However, in sample B, we cannot definitively say whether momentum would be conserved or not because it does not contain gas particles, and we do not have information about the behavior of its particles.  So, if we have to choose between the two samples, we would say the momentum would more likely not be conserved in sample B, as we don't have information to support the conservation of momentum for non-gas particles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Usage: The producer blends two varieties of tea, one costing Rs 18 per kg and another Rs 20 per kg, in the ratio 5:3. This means the producer mixes 5 parts of the Rs 18 per kg tea with 3 parts of the Rs 20 per kg tea to create the blended mixture. The blended tea is then sold at Rs 21 per kg. Part #2: Calculate the cost of the blended tea. Usage: We can calculate the cost of the blended tea using the cost of each tea and the ratio provided.  Cost of blended tea = (5 * Rs 18 + 3 * Rs 20) / (5+3) Cost of blended tea = (90 + 60) / 8 Cost of blended tea = Rs 150 / 8 = Rs 18.75 per kg Part #3: Determine the gain percent. Usage: We can find the gain percent by comparing the selling price (Rs 21 per kg) with the cost of the blended tea (Rs 18.75 per kg).  Gain = Selling Price - Cost Price Gain = Rs 21 - Rs 18.75 Gain = Rs 2.25 per kg Gain Percent = (Gain / Cost Price) * 100 Gain Percent = (Rs 2.25 / Rs 18.75) * 100 Gain Percent = 12% Part #4: Match the gain percent with the given options.

Universities Wales - the body representing institutions - said it will create \\"significant challenges\\". 854,572 (52.5%) voters in Wales chose to leave the EU, compared with 772,347 (47.5%) supporting Remain. Ms Button said the decision will not only be \\"hugely negative\\" for students and young people but Wales will also lose out on large amounts of EU funding. \\"Those funds support investment and infrastructure all across Wales, particularly for young people and communities in poverty. \\"This is a catastrophe for our generation,\\" she said. Earlier this month, Universities Wales published an open letter in which it outlined what it sees as the benefits of EU membership. The letter, signed by the chairman of the body, Cardiff University vice chancellor Colin Riordan, said the free movement of students and staff \\"enriches the student experience\\" but also made a contribution to the Welsh economy \\"worth hundreds of millions of pounds\\". It talked about partnerships with other EU researchers driving economic growth and innovation in areas such as healthcare. It also pointed to the economic impact of EU students themselves, claiming it was worth more than Â£70m a year off campus in Wales. Following the Leave vote, the body said there will be a \\"gradual exit process\\", during which time it will have opportunities to seek assurances and influence future policy. It said its first priority is to convince the UK government to allow students from EU countries to continue working and studying at British universities. A statement said: \\" We will also prioritise securing opportunities for our researchers and students to access vital pan-European programmes and build new global networks.\\" It wants to ensure the UK continues to be promoted as \\"a welcoming destination for the brightest and best minds\\". The NUS said students' unions had been fully engaged in the referendum, urging students to register to vote, running registration sessions and debates. But while turnout was higher than in the General Election, it said numbers would have been much greater among students if the UK Government had \\"truly engaged young people\\". \\"We will continue to fight and campaign for 16 and 17-year-olds to be given the vote. \\"We are confident that this will be in place for the next Assembly election, if not sooner,\\" the NUS said. While it expressed dismay that 17 out of 22 Welsh local authorities voted to leave, it called on the UK government to now include students in the exit negotiations. \\"The UK Government has committed to ensuring that the Welsh (government) budget will not suffer following the loss of European funding, and this promise must be kept. \\"But it is essential that students are at the heart of the negotiations. Any future deal will have a simply staggering impact upon us,\\" a statement added. NUS Wales women's officer Rosie Inman expressed concerns over EU-made laws. She said: \\"The European Union has been essential for helping to strengthen, and introduce, vital equality legislation. \\"The UK government cannot start to erode these rights.\\" Summary:","output":"Beth Button from Universities Wales said that since a lot of people in Wales chose to leave the EU, it might cause some problems. They are worried that young people and communities who don't have a lot of money will lose important funding. They also think leaving the EU could make it difficult for students to study and work in different places, which is a good experience for them. Universities Wales will try to work with other countries and make sure the UK stays a welcoming place for people to come and learn or teach. The NUS wants students to be considered when talking about the changes, and they want young people to be treated fairly with the same rights they had before."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:","output":"Title: Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson Conquers the Legend of \\"Hercules\\" with Unyielding Dedication and Intensive Training Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson, a renowned actor, wrestler, and now the embodiment of the mythical hero, Hercules, has shown an unparalleled commitment to his craft that has left audiences awestruck. In the much-anticipated film \\"Hercules,\\" Johnson takes on the role of the legendary demigod, and he does so with a mesmerizing display of sheer dedication and determination to conquer the physical and emotional demands of the character. Taking a closer look at how Johnson prepared for the role, one can see the grueling training regimen and the tremendous effort he put into transforming himself into the mighty Hercules. The actor, known for his incredible physique and larger-than-life presence, faced the challenge head-on by embracing a highly disciplined and intense training plan. This plan involved not only hours of intensive workouts but also an extraordinary diet plan, which saw him consuming seven meals a day to fuel his Herculean transformation. \\"I trained and worked harder than ever for eight months for this role,\\" Johnson shared on his Instagram, shedding light on the commitment and time he devoted to bringing the character of Hercules to life. The training plan incorporated a balance of weightlifting, cardio, and functional workouts, all cleverly designed to sculpt Johnson's physique in a way that would make the Greek hero proud. It is reported that he would start his days at 4 am with an hour of intense cardio, followed by a 90-minute workout session focused on heavy lifting. These sessions would further be complemented by a functional workout in the afternoon, which included combat training, horseback riding, and stunt work. The importance of the diet plan cannot be emphasized enough. Johnson, who typically weighs around 260 pounds, had to add an extra 20-25 pounds of pure muscle in order to embody the colossal, god-like image of Hercules. To achieve this, he followed a nutrient-dense, high-protein diet consisting of 5,500 calories every day. His meals were strategically planned, with protein sources like chicken, fish, and steak, along with a plethora of vegetables and balanced carbohydrates. \\"I was consuming a massive amount of calories per day...but I had to be smart about it,\\" Johnson recalls, reflecting on the meticulous planning involved in ensuring the right balance of food to support his intensive workouts and help build dense muscle. When asked about the most challenging aspect of the role, Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson was quick to mention the emotional demands of embodying the tragic, yet heroic, character of Hercules. \\"His life's journey is truly that of the ultimate anti-hero... going full circle without being fulfilled...yet always seeking redemption,\\" he explained. Thus, Johnson not only had to meet the physical requirements but also delve deep into the psyche of the mythological figure, showing his prowess as an actor who brings depth and complexity to his character portrayals. Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson's portrayal of Hercules serves as a testament to the actor's inexhaustible drive, discipline, and work ethic. He has undoubtedly proven his ability to conquer the most challenging of roles with unwavering commitment, leaving fans in anticipation of the actor's next legendary transformation. As Johnson continues to inspire through his work and dedication to his craft, the legend of Hercules will remain unforgettable thanks to his hard-earned, larger-than-life performance."},{"instruction":"She told her child it was okay he was that way, and that everyone is what? - afraid of - part old - different - good at - smart  The best answer is A:","output":"different"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - Body temperature rises - The brain tells blood vessels to dilate - The sweat glands become active - Moisture is released from the pores - The moisture evaporates - The evaporation causes cooling.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more cooling occurs happens, how will it affect MORE body cooling occurring.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"If more cooling occurs during the process, the body's response will be adjusted accordingly in an attempt to maintain homeostasis and regulate body temperature. Step-by-step analysis: 1. Body temperature rises. 2. The brain senses the increase in body temperature and initiates the thermoregulation process to maintain a stable internal temperature. 3. The brain instructs blood vessels in the skin to dilate (widen), allowing more blood to flow near the surface of the skin, where it can release heat through radiation. 4. The brain also signals the sweat glands to become active, producing sweat to aid in cooling the body. 5. The sweat, which is primarily composed of water and salts, is released from the pores onto the skin's surface. 6. The moisture on the skin evaporates, converting the liquid into vapor, which removes heat from the body and results in a cooling effect. Perturbation hypothesis: Suppose more cooling occurs. Now, let's consider the impact of more cooling occurring on the process and whether the perturbation has an effect (direct or indirect): 1. If more cooling occurs, the body would respond by adjusting the amount of sweat released and/or the dilation of blood vessels. The main goal is to maintain a stable internal temperature, so if the cooling effect is too strong, the body will try to minimize the cooling process to achieve a balance. 2. As more cooling occurs, the brain senses the change in temperature and may cause blood vessels to constrict (narrow), reducing the blood flow near the skin's surface and decreasing heat loss through radiation. 3. The brain may also reduce the activity of the sweat glands, resulting in less sweat being produced and released from the pores. This would decrease the amount of moisture available for evaporation and, subsequently, the cooling effect of evaporation. 4. With these adjustments, the body will continue to monitor its temperature and make further changes to the thermoregulation process as needed. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of more cooling occurring does have a direct effect on the process. The body's thermoregulation mechanisms, such as blood vessel dilation and sweat gland activation, will adjust to maintain homeostasis and a stable internal temperature."},{"instruction":"Question: What is a place that sells suntan lotion but not food or medicine?

Movie plot: The story is told in flashback by a villager, played by Mervyn Johns, as though to a person visiting after the war. He recounts: one Saturday during the Second World War, a group of seemingly authentic British soldiers arrive in the small, fictitious English village of Bramley End.[1] It is the Whitsun weekend so life is even quieter than usual and there is almost no traffic of any kind. At first they are welcomed by the villagers, until doubts begin to grow about their true purpose and identity. After they are revealed to be German soldiers intended to form the vanguard of an invasion of Britain, they round up the residents and hold them captive in the local church. The vicar is shot after sounding the church bell in alarm. In attempts to reach the outside world, many of the villagers take action. Such plans include writing a message on an egg and giving them to the local paper boy for his mother, but they are crushed when Mrs Fraser's cousin runs over them. Mrs Fraser then puts a note in Cousin Maude's pocket, but she uses it to hold her car window in place; her dog, Edward, then chews it to shreds after it blows onto the back seat. Mrs Collins, the postmistress, manages to kill a German with an axe used for chopping firewood, and tries to telephone elsewhere. The girls on the exchange see her light and decide that she can wait. Mrs Collins waits until she is killed by another German who walks into the shop moments afterwards. The girl at the exchange then picks up the phone, getting no reply. The civilians attempt to escape to warn the local Home Guard, but are betrayed by the village squire, who is revealed to be collaborating with the Germans. Members of the local Home Guard are ambushed and shot by the Germans. They begin to bow in until a young boy, George, succeeds in escaping; despite being shot in the leg, he alerts the army.

Consequently, the most appropriate response would be: B). It is not possible to tell. In order to make an accurate assessment, we would require more context about the subject matter in question. The phrase \\"does it say uh-huh\\" appears to be a casual, informal way of ascertaining whether or not something agrees with or affirms a particular statement. \\"Uh-huh\\" in itself is an informal affirmation, similar to saying \\"yes\\" or \\"I agree\\". However, without the context of what the phrase is referring to, we cannot determine if it is in agreement with \\"Does it say that?\\". To illustrate the point, let's consider two hypothetical examples: Example 1: Person A: \\"Does the book mention anything about taking a break after 90 minutes of intense work?\\" Person B: \\"Does it say uh-huh?\\" In this context, Person B wants to know if the book affirms the idea of taking a break after 90 minutes of intense work. A meaningful evaluation of the hypothesis \\"Does it say that?\\" would be contingent on understanding the book's content in question. Example 2: Person A: \\"Do the cooking instructions suggest that I should let the dough rest for an hour before shaping?\\" Person B: \\"Does it say uh-huh?\\" In this case, Person B is inquiring whether the cooking instructions agree with or mention letting the dough rest for an hour before shaping. Again, the validity of the hypothesis \\"Does it say that?\\" depends on examining the specific cooking instructions. In conclusion, it is not possible to determine the validity of the hypothesis \\"Does it say that?\\" without more context or information regarding the subject matter at hand. Therefore, the appropriate choice, given the available options, is B). It is not possible to tell.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves,  is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.

Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. This famous statement originates from his first inaugural address on March 4, 1933. At the time, the United States was experiencing the Great Depression, a severe worldwide economic downturn that began in 1929 and lasted until the late 1930s. Millions of Americans were out of work, and there was a widespread sense of despair. In this context, Roosevelt's words sought to reassure and inspire the American people, urging them to confront challenges with courage and resilience. The full quote from his speech is: \\"So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.\\" Roosevelt emphasized that fear could exacerbate problems and hinder progress by causing people to act irrationally or to avoid taking the actions necessary for recovery. By characterizing fear as \\"nameless, unreasoning, and unjustified,\\" he highlighted how, at times, fear could be an irrational and counterproductive response to adversity. Furthermore, the quote suggests that fear has a debilitating effect on human will and motivation, restraining individuals from capitalizing on opportunities for growth and improvement. Roosevelt's message was that overcoming this fear would empower people to take the essential steps towards recovery and progress. Roosevelt's famous line resonated with the American people and continues to be remembered and quoted to this day. The sentiment it expresses remains relevant in various situations that demand resilience, adaptability, and courage. In a broader sense, it encompasses the idea that fear, if left unchecked, can hold us back from realizing our full potential. By confronting and overcoming our fears, we can move forward and make progress in both personal and collective endeavors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their fund-raising. The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated  Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any  Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring  Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's  Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money.  Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"It blocked 34 million of Taliban assets, 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits\\" correctly answer the question \\"How much money was frozen after the President applied the same designation to the Taliban?\\"?   a). no.  b). yes.","output":"b). yes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.  - Sir George Henry Martin (3 January 19268 March 2016) was an English record producer, arranger, composer, conductor, audio engineer and musician. He was referred to as the \\"Fifth Beatle\\", including by Paul McCartney, in reference to his extensive involvement on each of the Beatles' original albums. Martin had 30 number-one hit singles in the United Kingdom and 23 number-one hits in the United States.  - Brian Samuel Epstein (19 September 1934 27 August 1967) was an English music entrepreneur, best known for managing the Beatles. Epstein first discovered the Beatles in November 1961 during a lunchtime Cavern Club performance. He was instantly impressed and saw great potential in the group. Epstein was rejected by nearly all major recording companies in London, until he secured a meeting with George Martin, head of EMI's Parlophone label. In May 1962, Martin agreed to sign the Beatles, partly because of Epstein's conviction that the group would become internationally famous.  - Ferry Cross the Mersey is a 1965 musical film featuring Gerry and the Pacemakers . The film , directed by Jeremy Summers , is one of the more uncommon artifacts of the Mersey scene , shown very rarely on television and never issued on video . It was the first to be shot on location in Liverpool after the city 's emergence into the music mainstream ( which had previously seen only Frankie Vaughan , Russ Hamilton , and Billy Fury as stars ) . For authenticity , many scenes were shot in clubs near the home of Gerry and the Pacemakers ' frontman Gerry Marsden . A scene on a ferry ( the Mountwood ) on the River Mersey showed the docks as a backdrop .

Information:  - The American Revolution was a political upheaval that took place between 1765 and 1783 during which colonists in the Thirteen American Colonies rejected the British monarchy and aristocracy, overthrew the authority of Great Britain, and founded the United States of America.  - Sociology is the study of social behaviour or society, including its origins, development, organization, networks, and institutions. It is a social science that uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge about social order, disorder, and change. Many sociologists aim to conduct research that may be applied directly to social policy and welfare, while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes. Subject matter ranges from the micro-sociology level of individual agency and interaction to the macro level of systems and the social structure.  - The term social order can be used in two senses. In the first sense, it refers to a particular set or system of linked social structures, institutions, relations, customs, values and practices, which conserve, maintain and enforce certain patterns of relating and behaving. Examples are the ancient, the feudal, and the capitalist social order. In the second sense, social order is contrasted to social chaos or disorder, and refers to a stable state of society in which the existing social order is accepted and maintained by its members. The problem of order or Hobbesian problem, which is central to much of sociology, political science and political philosophy, is the question how and why it is that social orders exist at all.  - Political Process and the Development of the Black Insurgency 1930-1970 is a 1982 book by sociologist Doug McAdam (published by the University of Chicago Press). It is responsible for laying the theoretical groundwork for the political process model for sociological theory.  - Social science is a major category of academic disciplines, concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society. It in turn has many branches, each of which is considered a \\"social science\\". The main social sciences include economics, political science, human geography, demography, and sociology. In a wider sense, social science also includes some fields in the humanities such as anthropology, archaeology, jurisprudence, history, and linguistics. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original 'science of society', established in the 19th century. A more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences can be found at Outline of social science.  - The United States Constitution is the supreme law of the United States of America. The Constitution, originally comprising seven articles, delineates the national frame of government. Its first three articles entrench the doctrine of the separation of powers, whereby the federal government is divided into three branches: the legislative, consisting of the bicameral Congress; the executive, consisting of the President; and the judicial, consisting of the Supreme Court and other federal courts. Articles Four, Five and Six entrench concepts of federalism, describing the rights and responsibilities of state governments and of the states in relationship to the federal government. Article Seven establishes the procedure subsequently used by the thirteen States to ratify it.  - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking.   - Doug McAdam ( born August 31 , 1951 ) ( Ph.D. 1979 ) is Professor of Sociology at Stanford University . He is the author or co-author of over a dozen books and over fifty articles , and is widely credited as one of the pioneers of the political process model in social movement analysis . He wrote one of the first books on the theory in 1982 when analyzing the U.S. Civil Rights Movement : Political Process and the Development of the Black Insurgency 1930 - 1970 . His other book Freedom Summer won the C. Wright Mills Award in 1990 . He served as the director of the prestigious Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences between 2001 and 2005 . He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003 .  - John Hancock (October 8, 1793) was an American merchant, statesman, and prominent Patriot of the American Revolution. He served as president of the Second Continental Congress and was the first and third Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He is remembered for his large and stylish signature on the United States Declaration of Independence, so much so that the term \\"John Hancock\\" has become, in the United States, a synonym for a signature.  - Welfare is the provision of a minimal level of well-being and social support for citizens without current means to support basic needs. In most developed countries, welfare is largely provided by the government from tax income, and to a lesser extent by charities, informal social groups, religious groups, and inter-governmental organizations.  - Sociological theories are statements of how and why particular facts about the social world are related. They range in scope from concise descriptions of a single social process to paradigms for analysis and interpretation. Some sociological theories explain aspects of the social world and enable prediction about future events, while others function as broad perspectives which guide further sociological analyses.  - Stanford University, officially Leland Stanford Junior University, is a private research university in Stanford, California, adjacent to Palo Alto and between San Jose and San Francisco. Its campus is one of the largest in the United States. Stanford also has land and facilities elsewhere.  - John Adams (October 30 [O.S. October 19] 1735  July 4, 1826) was an American patriot who served as the second President of the United States (17971801) and the first Vice President (178997). He was a lawyer, diplomat, statesman, political theorist, and, as a Founding Father, a leader of the movement for American independence from Great Britain. He was also a dedicated diarist and correspondent, particularly with his wife and closest advisor Abigail.  - The University of Chicago Press is the largest and one of the oldest university presses in the United States. It is operated by the University of Chicago and publishes a wide variety of academic titles, including \\"The Chicago Manual of Style\\", numerous academic journals, and a wide array of advanced monographs in the academic fields.  - The American Academy of Arts and Sciences, frequently known as the American Academy, is one of the oldest and most prestigious honorary societies and a leading center for policy research in the United States. Election to the Academy is considered one of the nation's highest honors since its founding during the American Revolution by John Adams, John Hancock, James Bowdoin, and other scholar-patriots who contributed prominently to the establishment of the new nation, its government, and the United States Constitution.  - San Francisco (SF) (Spanish for Saint Francis) officially the City and County of San Francisco, is the cultural, commercial, and financial center of Northern California. It is the birthplace of the United Nations. Located at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula, San Francisco is about in area, making it the smallest countyand the only consolidated city-countywithin the state of California. With a density of about 18,451 people per square mile (7,124 people per km), San Francisco is the most densely settled large city (population greater than 200,000) in California and the second-most densely populated major city in the United States after New York City. San Francisco is the fourth-most populous city in California, after Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Jose, and the 13th-most populous city in the United Stateswith a census-estimated 2015 population of 864,816. The city and its surrounding areas are known as the San Francisco Bay Area, and are a part of the larger OMB-designated San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland combined statistical area, the fifth most populous in the nation with an estimated population of 8.7 million.  - James Bowdoin II (August 7, 1726  November 6, 1790) was an American political and intellectual leader from Boston, Massachusetts, during the American Revolution and the following decade. He initially gained fame and influence as a wealthy merchant. He served in both branches of the Massachusetts General Court from the 1750s to the 1770s. Although he was initially supportive of the royal governors, he opposed British colonial policy and eventually became an influential advocate of independence. He authored a highly political report on the 1770 Boston Massacre that has been described by historian Francis Walett as one of the most influential pieces of writing that shaped public opinion in the colonies.

After the first three possessions of the game ended in punts, the struck first blood, driving all the way to the Lions 2-yard line, but could only muster a 19-yard field goal by Shayne Graham. The Lions countered, driving 71 yards in 11 plays, scoring on a 19-yard touchdown pass from Shaun Hill to Calvin Johnson. After a Patriots punt, another long Lions drive, going 63 yards in 13 plays, ended with running back Maurice Morris punching through a 1-yard touchdown run, increasing the Lions lead to 14-3. The Patriots answered their touchdown with one of their own, marching 83 yards in 10 plays, scoring on a 15-yard touchdown run by Green-Ellis with 0:45 seconds left in the half. The Lions appeared to have stopped the Patriots after Brady threw an incomplete pass on 3rd-and-6, but DeAndre Levy was called for pass interference, giving the Patriots a 1st down. Stefan Logan returned the ensuing kickoff 30 yards to the Lions 33. The return allowed the Lions to drive to the Patriots 26 and Dave Rayner was good on a 44-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 17-10 halftime lead.

On the third play of the Lions' next drive, Hill was intercepted by McCourty, who returned it 50 yards to the Lions 12. Four plays later, the Patriots put the game out of reach with a 1-yard touchdown run by Green-Ellis, making the score 45-24. During the extra point and afterwards, the Lions were called for three personal fouls, including one on defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh. This allowed the Patriots to kick off from the Lions' 40-yard line, and Graham was able to put the ball through the uprights, to a storm of boos from the Ford Field crowd.

Question: Process:  - Water comes into contact with something made of iron - The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid - As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve - Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen - The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together - They form iron oxide, which is rust -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose erosion occurs at faster pace happens, how will it affect more acid is formed.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you proposed suggests that erosion occurs at a faster pace, which potentially leads to more acid being formed. This scenario can indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the rusting process of iron. Here's a detailed explanation: 1. Direct effect: Faster erosion can lead to an increased exposure of iron surfaces. As erosion removes the outer layers of iron, more of the underlying iron will come into direct contact with water and carbon dioxide present in the air. This increased exposure to the reactants will cause more carbonic acid to form. Consequently, an increase in acid production would accelerate the rusting process, as the iron is reacting more rapidly with the water and the oxygen in the air. 2. Indirect effect: Erosion is the natural process of wearing away rocks, soil, and other materials by wind, water, and other natural agents. As erosion hastens and removes more materials, it can lead to more debris, dust, and sediments. This may result in the accumulation of particles on the iron surface, which could serve as catalysts for the reactions involved in the rusting process. Additionally, the increase in sedimentation can provide more opportunities for water to accumulate on the iron surface, creating pockets of moisture that facilitate rust formation. It is essential to note that various factors can influence the erosion process, such as the environment, temperature, and humidity. Therefore, the extent to which the perturbation will affect the rusting process will also depend on these factors. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation, where erosion occurs at a faster pace and potentially leads to more acid being formed, does have both direct and indirect effects on the rusting process of iron. The enhanced exposure to acids and increased accumulation of debris can contribute to the acceleration of rust formation. However, the actual impact of the perturbation can be influenced by the specific environmental conditions and other factors at play."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Overall, I would give the app 3 stars out of 5, as it does deliver on its promise of providing a more private browsing experience, but it's not without its flaws. On the positive side, the app features a clean and user-friendly layout, making it easy to navigate. The search function works well, and I appreciate knowing that my searches aren't being logged. In addition, the built-in tracker blocker helps keep my browsing habits more secure from online tracking. However, there are some drawbacks to using this app. Firstly, the browsing speed can sometimes be slower compared to more well-established browsers, which might discourage some users. Additionally, I have noticed that websites can occasionally load incorrectly, requiring a browser refresh or even a switch to another browser to fully access the content. Lastly, while the app's core privacy features are appreciated, the lack of secondary features like a built-in password manager or customizable extensions makes it feel somewhat limited in comparison to other popular browsers.

In the Bronx, New York, Joey tries to dissuade Turkey from joining a rival gang, the Fordham Baldies. Before Turkey can ask, Terror's girlfriend Peewee overhears Joey insulting the Baldies, calling them a \\"bunch of pricks with ears\\". Joey and Turkey flee and the Baldies chase them. Richie—the leader of the Wanderers—and Buddy come to help but they also flee from the Baldies. After being cornered, the Wanderers are helped by a tough stranger named Perry, who has recently moved to the Bronx from New Jersey. After much persuasion, Perry joins the Wanderers. In school, the Wanderers get into a racial dispute with another gang, the Del Bombers who are all African-American. Both gangs agree to settle their dispute, seemingly a street fight, but the Wanderers struggle to find a gang willing to back them. With no other options, Richie asks his girlfriend's father, local mafia boss Chubby Galasso, who agrees to help solve the gangs' dispute. During a game of \\"elbow-tit\\", Richie gropes a woman called Nina. He feels ashamed of himself, apologizes for his actions and persuades Nina to accept Joey's telephone number.

Does \\"West Antarctica was partially in the Northern Hemisphere, and during this period large amounts of sandstones, limestones and shales were deposited.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"In what hemisphere did west Antarctica share during the Cambrian?\\"","output":"Yes, the statement \\"West Antarctica was partially in the Northern Hemisphere during this period large amounts of sandstones, limestones and shales were deposited.\\" does contain the correct answer to the question \\"In what hemisphere did West Antarctica share during the Cambrian?\\"  The Cambrian Period (about 541 to 485.4 million years ago) marked a significant event in the history of Earth's evolution, as it was the time when most of the major groups of animals first appeared in the fossil record. This period saw a tremendous diversification of life, often referred to as the \\"Cambrian Explosion\\" of biodiversity. During the Cambrian Period, the configuration of continents was very different from what it is today. It is essential to understand the paleogeography – the ancient arrangement and movement of landmasses and oceans – to appreciate how West Antarctica was situated in the past. The continents were slowly drifting away from an earlier supercontinent called Pannotia that existed during the Neoproterozoic. As they moved, the continents underwent different degrees of separation, ultimately leading to the formation of the continents as we know them today. West Antarctica was located in the lower northern hemisphere during the Cambrian Period. The statement also mentions the deposition of large amounts of sandstones, limestones, and shales during this time. These sedimentary rocks are essential in reconstructing the geological history of the area, as they provide critical information about the depositional environments, paleoclimates, and bio-events of the Cambrian Period. Sandstones and limestones indicate the presence of shallow marine environments, where the accumulation of sand and calcium carbonate occurred. Shales are often formed through fine-grained sediment deposits in relatively deep marine basins. In conclusion, the given statement accurately describes West Antarctica's placement in the Northern Hemisphere during the Cambrian Period, as well as the deposition of various sedimentary rock types. This information is essential for understanding the geological history, paleogeography, and paleoenvironment of West Antarctica. Therefore, the correct answer to the question \\"In what hemisphere did West Antarctica share during the Cambrian?\\" is the Northern Hemisphere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Injured: NYPD officer Andrew Dossi (above) was visited by Mayor de Blasio and Commissioner Bill Bratton at St. Barnabas Hospital Monday night after he and his partner were shot by robbers. Not welcome: 'He wasn’t too happy about the Mayor’s visit,' said Joe Dossi, the officer's father, about Mayor Bill de Blasio (above) coming by the hospital. 'He deals with some crappy people every day and getting no support (from Mayor de Blasio), come on,' added the elder Dossi while speaking with the New York Post. 'These are the guys in the trenches dealing with anything and everything.' This is reference to Mayor de Blasio's comments in the wake of a grand jury's decision not to indict the cop that killed Staten Island resident Eric Garner after placing the man in a chokehold for selling loose cigarettes that he worries for his son Dante, who is half-black, and how his interactions with the police will go as the young man grows up. The elder Dossi also said he told Mayor de Blasio that men like his son were 'laying theit lives on the line' when he came into the hospital room Monday night. The man also said he liked Commissioner Bratton, who he saw  as 'a real legitimate guy.' Officer Dorsi, an Iraq veteran, was shot in the back and the arm.

The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.  Question: \\"Name few regions from the story?\\" Response: \\"Antartica\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"No, the response to the question is not factually correct.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: What Roman road, which began to be constructed in 312 BC, connected Rome to Brindisi in southeast Italy? Answer:","output":"The Roman road that began to be constructed in 312 BC and connected Rome to Brindisi in southeast Italy is known as the Via Appia or the Appian Way. This ancient roadway, stretching approximately 350 miles (560 kilometers), is one of the oldest and most significant roads in the Roman Republic and was of strategic importance to the Roman Empire. The Via Appia was named after Appius Claudius Caecus, a Roman censor who initially commissioned the road's construction. Its primary purpose was to facilitate the transportation of troops, goods, and resources between Rome and its vital southeastern territories, which included the regions of Latium, Campania, and Samnium. Beginning at the Porta Capena in Rome, the Via Appia extended south across the Alban Hills and passed through numerous ancient cities such as Aricia, Terracina, Minturnae, and Venusia. From there, it continued through the towns of Tarentum and Uria before reaching its final destination at the bustling port city of Brindisi. This route effectively linked Rome to its key provinces and served as a vital line of communication and commerce for the empire. Throughout its existence, the Via Appia underwent several reconstructions and expansions, reflecting the growing territorial ambitions of the Roman Republic and later the Roman Empire. One such example is the extension of the roadway to the Adriatic Sea by Emperor Trajan in the early 2nd century AD. By this time, the Appian Way had acquired a reputation as a symbol of Rome's military prowess and imperial reach. As well as its significance as a strategic and commercial route, the Via Appia played a vital role in the cultural and political landscape of Rome. Prestigious and wealthy Roman citizens would often possess properties along the roadway, and monuments, tombs, and landmarks were constructed to commemorate significant historical events or the achievements of renowned individuals. The most famous of these is the tomb of the Roman general and statesman, Quintus Fabius Maximus, who was buried along the road in 203 BC. Despite its significance and grand feat of engineering, the eventual decline of the Roman Empire led to a decline in the maintenance and use of the Via Appia. As droves of travelers and merchants sought alternative routes, many sections of the Appian Way were abandoned or fell into disrepair. However, some parts remain surprisingly well-preserved to this day, while others have been incorporated into modern infrastructure, serving as a testament to the Via Appia's historical importance and lasting legacy. In conclusion, the Via Appia, constructed in 312 BC, was a monumental achievement in Roman engineering, connecting Rome to Brindisi in southeast Italy. Serving as a vital strategic, economic, and cultural asset, it played a significant role in the expansion and maintenance of the Roman Empire and shaped the historical landscape of the region for centuries. Today, the remains of the Appian Way offer a fascinating glimpse into the grandeur and ambition of ancient Rome's most important and lasting road."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Drilling fluids are necessary for borehole stability in deep cores, and can also be used to circulate cuttings away from the bit.  Fluids used include water, ethanol/water and water/ethylene glycol mixtures, petroleum fuels, non-aromatic hydrocarbons, and n-butyl acetate. Water is the cheapest and cleanest option; it may be present on the glacial surface or may be created by thermal drilling.  In cold ice some form of antifreeze is necessary, or heat must be reapplied by reaming the hole periodically. Ethanol and water.  Ethanol acts as an anti-freeze in water; at sufficient concentrations it can reduce the freezing temperature of the mixture to well below any temperature likely to be encountered in ice drilling.  The concentration must be chosen to prevent the liquid freezing and also to maintain the borehole against the ice overburden pressure.  Because the density of the mixture decreases with lower temperatures, vertical convection will develop in boreholes where temperatures decrease with depth, as the lighter mixture rises.  This causes slush to form in the borehole, though successful drilling is still possible.  Ethanol is one of the cheapest options for a drilling fluid, and requires less storage space than other options because in use it is diluted with water.  A Soviet expedition left an 800 m borehole in Antarctica filled with ethanol and water at an ice temperature of −53 °C; after 11 months the borehole remained open and drilling was resumed with no problems.  A problem with this option is that the mixture will penetrate cores that have cracks.

His best-known works include the opera \\"Peter Grimes\\" (1945), the \\"War Requiem\\" (1962) and the orchestral showpiece \\"The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra\\" (1945).  - Henry Purcell (or ; c. 10 September 1659  21 November 1695) was an English composer. Although incorporating Italian and French stylistic elements into his compositions, Purcell's legacy was a uniquely English form of Baroque music. He is generally considered to be one of the greatest English composers; no other native-born English composer approached his fame until Edward Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams, and Benjamin Britten in the 20th century.  - Baroque music (or ) is a style of Western art music composed from approximately 1600 to 1750. This era followed the Renaissance music era, and was followed in turn by the Classical era. Baroque music forms a major portion of the \\"classical music\\" canon, being widely studied, performed, and listened to. Key composers of the Baroque era include Johann Sebastian Bach, Antonio Vivaldi, George Frideric Handel, Claudio Monteverdi, Domenico Scarlatti, Alessandro Scarlatti, Henry Purcell, Georg Philipp Telemann, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Arcangelo Corelli, Tomaso Albinoni, François Couperin, Giuseppe Tartini, Heinrich Schütz, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, Dieterich Buxtehude, and Johann Pachelbel.    What object entity has the relation of 'movement' with the subject 'daniel purcell'?   Choices: - baroque  - baroque music  - classical music Answer:","output":"The object entity that has the relation of 'movement' with the subject 'Daniel Purcell' is \\"Baroque music.\\" Daniel Purcell was an English Baroque composer, and the term 'movement' typically refers to a self-contained part of a larger musical work, such as a symphony or suite. In the context of Baroque music, these movements were often characterized by contrasts in tempo and mood. Baroque music, as a style of Western art music, was composed between approximately 1600 and 1750. It followed the Renaissance music era and preceded the Classical era. Baroque music is known for its intricate melodies, rich harmonies, and elaborate ornamentation. Many of these compositions were built on the principles of tonality and the use of basso continuo, which provided a strong foundation for the melodies and harmonic structures. Several key composers of the Baroque era, in addition to Daniel Purcell, include Johann Sebastian Bach, Antonio Vivaldi, George Frideric Handel, Claudio Monteverdi, Domenico Scarlatti, Alessandro Scarlatti, Henry (Daniel's brother or cousin) Purcell, Georg Philipp Telemann, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Arcangelo Corelli, Tomaso Albinoni, François Couperin, Giuseppe Tartini, Heinrich Schütz, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, Dieterich Buxtehude, and Johann Pachelbel. These composers contributed immensely to the development and evolution of Baroque music through their innovative compositions and unique styles. The movement-related aspects of their works, such as tempo and pattern variations, allowed for greater emotional depth and expression. In the case of Daniel Purcell and other Baroque composers, their exploration of musical movement within the Baroque genre played an essential role in establishing their lasting impact on the world of classical music."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The premiere, originally planned for 14 September 1863, was postponed to the 30th because of the illness of the soprano lead, Léontine de Maësen. The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer Louis Gallet, who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as \\"a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes...\\" The audience's appreciation was not reflected in the majority of the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage. Gustave Bertrand in Le Ménestrel wrote that \\"this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success, and even then we prefer to have the composer dragged on in spite of himself, or at least pretending to be\\". Another critic surmised that the calls for the composer had been orchestrated by a \\"claque\\" of Bizet's friends, strategically distributed.Of the opera itself, Benjamin Jouvin of Le Figaro wrote: \\"There were neither fishermen in the libretto nor pearls in the music\\".

Hypothesis: If I have another novel to write, I'll write it. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, it is essential to analyze the statements and their relationship in a logical manner. An entailment occurs when the truth of one statement guarantees the truth of the other statement. Premise: I will only write another novel if I have another novel to write. In logical terms, this statement translates to: Writing a novel → Having another novel to write. Here, the act of writing another novel is dependent on having another novel to write. If someone genuinely writes another novel, it necessarily implies that they had another novel to write. Hypothesis: If I have another novel to write, I'll write it. In logical terms, this statement translates to: Having another novel to write → Writing a novel. This time, the implication goes in the opposite direction. If an individual has another novel to write, then they will undoubtedly write it.  To check whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to examine whether the premise's truth will guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. Although both statements share similar elements (writing a novel and having a novel to write), their implications go in opposing directions. The premise states that the act of writing another novel rests on having another novel to write. Essentially, it implies that without another novel to write, the person would not write a new novel. However, it does not guarantee that they will unconditionally write a novel if they have another one to write. On the other hand, the hypothesis asserts that if the person has another novel to write, they will surely write it. The hypothesis effectively establishes a stronger commitment to writing the novel simply due to its existence. Thus, in conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.

How to slow cook ribs  Prepare the ribs for the grill by trimming away any visual fat and then applying your favorite rub, or just season them with salt and pepper.  Prepare the propane grill by turning it on and letting it heat up, or by lighting a charcoal grill and then letting it heat until the coals begin to turn grey.  Place the ribs on the grill.","output":"After placing the ribs on the grill, lower the heat to maintain a consistent temperature of around 225-250°F (107-121°C) for the perfect slow-cooking atmosphere. If using a charcoal grill, arrange the coals on one side of the grill and place the ribs on the opposite side, allowing them to cook through indirect heat. In case you're using a propane grill, simply turn off the burners directly under the ribs and keep the other burners on low.  To ensure even cooking and to retain their tenderness, be sure to place the ribs bone side down on the grill grate. Cover the grill with its lid for optimal heat circulation, which will create a convection-like cooking environment. Throughout the slow cooking process, periodically check the temperature of the grill, maintaining the heat levels by adjusting the grill vents or adding more charcoal as needed. It's crucial to limit the amount of times you lift the lid to avoid losing heat and lengthening the cooking time.  For an added depth of flavor, you may consider placing a heat-resistant tray filled with a mixture of water, apple cider, or beer beneath the grilling grate. This will not only introduce moisture into the cooking environment, but it will also catch any dripping fat and prevent flare-ups. As the ribs continue to cook, be sure to baste them with your preferred barbecue sauce or mop sauce every 45-60 minutes, ensuring they stay moist throughout the process.  Generally, slow cooking ribs can take anywhere from 4-6 hours, depending on their thickness and the temperature maintained within the grill. To determine whether the ribs are cooked to perfection, use a meat thermometer to check that their internal temperature has reached at least 190°F (88°C). At this point, the meat should be tender and pull away easily from the bone. Once the ribs have reached the desired level of tenderness, remove them from the grill and let them rest for about 10 minutes, allowing the juices to redistribute and the flavors to fully settle. By mastering the skill of slow cooking ribs, you'll be able to treat your family and friends to a mouth-watering, savory dish that is sure to impress at your next barbecue gathering. The key to success is patience, as giving the ribs ample time to cook will result in a tender and flavorful meal. Moreover, utilizing your preferred choice of seasonings, sauces, and wood chips can enhance the overall taste of the ribs, creating a truly memorable culinary experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please capitalize where necessary: packaging is important for creating a brand image in any market where products are competing for a share of the market.","output":"\\"Packaging is important for creating a brand image in any market where products are competing for a share of the market.\\" The provided sentence is already grammatically correct, including the capitalization. 'Packaging' is properly capitalized as the start of the sentence, and there are no specific names or titles present that would require additional capitalization. As a reminder, here are the general rules for proper capitalization in English: - The first letter of each sentence should be capitalized. - Proper nouns, which are the names of specific people, places, organizations, and sometimes things, should always be capitalized. - The pronoun 'I' is always capitalized. - Abbreviations and acronyms are usually capitalized. - The first letter of each word in a title, except for certain short words, such as articles and short prepositions, is typically capitalized. In this context, the term 'packaging' is not a proper noun needing capitalization. Branding and marketing terms are generally not treated as proper nouns unless they're part of an official title or name. Although 'packaging' is a significant concept in marketing and branding, it is used here in a general sense to indicate the act of designing and producing packages. Likewise, the term 'brand image' is not capitalized as it is a general term used to describe how a brand is perceived by the public. This term can vary greatly from one company or product to another and, therefore, is not considered a specific proper noun. The word 'market' also doesn't require capitalization here. Although it represents a significant business concept, it's used idiomatically in this sentence to refer to the general business environment rather than a specific market or named entity that would require capitalization.  Hence, the sentence is already correctly capitalized as it is."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Step 1: Calculate the area of the rectangle. Area of the rectangle = Length * Width = 50 cm * 10 cm = 500 cm² Step 2: Determine the area of the square. Since the area of the square is 5 times the area of the rectangle, the area of the square = 5 * (Area of the rectangle) = 5 * 500 cm² = 2500 cm² Step 3: Find the side length of the square. The area of the square = Side * Side or Side² To find the side length, we need to take the square root of the area. Side = √(Area of the square) = √2500 cm² = 50 cm Step 4: Determine the perimeter of the square. The perimeter of the square is the sum of all its sides, which are equal in length. Perimeter = 4 * Side = 4 * 50 cm = 200 cm Now, let's choose the answer from the options. The correct answer is b) 200 cm."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After a few days of feeling terrible his brother comes by to check his temperature noting that it is 100.6°F.  But I can use this background: White blood cells also make chemicals that cause a fever. A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection.  What is an answer for this question: Will being sick with a bacterial infection cause a person's body temperature to increase or decrease? A:","output":"Being sick with a bacterial infection, such as strep throat in James' case, will cause a person's body temperature to increase. This increase in body temperature is known as a fever.

Here is an article: Matthew Staver for The New York Times Linda Vargas works as a volunteer in Denver with Mi Familia Vota, which helps Latinos become citizens and register to vote. DENVER — The nation’s rapidly growing Latino population is one of the most powerful forces working in President Obama’s favor in many of the states that will determine his contest with Mitt Romney. But Latinos are not registering or voting in numbers that fully reflect their potential strength, leaving Hispanic leaders frustrated and Democrats worried as they increase efforts to rally Latino support. Interviews with Latino voters across the country suggested a range of reasons for what has become, over a decade, an entrenched pattern of nonparticipation, ranging from a distrust of government to a fear of what many see as an intimidating effort by law enforcement and political leaders to crack down on immigrants, legal or not. Here in Denver, Ben Monterosso, the executive director of Mi Familia Vota, or My Family Votes, a national group that helps Latinos become citizens and register to vote, gathered organizers around a table in his office and recited census data demonstrating the lack of Latino participation. “Our potential at the ballot box is not being maximized,” Mr. Monterosso told them. “The untapped potential is there.” More than 21 million Latinos will be eligible to vote this November, clustered in pockets from Colorado to Florida, as well as in less obvious states like Illinois, Iowa, North Carolina and Virginia. Yet just over 10 million of them are registered, and even fewer turn out to vote. In the 2008 presidential election, when a record 10 million Latinos showed up at the polls nationwide, that amounted to just half of the eligible voters. By contrast, 66 percent of eligible whites and 65 percent of eligible blacks voted, according to a study by the Pew Hispanic Center. That disparity is echoed in swing states across the country. In Nevada, 42 percent of eligible Hispanics are registered, while just 35 percent are registered in Virginia, according to Latino Decisions, which studies Latino voting trends. Although Latinos do not turn up at the polls in the same numbers, relative to their population, as other ethnic groups, their overall numbers are growing so rapidly that they are nevertheless on the verge of becoming the powerful force in American politics that officials in both parties have long anticipated — an effect that would only be magnified should they somehow begin to match the voting percentages of other ethnic groups. Mr. Obama’s campaign has seized on that as a central part of his re-election strategy, with an early burst of three Spanish-language television advertisements in four swing states, including Colorado, and voter registration drives in Latino neighborhoods. “Hi, are you registered to vote?” Linda Vargas, 62, called out in English and Spanish to people walking into a public library on the outskirts of Denver as she sat behind a table stacked with voter registration forms. This segment of the American electorate is by any measure sprawling, with near-explosive population growth in places like California and Texas and growing numbers in swing states like Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Nevada and New Mexico. Their presence in such politically important states has only fed the frustration of Latino organizers over their underrepresentation at the polls. Matt A. Barreto, an associate professor of political science at the University of Washington and head of Latino Decisions, said the population growth had produced a higher Latino vote in every presidential election over the last decade, a number that had the effect of masking the political apathy of many Latino voters. “The population growth has driven increases in the Latino vote every year,” he said. “But we still need to confront a registration gap that is quite significant.” Jim Messina, Mr. Obama’s campaign manager, said Latino voters were a critical factor in the president’s re-election hopes. “Look, if we do our job right and have a good ground game, I absolutely believe that Latino voters can be one of the big reasons we win this election,” he said. Officials in Mr. Romney’s campaign argued that he would cut into Mr. Obama’s Latino support by challenging his record on the economy, and how, they said, it had been particularly harmful to Latinos. Last week, the Romney campaign posted a Spanish-language advertisement on its Web site pointing to rising unemployment among Latinos.

It said it’s taking a 4 billion charge to cover a “breakup fee” it negotiated upfront with T-Mobile’s parent company, Deutsche Telekom “in the event the transaction does not receive regulatory approval.”      Supporters of the deal said this could open the door for more serious settlement talks.      “This is a smart move by AT&T/T-Mobile that will hopefully place emphasis on reaching a settlement that assures the benefits of the deal while addressing the challenges,” Dean Garfield, president and CEO of The Information Technology Industry Council, told POLITICO Thursday. The trade group had backed the deal in the hopes it would spur more wireless broadband.      AT&T and Deustche Telekom said in a statement that they took the action after FCC staff said Tuesday that Chairman Julius Genachowski would seek to block the wireless megadeal by designating it for an administrative hearing. Commission staff told reporters Wednesday that they believed the pairing of the nation’s second- and fourth-largest wireless carriers would reduce competition in the wireless market. They also said it wouldn’t produce the benefits for consumers in terms of jobs and expansion of wireless broadband.      AT&T and Deutsche Telekom said they electronically withdrew the application with the FCC on Wednesday.      The move was the first crack in the veneer of a deal that was announced in March with great fanfare and promise.      AT&T set about waging an intensive campaign through advertisements and lobbying to convince the public, state and federal regulators, unions and members of Congress that the pairing with T-Mobile would help fuel the sputtering U.S. economy. The company said the deal would add up to 96,000 jobs to the economy and help fulfill President Barack Obama’s goal of spreading broadband Internet services to all corners of the nation.      While lawmakers weighed in on both sides of the deal, the first sign that the Obama administration would fight approval came in August, when the Justice Department filed suit in U.S. District Court to block the transaction. But the companies vowed to fight back while keeping the prospect of a possible settlement open.      On Thursday, some of the public interest groups that opposed the deal called on AT&T to back away from the deal entirely. ||||| The withdrawal of the F.C.C. application “is a tacit acknowledgment by AT&T that this story is all but over,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. “The fat lady hasn’t started singing yet, but she’s holding the mike, and the band is about to play.”      The efforts by the Justice Department’s antitrust division and the F.C.C. to block the merger reflect a reinvigoration of federal efforts to rein in excessive business practices after a prolonged period of deregulation that preceded the 2008 financial crisis.      President Obama came into office pledging to take a harder look at the antitrust implications of proposed mergers, but the Justice Department was criticized by consumer groups in its first year for appearing hesitant to follow through on that promise.      Similarly, the F.C.C. drew rebukes for its approval last year of the merger between Comcast and NBC Universal , which critics claimed would concentrate too much power over both television content and its transmission to consumers.      Photo      The move this week to conduct a hearing on the cellphone deal was the first time the F.C.C. had done so on a merger since the 2002 proposed alliance between Echostar and Direct TV, which ultimately was scrapped.      In the current case, however, AT&T has noted that expansion of the nation’s Internet infrastructure is one of Mr. Obama’s top goals to help rebuild the economy, and the F.C.C. itself has predicted that its recent initiative to expand broadband Internet access to rural areas would create hundreds of thousands of jobs.      Consumer groups, which generally have opposed the merger, said this week’s combined actions indicated that the deal was falling apart.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      “The chances that AT&T will take over T-Mobile are almost gone,” Gigi B. Sohn, president of the consumer group Public Knowledge, said in a statement. “While you can never count out AT&T entirely, the fact that they pulled their F.C.C. application speaks volumes about the company’s lack of confidence” in getting approval.      Deutsche Telekom, based in Germany , said in a statement that the withdrawal “is being undertaken by both companies to consolidate their strength and to focus their continuing efforts on obtaining antitrust clearance for the transaction from the Department of Justice. As soon as practical, Deutsche Telekom and AT&T intend to seek necessary F.C.C. approval.”      AT&T issued its own statement saying that the companies were taking this step “to facilitate the consideration of all options at the F.C.C.,” as well as to consider other options.      The company said the 4 billion pretax charge, to be taken in the current quarter, reflects a 3 billion cash payment and 1 billion worth of cellular airwaves, or spectrum, that AT&T must pay to T-Mobile’s parent if the merger does not receive regulatory approval.

The commission is not obligated to grant the request, however. It could deny the request, going ahead with its consideration and judicial hearing, or it could grant the request with prejudice, meaning that AT&T could not later refile the application. That would essentially kill the deal.      When AT&T agreed to buy T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom in March, the deal looked like a happy ending for T-Mobile, which had been bleeding customers and battling against declining sales. The company has struggled to retain and add new customers as AT&T, Verizon and Sprint have attracted new mobile phone shoppers with popular handsets like the iPhone and the promise of faster networks and data services.      Photo      Over the last eight quarters, the mobile industry over all has added a net 33 million customers in the United States; T-Mobile has added only 89,000 of those, according to Chetan Sharma, an independent wireless analyst.      A dissolution of the merger could leave T-Mobile in a much worse position than it was prior to March, when the acquisition was first announced. Analysts say that since then, the company most likely froze any major negotiations with smartphone and tablet manufactures like Apple to avoid interfering with any deals under way between AT&T and those hardware vendors.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      That could severely limit T-Mobile’s ability to lure customers from competitors over the coming quarters if the merger is abandoned. But the spectrum that T-Mobile would receive from AT&T in a breakup could help the company, perhaps making it attractive to another company or investment group looking to get into the cellular and mobile broadband business.      Deutsche Telekom has made clear that it no longer wants to be in the mobile phone business in the United States, saying it would stop investing in cellular infrastructure here to concentrate on its European operations. If the merger falls through, the German company may decide to spin off the unit as an independent entity, sell it at a less attractive price to a rival like Sprint Nextel or sell it off in pieces. Possible proceeds from the deal had been earmarked to reduce debt and buy back stock.      While there has long been talk about a possible combination of T-Mobile with Sprint, the Justice Department’s opposition to the AT&T combination would seem to indicate problems for Sprint, the No. 3 cellphone carrier. Verizon is currently the largest carrier, but the AT&T purchase of T-Mobile would have vaulted the combined entity into first place.      For AT&T, the acquisition of T-Mobile and its wireless spectrum could mean improved service and network quality, crucial for helping the carrier ramp up its rivalry with Verizon.      AT&T has been looking for ways to keep an edge over the other carriers since losing its exclusivity as the sole carrier of the iPhone in the United States earlier this year.      Analysts expected that acquiring T-Mobile would give AT&T the ability to price its plans and handsets more aggressively, since hardware makers might be willing to offer AT&T a lower rate for large volume purchases of new smartphones and tablet computers.      Even if AT&T wins its case with the Justice Department, it must receive F.C.C. approval to be able to take over T-Mobile’s licenses to operate its network on the public airwaves.      The decision by the F.C.C. to request a judicial hearing on the merger had already caused Christopher C. King, a telecommunications analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, to put the probability of the deal being completed as low as 10 to 20 percent.      “At some point,” Mr. King said, “AT&T is going to have to face the reality that this deal is pretty much dead.” |||||","output":"AT&T and T-Mobile have withdrawn their application to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for approval of their 39 billion merger deal. However, the companies still plan to pursue the sale of T-Mobile's wireless assets to AT&T by seeking approval from the Department of Justice, either at trial or through settlement. This comes after AT&T made its first public statement about the possibility of the deal not receiving regulatory approval, taking a 4 billion charge to cover a \\"breakup fee\\" it had negotiated with T-Mobile's parent company, Deutsche Telekom.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation.  Now, I have a new situation: Jason recently learned that he has cancer. After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out. After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure. Relieved at this news, Jason was now focused on battling his cancer and fighting as hard as he could to survive.  Answer this question please: Who has less abnormal cells in their body?

Moreover, healthy blood circulation allows the kidneys to perform their functions, including the stimulation of red blood cell production."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What was the last name of the person who began investigating the costs of the capitol project? from the following article ?  William H. Berry was elected in 1906, shortly after the dedication, to the office of State Treasurer on a reform \\"fusion ticket\\". Berry was the only Democrat elected to a statewide office from 1895 to 1934. His successful campaign was deemed by Governor Pennypacker to be \\"one of those freaks of ill fortune\\". Berry began investigating the costs of the capitol project and brought its 13 million pricetag to the attention of the public. Part of the reason for the discrepancy was Pennsylvania's \\"over-elaborate\\" and sometimes \\"unintelligible\\" method of \\"ordering and purchasing supplies, equipment [and] furnishings, commonly called the 'per-foot rule' \\". Because the methods of measuring under the \\"per-foot rule\\" were not rigorously enforced, furnishing could be, intentionally, overpriced by the supplier. For example, a flagpole installed on the capitol roof was priced at 850; Berry estimated the value of the pole to have been only 150. Other expenses included 1,619 for a 125 bootblack stand and 3,257 for a 325 \\"mahogany case in the Senate barber shop\\".Pennypacker tried to demonstrate that costs associated with the capitol were reasonable in comparison with similar notable structures.  He pointed out that the United States Capitol cost 18 million, but had \\"fifty-five less [rooms] than the Capitol at Harrisburg.\\" Pennypacker also showed how the New York State Capitol had cost 24 million, and was still unfinished. After an investigation, a total of five people, including Huston, were convicted, on December 18, 1908, and sentenced to two years in prison for \\"conspiring with State officials to defraud the State in the erection and furnishing of the Capitol.\\" The Superintendent of Public Ground and Buildings James Shumaker and Auditor General William P. Snyder were also convicted. Among the convicted, John H. Sanderson and William L. Mathues died before going to prison. Answer:","output":"The last name of the person who began investigating the costs of the capitol project is Berry. William H. Berry was the State Treasurer who brought the 13 million pricetag of the capitol project to the attention of the public."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What are the names of the people who are born to the same mother? is inside the article: The film opens as a pregnant woman gives birth to a vampire. A young Brother, Silus, aged 10–13 is told this child, Edgar and he are from the same mother. Throughout this introduction, the mother is in visible emotional distress, reaching out across the room to Silus, trying to touch him. Captioned \\"100 Years Later.\\" Jamestown slum has had a series of attacks on women, who are all found with their throats bitten. Lilly Squires is in charge of the human police investigating these cases. She states that she comes from a workhouse in this same slum, and we establish that she is one of the few cops who care what happens to these people at the bottom of the socioeconomic heap.  Lilly finds a small boy who witnesses one attack, and tells her that a Brother was responsible. As the police don't want to panic the city, the string of murders is explained away as being the result of an outbreak of the rampant influenza virus. Silus is detailed by the church cardinals to work with the human police, because the Brothers know that these attacks have been carried out by a Brother; Silus's brother Edgar. Edgar has sent Silus a recording of his last murder, challenging him to find and stop him before he kills again. Edgar provides the location of his next murder. With Silus' help, Lilly puts together a task force to stake out the area Edgar has targeted. However Edgar distracts the cops and attacks Lilly, biting her in the neck. An officer interrupts the attack and Edgar flees. To save Lilly's life, Silus tells her to drink his blood, which she does. Silus then pursues Edgar, managing to shoot him with a tranquilizing dart. Silus later visits Lilly in hospital. We establish that she has no family as they died from influenza. Lilly is having visions from drinking Silus' blood. The newspapers have published a fake story of the death of the killer; a deranged human who believed he was a Brother., can you guess it ?

When she went home she told her friends about it. They then wanted to go themselves. Hypothesis: Tina went home after her vacation was over.","output":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that \\"Tina went home after her vacation was over\\" from the given context. Extensive evidences lend support to this conclusion. The conclusion revolves around a person named Tina, and her activities are discussed exclusively.  The initial phrase introduces us to Tina and her experience of had to go back on the ferry. The term \\"had to go back\\" indicates a return journey from a certain place, which can be perceived as the location of her vacation.  The next sentence, \\"Her vacation was coming to an end\\", consolidates the idea that Tina was indeed on vacation and was now wrapping it up. This further bolsters the belief that she had been spending her time at a location that necessitated the ferry ride for her to return home. In addition, the phrase \\"So she was excited about it\\", suggests that the ending of the vacation elicits emotions of elation in Tina. This could be interpreted as her enthusiasm to return home after her vacation. When reading \\"When she went home she told her friends about it\\", it establishes the fact that her vacation has ended, and she indeed returned home. She expresses the details of her vacation to her friends which further confirms the hypothesis. The final sentence, \\"They then wanted to go themselves\\" implies that her friends found her vacation experience appealing, and decided that they might want to go there themselves. This piece of information isn't directly linked to confirming the hypothesis, but it affirms that Tina has indeed completed her vacation and returned home, because she is in a position to share her experiences, which leads to her friends wanting to have similar experiences. Hence, based on the context provided, we can confidently confirm the hypothesis that Tina did return home after her vacation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Chinese put up with a lot living in the world's most populous country: standing on over-crowded trains for 40 hours; sleeping outside hospitals to secure a doctor's appointment; waiting more than a year to earn a driver's license.  Add getting a U.S. entry visa to the list. Applicants here have waited as long as 60 days to secure an appointment at one of five U.S. consular locations in China that process visas. There, they're often greeted by long lines, followed by a face-to-face interview that can end badly in a matter of seconds.  Now there are only about 100 U.S. visa officers in China, facing considerable challenges during the summer when tourists and students travel the most. \\"It's not easy work,\\" Charles Bennett, minister-counselor for Consular Affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, said to his staff. \\"You're making, in some cases, life-changing decisions many times a day, and that can cause great tiredness.\\"  To adapt, US consular services expanded their hours, took on about a dozen additional staff and hope to have another 20 officers by spring. More facilities are also being expanded.  Despite the shocking numbers, the embassy remains troubled by charges that it rejects applicants unreasonably and that the process is unfairly burdensome. \\"I'm fed up,\\" said Wendy Liu, 24. The single woman from Beijing said she was recently refused a visa and told to re-apply when her personal life and finances were more stable. \\"I'll go anywhere but the U.S. now,\\" she said. \\"I thought America was supposed to be a country of freedom.\\"  To visit the US, Chinese nationals must prove that they have enough money and family or business ties that make it likely they'll return to China. The Department of Homeland Security said it did not keep records on how many Chinese overstay their visas.  Student visas can be refused on grounds of national security. Beijing native Tan Ge, 25, believes he was not accepted after he stated his interests in infrared technology and nanoelectronics on his application. He now studies in Canada after being forced to abandon a full scholarship to Arizona State University.  By its very nature, the on-the-spot process at the U.S. Embassy can feel unbearable to Chinese applicants, who are asked to take their bank statements, property deeds , marriage licenses and HUKOU, a Chinese household ID.  \\"It made me feel very uncomfortable,\\" said Xu Yong, 28, a journalist who needed a business visa last month to cover a conference in New York. \\"They made me feel like someone from a Third World country up to no good.\\"  After giving his fingerprints, Xu waited to be called for his interview, sitting in an area that was as quiet as a library. Each passing minute seemed to be as long as a century.  After an hour, Xu was called with three other people to a window for their interview. Two were rejected before his turn. Then the American officer, speaking fluent Chinese, reached for Xu's paperwork, asked some simple questions and said, \\"Congratulations.\\"  \\"I was so nervous.

Hypothesis: The nara melon not an important food plant in its native range.","output":"Based on the context provided, it would be incorrect to draw the hypothesis that the nara melon is not an important food plant in its native range. On the contrary, the context explicitly states that \\"Acanthosicyos horridus\\", commonly known as the nara melon, is an important food plant in its native range. To further elaborate, the context provides important information about the Acanthosicyos genus of thorny shrubs, which belong to the Cucurbitaceae family (also known as the gourd family) and are from the subfamily Cucurbitoideae. The genus name, Acanthosicyos, is derived from Greek, where \\"akantha\\" means thorn and \\"sykios\\" refers to cucumber or gourd. This provides a little insight into the plant's appearance and characteristics, particularly its thorny nature and close relationship to cucumbers and gourds. The context also specifies that the Acanthosicyos genus is endemic to the Namib Desert in Africa. Being endemic to a region implies that the genus consists of unique species that can only be found in that particular region and nowhere else. Within this genus, there are two known species, and one of them is Acanthosicyos horridus, or the nara melon. The nara melon is mentioned to be an important food plant within its native range. This statement leads us to conclude that, within the Namib Desert, the nara melon serves as a significant source of nutrition and sustenance for the people, animals, or insects residing or relying on that region's ecosystem. In conclusion, drawing a hypothesis contrary to the context would be inaccurate. As the context explicitly states the importance of the nara melon as a food plant in its native range, it is clear that the nara melon plays a significant role as a food resource within the Namib Desert ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- The Connecticut Senate on Thursday voted to repeal the death penalty, setting the stage for Connecticut to join several states that have recently abolished capital punishment.  In the last five years, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Illinois have repealed the death penalty. California voters will decide the issue in November.  The bill now goes to the House of Representatives, where it is also expected to pass. Gov. Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, has vowed to sign the measure into law should it reach his desk, his office said.  \\"For everyone, it's a vote of conscience,\\" said Senate President Donald Williams Jr., a Democrat who says he's long supported a repeal. \\"We have a majority of legislators in Connecticut in favor of this so that the energies of our criminal justice system can be focused in a more appropriate manner.\\"  In 2009, state lawmakers in both houses tried to pass a similar bill, but were ultimately blocked by then-Gov. Jodi Rell, a Republican.  Capital punishment has existed in Connecticut since its colonial days. But the state was forced to review its death penalty laws beginning in 1972 when a Supreme Court decision required greater consistency in its application. A moratorium was then imposed until a 1976 court decision upheld the constitutionality of capital punishment.  Since then, Connecticut juries have handed down 15 death sentences. Of those, only one person has actually been executed, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonpartisan group that studies death penalty laws.  Michael Ross, a convicted serial killer, was put to death by lethal injection in 2005 after giving up his appeals.  Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1.

Article: Patti Page, the top-selling female artist of the 1950s with more than 100 million records sold, died on January 2nd, 2013, when she was 85. She was one of the most beloved singers of the post-war era. Take her \\"Tennessee Waltz\\" for example, it sold more than 10 million copies and was her biggest hit  .  Born in Claremore, Oklahoma, a small town near Tulsa, Page once dreamed of a career in commercial art. Her first job in the art department at a local radio station soon led to her performing 15-minute program on her own. At age 20, Page was discovered by big-band leader Jack Rael, who gave up his job to become her manager. The next year, she signed her first recording contract with Mercury Records and enjoyed her first hit record soon. She stayed with Mercury for the next 14 years and recorded hit after hit including: \\"With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming\\" and \\"Old Cape Cod\\". Her last hit was \\"Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" , recorded for the Bette Davis movie of the same name. And then, there was \\"Doggie in the Window\\". The creative tune was a huge hit, but with its repeated barking sounds and silly lyrics  , the song has been used by many people as an example of all that was wrong with pop music in the early 1950s.  Throughout the 1950s, Patti Page made regular appearances on a variety of television shows and in 1957 she was chosen to host the musical program \\"The Big Record\\". The following year, Page appeared in her own CBS television series \\"The Patti Page Show\\".

The Catch: Montana to Dwight Clark wins '82 NFC title game (Originially published by the Daily News on Monday, Jan. 11, 1982; written by Larry Fox) San Francisco - The cast was completed for an all-Cinderella Super Bowl yesterday when the 49ers picked the Cowboys' pockets to come up with a miracle, winning the NFC championship, 28-27 on a six-yard pass from Joe Montana to secondary target Dwight Clark with only 51 seconds left. The victory then was assured two downs later when Lawrence Pillers, cut by the Jets for his failures as a pass rusher, sacked Danny White into the fumble that gonged midnight for America's Team. By coming out on top in this crowd-pleasing melodrama in which the lead changed hands six times, the 49ers earned the right to meet AFC champion Cincinnati in Super Bowl XVI in Pontiac, Mich. Jan. 24. Bill Walsh, coach of the 49ers who used to work for the Bengals and quit when he was passed over for the head job, said Super Bowl XVI will involve a matchup \\"of two teams that fought their way up from the bottom.\\" At season's start, there were probably no odds that these two perennial also-rans would meet in the Super Bowl. AND WHEN THE Cowboys took a 27-21 lead on Danny White's 21-yard pass to Doug Cosbie with 10:41 remaining, the odds didn't appear to be very good that mistake-plagued San Francisco, a team inexperienced in the pressures of post-season play, would be able to come back. To that point, the 49ers had lost three fumbles, suffered three pass interceptions and incurred two damaging pass interference calls on rookie cornerback Ronnie Lott. Of three Dallas touchdowns and two field goals, only one field goal didn't involve some 49er assistance. But, on the sidelines, the 49ers were confident. After a Dallas punt, they set up at their 11. \\"It was 90 yards,\\" said Walsh, \\"and we knew we couldn't get it in big chunks. We just set about marching down the field. We wanted to methodically pick them apart.\\" \\"It was a long way, but we had to get it a little bit at a time,\\" said Clark, who caught two of Montana's three touchdown passes. Twice early in the drive the 49ers were faced with third-down situations. On the first of these, Montana passed to Freddie Solomon for six yards, maintaining possession with two yards to spare. Dallas handed the first down over on the second, as Bruce Thornton went offsides. At the two-minute warning, the 49ers had moved across the 50 to the Dallas 49 when Solomon dashed 14 yards on an end around. MONTANA PASSED PERFECTLY to Clark for 10 and Solomon for 12 more and a first down at the 13. Now it was time for Solomon again and the one-time college quarterback was wide open in the corner of the end zone when Montana overthrew him. So Lenvil Elliott, the Bengal retread who got the start because of an injury to halfback Ricky Patton, got the call and gained seven on a sweep. That made it third-and-three at the six with 58 seconds left. In came the play from Walsh. Sprint Right Option. It had worked for Montana's first touchdown of the day under similar circumstances in the first half, an eight-yarder. Solomon was the primary target again, only this time the Cowboys, obviously remembering that first touchdown, collapsed their defense on him. Montana admitted he was on the verge of throwing the ball away when he spotted Clark sweeping across the back line of the end zone. He fired the ball high, higher actually than intended, but he explained, \\"This is something we work on from Day One in camp. If he doesn't catch it, nobody does . . . but I have great confidence in Dwight's leaping ability.\\" There were a couple of Cowboy defenders between Solomon, who was the short man, and Clark. They quickly tried to reverse gears, but couldn't get back in time. The ball sailed too high for them, but the 6-4 Clark leaped and made what he described as a \\"double catch,\\" the ball bouncing off one palm before he trapped it with the other hand and pulled it in. \\"I really don't remember which hand it was,\\" he said. ONLY ONE POINT behind with 51 seconds left, the Cowboys were hardly dead yet. In Rafael Septien, they had one of the NFL's best place-kickers and an offense that could get him within range. \\"We just had to tighten up. We knew we had to stop 'em to keep them out of field-goal range,\\" said Fred Dean. \\"We had to stop 'em,\\" said Lott, who was operating under the added burden of those two damaging calls. \\"We sure were under extra pressure because with a kicker like Septien, the goal line is at the 40 or 30-yard line.\\" After Ray Wersching's semi-squib kick, the Cowboys set up at their own 25 when White passed 31 yards to Drew Pearson to the SF 44. One more gain like this and the Cowboys would have moved into Septien's range. \\"If we could have just gotten 15 more yards on the last drive, we could have been in field-goal range and we could have won it,\\" said White, but the could-have-beens never were. THE 49ERS, WHO normally play a three-man front, went to four down linemen for a bigger rush. Pillers, who plays in pass-rush situations out here, was at left tackle with Jim Stuckey his left end. They decided to play one of those little line stunts, shifting rush lanes. Pillers shot between left guard Herb Scott and center Tom Rafferty. Rafferty grabbed him and, Pillers said, \\"actually helped pull me through.\\" White, meanwhile, was looking for Tony Hill and Hill was open. But the ball never got there. Pillers shot over Rafferty and exploded into White for his second sack of the game, knocking the ball free. Stuckey recovered for San Francisco and the Cowboys were finished. The Cowboys were bitter over the sudden end. \\"We were moving the football and we figured to get a field goal,\\" said Tony Dorsett, his left eye still red from an accidental kick that kept him on the sidelines for a while. \\"But then on the next play, they had a great rush and they stripped Danny of the football. I knew we had time to come back. Fifty seconds with our offense, it's not asking a lot to get in field-goal range, but it didn't work because of a turnover. It wasn't a case that we ran out of time.\\" It was ironic the Cowboys would finally be undone by a turnover, because that's what had been keeping them in the game. \\"We overcame a lot of adversity,\\" Walsh said and then in a reference to the turnovers, \\"and some questionable calls.\\" The 49ers took an early lead on the first of Montana's three touchdown passes, the eight-yarder to Solomon. The Cowboys retaliated with a 44-yard field goal by Septien and then took the lead when they converted Mike Hegman's fumble recovery into a 26-yard, White-to-Hill touchdown. THE 49ERS BLEW another scoring chance early in the second quarter on the first of two Everson Walls interceptions, but then went ahead, 14-10, on a 20-yard pass from Montana to Clark. The rangy receiver caught this one on his knees, after faking Dennis Thurman out of the park. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article is about a football game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys in 1982. The 49ers won the game 28-27 with a last-minute touchdown pass from Joe Montana to Dwight Clark. This victory allowed the 49ers to advance to the Super Bowl against the Cincinnati Bengals.

Information:  - Gampopa \\"the man from Gampo\\" or Sönam Rinchen (10791153), also known by the titles Dakpo Lharjé \\"the physician from Dakpo\\" and Daö Zhönnu, \\"Candraprabhakumara\\" established the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism.  - The Tibetan Empire (\\"Great Tibet\\") existed from the 7th to 9th centuries AD when Tibet was unified as a large and powerful empire, and ruled an area considerably larger than the Tibetan Plateau, stretching to parts of East Asia, Central Asia and South Asia.  - The Jonang is one of the schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Its origins in Tibet can be traced to early 12th century master Yumo Mikyo Dorje, but became much wider known with the help of Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen, a monk originally trained in the Sakya school. The Jonang school was widely thought to have become extinct in the late 17th century at the hands of the 5th Dalai Lama, who forcibly annexed the Jonang monasteries to his Gelug school, declaring them heretical.  - The Nyingma tradition is the oldest of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism (the other three being the Kagyu, Sakya and Gelug). \\"Nyingma\\" literally means \\"ancient,\\" and is often referred to as Ngangyur (, \\"school of the ancient translations\\" or \\"old school\\") because it is founded on the first translations of Buddhist scriptures from Sanskrit into Old Tibetan in the eighth century. The Tibetan alphabet and grammar was actually created for this endeavour.  - The Kagyu, Kagyü, or Kagyud school, also known as the \\"\\"Oral Lineage\\"\\" or \\"Whispered Transmission\\" school, is today regarded as one of six main schools (\\"chos lugs\\") of Himalayan or Tibetan Buddhism, the other five being the Nyingma, Sakya, Jonang, Gelug and Bon. Along with the Sakya and Gelug schools, the Kagyu tradition is classified as one of the Sarma or \\"New Transmission\\" schools of Vajrayna founded during the second diffusion of Buddhism into Tibet (diffusing the so-called \\"New Tantras\\"). It is a Red Hat sect along with the Nyingma and Sakya.  - Classical Tibetan refers to the language of any text written in Tibetic after the Old Tibetan period; though it extends from the 7th century until the modern day, it particularly refers to the language of early canonical texts translated from other languages, especially Sanskrit. The phonology implied by Classical Tibetan orthography is basically identical to the phonology of Old Tibetan, but the grammar varies greatly depending on period and geographic origin of the author. Such variation is an under-researched topic.  - Bon or Bön is a Tibetan religion, which self-identifies as being distinct from Tibetan Buddhism, although it shares the same overall teachings and terminology. It arose in the eleventh century and established its scriptures mainly from termas and visions by tertöns such as Loden Nyingpo. Though Bon terma contain myths of Bon existing before the introduction of Buddhism in Tibet, \\"in truth the 'old religion' was a new religion.\\"  - The Samye Monastery or Samye Gompa (Chinese:) is the first Buddhist monastery built in Tibet. It was probably first constructed between 775-9 CE under the patronage of King Trisong Detsen of Tibet who sought to revitalize Buddhism, which had declined since its introduction by King Songtsän Gampo in the 7th century. The monastery is in Dranang, Lhoka Prefecture. It was supposedly modeled on the design of Odantapuri in what is now Bihar, India.  - Tibetan Buddhism is the body of Buddhist doctrine and institutions characteristic of Tibet, the regions surrounding the Himalayas and much of Central Asia. It derives from the latest stages of Indian Buddhism and preserves \\"the Tantric status quo of eighth-century India.\\" Tibetan Buddhism aspires to Buddhahood or rainbow body.  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - In Mahayana Buddhism, bodhisattva is the Sanskrit term for anyone who, motivated by great compassion, has generated bodhicitta, which is a spontaneous wish to attain buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings. Bodhisattvas are a popular subject in Buddhist art.  - Daklha Gampo ( Dwags lha sgam po ) is a Kagyu monastery founded in 1121 CE by Je Gampopa ( 1079 - 1153 ) , the disciple of the famous and much - loved bodhisattva , Jetsun Milarepa ( c. 1052 -- c. 1135 ) It is located in Gyatsa County in the old district of Dakpo in southern Tibet on land sanctified as a geomantic power - place ( ' head of the ogress ' ) by the first Tibetan emperor , Songtsen Gampo ( 605 or 617 ? - 649 ) , and made a repository of terma by Padmasambhava .  - In Buddhism, bodhicitta (\\"putixin\\" \\"bodaishin\\" Wylie transliteration: \\"byang chub kyi sems\\" Vietnamese: B- tâm), \\"enlightenment-mind\\", is the mind that strives toward awakening, empathy and compassion for the benefit of all sentient beings.  - Songtsen Gampo (569649?/605649?) was the founder of the Tibetan Empire, and is traditionally credited with the introduction of Buddhism to Tibet, influenced by his Nepali and Chinese queens, as well as being the unifier of what were previously several Tibetan kingdoms. He is also regarded as responsible for the creation of Tibetan alphabet and therefore the establishment of Classical Tibetan, the language spoken in his region at the time, as the literary language of Tibet.  - Sanskrit (English pronunciation:; written in Devanagari script ; : or ', originally ', \\"refined speech\\") is the primary sacred language of Hinduism and \\"Mahyna\\" Buddhism, a philosophical language in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. It was also a literary language that was in use as a \\"lingua franca\\" in ancient and medieval South Asia. It is a standardised dialect of Old Indo-Aryan, originating as Vedic Sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to Proto-Indo-Iranian and Proto-Indo-European. Today it is listed as one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and is an official language of the state of Uttarakhand. As one of the oldest Indo-European languages for which substantial written documentation exists, Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies.  - The Tibetan alphabet is an abugida used to write the Tibetic languages such as Tibetan, as well as Dzongkha, Sikkimese, Ladakhi, and sometimes Balti. The printed form of the alphabet is called uchen script while the hand-written cursive form used in everyday writing is called umê script.  - The Sakya (\\"pale earth\\") school is one of four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism, the others being the Nyingma, Kagyu, and Gelug. It is one of the Red Hat sects along with the Nyingma and Kagyu.  - The Gelug, Gelug-pa, dGe Lugs Pa, dge-lugs-pa or Dgelugspa is the newest of the schools of Tibetan Buddhism. It was founded by Je Tsongkhapa (13571419), a philosopher and Tibetan religious leader. The first monastery he established was named Ganden, and to this day the Ganden Tripa is the nominal head of the school, though its most influential figure is the Dalai Lama. Allying themselves with the Mongols as a powerful patron, the Gelug emerged as the pre-eminent Buddhist school in Tibet since the end of the 16th century.  - In Tibetan Buddhism, the Red Hat sect or Red Hat sects, named for the colour of the monks' hats at formal occasions, includes the three oldest of the four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism, namely:  - Buddhism (or ) is a religion and dharma that encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on teachings attributed to the Buddha. Buddhism originated in India sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, from where it spread through much of Asia, whereafter it declined in India during the middle ages. Two major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars: Theravada (Pali: \\"The School of the Elders\\") and Mahayana (Sanskrit: \\"The Great Vehicle\\"). Buddhism is the world's fourth-largest religion, with over 500 million followers or 7% of the global population, known as Buddhists.  - Nepal, officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, is a landlocked central Himalayan country in South Asia. It has a population of 26.4 million and is the 93rd largest country by area. Bordering China in the north and India in the south, east, and west, it is the largest sovereign Himalayan state. Nepal does not border Bangladesh, which is located within only 27 km (17 mi) of its southeastern tip. It neither borders Bhutan due to the Indian state of Sikkim being located in between. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest city. It is a multiethnic nation with Nepali as the official language.   - Trisong Detsän or Trisong Detsen was the son of Me Agtsom and one of the emperors of Tibet. He ruled from 755 until 797 or 804 CE. Trisong Detsen was the second of the Three Dharma Kings of Tibet, playing a pivotal role in the introduction of Buddhism to Tibet and the establishment of the Nyingma or \\"Ancient\\" school of Tibetan Buddhism.  - In Buddhism, buddhahood (, or ) is the condition or rank of a buddha (or , , Pali/Sanskrit for \\"awakened one\\").  - Tibet (Tibetan Pinyin: \\"boe\\", ; /i ts¹/) is a region on the Tibetan Plateau in Asia. It is the traditional homeland of the Tibetan people as well as some other ethnic groups such as Monpa, Qiang, and Lhoba peoples and is now also inhabited by considerable numbers of Han Chinese and Hui people. Tibet is the highest region on Earth, with an average elevation of . The highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest, Earth's highest mountain, rising 8,848 m (29,029 ft) above sea level.  - Buddhist art is the artistic practices that are influenced by Buddhism. It includes art media which depict Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and other entities; notable Buddhist figures, both historical and mythical; narrative scenes from the lives of all of these; mandalas and other graphic aids to practice; as well as physical objects associated with Buddhist practice, such as vajras, bells, stupas and Buddhist temple architecture. Buddhist art originated on the Indian subcontinent following the historical life of Siddhartha Gautama, 6th to 5th century BC, and thereafter evolved by contact with other cultures as it spread throughout Asia and the world.  - Padmasambhava (lit. \\"Lotus-Born\\"), also known as Guru Rinpoche, was an 8th-century Indian Buddhist master. Although there was a historical Padmasambhava, nothing is known of him apart from helping the construction of the first Buddhist monastery in Tibet at Samye, at the behest of Trisong Detsen, and shortly thereafter leaving Tibet due to court intrigues.

Summarize this article: V5C log books record a car's \\"registered keeper\\". However, in some cases they are not being updated for several months after cars are sold, a BBC investigation has found. Some dealers retain the documents to help them qualify for large discounts from car manufacturers. The National Franchised Dealers Association describe the findings as \\"concerning\\" and say bonuses linked to sales might \\"incentivise\\" the activity. The cars affected are \\"pre-registered,\\" excess stock sold cheaply by manufacturers to dealers. They must legally be kept off-road for 90 days before being re-sold. The delays can be even longer if the car was originally registered by a retailer as a business fleet vehicle. However, in some cases the cars are delivered to new buyers immediately, while the vehicles remain registered at a separate address, an investigation by BBC Radio 4's You and Yours has found. Many of the cars are sold on by online car brokers. They commonly disclose the disadvantages in their terms and conditions, explaining that the vehicles will be registered to customers \\"in due course\\". However, many customers fail to read the small print and some suffer the consequences. \\"I couldn't drive the car because it had been declared off-road\\", said buyer Andrew March. \\"The car log book had been withheld so I couldn't re-tax it.\\" After asking repeatedly for his logbook, motorist James Laddie applied to the DVLA for a new one. The three-month delay proved expensive: \\"The council would not transfer our old parking permit to the new car without proof of ownership. The combined cost of parking tickets was about Â£200.\\" Experts stress that there can be potentially more serious consequences of a driver and their car being registered to different addresses. For example, police speed camera fines are sent to the postal address linked via DVLA records to a car's registration plate. One driver who spoke to You and Yours lived in London while his car remained registered for several months in Bolton. Insurance companies also require drivers to disclose both the owner and the registered keeper of a vehicle. Roy Rodger, an expert on insurance law who has trained underwriters, warns that drivers' confusion over withheld log books could lead to costly mistakes. \\"In a situation where a driver misled the insurance company over registration details and a serious accident occurred, the driver could be in a very, very awkward position. \\"They could have to pay the claim out of their own pocket eventually,\\" he said. The Association of British Insurers told You and Yours it was not aware of any cases where this had happened, but added that drivers should inform motor insurers if they are not the registered keeper. The practice of log books being retained by third party suppliers was highlighted in a 2012 court case brought against a competitor by online car broker Richard Sanders, founder of Drive the Deal. The competitor had not adequately warned consumers of the risks involved. Although Mr Sanders won the case, he says the industry has not been fully cleaned up. \\"We decided to start looking at this because we were very concerned indeed about the trouble that some consumers would get themselves into,\\" he said. \\"Unfortunately I think the practice of wrongly registering cars on purpose does continue.\\" The director of the National Franchised Dealers Association, Sue Robinson, says she is very concerned by the findings. \\"As dealers are required to keep vehicles for 90 days to qualify for some bonuses, that could incentivise this type of activity,\\" she said. Autocar editorial director, Jim Holder, says transparency in the car industry has improved but problems remain. \\"This part of the industry is poorly regulated and there are still traders out there who ignore the rules,\\" he said. \\"It's not really a problem that the industry takes seriously and it's really only word of mouth and education that can stop this.\\" You and Yours is on BBC Radio 4 weekdays 12:15-13:00 GMT.

What's the best answer to this question: is it possible to have sympathy pregnancy symptoms? pick from the following.  * no  * yes...A:","output":"Yes, it is possible to have sympathy pregnancy symptoms. Couvade syndrome, also known as sympathetic pregnancy, is a phenomenon in which a partner, usually the expectant father, experiences some of the same symptoms and behavior as the pregnant mother. This condition is not officially recognized as a medical diagnosis, but there is evidence that it exists on a psychosocial and physiological level. Sympathy pregnancy symptoms can vary and often align with the symptoms experienced by the pregnant mother. Some common symptoms reported include minor weight gain, alterations in hormone levels, morning nausea, disturbed sleep patterns, and even, in more extreme cases, labor pains, postpartum depression, and nosebleeds. The labor pain symptom is commonly referred to as sympathy pain. It is believed that the underlying cause of Couvade syndrome is a combination of psychological, social, and hormonal factors. Emotional stress and anxiety related to the impending arrival of a new child can result in the non-pregnant partner experiencing physical symptoms. Additionally, some researchers suggest that hormonal changes, particularly increased levels of prolactin, might contribute to the condition. Furthermore, the social and cultural context may contribute to the development of Couvade syndrome. In some societies, the expectation of a strong emotional bond between prospective parents could lead to the manifestation of sympathetic pregnancy symptoms. When the couple is heavily involved in each other's lives and the daily experience of pregnancy, it is not surprising that the partner may develop similar symptoms. In conclusion, it is possible to have sympathy pregnancy symptoms, as seen in Couvade syndrome. This condition is not an officially recognized medical diagnosis, but it is well-documented in various cultures and has been observed by experts in the fields of psychology, sociology, and medicine. The occurrence of sympathetic pregnancy involves a complex interplay of psychological, hormonal, and cultural factors that can lead to the development of shared physical symptoms between expectant parents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

While traveling in the Earth's orbit over 240 miles up, American astronaut Karen Nyberg joined Leading Women anchor Becky Anderson for a live interview from the International Space Station (ISS) Friday. When she's not working on scientific experiments, Nyberg can be found tweeting amazing pictures of the planet, chasing floating desserts in space and knitting. Read on for the full interview. CNN: Station, this is CNN. How do you hear me? Karen Nyberg: Good Morning CNN. This is station. I have you loud and clear. CNN: Simeon Birchall, a CNN.com commenter asks is there huge competition for every seat on a shuttle launch? KN: Well I don't know if I'd say competition. Definitely everybody that is in the astronaut office that wants to fly is very eager to do so even if they have gone before. Generally it's kind of going in order of when a class is selected, they start flying people from that class. And then it depends on what roles are needed. If we need to fly somebody that is going to be the commander of the space station, frequently most often that is somebody who has experience flying; if we need somebody who is going to be doing space walks, we need somebody that can do that. Back when we were flying the shuttle, there were a lot more specific tasks doing robotics ops and the space walks. TIMELINE: 50 years of women in space. Now on the space station everybody pretty much has to do everything and so it's a little competitive I guess, but your turn comes along. CNN: @Alizabev asks what type of experiments are you working on? KN: This week we've been doing a lot of experiments on our ocular health. We've noticed some problems over the past several years with many of our astronauts. They come back to Earth after three to six months in space and have long term vision problems, changes in their vision. We are trying to figure out what exactly is causing that. Luca (Parmitano) and I have been involved in numerous tests. We're doing tonometry -- we are looking at the pressure of the eye. We are doing ultrasounds to look at the morphology of the eye, we are doing fundoscopy to take images of the retina, vision tests. We are hoping that we can determine exactly what is causing this and hopefully mitigate the problem, especially if we start longer duration missions going to Mars ... we really need to understand this so we don't degrade the vision of every astronaut that is going into space. CNN: A commenter on CNN.com Marik asks what do you think of the Mars One project which aims to privately settle people on the planet? KN: I think it would be interesting. I think there are a lot of challenges and a lot of things that need to be figured out before that can be a successful mission. Mars is a long ways away and we have a lot to learn ... I don't know how many years from now that will be, but that type of thing may become standard. CNN: Floyd Moore aged 5 and Camper Carl of @AZChallenger both asked the same question: What is it like to sleep in space? And have you ever floated out of your bed? KN: It's actually quite comfortable sleeping in space. We have sleeping bags that we hang from the wall. The first couple weeks when I was here, it was very important to me to feel like I was almost laying on something. I would lay with my legs sideways in the sleeping back so that I felt pressure along my back from one side of the sleeping bag and I felt pressure from my legs on the other side. Now I've become a little more adapted to it and I can just float there. And no, I've never floated out of the bed. I'm usually zipped in pretty well. CNN: @Womenintheair asks: Which female astronauts influenced you? And have you met any of them as an astronaut? KN: Sally Ride was making her first flight into space and she really impacted me. And also just looking back, I did some research on Valentina Tereshkova when I was in high school because she was the first female to fly in space. And I actually did meet her last year for a brief moment before traveling to Baikonur as a back up for one of the missions. It was just (a) fantastic opportunity to get to meet her. I never did meet Sally Ride. I met her sister after her passing but it would have been fantastic to meet her too. But I think those two, the firsts, those names stick in your head and they really become inspirations for you. CNN: @nmedia_s asks do you think there is intelligent life in space -- besides the people at the ISS? KN: I don't know. I don't think I'm smart enough to know. The universe is so big. It's hard to imagine that there isn't something out there that is similar to our solar system and could provide what the Earth provides for us. But certainly we haven't seen that and you know, maybe some day we will. It's hard for me to say whether I truly believe it or not. I think it's possible. I don't believe we've seen anything but it's possible there is life out there somewhere. CNN: @FumaiMartin asks how much physics and chemistry taught in high school helps at the International Space Station? KN: I think any type of scientific class or mathematical class or any class really that you take is helpful even if you don't use the specific fundamentals that you learn in that class. There is something about learning how to learn that I think is very important is a very broad spectrum. And the same for college, a lot of the classes you take you are like, you think to yourself 'I'm never going to use this.' And you know what, sometimes you don't ... But a lot of it you do use. Even though we are working directly with the investigators of the scientific experiments. It's important for us understand what's going on so we can help and maybe we can see things and we can help them with their discoveries. CNN: Greg Wagner on Facebook asks what one place on Earth would you most like to visit with only the knowledge of having seen it from the ISS? KN: Oh wow! You know there are so many beautiful places that I don't even know how I would answer that. I've seen some mountain ranges that are just absolutely incredible ... But at the same time, I've come along some coastlines that look just breathtaking and so I guess I would have a lot of traveling to do if I were to go to every single place that I thought looked like a great place to be. CNN: CNN Mexico commenter Luis Flores Gonzalez asks if you were offered the opportunity to take a one-way trip to the deepest part of the universe, would you accept it? KN: A one-way trip, no. Especially with the current situation I'm in with a young son and a husband at home. I definitely would not want to do a really long, and definitely a one-way trip. It might be a different story if I had family with me but I'd have to say no to that. CNN: @Fadhelindonesia asks when you read my message what continent are you looking at? KN: We just passed over the east coast of South America and we are heading up towards Africa. We should be there in just a couple of minutes. And then we'll head up over Europe and into Asia. CNN: Leading Women co-anchor Kristie Lu Stout tweeted: We hear you're a bit of a DIY design geek. Do you get crafty in space? KN: I have been trying to do a little bit. ... It's amazing. Time goes by so fast and in the weekdays and on the evenings, there's absolutely no time for that. Sundays is really my day and I actually got a few things out the other day and drew up a design on a piece of paper and cut up some old T shirts and have started sewing things together. Not quite sure exactly how it is going to turn out but ... when I find the time to sit there and do that only, hopefully I'll get something done. WATCH THE FULL LIVE STREAM INTERVIEW.

The Manhattan Bridge, Throgs Neck Bridge, Triborough Bridge, and Verrazano-Narrows Bridge are all examples of Structural Expressionism. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): The Queensboro Bridge utilized what type of construction?","output":"The Queensboro Bridge, also known as the 59th Street Bridge, is an important piece of cantilever architecture in New York City. It spans the East River and connects the boroughs of Manhattan and Queens. The bridge was designed by engineer Gustav Lindenthal and architect Henry Hornbostel and was completed in 1909. The Queensboro Bridge used a type of construction called cantilever construction, which is an architectural technique that involves projecting a structure horizontally into space, supported on only one end. In this case, the bridge's weight is carried by steel cantilevered trusses, which are supported by two large masonry piers. This construction method means the bridge doesn't need any additional support other than the two piers, and the cantilever trusses transfer the weight of the bridge to these piers on either side of the river. This was a common approach for long-span bridges in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Cantilever construction is designed to distribute the weight of a structure evenly, allowing it to carry heavy loads and resist lateral forces. The main feature of cantilever construction is the use of long, steel beams that project outwards from the piers and are anchored by counterweights at each end. These steel beams are then connected to each other at their center points by additional beams, creating a box-like structure that gives the bridge its rigidity and strength. The chief advantage of cantilever construction is that it eliminates the need for compression members, like vertical pillars or suspension cables, in the center of the bridge. This allows for a greater space underneath the bridge, which is useful for the passage of boats and ships. In addition, cantilever construction affords easier access for maintenance work, as there are fewer structural elements in the way. In summary, the Queensboro Bridge utilized cantilever construction, where steel trusses were cantilevered from two main piers to form the bridge's structure. This technique was favorable during the late 19th and early 20th centuries for long-span bridges, providing an efficient way to carry heavy loads and resist lateral forces while allowing for easy maintenance and ample space underneath the bridge."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lastly, while the context does not directly state its recreational aspect, the fact that it is located in Bogotá, Colombia's capital city, suggests its accessibility and attractiveness for recreational visits. As many citizens and tourists are likely to be based in Bogotá when exploring nearby points of interest, the botanical garden could be considered as a popular outdoor venue for relaxation and recreation. In conclusion, based on the given context, we can formulate a hypothesis that the José Celestino Mutis botanical garden serves as a recreation center, as it offers a wide variety of plants, focuses on Andean and Páramo ecosystems, and is conveniently located in Bogotá. This combination of features positions the garden as an ideal destination for people seeking a recreational experience while learning about the importance of nature and environmental conservation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Do you know there is a group called the National Children's Bureau? They are a group of people who care about children, just like you! They work on making sure kids have what they need to grow up happy and healthy. Well, they recently shared some news, and it's important that we talk about it. The National Children's Bureau has found out that thousands of children in England are not getting the education they need. Education is like going to school, where you learn how to read, write, and do fun things like arts and crafts. School is where you get to learn about the world around you and make new friends. So why are many kids not getting the education they need? There could be many reasons. Sometimes, it might be because their family is moving around a lot, and they cannot go to the same school for a long time. Other times, it might be because their parents are busy taking care of other family matters and can't help them get to school. Not getting a proper education could make life harder for these kids when they grow up. They might struggle with finding good jobs, taking care of themselves, and being a part of the community. The National Children's Bureau thinks that this problem is very serious and needs to be fixed. They are telling the people who make decisions, like the government, that they need to do more to help these kids get the education they need. This could mean making sure there are enough schools in every area or finding ways to make school more enjoyable for kids. It might also mean finding better ways to help families when they need it, so that kids don't miss school as often. So kids, whenever you go to school, remember that it's a special place to learn and grow. If you come across friends who are having a hard time or not going to school, let an adult know so that they can help, too. Together, we can make sure all kids have the chance to get an amazing education and grow up to do great things!"},{"instruction":"Since grade school we have known about the food pyramid, but the food pyramid I want to discuss today is quite different: The Mediterranean Food Pyramid. The pyramid is used by countless health organizations, clinics, doctors and many others to guide people to eat in a healthy manner. It is the standard to live by and health professionals unanimously agree that by following this diet pyramid, your health will benefit tremendously. The pyramid is a wonderful synopsis of what the Mediterranean Diet entails. It shows four different food groups and the optimal number of servings of each group that should be consumed. The pyramid was created based on research of the diet that the people in the Mediterranean countries consume. The area was selected as the model because of the low incidence of heart disease and high life expectancy found in the region. One of the primary reasons for the healthy results of the diet is that the people not only use fresh, unadulterated ingredients, they also cook their meals in very healthy ways. They are among the minority of the world’s population that have not embraced the fast food culture that dominates the US and Australia. It should be noted that both countries are battling an obesity epidemic. There are no processed foods, colas, white flour products, pizzas or any unhealthy food in the food pyramid. There are only categories of fresh, healthy foods: fruits and vegetables, nuts and grains, beans, fish and seafood, and healthy oils (primarily olive oil) – plus a little red wine. Your fat consumption should be moderate along with consumption of dairy products such as yogurt and cheese. Eggs can be consumed daily. Fish (seafood) is preferred over meat and should be consumed twice a week. Poultry is also preferred over red meat and should be consumed once a week. Red meat should only be consumed 3 to 4 times a month. The rest of the time, vegetables, legumes, and/or pasta should be the focal point of your meals. Fruit and vegetables (7 servings) should be consumed daily. How long did it probably take the author to try to the Mediterranean diet?

Article: This is the classic way to wear a fanny pack, though you may be surprised to learn you can create different styles just wearing it in slightly different places near your waist! For instance, try wearing it at your natural waist, which is just above your belly button, where your torso is the smallest. Wearing a fanny pack here helps define the shape of your body. Try wearing it on the front but slightly off-center.  You can also place the fanny pack near the top of your pants for a bold approach. This position makes the fanny pack stand out, since it's sitting near your hips, pushing it outward. If you want to show off your fanny pack this way, position it at or just below your belly button. You can wear it in the front of your body right in the middle, slightly off-center, or off one hip. Wear a small bag through your belt loops for a subtle approach. Pull the straps through your belt loops from the front with the pack like a belt buckle. Secure it in the back, and then throw a jacket over your whole outfit. Try wearing your fanny pack turned to the back for a fun surprise. Wear it slung across your backside at your waist. People won't be able to see it in the front, but when you turn around, you'll have a fashionable accessory! While fanny packs are usually worn around the waist, using one as a shoulder bag can be a trendy look. Wear it across your chest with the bag centered in front. Because it fits close to your body, it will keep all your stuff within easy reach. You can even put a fanny pack on over a jacket. The fanny pack can act as a belt, cinching in your clothes to create a more defined silhouette. This is the classic way to wear a fanny pack. Belt a small leather bag into your pants and wear a shirt you tuck in or that falls just at the fanny pack. Then, throw a jacket over it all to complete the look.  This look is great for a rock concert or date night, depending on what jacket you choose! You can also try this look with a statement top and no jacket, such as a plunging silk top with billowy arms that falls just over the top of the fanny pack. Pair a stylish bag with your favorite shirt and jeans. Sling the bag over your hips, and you're ready for a walk through the park or a fun day at a festival.  Try adding flats for a bit of pizazz or simply stick with sneakers if you need to walk a long way. You could also wear corduroys or sporty pants. In the winter, wearing it over your clothes may still hide your fanny pack so move it so it's on the outside. Try wearing one over a trench coat, for instance, for easy access. Wrap it around your natural waist or just below to help define your silhouette.  Pick one that adds a pop of color or try one that blends in with the outfit. You could also put one over a blazer. You may not think a fanny pack goes over a dress, but think again. Many fashion-forward celebrities rock this look. Just pick a stylish bag in a quality material, and you're good to go.  For instance, try a leather bag over a maxi dress. Other quality materials include silk and wool. This look works best for casual looks, date night, and semi-formal events, depending on the bag you choose. Skip it for formal events. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article would be: Fanny packs can be worn in various styles to create different looks.

Productions during the 1980s included the company's first presentations of Pelléas and Mélisande (1981), Parsifal (1986) and Billy Budd (1988). 1980s productions that remained in the repertory for many years included Xerxes directed by Hytner, and Rigoletto and The Mikado directed by Jonathan Miller. In 1984 ENO toured the United States; the travelling company, led by Elder, consisted of 360 people; they performed Gloriana, War and Peace, The Turn of the Screw, Rigoletto and Patience. This was the first British company to be invited to appear at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, where Patience received a standing ovation and Miller's production of Rigoletto, depicting the characters as mafiosi, was greeted with a mixture of enthusiasm and booing. In 1990 ENO was the first major foreign opera company to tour the Soviet Union, performing the Miller production of The Turn of the Screw, Pountney's production of Macbeth, and Hytner's much-revived Xerxes.The 'Powerhouse' era ended in 1992, when all three of the triumvirate left at the same time. The new general director was Dennis Marks, formerly head of music programmes at the BBC, and the new music director was Sian Edwards. Pountney's post of director of productions was not filled. Marks, inheriting a large financial deficit from his predecessors, worked to restore the company's finances, concentrating on restoring ticket sales to sustainable levels. A new production by Miller of Der Rosenkavalier was a critical and financial success, as was a staging of Massenet's Don Quixote, described by the critic Hugh Canning as \\"the kind of old-fashioned theatre magic which the hair-shirted Powerhouse regime despised\\".Marks was obliged to spend much time and effort in securing the funding for an essential restoration of the Coliseum, a condition on which ENO had acquired the freehold of the theatre in 1992.

As a recent article in The Guardian newspaper noted,  \\"There's more to understanding a joke in a foreign language than understanding vocabulary and grammar.\\" Being able to understand local jokes is often seen as an incredible ice-breaker for a language learner eager to form friendships with native speakers. \\"I always felt that humor was a ceiling   that I could never break through,\\" Hannah Ashley, a public relations account manager in London, who once studied Spanish in Madrid. Told The Guardian, \\"I could never speak to people on the same level as I would speak to a native English speaker. I almost came across as quite a boring person because all I could talk about was facts.\\" In fact, most of the time, jokes are only funny for people who share a cultural background or understand humor in the same way. Chinese-American comedian Joe Wong found this out first-hand. He had achieved huge success in the US, but when he returned to China in 2008 for his first live show in Beijing, he discovered that people didn't think his. Chinese jokes were as funny as his English ones. In Australia, meanwhile many foreigners find understanding jokes about sports to be the biggest headache. \\"The hardest jokes are related to rugby because I know nothing about rugby,\\" said Melody Cao, who was once a student in Australia. \\"When I heard jokes I didn't get, I just laughed along.\\" In the other two major English-speaking countries, the sense of humor is also different. British comedian Simon Pegg believes that while Britons use irony-basically, saying something they don't mean to make a joke-every day, people in the US don't see the point of using it so often. \\"British jokes tend to be more subtle and dark, while American jokes are more obvious with their meanings, a bit like Americans themselves,\\" he wrote in The Guardian.","output":"Which of the following statements best describes the challenges faced by language learners when trying to understand jokes in a foreign language?

I just genuinely do n't want to go back to that church . I could n't get the balls to tell her that ... Question: Why would n't I have the balls to tell her that ?","output":"There could be several reasons why you wouldn't have the \\"balls\\" to tell her that you don't want to go back to the church. Assuming \\"her\\" is a close person to you, it could involve deep-rooted emotions, social factors, and personal experiences that may be causing hesitation. Let's explore some potential factors that could be contributing to this situation: 1. Fear of confrontation: Many people tend to avoid confrontations, as they can be uncomfortable or distressing. You might be concerned that by telling her your true feelings, it could lead to an argument or strain your relationship with her. This fear of confrontation can sometimes prevent us from expressing our genuine thoughts and feelings. 2. Worries about judgment: Expressing your unwillingness to return to the church might be something you believe could lead to her judging or questioning your actions, beliefs, or values. This concern about facing judgment from others often prevents people from being open about their thoughts and choices. 3. Emotional attachment: If the person you need to talk to is someone with whom you share a close bond or emotional attachment, it might be challenging to express your feelings towards the church. You might be worried about how this could affect your relationship, fearing the possibility of upsetting her or causing emotional pain. 4. Fear of rejection: There's always a possibility that when we express our true thoughts or feelings to someone, they might not agree or understand our perspective. This fear of being rejected or dismissed might be holding you back from telling her about your feelings regarding the church. 5. Social pressure: If the church has played a significant role in your social circle, shared experiences, or relationships, it might be challenging to stand up against that \\"norm.\\" You could be concerned about how this decision will be perceived by your friends, family, and community members, causing additional stress and anxiety. 6. Personal experiences: Your feelings towards the church might have been shaped by personal experiences that you have not yet fully processed or shared. There might be lingering fears or anxieties about revisiting those events or feelings in a conversation with her. 7. Concern for her feelings: It's also possible that you are genuinely concerned about the impact your decision could have on her. Perhaps she deeply cares about the church, has a personal connection to it, or might be hurt by your decision to not return. As a result, you might be hesitant to share your thoughts to avoid hurting her feelings or causing any heartache. To overcome these barriers and gather the courage to express your feelings, you could try speaking to a trusted friend or counselor who can provide guidance and support. Reflecting on the reasons why you don't want to return to the church and practicing healthy communication strategies can also help you build the confidence to share your thoughts with her. Remember, being honest and open about your feelings is an essential aspect of maintaining healthy relationships, overcoming challenges, and growing as an individual."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If the individual is consuming larger quantities of food, particularly those high in carbohydrates and sugars, their blood sugar levels might increase more rapidly and to higher levels.

Process:  - Pollution enters natural water sources such as rivers and lakes - The pollution negatively affects the water quality - The pollution negatively affects the health of plants and animals - The plants and animals have shorter, less healthy lives - The plants and animals do not reproduce very well - The number of plants and animals decreases over time - The quality of water gets worse and worse as there are no plants or animals to clean it - Eventually there is nothing living in the water and it is unusable -   suppose there will be fewer pollutants pumped into rivers happens, how will it affect MORE bad effects of pollution.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation of having fewer pollutants pumped into rivers can be considered as directly impacting a step of the process. By reducing the amount of pollution that enters natural water sources, we can potentially alleviate or reverse some of the negative consequences associated with water pollution. Here's how fewer pollutants pumped into rivers might affect the process: 1. If less pollution enters natural water sources, the water quality will begin to improve over time. Cleaner water will support a diversity of living organisms, including beneficial microbes and aquatic plants that help cleanse the water and maintain its natural state. 2. With improved water quality, plants and animals living in and around these water sources would experience better health. This means that they would live longer and healthier lives, which can positively impact their ability to reproduce effectively. 3. As the health of plants and animals in these ecosystems improves, their populations would start to rebound as well. With more living organisms present in the water, the natural processes that keep the water clean can function more effectively, working together to maintain balance in the ecosystem. 4. The improved water quality, coupled with the increased presence of plants and animals, will help make the water usable again for a variety of purposes, including agriculture, recreation, and possibly even drinking and other household needs. In summary, directly impacting a step of the process by reducing the amount of pollutants pumped into rivers can have a domino effect on subsequent steps, ultimately leading to a healthier and more vibrant aquatic ecosystem. This stands in stark contrast to the original process described, wherein pollution continued to degrade water quality and undermine the health of plants and animals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They asked if we were going to try for our Canine Good Citizenship certificate and I said yes and we were hoping to go further and do therapy work . They also invited us to stick around and watch the Rally class and give it shot . They said Poodles usually need more of a challenge ! Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question Why would poodles need additional stimulus ?","output":"Poodles need additional stimulus due to their high level of intelligence, energy, and versatile nature. These traits make them one of the most intelligent dog breeds, alongside their strong instinct to please their human companions, which leads to impressive trainability. However, these wonderful qualities can also mean that poodles require more of a challenge to stay mentally and physically engaged. Let us delve deeper into these qualities. 1. High Intelligence: Poodles are known for their incredible intelligence, consistently ranking as one of the smartest dog breeds according to various sources, such as Dr. Stanley Coren's book \\"The Intelligence of Dogs.\\" Their ability to learn commands, tasks, and behaviors quickly means they can become bored if not provided with adequate mental stimulation. Boredom in intelligent dogs can lead to unwanted behaviors as they seek ways to entertain themselves. 2. Energy Levels: Poodles, particularly the Standard and Miniature varieties, are quite energetic and require regular exercise to maintain their physical health and burn off excess energy. If poodles do not receive enough physical activity, they can become restless and develop problematic behaviors as a result. 3. Versatility: Poodles exhibit a versatile skillset, with a history as water retrieval dogs, circus performers, and even military dogs. This adaptability to various roles underscores their ability to learn and perform different tasks. This also means that they have the capacity to excel in various dog sports and activities, such as obedience, agility, and rally sports, where they can showcase their skills and challenge themselves. 4. Strong Human Connection: Poodles have a strong instinct for pleasing their human companions. This trait lends itself to their superb trainability, as they actively seek out ways to engage with and please their owners. Encouraging this connection through advanced training and activities allows the poodle to strengthen its bond with its owner while also receiving the mental stimulation and challenges it craves. Given these factors, it is not surprising that poodles may need additional stimulus to remain happy, healthy, and well-rounded. Engaging them in advanced training and activities like Rally, Canine Good Citizenship, and therapy work enables poodles to utilize their intelligence and energy to the fullest, maintaining strong connections with their human companions while benefiting from the mental and physical challenges these activities provide."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Question: What \\"bites\\" his penis off?

After swimming together, they go into a cave to get warm and begin kissing. Dawn gets uncomfortable and tries to get them to go back. Tobey then attempts to rape Dawn, who panics and tries to push him off. Tobey becomes aggressive and shakes Dawn, resulting in her smacking her head on the ground. While she is dazed, Tobey takes the opportunity to begin raping her. Dawn fights back and inadvertently bites off his penis with her vagina. A horrified Dawn stumbles away and she flees the scene.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Depending on what part of the world you are moving from, Norway could be culturally and climatically very far removed from what you are used to. If you are moving from Northern Europe, the change will less dramatic than if you are moving from Central America or East Asia. The chances are that you have already visited and spent some time in Norway, if you have decided that you want to make the move over there.  If you haven't actually been there, it's sensible to try to book yourself a holiday and spent a couple of weeks travelling around the country. Talk to people and try to get a feel for the culture and sensibilities of Norwegian people. One of the biggest adjustments and potential barriers to living in a new country can be the language. If you don't speak Norwegian, you might have a tough time finding work and dealing with the administrative and bureaucratic processes of finding a place to live and register as a resident. Although English is widely spoken in Norway, it's a good idea to try to learn some basic Norwegian before you go.  Once you are there be sure to commit enough time to learning the language. Your experiences, relationships and opportunities will likely stay reasonably narrow if you can't operate in the local language. One of the biggest shocks to new arrivals in Norway might be the weather. Parts of Norway are in the Arctic circle, so you should expect plenty of cold, wind and rain. The weather does vary depending on weather you live close to the coast or more inland. As a general rule, the coastal areas will have milder winters, but will experience more wind and rain throughout the year.  The average winter temperature of Oslo is around -4 degrees Celsius, or 23 degree Fahrenheit. Winter snow and frosts can occur from October, all the way to April. In the summer months you can expect milder temperatures, and even the occasional heat wave. Norway has very long days in summer that can cause problems to people who have not experienced this before. In the winter, however, the long days are replaced by long nights. The impact of this will depend where you are moving from, but it can cause problems.  In the summer in Oslo, it will generally not get any darker than twilight. The further north you go, the longer the days. If you go far enough north you will reach a point where the sun doesn't set. In winter, the daylight in Oslo can be as brief as six hours. In Tromsø, above the Arctic circle, the sun does not rise for six weeks. One of the potential problems with living in Norway, is the relatively high cost of living. Housing costs and eating out can be expensive, and there are relatively high levels of taxation. Be sure to spend some time thinking about housing and other essential costs, as well as how much money you can expect to earn.

General Assembly, where some of the most-controversial speakers spoke last. Here are a few things we learned:. 1. The Syrian government is not backing down. Foreign Minister Walid Moallem took to the lectern to defend his country's handling of the 19-month crisis, which has spiraled into a civil war. He accused \\"some well-known countries\\" of pursuing \\"new colonial policies\\" under the guise of humanitarian efforts, and blamed Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Libya and others for \\"arming, funding, training and harboring armed terrorist groups.\\" International calls for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down are a \\"blatant interference in the domestic affairs of Syria,\\" the foreign minister said. Approximately 28,000 people have been killed in the conflict, according to the opposition, and hundreds of thousands have been forced from their homes. \\"While my government is working hard to meet the basic needs of citizens who have been forced by the violence of armed groups to flee their homes, some have sought to fabricate a refugee crisis in neighboring countries through inciting armed groups to intimidate Syrian civilians at border areas and forcing them to flee to neighboring countries,\\" said Moallem. U.N. debate this year largely centered around the conflict in Syria. Most of the international community condemns the government there, but can't agree on how to stop the bloodshed. Strong U.N. Security Council action has been blocked by longtime Syria supporters, Russia and China. 2. Cuba slams the U.S. embargo, which has been in place for more than 50 years. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez railed against his country's northern neighbor, blasting the embargo that was put in place in 1960. Cuba attributes much of its economic woe to the embargo, which it calls \\"the blockade.\\" Rodriguez said the policy has caused \\"invaluable human and economic damage,\\" and accused President Barack Obama of breaking promises he made in 2009. \\"The U.S. policy towards our region, whether under Democrat or Republican governments, is essentially the same. The promises made by the current president ... were not fulfilled,\\" he said, referring to Obama's initial pledge to lower some of the barriers in Cuban-American relations. In 2009, the U.S. Treasury Department lifted some restrictions on the ability of Cuban-Americans to visit relatives in Cuba and send them money, but the United States has kept key components of the embargo in place. The continued imprisonment of U.S. contractor Alan Gross, who was jailed in 2009 on suspicion of espionage, is thought to be the most recent reason why relations are not improving. \\"The United States do not have the slightest moral or political authority to judge Cuba,\\" Rodriguez told delegates. 3. The head of the North Korean delegation says a spark could set off war on the Korean Peninsula. Vice Foreign Minister Pak Kil-yon addressed delegates amid ever-present pressure on his country's nuclear program. He criticized the United States, claiming it wants to occupy the Korean Peninsula and use the region as a \\"stepping stone for realizing its strategy of dominating the whole of Asia.\\" \\"Today, due to the continued U.S. hostile policy towards DPRK, the vicious cycle of confrontation and aggravation of tensions is on ongoing phenomenon on the Korean Peninsula, which has become the world's most dangerous hotspot where a spark of fire could set off a thermonuclear war,\\" Pak said. He recalled the December death of longtime leader Kim Jong Il. Kim Jong Il's son and chosen successor, Kim Jong Un, has taken over as \\"supreme leader,\\" though the level of his influence on policy decisions remains unclear. Pak also made mention of the country's recent rocket launch. In April, North Korea launched a rocket, which failed less than two minutes into the flight. It said the launch was to put a satellite into orbit, but much of the international community saw it as a cover-up for testing ballistic missile technology. The move destroyed a deal reached in February under which Pyongyang agreed to suspend its nuclear activities in exchange for food aid shipments from the United States. \\"The United States took issue with our legitimate and peaceful space launch that followed the universal, international law and forced the U.N. Security Council to adopt an unjust statement,\\" Pak said. North Korea has been virtually isolated from the world by international sanctions over its development of a nuclear program.","output":"The 67th session of the U.N.

Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez criticized the U.S. embargo, which has been in place since 1960, attributing much of the country's economic turmoil to this policy. Rodriguez accused President Barack Obama of breaking promises he made in 2009, stating that U.S. policy towards Cuba has remained essentially the same under both Democrat and Republican governments. While the U.S. Treasury Department lifted some restrictions on Cuban-Americans in 2009, key components of the embargo remain in place. Rodriguez argued that the United States does not have the moral or political authority to judge Cuba.  3. North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Pak Kil-yon warned that a spark could set off a war on the Korean Peninsula, emphasizing the tension caused by the U.S. hostile policy towards North Korea. Pak accused the U.S. of wanting to occupy the Korean Peninsula and use it as a stepping stone to dominate Asia. Furthermore, he criticized the United States for taking issue with North Korea's recent rocket launch, which many in the international community saw as a cover-up for testing ballistic missile technology. North Korea has faced international isolation due to the development of its nuclear program."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Veteran Jim Furyk produced the round of the day at the Tour Championship in Atlanta after carding a score of 64 at East Lake. The American birdied six of the first nine holes to record an outward 29 as he raced through the field. Furyk won the FedEX Cup 10 million prize two years ago and looked to have an incredible opportunity to record a 59 after hitting seven birdies in the first ten holes. He also claimed birdies at the 15th and 17th but bogeys at the 13th, 16th and 18th left him just two shots clear at the top of the leader board. England's Justin Rose shot a 68 to move into second place on six-under-par. The joint overnight leader hit five birdies to remain in contention following his opening round of 66. But World No.1 Rory McIlroy remained in pole position to claim that 10 prize for overall winner of the playoffs after producing his 10th consecutive sub-70 score. McIlroy sank a 25-foot eagle putt on the 16th to ensure he finished with a round of 68 and leave him four shots off the lead at halfway. The Northern Irishman was joined on three-under-par by Americans Robert Garrigus and Zach Johnson after both players hit rounds of 69. Woods and Rose share first round lead. But Tiger Woods, who shot an opening round 66 to share the lead with Rose, struggled to produce a repeat performance. Woods, whose last win came at July's AT & T National, could only manage a 73 to leave him on one-under-par, a setback to his challenge to McIlroy for the playoffs title. Masters champion Bubba Watson moved into contention on five-under-par alongside Bo Van Pelt, with Matt Kuchar and Dustin Johnson a shot further back. Last year's money list winner Luke Donald of England shot a 69 to finish level par at the halfway stage, while his compatriot Lee Westwood was 28th out of 30 on five-over-par following a disappointing round of 73. .

Justin Rose from England is in second place with a score of 68. 4. Rory McIlroy is doing well and is in a good position to win a big prize of 10 million. 5.

By now, it seems, the whole Chinese Internet is familiar with what happened on a crowded Hong Kong shopping street. A mother holds a nappy   while her two-year-old pees. A passerby took pictures which then were put online.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants.  Paragraph: Two groups of scientists examined two fires. Group A put a large log on it, and group B made a fire with small twigs. They wanted to see which fire would last longer.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group had a fire with wood that provoked a more intense reaction? The answer to this question is:","output":"Group B, who made a fire with small twigs, had a fire with wood that provoked a more intense reaction. This is because the small twigs provided a greater surface area for the reaction to occur compared to the large log used by Group A. As explained in the background, an increase in surface area leads to an increase in the rate of a reaction. Since the smaller twigs have a larger combined surface area, the reaction happening in the fire will be more intense as it allows for more effective contact and interaction between the wood and the oxygen in the air.  Furthermore, the more substantial surface area of the small twigs also means that a larger number of chemical reactions can take place concurrently, resulting in a faster and more intense combustion process. This is why the fire created by Group B using small twigs will burn with a more intense reaction relative to Group A's fire with the large log. It's important to note that the higher intensity of the reaction in Group B's fire with twigs does not mean that their fire will last longer. On the contrary, the more intense and rapid combustion process will likely cause their fire to burn out more quickly when compared to the slower-burning large log used by Group A. However, the question specifically asked about the intensity of the reaction, and in that regard, Group B's fire exhibits a more intense reaction due to the increased surface area provided by the small twigs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the below context:  On 10 March 1914, the suffragette Mary Richardson walked into the National Gallery and attacked Velázquez's canvas with a meat cleaver. Her action was ostensibly provoked by the arrest of fellow suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst the previous day, although there had been earlier warnings of a planned suffragette attack on the collection. Richardson left seven slashes on the painting, particularly causing damage to the area between the figure's shoulders. However, all were successfully repaired by the National Gallery's chief restorer Helmut Ruhemann.Richardson was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, the maximum allowed for destruction of an artwork. In a statement to the Women's Social and Political Union shortly afterwards, Richardson explained, \\"I have tried to destroy the picture of the most beautiful woman in mythological history as a protest against the Government for destroying Mrs. Pankhurst, who is the most beautiful character in modern history.\\" She added in a 1952 interview that she didn't like \\"the way men visitors gaped at it all day long\\".The feminist writer Lynda Nead observed, \\"The incident has come to symbolize a particular perception of feminist attitudes towards the female nude; in a sense, it has come to represent a specific stereotypical image of feminism more generally.\\" Contemporary reports of the incident reveal that the picture was not widely seen as mere artwork. Journalists tended to assess the attack in terms of a murder (Richardson was nicknamed \\"Slasher Mary\\"), and used words that conjured wounds inflicted on an actual female body, rather than on a pictorial representation of a female body. The Times described a \\"cruel wound in the neck\\", as well as incisions to the shoulders and back.  Guess a valid title for it!

But South Korea ended the day on top of the group following a 2-0 victory over Greece in Port Elizabeth earlier on Saturday. Goals from Lee Jung-Soo and Park Ji-Sung gave the 2002 semifinalists a comfortable win over the 2008 European cvhampions.

Sunburns, characterized by redness, pain, and sometimes swelling, are typically viewed as an unpleasant experience stemming from excessive exposure to the sun or ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Many people find them uncomfortable and disruptive to their daily life, as they can potentially result in peeling, blistering, and other symptoms. In this context, the author is expressing that they have experienced sunburn on their entire body, which likely has caused a significant amount of discomfort.

Regional social norms are generally antagonistic to hunting, while a few sects, such as the Bishnoi, lay special emphasis on the conservation of particular species, such as the antelope. India's Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 bans the killing of all wild animals. However, the Chief Wildlife Warden may, if satisfied that any wild animal from a specified list has become dangerous to human life, or is so disabled or diseased as to be beyond recovery, permit any person to hunt such an animal. In this case, the body of any wild animal killed or wounded becomes government property. What bans the killing of all wild animals in India?","output":"In India, the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 bans the killing of all wild animals. This legislation was enacted to provide a comprehensive framework for the protection and conservation of wildlife in India, including endangered and threatened species, as well as their habitats. The Act prohibits hunting, capturing, injuring, or killing wild animals, except under specific circumstances, such as when the animal poses a danger to human life or is severely injured or diseased beyond recovery. The Wildlife Protection Act also empowers the Chief Wildlife Warden to grant permissions for hunting certain animals if they are deemed a threat to human life or if they are in a condition that cannot be treated or cured. In these instances, the body of the killed or wounded animal becomes government property. Along with the Wildlife Protection Act, regional social norms and specific sects such as the Bishnoi community also contribute to the conservation of wildlife in India. The Bishnoi sect emphasizes the protection of certain species, like the antelope, and discourages hunting activities. Overall, the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 plays a pivotal role in banning the killing of all wild animals in India, while the support of local communities and religious sects aids in promoting wildlife conservation within the country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Process:  - There is a fetus in the womb - They are born and are a baby - The baby grows into a child - Puberty turns the child into an adolescent - The adolescent becomes an adult - An adult becomes an elderly person - The elderly person dies.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Every breath I exhale carbon dioxide happens, how will it affect no baby will be born.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the process The process describes the stages of human life: from being a fetus in the womb, to eventually dying as an elderly person. Step 2: Understand the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis is that every time someone exhales carbon dioxide, no baby will be born. We need to evaluate if exhaling carbon dioxide affects the birth of babies. Step 3: Examine the relationship between exhaling carbon dioxide and the birth of babies Exhaling carbon dioxide is a byproduct of respiration, which is a natural and essential process for all living organisms, including humans. The birth of babies is a result of reproduction, another natural and essential process in the continuation of the human species. Step 4: Determine if the perturbation affects the process The act of exhaling carbon dioxide does not appear to have a direct impact on the birth of babies. The two processes (respiration and reproduction) occur independently of one another. Step 5: Consider any indirect effects of the perturbation on the process While it is true that the presence of excessive carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can contribute to climate change and other environmental issues, this would not directly prevent a baby from being born. Instead, it might contribute to a range of broader issues that could affect humanity as a whole, including the availability of resources, ecosystems, and general quality of life. However, these indirect effects are more global and long-term, and not directly linked to the act of exhaling carbon dioxide and the birth of an individual baby. Conclusion: The supposed perturbation (every breath I exhale carbon dioxide) does not have a direct effect on the process (fetus to elderly person). Exhaling carbon dioxide is a natural part of human respiration and does not directly impact reproduction or the birth of babies. While there may be indirect effects related to environmental issues, they do not directly prevent a baby from being born."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species.  Paragraph: Two teams studied two types of animals: team A studied predators, while team B studied grazers. They learned a lot from this experience.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which team learned less about wolves?

Asia was mostly populated by reptiles of all species, while Africa was mostly populated by birds and very few reptiles.  Which continent was inhabited by fewer crocodiles?  Hint: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw... Answer:","output":"Given the information provided, it is important to note that Asia was mostly populated by reptiles of all species, while Africa was mostly populated by birds and very few reptiles. Since crocodiles belong to the class of reptiles, we can infer that there were fewer crocodiles in Africa than in Asia. The primary reason behind this outcome is due to the varying ecosystems and habitats on the two continents. In Asia, the climate and environment are more suitable for sustaining a diverse range of reptiles, including crocodiles. The continent is home to numerous tropical and subtropical regions, as well as vast river systems and wetlands that provide adequate living conditions for these animals. On the other hand, Africa is well-known for its rich avian diversity; however, the continent possesses fewer suitable habitats for sustaining a large reptile population. While some African habitats, such as the Nile River, do support crocodile populations, the overall reptile population in Africa is relatively small compared to that of Asia. This is presumably due to factors such as habitat availability, climate, and competition within the respective ecosystems. One example that highlights this conclusion is the distribution of the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) in Africa. Although the Nile crocodile is the largest and most widespread crocodile species on the continent, its distribution is limited to specific freshwater habitats that provide the necessary resources for survival, such as lakes, rivers, marshes, and mangrove swamps. In comparison, Asia offers a variety of habitats that support multiple crocodile species, including saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus), Siamese crocodiles (Crocodylus siamensis), and mugger crocodiles (Crocodylus palustris), among others. In conclusion, while both continents are home to various species of crocodiles, the higher reptile population in Asia indicates that there are fewer crocodiles in Africa overall. This variation in crocodile populations can be attributed to the differences in climate, ecosystems, and the availability of suitable habitats."},{"instruction":"Cerberus just stared at me.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. Question: When were people MOST likely to overeat processed food due to a certain quality? Options: - After not consuming salt for more than 48 hours. - not enough information - When high amounts of salt were added during processing. - When sweet and fatty foods were offered at breakfast. A:","output":"When high amounts of salt were added during processing."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Question: Question: Why do some people quit work and go back to school for? Options: - face problems - better themselves - become disillusioned - knowledge - talk to each other  Explain why a human would choose \\"better themselves\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"Many individuals choose to quit work and go back to school in order to better themselves, which entails pursuing personal improvement and fulfillment on multiple levels, such as intellectual, emotional, and professional growth. This decision is an indication of the individual's intrinsic motivation to lead more fulfilling lives and achieve their full potential. There are several reasons that can contribute to this choice, which are discussed below. 1. Career Advancement: One of the main reasons some individuals decide to go back to school is the prospect of career advancement. Academic degrees, certifications, and specialized training can significantly improve a person's chances of securing better job positions, higher salaries, and increased job security. These factors contribute to an overall sense of professional progress and growth. By investing in themselves, individuals are more likely to gain a competitive edge in their field and enjoy a more rewarding career in the long run. 2. Skill Enhancement: Going back to school allows individuals to acquire new skills and expertise that they may not have had the opportunity to develop in their current jobs, enabling them to adapt to the ever-evolving workforce. This drives individuals to pursue higher education or specialized training, wishing to enhance their problem-solving, critical thinking, communication, and technical skills. Improved skill sets not only increase one's marketability to employers but also contribute to personal growth and self-esteem. 3. Passion and Personal Interests: Some individuals may choose to go back to school to explore new subjects or areas of interest that they are passionate about. These individuals realize that pursuing their passions or deepening their knowledge in their chosen field will lead to a more satisfying life and career. Engaging in higher education for personal interest can lead to a more profound sense of purpose and personal fulfillment, as individuals are driven by the joy of learning rather than external pressure or expectations. 4. Intellectual Curiosity and Lifelong Learning: Humans are innately curious, and for some, the desire to learn and improve oneself fuels the decision to return to school. Lifelong learning is a concept embraced by many, as it promotes continuous personal and professional growth, adaptability, and a well-rounded perspective on life. Seeking higher education to satisfy this curiosity and dedication to expanding one's knowledge contributes to individual betterment and intellectual enrichment. 5. Networking Opportunities: Going back to school brings individuals into contact with a diverse community of peers, professors, and professionals who share similar goals, values, and aspirations. Establishing meaningful connections within this community offers valuable networking opportunities that can further advance one's career and personal development. Additionally, being part of a thriving educational environment fosters a sense of camaraderie, support, and shared motivation that can be instrumental in promoting personal growth. In conclusion, choosing to quit work and go back to school to better oneself is a multifaceted decision driven by various factors, including career advancement, skill enhancement, passion for personal interests, intellectual curiosity, and networking opportunities. A commitment to self-improvement and personal growth drives these individuals to invest in themselves and their future, solidifying the choice to return to higher education as a transformative and life-enriching experience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A prosecutor in Texas wants Adrian Peterson arrested and his bond revoked after the NFL star allegedly admitted to smoking marijuana while out on bail on a felony child abuse charge. Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon sent a motion to the 9th District Court to set aside the NFL star's bail, saying Peterson told an employee of a company that does drug testing that he \\"smoked a little weed.\\" Peterson posted 15,000 bail on September 12.

It carries the same meaning of expressing agreement or an obvious fact in both languages. 2. \\"just\\" - It can be translated as \\"klidně,\\" which adds a sense of assurance and casualness to the sentence, much like \\"just\\" does in English. In this context, it implies that the speaker is okay with the action or does not mind it. 3. \\"take\\" - The verb \\"to take\\" is translated as \\"vzít\\" in Czech.

It implies that the speaker is giving permission or offering something. 4. \\"it\\" - The pronoun \\"it\\" can be translated to \\"to\\" in Czech.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What was the name of the album that peaked at number 8 on the charts? is inside the article: A significant stylistic shift in the Kinks' music became evident in late 1965, with the appearance of singles like \\"A Well Respected Man\\" and \\"Dedicated Follower of Fashion\\", as well as the band's third album, The Kink Kontroversy, on which session musician Nicky Hopkins made his first appearance with the group on keyboards. These recordings exemplified the development of Davies' songwriting style, from hard-driving rock numbers toward songs rich in social commentary, observation and idiosyncratic character study, all with a uniquely English flavour.The satirical single \\"Sunny Afternoon\\" was the biggest UK hit of summer 1966, topping the charts and displacing the Beatles' \\"Paperback Writer\\". Before the release of The Kink Kontroversy, Ray Davies suffered a nervous and physical breakdown, caused by the pressures of touring, writing and ongoing legal squabbles. During his months of recuperation, he wrote several new songs and pondered the band's direction. Quaife was involved in an automobile accident, and after his recovery decided to step back from the band for much of 1966. Bassist John Dalton filled in until Quaife returned to the group at the end of the year.\\"Sunny Afternoon\\" was a dry run for the band's next album Face to Face, which displayed Davies' growing ability to craft gentle yet cutting narrative songs about everyday life and people. Hopkins returned for the sessions to play various keyboard instruments, including piano and harpsichord. He played on the band's next two studio albums as well, and was involved on a number of their live BBC recordings before joining the Jeff Beck Group in 1968. Face to Face was released in October 1966 in the UK, where it was well received and peaked at number eight. It was released in the US in December and was tipped as a potential \\"chart winner\\" by Billboard magazine.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin,  (26 June 1824 - 17 December 1907) was a Scots-Irish mathematical physicist and engineer who was born in Belfast in 1824. At the University of Glasgow he did important work in the mathematical analysis of electricity and formulation of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and did much to unify the emerging discipline of physics in its modern form. He worked closely with mathematics professor Hugh Blackburn in his work. Though now eminent in the academic field, Thomson was obscure to the general public. In September 1852, he married childhood sweetheart Margaret Crum, daughter of Walter Crum; but her health broke down on their honeymoon and, over the next seventeen years, Thomson was distracted by her suffering. On 16 October 1854, George Gabriel Stokes wrote to Thomson to try to re-interest him in work by asking his opinion on some experiments of Michael Faraday on the proposed transatlantic telegraph cable.  Faraday had demonstrated how the construction of a cable would limit the rate at which messages could be sent - in modern terms, the bandwidth. Thomson jumped at the problem and published his response that month. He expressed his results in terms of the data rate that could be achieved and the economic consequences in terms of the potential revenue of the transatlantic undertaking. In a further 1855 analysis, Thomson stressed the impact that the design of the cable would have on its profitability.  Thomson contended that the signalling speed through a given cable was inversely proportional to the square of the length of the cable. Thomson's results were disputed at a meeting of the British Association in 1856 by Wildman Whitehouse, the electrician of the Atlantic Telegraph Company. Whitehouse had possibly misinterpreted the results of his own experiments but was doubtless feeling financial pressure as plans for the cable were already well under way. He believed that Thomson's calculations implied that the cable must be \\"abandoned as being practically and commercially impossible.\\"  Thomson attacked Whitehouse's contention in a letter to the popular Athenaeum magazine, pitching himself into the public eye. Thomson recommended a larger conductor with a larger cross section of insulation. However, he thought Whitehouse no fool and suspected that he might have the practical skill to make the existing design work. Thomson's work had, however, caught the eye of the project's undertakers and in December 1856, he was elected to the board of directors of the Atlantic Telegraph Company. How did the public react to this letter?","output":"The public reaction to Thomson's letter in the Athenaeum magazine can be inferred from the fact that it propelled him into the public eye. While previously he was only known within the academic field, his letter contesting Wildman Whitehouse's contention and offering recommendations for the transatlantic cable project garnered attention from the public, as well as the project's undertakers. Thompson's expertise and intervention in the debate played a significant role in shaping public opinion on the issue and eventually led to his election to the board of directors of the Atlantic Telegraph Company in December 1856. This demonstrates that his ideas and contributions to the project were well-received and seen as valuable by both the general public and professionals involved in the project."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their fund-raising. The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated  Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any  Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring  Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's  Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money.  Question: \\"What was the result of following terrorist money flowing from point A to point B?\\" Answer: \\"CIA found it was hard to attack funds of Al Qaeda\\" Is this answer correct? Choose from: a. no b. yes...I think the answer is","output":"b. yes"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Vasco da Gama was born in 1460 or 1469 in Sines, on the southwest coast of Portugal, probably in a house near the church of Nossa Senhora das Salas. Sines, one of the few seaports on the Alentejo coast, consisted of little more than a cluster of whitewashed, red-tiled cottages, occupied chiefly by fisherfolk. Vasco da Gama's father was Estevao da Gama, who had served in the 1460s as a knight of the household of Infante Ferdinand, Duke of Viseu. He rose in the ranks of the military Order of Santiago. From the earlier part of the 15th century, Portuguese expeditions organized by Prince Henry the Navigator had been reaching down the African coastline, principally in search of west African riches (notably, gold). They had greatly extended Portuguese maritime knowledge, but had little profit to show for the effort. After Henry's death in 1460, the Portuguese Crown showed little interest in continuing this effort and, in 1469, sold off the neglected African enterprise to a private Lisbon merchant consortium led by Fernao Gomes. Within a few years, Gomes' captains expanded Portuguese knowledge across the Gulf of Guinea, doing business in gold dust, Melegueta pepper, ivory and sub-Saharan slaves. When Gomes' charter came up for renewal in 1474, Prince John (future John II), asked his father Afonso V of Portugal to pass the African charter to him.  Upon becoming king in 1481, John II of Portugal set out on many long reforms. To break the monarch's dependence on the feudal nobility, John II needed to build up the royal treasury; he considered royal commerce to be the key to achieving that. Under John II's watch, the gold and slave trade in west Africa was greatly expanded. He was eager to break into the highly profitable spice trade between Europe and Asia, which was conducted chiefly by land. At the time, this was virtually monopolized by the Republic of Venice, who operated overland routes via Levantine and Egyptian ports, through the Red Sea across to the spice markets of India. John II set a new objective for his captains: to find a sea route to Asia by sailing around the African continent.  By the time Vasco da Gama was in his 20s, the king's plans were coming to fruition. In 1487, John II dispatched two spies, Pero da Covilha and Afonso de Paiva, overland via Egypt to East Africa and India, to scout the details of the spice markets and trade routes. The breakthrough came soon after, when John II's captain Bartolomeu Dias returned from rounding the Cape of Good Hope in 1488, having explored as far as the Fish River (Rio do Infante) in modern-day South Africa and having verified that the unknown coast stretched away to the northeast.  An explorer was needed who could prove the link between the findings of Dias and those of da Covilha and de Paiva, and connect these separate segments into a potentially lucrative trade route across the Indian Ocean. What happened after Henry's death?","output":"After Henry the Navigator's death in 1460, the Portuguese Crown showed little interest in continuing the African exploration efforts initiated by Henry.

Now an explorer was needed to connect the findings of Dias with those of da Covilha and de Paiva to establish a potentially lucrative trade route across the Indian Ocean. This task would eventually fall to Vasco da Gama, who set sail in 1497 on a historic voyage that ultimately proved the feasibility of a sea route from Europe to Asia by circumnavigating Africa."},{"instruction":"Q: This task is about creating an unanswerable question based on a given passage.
