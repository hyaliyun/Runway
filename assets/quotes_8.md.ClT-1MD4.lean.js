In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The melon size varies between species, the bigger the more dependent they are of it. A beaked whale for example has a small bulge sitting on top of its skull, whereas a sperm whale's head is filled up mainly with the melon.The whale eye is relatively small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, the eyes of a whale are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When belugas surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light, but they have far more rod cells than they do cone cells. Whales do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most whales have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a  tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area.

Amy bought a brand new car last weekend while Kayla didn't, because  Select from: [+] Amy is very poor.; [+] Kayla is very poor.;","output":"Kayla is very poor. Amy couldn't contain her excitement. She had finally been able to save up enough money to buy the brand new car she'd been dreaming of since she saw it showcased at the Auto Expo last year. The sleek design, cutting-edge technology, and the efficiency the car offered were all features Amy knew she needed in her life. Most importantly, she'd been able to afford it comfortably, making the purchase feel even better. On the other hand, there was Kayla. Much like Amy, she, too, had set her eyes on a beautiful car that, upon seeing it, had captured her heart and fuelled her desires. However, life had thrown its fair share of challenges her way. Kayla struggled to make ends meet and led a very frugal life. In spite of cutting back on her expenses and attempting to save money, she just couldn't put enough together to buy the car she wanted. Her dreams seemed unattainable, at least for the time being. Despite being aware of Kayla's financial struggles, Amy couldn't help but invite her for a drive in her new car. Excitement overshadowed her practical thinking, and Kayla, not wanting to dampen Amy's spirits, agreed to go for a spin. During the drive, Amy was ecstatic to see the pure joy and excitement on Kayla's face as she became enraptured by the car's performance and comfort. In that brief moment, they both shared a sense of carefree bliss, feeling the wind on their faces as they cruised along the coastline. After the drive, as the two friends sat on the hood of Amy's car overlooking the ocean, their laughter began to fade, and the reality of their differing situations began to settle in. Kayla felt a wave of envy so sudden and intense that she wasn't sure what to do with herself. Amy, witnessing her friend's sudden change in disposition, immediately sensed Kayla's discomfort and a knot formed in her stomach. \\"I'm really sorry, Kayla,\\" Amy said, her voice suddenly somber. \\"I didn't think about how flaunting my new car might affect you. I just got caught up in the excitement of it all.\\" Kayla looked at her friend and forced a smile. \\"No, Amy, it's okay. I'm happy for you. I really am. It's just…I guess I wish things were different for me, you know?\\" Amy nodded empathetically. \\"I understand, and I wish there was something I could do to help. But remember that life has its ups and downs, and this is just a phase for you. Good times will come. I'm sure of it.\\" As they sat there, Amy tried to think of ways she could help Kayla without making her feel like she was receiving charity. She knew that Kayla was hardworking, responsible, and had a great work ethic. It was all just a matter of finding the right opportunity. That's when it struck her. \\"I have an idea,\\" Amy said excitedly. \\"My company is hiring, and I think you'd be perfect for the position. Plus, it pays really well. Why don't you apply for it? With a better-paying job, it wouldn't be long before you could save up and get your dream car.\\" Kayla considered Amy's suggestion and felt a flicker of hope. \\"You really think I'd be a good fit?\\" she asked cautiously. \\"Absolutely!\\" Amy insisted. \\"You have all the skills they're looking for, and I'd be more than happy to refer you.\\" Feeling grateful for Amy's help, Kayla decided to take her friend's advice and apply for the job. She knew deep down that life might be hard at present, but with a little determination and support from her friends, her situation could change for the better. As they continued to sit and talk about their dreams and aspirations, Amy and Kayla committed to helping each other face the uncertainties life had in store for them.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: biological species perching in the garden at beach","output":"In the given sentence, \\"biological species perching in the garden at beach\\", the most important words can be determined based on their significance in conveying the overall meaning of the sentence. Here are the most important words along with explanations for their importance: 1. Biological species: This term holds a primary significance in the sentence, as it is the subject being discussed. It tells us that the sentence is about living organisms that belong to a particular species. Any context or action in the sentence revolves around these organisms. 2. Perching: This verb describes the action of the biological species, which gives us essential information about what the organisms are doing. It helps create a clear image of their state or situation, which aids significantly in understanding the sentence. Without this action, we would only have information about the organisms' existence but not their behavior. 3. Garden: This word provides the crucial context of location. By telling us where the biological species are perching, the sentence becomes more meaningful. Garden typically implies a specific environment, which can influence the interpretation of the sentence and conjure images of nature, growth, and perhaps a serene or peaceful ambiance. 4. Beach: \\"Beach\\" is another word that provides context about the location, as it clarifies where the garden is found. This additional context further enriches our understanding of the sentence and helps create a mental image of the scenery. Knowing that the garden is by the beach may imply a particular kind of climate, geography, and ecosystem. This information might also be relevant for the kind of biological species that can be found in such an environment. These four words, in combination, convey crucial information about the subject, action, and location of the sentence, and are thus deemed the most important in understanding its meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

New Zealand #39;s dollar rose and bonds fell after the central bank raised the nation #39;s benchmark interest rate for a fifth time and signaled it may boost rates again to curb inflation. OPTIONS: [A]. World; [B]. Sports; [C]. Business; [D]. Science/Tech;","output":"[C]. Business This news is about New Zealand's economy and financial markets, which fall under the category of business. The central bank has raised the benchmark interest rate for the fifth time, which will have an effect on the nation's economic landscape and financial markets. Interest rates have a direct impact on inflation, borrowing, and spending in an economy. In this case, the central bank signals that it may increase rates again in the future to control inflation. Raising the interest rate is a common method employed by central banks to keep inflation under control. Inflation refers to the overall increase in general price levels over time. Controlling inflation is crucial to maintain stability in an economy and protect the purchasing power of a nation's currency. In the given news, the rise of the New Zealand dollar and the decrease in bond prices are both consequences of the central bank's decision to raise the benchmark interest rate. When interest rates rise, currency values often strengthen, since higher interest rates typically attract more foreign capital due to the prospect of higher returns on investments. On the other hand, bond prices typically fall as interest rates increase. This is because investors demand higher yields to compensate for the increased interest rate risk. As bond yields rise to meet investor expectations, the bond prices decrease, reflecting the inverse relationship between bond yields and prices. The central bank's decision to raise interest rates and the subsequent effects on the country's currency and bond markets are all tied to business and economic activities. Such information is essential for businesses and investors as they make decisions, and it is a clear representation of how macroeconomic policies can shape the financial landscape in a given country. Additionally, this news provides insight into the central bank's stance on monetary policy, which plays an important role in the overall functioning of the economy. Understanding the central bank's policy actions aids in anticipating future economic conditions and can help businesses and individuals make more informed decisions in areas such as investments, savings, and borrowing. Overall, the news about New Zealand's central bank increasing the benchmark interest rate, the implications on the nation's economy, and the potential for further rate hikes fall under the business category, as it deals with financial market dynamics and economic activity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

He worried also lest Pakistani authorities not get adequate warning, think the missiles came from India, RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA'S INITIAL ASSAULTS 135 and do something that everyone would later regret. Discussing potential repercussions in the region of his military responsibility, Zinni said, \\"It was easy to take the shot from Washington and walk away from it. We had to live there.\\" Zinni's distinct preference would have been to build up counterterrorism capabilities in neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan. But he told us that he could not drum up much interest in or money for such a purpose from Washington, partly, he thought, because these countries had dictatorial governments. After the decision-in which fear of collateral damage was an important factor- not to use cruise missiles against Kandahar in December 1998, Shelton and officers in the Pentagon developed plans for using an AC-130 gunship instead of cruise missile strikes. Designed specifically for the special forces, the version of the AC-130 known as \\"Spooky\\"can fly in fast or from high altitude, undetected by radar; guided to its zone by extraordinarily complex electronics, it is capable of rapidly firing precision-guided 25, 40, and 105 mm projectiles. Because this system could target more precisely than a salvo of cruise missiles, it had a much lower risk of causing collateral damage. After giving Clarke a briefing and being encouraged to proceed, Shelton formally directed Zinni and General Peter Schoomaker, who headed the Special Operations Command, to develop plans for an AC-130 mission against  Bin Laden's headquarters and infrastructure in Afghanistan. The Joint Staff prepared a decision paper for deployment of the Special Operations aircraft. Though Berger and Clarke continued to indicate interest in this option, the AC-130s were never deployed. Clarke wrote at the time that Zinni opposed their use, and John Maher, the Joint Staff 's deputy director of operations, agreed that this was Zinni's position. Zinni himself does not recall blocking the option. He told us that he understood the Special Operations Command had never thought the intelligence good enough to justify actually moving AC-130s into position. Schoomaker says, on the contrary, that he thought the AC-130 option feasible. The most likely explanation for the two generals' differing recollections is that both of them thought serious preparation for any such operations would require a long-term redeployment of Special Operations forces to the Middle East or South Asia. The AC-130s would need bases because the aircraft's unrefueled range was only a little over 2,000 miles.

Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"More pollution will most likely not affect the frequency of bacterial entry into the body in any significant way. There's no direct link between the two variables. Explanation:  Here, the user is asking me to analyze how an increase in pollution would affect the amount of bacteria entering the body.

The occurrence of pollution primarily affects air quality and, to some extent, might impact the types of bacteria or the volume of bacteria in the environment. However, these changes don't necessarily translate into more or fewer bacteria entering the body because the human body has multiple mechanisms (like skin, cilia in the respiratory system, etc.) to prevent bacterial entry regardless of the environment. Thus, based on the steps and factors involved, an increase in pollution would likely have no direct effect on the frequency or volume of bacteria entering the body and subsequently hitting the bloodstream.  However, it's necessary to mention that increased pollution can have indirect health effects that could potentially weaken the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to bacterial infections, but as per the specific context given (direct bacterial entry in the body), the effect would be minor or none."},{"instruction":"Read the bio below and try to give details on jim swinden 's:    - death place     - clubs     - caps     - position     - years     - height     - death date     - youthclubs     - youthyears       - birth date     - fullname     - name     - birth place     - goals     Bio: james frederick \`\` jim '' swinden -lrb- 30 january 1905 -- march 1971 -rrb- was an english professional footballer who played as an inside-forward for southampton in the 1920s .

Given the question: Background: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.  Paragraph: John wanted to revisit Aristotle's theory of tetrapods. To that end, he chose two tetrapods, tetA and tetB. An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. Moreover, a tetA had longer gestation period than tetB. He needed to figure out how their characteristics fit Aristotle's theory.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which tetrapod would live longer, tetA or tetB? The answer is:","output":"tetA. Step 1: Understand the background information provided about Aristotle's theory. According to Aristotle's theory, there are correlations between body mass, gestation period, and lifespan in live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals). These correlations are: - Brood size decreases with body mass. - Lifespan increases with gestation period and body mass. - Fecundity decreases with lifespan. Step 2: Apply the data from the paragraph to Aristotle's theory. In the given paragraph, John chose two tetrapods, tetA and tetB, with the following characteristics: - An adult tetA is heavier than an adult tetB (higher body mass). - A tetA has a longer gestation period than tetB. Step 3: Determine which tetrapod would live longer based on the given data and Aristotle's theory. According to Aristotle's theory, lifespan increases with both gestation period and body mass. Given that tetA has a higher body mass and a longer gestation period compared to tetB, we can infer that tetA would have a longer lifespan than tetB. Therefore, tetA would live longer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Maria could not figure it out.; (B). Sarah could not figure it out.;","output":"Maria asked Sarah if they knew how to set up a smartphone because Maria could not figure it out (A). In this situation, Maria is experiencing difficulties with setting up her new smartphone. It's quite common for people, especially those who have recently purchased a new or upgraded device, to face challenges with its configuration. Setting up a smartphone typically involves several steps. First, the user needs to insert the SIM card, power on the device, and establish an initial connection with the carrier network. This will allow the phone to be activated and for calls, texts, and data services to function properly. Next, the user will need to connect the device to a Wi-Fi network or use mobile data to download and install any software updates that may be available. Moreover, setting up a smartphone also entails creating or signing in to a user account. This account is usually linked to an email address or a phone number and allows the user to access the device manufacturer's apps, cloud storage, and services. For example, Android users often sign in with their Google accounts, while Apple users use Apple IDs. To personalize the device, users must customize the settings, selecting preferences that suit their needs and preferences. They may choose their preferred language, set the time and date, and adjust system preferences such as brightness, notification settings, and volume levels. Additionally, users can configure their device's security measures by creating a password, generating a passcode, or using biometric authentication methods, such as fingerprint recognition or facial scanning. Maria, having faced trouble with these tasks, turns to Sarah for help. Fortunately, Sarah is an individual well-versed in setting up smartphones and has extensive knowledge of the device setup processes. These include transferring contacts, messages, photos, and other data from the old device to the new one, as well as installing and organizing useful apps. Maria's difficulties might have arisen from various factors, such as a lack of familiarity with the new device's operating system, not understanding certain settings or features, or simply feeling overwhelmed by the multitude of customizable options. It's important to remember that seeking assistance with technology doesn't signify a lack of capacity or intelligence – sometimes people simply have different areas of expertise. By asking for Sarah's help, Maria can learn how to set up her smartphone correctly, and in return, perhaps share her own knowledge with Sarah in a different domain. This exchange of knowledge can strengthen their relationship, foster collaborative problem-solving, and create a more supportive community."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: The answer to the question: What genres are defined chiefly by lyrical focus? is inside the article: The term \\"Viking metal\\" has sometimes been used as a nickname for the 1990s Norwegian black metal scene, which was \\"noisy, chaotic, and often augmented by sorrowful keyboard melodies\\". It has also been variously described as a subgenre of black metal, albeit one that abandoned black metal's Satanic imagery, \\"slow black metal\\" with influences from Nordic folk music, straddling black metal and folk metal almost equally, or running the gamut from \\"folk to black to death metal\\". Typically, Viking metal artists rely extensively on keyboards, which are often played at a \\"swift, galloping pace\\". These artists often add \\"local cultural flourishes\\" such as traditional instruments and ethnic melodies. It is similar to folk metal, and is sometimes categorized as such, but it uses folk instruments less extensively. For vocals, Viking metal incorporates both singing and the typical black metal screams and growls. Overall, Viking metal is hard to define since, apart from certain elements like anthem-like choruses, it is not based entirely on musical features and overlaps with other metal genres, with origins in black and death metal Some bands, such as Unleashed and Amon Amarth, play death metal, but incorporate Viking themes and thus are labeled as part of the genre. Generally, Viking metal is defined more by its thematic material and imagery than musical qualities. Rather than being a mock-up of medieval music, \\"it is in the band names, album titles, artwork of album covers and, especially, in the song lyrics that Viking themes are so evident.\\" Viking metal, and the closely related style pagan metal, is more of a term or \\"etiquette\\" than a musical style. Since they are defined chiefly by lyrical focus, any musical categorizations of these two styles is controversial. Thus, Viking metal is more of a cross-genre term than a descriptor of a certain sound. Ashby and Schofield write that \\"The term 'Viking metal' is one of many that falls within a complex web of genres and subgenres, the precise form of which is constantly..., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"Viking metal and pagan metal are two genres that are chiefly defined by their lyrical focus. These two styles place a strong emphasis on thematic material and imagery, often drawing on Viking and pagan themes. Rather than being characterized by specific musical qualities, they can incorporate musical elements from a broad range of other genres, making them more of a cross-genre term than a descriptor of a particular sound. These genres often incorporate anthem-like choruses and may use traditional instruments and ethnic melodies, but the classification is primarily based on the lyrical content and overall thematic focus. Therefore, Viking metal is not simply a subgenre of black metal or a version of medieval music, but employs Viking themes in elements like band names, album titles, artwork of album covers, and especially in the song lyrics. It's more about the expression of a culturally specific thematic material than musical categorization, hence leading to controversial categorizations in music genres."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, it was in 1700 when he founded the Mission San Xavier del Bac, which is approximately 7 miles (11 kilometers) from the site of his initial visit. The Mission was established to evangelize and provide assistance to the native populations in the region, particularly the Tohono O'odham people, who have lived in the Sonoran Desert for thousands of years. The mission is named in honor of the Christian missionary and co-founder of the Society of Jesus, St. Francis Xavier. It is situated along the banks of the Santa Cruz River, approximately 10 miles south of present-day Tucson, Arizona. The location for the Mission was carefully chosen by Kino, as the area had fertile soil and a reliable water source, which were essential for agriculture and the mission's sustainability. Over the years, the Mission has gone through several changes and phases of construction. The first church building constructed at the site was a simple adobe structure. It was later replaced with a larger church that was designed and constructed by Ignacio Gaona, a prominent architect and builder of the time. The church, which now stands as the iconic Spanish Baroque structure known today as the White Dove of the Desert, was completed in the late 18th century. Throughout its long history, the Mission has faced numerous challenges, including abandonment, repairs, restorations, and even a temporary closure during the Mexican Jesuit Expulsion in the mid-18th century. Despite these challenges, Mission San Xavier del Bac still stands today as an important historical, cultural, and spiritual landmark. In conclusion, Mission San Xavier del Bac was founded by Jesuit missionary Eusebio Francisco Kino in 1700, after he initially visited the Santa Cruz River valley in 1692. The mission holds great historical, cultural, and spiritual significance, serving as an iconic landmark in the southwest United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is due to an increase in nuclear charge. Alkali metals have the lowest electronegativities, while halogens have the highest. Because most noble gases do not form compounds, they do not have electronegativities. Note that there is little variation among the transition metals. Electronegativities generally decrease from top to bottom within a group due to the larger atomic size. Answer:","output":"Section A"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: CHICAGO (AP) — Best-selling author Kevin Trudeau, whose name became synonymous with late-night TV pitches, was sentenced to 10 years in prison Monday for bilking consumers through ubiquitous infomercials for his book, \\"The Weight Loss Cure 'They' Don't Want You to Know About.\\"      FILE - In this Oct. 28, 2013 file photo, television infomercial pitchman Kevin Trudeau speaks to the media after leaving the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Chicago. On Monday, March 17,... (Associated Press)      As he imposed the sentence prosecutors had requested, U.S. District Judge Ronald Guzman portrayed the 50-year-old Trudeau as a habitual fraudster going back to his early adulthood. So brazen was Trudeau, the judge said, he once even used his own mother's Social Security number in a scheme.      \\"Since his 20s, he has steadfastly attempted to cheat others for his own gain,\\" Guzman said, adding that Trudeau is \\"deceitful to the very core.\\"      Trudeau, whose trademark dyed black hair turned partially gray as he awaited sentencing in jail, showed little emotion as the stiff sentence was handed down at the hearing in Chicago.      Addressing the judge earlier in a 10-minute statement, Trudeau apologized and said he's become a changed man. He said he's meditated, prayed and read self-help books while locked up at Chicago's Metropolitan Correctional Center.      \\"I have truly had a significant reawakening,\\" said Trudeau, who was dressed in orange jail clothes. \\"If I ever do an infomercial again ... I promise: No embellishments, no puffery, no lies.\\"      While Trudeau appeared calm throughout the hearing, one of his supporters interrupted the judge at one point and began to speak. After cutting the judge short a second time, the man dropped to the floor and refused to leave. U.S. marshals carried him out of the courtroom.      Jurors convicted Trudeau of criminal contempt in November for defying a 2004 court order barring him from running false ads about the weight-loss book. Despite the order, he aired the infomercials at least 32,000 times, according to prosecutors.      He sold more than 850,000 copies of the weight-loss book, generating 39 million in revenue, prosecutors say. And the judge agreed with prosecutors that the amount of loss stemming from Trudeau's deception was more than 37 million — nearly the amount in revenue.      But in remarks Monday asking for a sentence of less than two years for his client, defense attorney Tom Kirsch said the harm Trudeau caused was minor compared to fraud in which some people are cheated out of their life savings.      \\"A 10-year sentence might be appropriate for a defendant who destroyed lives,\\" Kirsch said. \\"(But) Trudeau — if he swindled anyone — swindled them out of 30 (the price of the book).\\"      Another defense attorney, Carolyn Gurland, added that Trudeau's legal troubles had already cost him his businesses and his home, and nearly all his other worldly possessions.      \\"He has a suitcase containing his personal artifacts. That's what he has left,\\" she said.      But Guzman showed little sympathy, appearing angry as he said that Trudeau had thumbed his nose at the justice system by violating multiple court orders since the 1990s.      \\"He has treated federal court orders as if they were mere suggestions ... or impediments to be side-stepped, out-maneuvered or just ignored,\\" the judge said.      Trudeau's weight-loss book describes a grueling, 500-calorie-a-day diet, as well as hormone treatments. The deception, Guzman explained, came in Trudeau's infomercials that misrepresented the contents of the book as laying out \\"a simple, no hunger ... diet-free method of losing weight,\\" which enticed more people to buy the book.      Trudeau became rich selling millions of books with titles such as \\"Natural Cures 'They' Don't Want You to Know About\\" and \\"Debt Cures 'They' Don't Want You to Know About,\\" touting them in commercials with a news-interview formats.      As legal scrutiny intensified over the years, Trudeau claimed the U.S. government was out to get him, and he accused agencies and other vested interests of conspiring to suppress low-cost, common remedies to diseases, including cancer.      His weight-loss book, which once topped best-seller lists, was the focus of the criminal conviction for which he was sentenced. It also was the subject of related civil case brought by the Federal Trade Commission, in which Trudeau was ordered to pay a 37 million judgment.      In that civil case, Trudeau said he couldn't pay the judgment because he's broke. But FTC lawyers balked at that claim, accusing him of hiding money in shell companies. Trudeau, they noted, has spent lavishly in recent years, including 359 on two haircuts.      ___      Follow Michael Tarm on Twitter at https://twitter.com/mtarm . ||||| Kevin Trudeau has his day in court      When TV huckster Kevin Trudeau stood in a packed federal courtroom to make one final sales pitch Monday, he hardly resembled the tanned, dapper figure seen hawking miracle diets and natural cancer cures on so many late-night infomercials.      After spending four months in jail for contempt of court, Trudeau’s trademark jet black coif was thin and gray. His usual tailored suit was replaced by rumpled orange jail clothes. Even his typical air of defiance had turned to contrition, a change he said washed over him during his sleepless first night in custody.      “If I ever write a book again, if I ever do another infomercial again, I promise no embellishment, no puffery and absolutely no lies,” Trudeau told U.S. District Judge Ronald Guzman in a remorseful tone. “I know going forward I will be a better person.”      But the judge wasn’t buying a word.      Moments after Trudeau’s plea for leniency, a visibly irritated Guzman sentenced the best-selling author to 10 years in prison, citing Trudeau’s decades-long history of fraud and calling him “deceitful to the core.”      “He has treated federal court orders as if they were mere suggestions...or at most impediments to be sidestepped, outmaneuvered or just ignored,” Guzman said in handing down an unusually lengthy prison term for a contempt conviction. “That type of conduct simply cannot stand.”      At the defense table, Trudeau sat back in his chair and smiled slightly as the judge announced his decision. Before he was escorted back to the lockup by U.S. deputy marshals, he turned and waved at the dozens of supporters who had packed the courtroom gallery, mouthing the words, “Thank you.”      It was a tranquil end to a two-hour hearing that at one point had grown raucous. As Guzman was questioning one of Trudeau’s attorneys, an elderly supporter suddenly stood in the front row of the audience and bellowed, “Judge, I am a former U.S. congressman!” before being ordered to sit down.      After another outburst a few minutes later, the man, later identified as Ed Foreman, 80, of Dallas, was ordered to leave the courtroom. He refused, and when security officers tried to stand Foreman up, he went limp and was eventually carried out as other spectators shouted in protest.      “You are not entitled to disrupt the proceedings,” Guzman told the remaining audience members, some of whom sobbed loudly. “I urge you to simply keep quiet and listen.”      Foreman, a former Congressman who represented districts in Texas and New Mexico four decades ago, was ticketed for creating a disturbance, a petty offense payable by a 150 fine and court fees, officials said. According to his website, he is a motivational speaker who has previously touted Trudeau’s Global Information Network, touted as an international club that charges membership fees in exchange for success “secrets.”      Trudeau has been jailed since Nov. 12 when he was convicted by a federal jury of criminal contempt for lying in several infomercials about the contents of his hit book, “The Weight Loss Cure 'They' Don't Want You to Know About.” Prosecutors said he ignored a previous court order by describing the program as easy when it actually called for punishing calorie restrictions and a crippling list of food restrictions.      Meanwhile, U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman has repeatedly found Trudeau in civil contempt for failing to pay anything toward a 37.6 million fine imposed by the Federal Trade Commission in spite of continuing to live a lavish lifestyle.      On Monday, prosecutors cited Trudeau’s history of fraud that goes back to a state conviction in 1984.      “He is a habitual liar and a fraudster,” Assistant U.S. Attorney April Perry said.      As a result of the size of the fraud and Trudeau’s two previous felony convictions, federal sentencing guidelines called for 20 to 25 years in prison, a range that Guzman said he thought was “appropriate.” However, he eventually agreed with prosecutors who said a 10-year term was sufficient since -- unlike in many fraud cases -- no one who bought Trudeau’s book was financially ruined.      Trudeau’s attorneys argued that prosecutors vastly inflated the amount of harm done by Trudeau’s misleading infomercials, saying many buyers were satisfied with the weight loss book.      In his lengthy statement to the court, Trudeau said he has been “completely wiped out” financially and that he and his wife Nataliya Babenko, 26, are “effectively homeless.” He said his time at the Metropolitan Correctional Center has changed his perspective and led him to realize he had made many errors. While he wouldn’t wish incarceration on anyone, the experience has wound up being “one of the best, most positive things in my life,” Trudeau said.      “In the past four months I have been stripped of all ego, defiance, arrogance and pride and for that I am thankful,” Trudeau said as he stooed at a lectern and read from typed notes.      But Judge Guzman was unimpressed, noting that in his three decades of fraud, Trudeau had taken on more than a dozen different aliases and even used his mother’s Social Security number to perpetrate a scam.      “That doesn’t happen by accident, and it doesn’t happen by good intentions,” the judge said. “It is a reflection of a person’s character.”      jmeisner@tribune.com       |||||Summary:","output":"Best-selling author Kevin Trudeau, known for his late-night TV infomercials, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for defrauding consumers with his weight-loss book, \\"The Weight Loss Cure 'They' Don't Want You to Know About.\\" A U.S. District Judge, Ronald Guzman, portrayed Trudeau as a consistent fraudster, even mentioning a case where the author used his own mother's Social Security number in a scheme. According to the judge, Trudeau's fraudulent behaviors can be traced back to his early adulthood. Trudeau showed little emotion during the sentencing. Prior to the stiff sentence being imposed, he apologized and stated that he'd become a different person while in jail. He claimed to have engaged in meditation, prayer and reading self-help books while incarcerated at Chicago's Metropolitan Correctional Center. Trudeau's contempt conviction followed his defiance of a 2004 court order prohibiting him from running false ads about his weight-loss book. Despite the order, he aired the infomercials over 32,000 times. For this reason, he was convicted by the jury. According to the prosecutors, he managed to sell over 850,000 copies of the fraudulent weight-loss book, generating a revenue of 39 million. His defense lawyers argued that the harm Trudeau had caused was minor compared to more severe fraud cases where individuals lose their life savings. They stated that Trudeau's punishment was overly harsh given the level of deceit. They additionally highlighted that his legal troubles had already cost him his businesses, home, and nearly all other possessions, leaving him with only a suitcase of personal artifacts. Nevertheless, Judge Guzman showed little sympathy, noting that Trudeau had repeatedly violated court orders since the 1990s, treating them as mere suggestions rather than mandatory instructions. Trudeau's weight-loss book advertised a rigorous 500-calorie-a-day diet alongside hormone treatments. However, his infomercials misleadingly depicted the book as a simple, hunger-free, and diet-free method for weight loss, enticing people to purchase it. As his legal issues grew over the years, Trudeau declared that the U.S. government was against him. He asserted that agencies and other vested interests conspired to suppress simple, inexpensive remedies for diseases, including cancer. However, his weight-loss book was the focal point of both his criminal conviction and a related civil case led by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In the civil case, Trudeau was instructed to pay a 37 million judgement. When Trudeau claimed he could not pay the judgement as he was insolvent, lawyers from the FTC contested, accusing him of hiding money in shell companies. They pointed out Trudeau's lavish spending habits in recent years as contradictory to his claim of being broke.  In conclusion, Kevin Trudeau's fraudulent actions and deceit, particularly related to his weight-loss book, resulted in a ten-year prison sentence, demonstrating a severe consequence for fraudulent activities and ignoring court orders."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They ate all that they could find, and then moved on. Then around 10,000 years ago, about 1% of human history, people learned to farm the land. The kind of food we eat depends on which part of the world we live in, or which part of our country we live in. For example, in the south of China they eat rice, but in the north they eat noodles. In European countries near the sea, people eat a lot of fish. In central Europe, away from the sea, people don't eat so much fish, but they eat more meat. For example, in Germany and Poland, there are hundreds of different kinds of sausages. In North America, Australia, and Europe, people eat with knives and forks. In China, people eat with chopsticks. In parts of India and the Middle East, people use their fingers to pick up food. Nowadays it is possible to transport food easily from one part of the world to another. We can eat whatever we like, at any time of the year. In Britain, bananas come from Africa; rice comes from India or the U.S.A.; strawberries come from Chile or Spain. Food is a very big business.

First question: Computer Architecture: Why is context switching expensive on intel x86 chips? Second question: Why did the x86 architecture become more popular than the MIPS architecture? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Select from:  -- no.  -- yes.","output":"First answer: Context switching is a process where a computer saves the current state of a task so it can work on another task, and then later switch back to the first task. On Intel x86 chips, context switching is expensive because there are many registers and complex structures that need to be saved. This takes time and resources, which can slow down the computer. Second answer: The x86 architecture became more popular than the MIPS architecture because: 1. x86 was used in many personal computers (like those from IBM and Microsoft) which made it widely adopted. This means many people began using x86 computers since they were more available. 2. Many software applications were written for x86, so it was easier for people to find and use programs they wanted on x86 computers. 3. x86 was backward-compatible, so newer x86 chips could run older software written for previous versions. This made upgrading to newer computers easier for people.

In 1995, material costs were 30 cents for the jewel case and 10 to 15 cents for the CD. Wholesale cost of CDs was 0.75 to 1.15, which retailed for 16.98. On average, the store received 35 percent of the retail price, the record company 27 percent, the artist 16 percent, the manufacturer 13 percent, and the distributor 9 percent. When 8-track tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs were introduced, each was marketed at a higher price than the format they succeeded, even though the cost to produce the media was reduced. This was done because the apparent value increased. This continued from vinyl to CDs but was broken when Apple marketed MP3s for 0.99, and albums for 9.99. The incremental cost, though, to produce an MP3 is very small. Q: Who received the most profit from the sale of CDs?","output":"Imagine you are buying a toy, and the toy's price is divided among different people who helped make it.

When you are learning English, listening, speaking and writing are important, but reading can also be very helpful. When you read, you can not only learn some new words, but also learn how to use these English words. When you read, it gives you a good example for writing. Good reading tips: Try to read at the right level  . Read something that you can (more or less) understand. If you need to stop every three words to use a dictionary, it is not interesting. Try to increase   the number of your new words. If there are four or five new words on a page, write them in your notebook. But you don't have to write them while you read. Instead, try to guess their meanings as you read: mark   them with a pen. Then come back when you have finished reading to look them up in a dictionary and write them in your own vocabulary   book. Then try to remember them. Try to read regularly. For example, read for a short time once a day. Fifteen minutes every day is better than two hours every Sunday. Fix   a time to read and keep to it. You could read for fifteen minutes when you go to bed, or when you get up or at lunchtime. Read what interests you. Choose a book or a magazine about a subject that you like, because you are going to spend time and money reading it. So, choose an interesting book. You can also read newspapers.

A) it's enough for you to read 21st Century Teens B) only read a magazine about a subject that you like C) you should read something that you like for a short time once a day at least D) reading English for two hours every Sunday is much better Answer:","output":"C) you should read something that you like for a short time once a day at least Reading in English can bring numerous benefits for learners, and it is crucial to maximize its advantages by following some helpful tips. Firstly, it is essential to select materials that are suitable for your reading level. If you require frequent dictionary consultations, the material might be too advanced and potentially discourage your progress. Aim for texts with four or five unknown words on a page and try to deduce their meanings from the context before consulting a dictionary. This approach will enable you to maintain a steady flow while refining your vocabulary. Maintaining consistency in your reading practice is key to achieving progress. Establishing a routine that involves reading for a short period every day (e.g., 15 minutes) is more effective than reading for longer durations sporadically (e.g., two hours every Sunday). By allotting specific time slots for your reading sessions – be it before bed, upon waking up, or during lunch – you enhance your chances of forming a beneficial habit. It is equally important to read texts that genuinely interest and engage you. Whether it's books, magazines, or even newspapers, select the materials based on your preferences, as this will motivate you to continue reading. For example, 21st Century Teens is an English newspaper readily available in China that might prove suitable for many learners with its accessible content and diverse range of topics. To sum up, reading in English can significantly improve your language skills, provided you adopt a consistent routine, select suitable materials, and engage with topics that genuinely interest you. By following these guidelines, you will not only expand your vocabulary but also enhance your overall understanding of English language usage."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He researched Mount St. Helens in the United States before and after its 1980 eruption, and was very distraught about the death of fellow volcanologist David A.

Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. New Legitimacy: Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas — corporate cash. Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage —  which became an instant success.  Question: \\"What did Hughes do as soon as he arrived in Vegas in 1966?\\" Answer: \\"He got married\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, the answer is not correct. When Howard Hughes arrived in Las Vegas in 1966, he cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. After being asked and ordered to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, he bought the property and fired the management. This incident marked the beginning of his legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer this question please: Would pack A's health warning be more or less visible than pack B's? A:","output":"Pack A's health warning would be less visible than pack B's health warning. Here's a step-by-step explanation: 1. The background information states that beginning in September 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration required larger, more prominent cigarette health warnings on all cigarette packaging and advertisements in the United States. 2. Based on this information, the health warnings on cigarette packs became more visible after September 2012. 3. Pack A is from before September 2012, when the new, more visible health warnings were not yet required. 4. Pack B is from after September 2012, when the new, more visible health warnings were required. 5. Since Pack A is from the time before the more visible health warnings were required, its health warning would be smaller and less prominent compared to Pack B. 6.

Like any ambitious person in his profession, he dreams of writing a groundbreaking story that would earn him recognition and success, but life seems to have different plans for him. One day, Michael's old college friend, Nick, pays him an unexpected visit. They both had lost touch over the years and Michael is pleasantly surprised to see him. As they catch up over drinks, Nick mentions a strange article he found in the attic of his grandmother's house. He hands Michael an old, worn out envelope containing the article. Intrigued, Michael examines the article closely and realizes it's about a high-profile unsolved murder case from the 1970s. The story was written by a renowned investigative journalist named James Harris, who suspiciously vanished a few years after this piece was published. Harris had claimed that he was on the brink of cracking the case and exposing a deep-seated conspiracy involving corrupt police officials, powerful organized crime figures, and potentially even government officials. But before he could make his findings public, he disappeared. This revelation sparks new life in Michael's journalistic ambitions. Determined to uncover the truth behind Harris' disappearance and potentially solve the high-profile murder case, he embarks on an investigation with Nick's help. Together, they follow a trail of clues left by the long-dead journalist, leading them further down a dark and twisted path filled with danger and deceit. As they dig deeper, the duo starts uncovering a web of complex alliances and powerful people who will do anything to keep their secrets buried.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First, let's address both questions independently, then we can discuss if they are asking the same thing or not. First question: How many Facebook victims were there in 2010? The term \\"Facebook victims\\" can be interpreted in different ways. If you mean the number of people who fell victim to scams, hacks, or data breaches involving Facebook in 2010, it's challenging to provide an exact number, as many incidents may have gone unreported or undetected. Nevertheless, I can provide some notable incidents that occurred in 2010: 1. In October 2010, there was a major privacy breach involving third-party applications on Facebook. At the time, the 10 most popular Facebook apps, including FarmVille, Texas HoldEm Poker, and FrontierVille, were found to be leaking the user IDs of app users to advertisers and third parties. It is estimated that tens of millions of Facebook users were affected by this breach. 2. Throughout 2010, numerous Facebook scams and attacks were reported, a trend that continues today. Some of these scams included phishing attacks, bogus friend requests, the \\"dislike button\\" scam, and many more. The exact number of victims of these various scams is unknown, but it's safe to say that thousands, if not millions, of users were harmed or inconvenienced. Second question: How many Facebook victims were there in 2005? Facebook was in its infancy in 2005, having been launched only the previous year. As a result, there were significantly fewer users compared to 2010, translating to fewer potential victims. The majority of users at this time were students and members of specific universities and schools. It's worth noting that in 2005, Facebook was not as ubiquitous as it became later on, and many of the privacy issues, scams, and attacks associated with the platform had not yet emerged. Now, to address the final query: Are these two questions asking the same thing? No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. While both questions inquire about the number of Facebook victims in a given year, they refer to two distinct years, 2010 and 2005. The number of Facebook victims is likely to differ between those years due to the platform's growth, the evolution of the digital landscape, and changes in privacy and security measures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Bavaria, officially the Free State of Bavaria is a landlocked federal state of Germany, occupying its southeastern corner. With an area of 70,550.19 square kilometres (27,200 sq mi), Bavaria is the largest German state by land area. Its territory comprises roughly a fifth of the total land area of Germany. With 12.9 million inhabitants, it is Germany's second-most-populous state (after North Rhine-Westphalia). Bavaria's capital and largest city, Munich, is the third largest city in Germany.  The history of Bavaria stretches from its earliest settlement and formation as a duchy in the 6th century CE (AD) through the Holy Roman Empire to becoming an independent kingdom and finally a state of the Federal Republic of Germany.  The Duchy of Bavaria dates back to the year 555. In the 17th century CE (AD), the Duke of Bavaria became a Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire. The Kingdom of Bavaria existed from 1806 to 1918, when Bavaria became a republic. In 1946, the Free State of Bavaria re-organised itself on democratic lines after the Second World War.  Bavaria has a unique culture, largely because of the state's Catholic majority (52%) and conservative traditions. Bavarians have traditionally been proud of their culture, which includes festivals such as Oktoberfest and elements of Alpine symbolism. The state also has the second largest economy among the German states by GDP figures, giving it a status as a rather wealthy German region. 1. Which festival does Bavaria celebrate? 2.

That night I wrote a short sad poem about broken dreams and mailed it to the Capri's Weekly newspaper. To my astonishment, they published it and sent me two dollars. I was a published and paid writer. I showed it to my teacher and fellow students. They laughed. \\"Just plain dumb luck,\\" the teacher said. I tasted success. I'd sold the first thing I'd ever written. That was more than any of them had done and if it was just dumb luck, that was fine with me. During the next two years I sold dozens of poems, letters, jokes and recipes. By the time I graduated from high school, with a C minus average, I had scrapbooks filled with my published work. I never mentioned my writing to my teachers, friends or my family again. They were dream killers and if people must choose between their friends and their dreams, they must always choose their dreams. I had four children at the time, and the oldest was only four. While the children slept, I typed on my ancient typewriter. I wrote what I felt. It took nine months, just like a baby. A month later Crying Wind, the title of my book, became a best seller, was translated into fifteen languages and Braille and sold worldwide. I appeared on TV talk shows.

Once aboard he seeks out his runaway wife, Julia (Barbara Stanwyck). He discovers she is trying to take their two unsuspecting children, 18-year-old Annette (Audrey Dalton) and ten-year-old Norman (Harper Carter), to her hometown of Mackinac, Michigan, to raise as down-to-earth Americans rather than rootless elitists like Richard himself. As the ship prepares for departure, her captain, E. J. Smith (Brian Aherne), receives a hint from the shipping company representative that a record-setting speedy passage would be welcomed. Other passengers include a wealthy woman of a working-class origin (based on a real-life Titanic survivor Molly Brown), Maude Young (Thelma Ritter); social-climbing Earl Meeker (Allyn Joslyn); a 20-year-old Purdue University tennis player, Gifford \\"Giff\\" Rogers (Robert Wagner); and George S.

It was a made-for-TV moment that all presidents would relish, but it seemed especially significant for the man who turned a reality TV career into a successful bid for the presidency. Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. “It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival “probably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o’clock in the morning.” It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim. Trump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally. Those numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president’s poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy.

Step 1: Analyze the question and the given choices In this question, we are asked to identify the component through which the blood is transported in most animals via the circulatory system.

It plays no role in blood circulation. - Stratum corneum: Stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the skin, and it is not related to blood circulation. - Nerves: Nerves are part of the nervous system that transmits signals from the brain to the rest of the body, but they are not the main component for blood transportation. Step 3: Identify the correct choice - Body: Blood is transported by the circulatory system throughout an animal's body to supply oxygen and nutrients to the cells, and remove waste products from them.

Please answer the following question: Dogs are social animals and without proper training, they will behave like wild animals. They will soil your house, destroy your belongings, bark excessively, fight other dogs and even bite you. Nearly all behavior problems are perfectly normal dog activities that occur at the wrong time or place or are directed at the wrong thing. The key to preventing or treating behavior problems is learning to teach the dog to redirect its normal behavior to an outlet that is acceptable in the domestic   setting. One of the best things you can do for your dog and yourself is to train its obedience. Obedience training doesn't solve all behavior problems, but it is the foundation for solving just about any problem. Training pens up a line of communication between you and your dog. Effective communication is necessary to instruct your dog about what you want it to do. Training is also an easy way to establish the social rank order. When your dog obeys a simple request of \\"come here, sit,\\" it is showing obedience and respect for you. It is not necessary to establish yourself as top dog or leader of the pack   by using extreme measure. You can teach your dog its subordinate   role by teaching it to show submission to you. Most dogs love performing tricks for you to pleasantly accept that you are in charge. Training should be fun and rewarding for you and your dog. It can enrich your relationship and make living together more enjoyable. A well-trained dog is more confident and can more safely be allowed a greater amount of freedom than an untrained animal.

Question: What is the full name of the person that had a reclusive life style?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Charles-Valentin Alkan (French: [ʃaʁl valɑ̃tɛ̃ alkɑ̃]; 30 November 1813 – 29 March 1888) was a French-Jewish composer and virtuoso pianist. At the height of his fame in the 1830s and 1840s he was, alongside his friends and colleagues Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt, among the leading pianists in Paris, a city in which he spent virtually his entire life. Alkan earned many awards at the Conservatoire de Paris, which he entered before he was six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his occasional long withdrawals from public performance, for personal reasons. Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including Eugène Delacroix and George Sand, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions – virtually all of which are for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large-scale studies in all the major keys (Op. 35) and all the minor keys (Op. 39). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 4–7) and Concerto for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 8–10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians. Alkan's attachment to his Jewish origins is displayed both in his life and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, like many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son Élie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works. Following his death (which according to persistent but unfounded legend was caused by a falling bookcase) Alkan's music became neglected,...

Answer the following question: You are presented with the question \\"what does a solar panel convert sunlight into?\\" and the following answer choices:  - adding heat  - heat energy  - deoxyribonucleic acid  - electromagnetic energy  - rays or beams  - activation energy  - Solar energy  - electrons in motion  Now knowing that asolar panel converts sunlight into electricity and electricity is electrons in motion, choose the best answer. Answer:","output":"A solar panel works through the process referred to as the Photovoltaic Effect. This phenomenon involves the conversion of sunlight (which is essentially a form of electromagnetic energy) into electricity. In a solar panel, sunlight is absorbed by photovoltaic cells, which are generally made up of semi-conductive material, usually silicon. The absorbed sunlight provides energy that excites the electrons in the silicon. When these electrons are excited, they move from a state of low energy to a higher energy state, thereby creating an electric current. This electric current is direct current (DC) electricity. The DC electricity is then usually converted into alternating current (AC) electricity (the type of electricity used in most homes) by an inverter, to be used for typical household appliances and systems. Therefore, and considering the provided answer choices, the most accurate is \\"electrons in motion\\". None of the other choices entirely capture the concept of what a solar panel does. While some might somewhat describe part of the process or result in broader or somewhat related terms, they do not accurately describe the conversion process that occurs in a solar panel. For instance, while sunlight is a form of \\"electromagnetic energy\\", a solar panel doesn’t convert sunlight into electromagnetic energy; instead, it uses the electromagnetic energy from the sunlight. Similarly, while \\"heat energy\\" could, in a way, describe a form of energy gained from sunlight, solar panels specifically aim to convert sunlight into electrical energy, not general heat energy. Also, \\"solar energy\\" is too broad a term for the specific result of a solar panel's operation, which is the generation of electricity. Moreover, the answers \\"adding heat\\", \\"rays or beams\\", \\"activation energy\\", and \\"deoxyribonucleic acid\\" are inaccurate and practically irrelevant, as they do not involve the photovoltaic process by any means. In conclusion, the best answer from the provided choices that aligns with the fact that a solar panel converts sunlight into electricity is \\"electrons in motion\\"."},{"instruction":"Noeggerathiales -  Noeggerathiales is a now-extinct order of vascular plants.

Article: Detective Chief Inspector Jes Fry said they were examining cold case files nationally to try and identify her.      Mr Fry said: \\"We are at the very early stages of the investigation and it could be a complex inquiry.      \\"The body had been there for some time. The circumstances suggest this is a murder case and we are looking at missing persons reports and cold cases both locally and nationwide.\\"      Residents expressed their shock at the discovery of human remains in woodland on the Queen’s country retreat in Norfolk.      A major police inquiry was launched after a dog walker discovered the woman's remains on New Year’s Day just a mile from the Royal Stud and less than two miles from the estate’s main residence.      Officers are carrying out a “detailed search” throughout the area of woodland in Anger, near King’s Lynn, which is east of Sandringham House, where members of the Royal Family had gathered.      The operation was kept secret for more than 24 hours as detectives worked to establish how the body was so close to the Royal residence. A large area of the woodland had been cordoned off.      The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who are currently staying on the 20,000-acre (8,000-hectare) estate for their Christmas break, were informed of the discovery on Monday night.      The body was discovered shortly after the Royals attended a church service on Sunday.      A post mortem is due to take place later.      It remains unclear how long the woman's body has been there. The dog walker has also not been named.      Residents told The Daily Telegraph that the large police operation had been shrouded in secrecy.      One resident, who did not want to be named, said: “There is a heavy police presence even 24 hours after the discovery.      \\"You couldn't get very close to the site. Police said they expected to be there on tomorrow (Tuesday).      \\"It is just a stone's throw from the Stud and the Royals' house. It is very close.\\"      Another resident, who also did not want to be named, said locals were shocked at the discovery.      \\"I spoke to several of my friends who work on the estate and they were at work on Monday and didn't hear anything about it,\\" he said.      \\"No one knows anything about it. It has been quite a secret operation.      \\"The area is only used by people who work nearby, dog walkers and local residents.\\"      He added: \\"It is quite a bit of a shock, given the proximity to the grounds itself. The area is really not that far from Sandringham House.      \\"We are all a bit stunned to be honest. It is just a really quiet area.\\"      Mike Berman, the Chairman of Norfolk Ramblers, added: \\"I believe Anmer did once have a burial site which is no longer used so perhaps that may shed some light on the discovery.\\"      A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman declined to comment, referring inquiries to police.      The details emerged just days after the Duke, 90, left Papworth Hospital, Cambridgeshire, where he was treated for a blocked artery after suffering chest pains.      The Duke’s heart scare forced him to miss the annual celebrations, including the annual Boxing Day shoot.      He was airlifted to hospital from Sandringham on December 23 and kept under observation for four nights after undergoing the “minimally invasive procedure” of coronary stenting, which was declared a success.      The Queen, who makes it her official base until February, was seen riding on the estate on Monday morning.      The 85-year-old year-old wore only a headscarf and the hood of her long blue waxed jacket for protection as she rode a chestnut coloured horse.      She emerged in the winter sunshine a few minutes later on horseback, accompanied by a smartly-dressed male groom on a white horse who was wearing a proper black riding hat in case he fell off.      Sandringham has served as a private residence for Royal Family since 1862. King George V, the queen's grandfather, once called \\"dear old Sandringham ... (the) place I love better than anywhere in the world\\".      Around half of the estate is let to farm tenants, with much of the remainder used for forestry.      In October The Daily Telegraph disclosed that the remains of an American man had been lying near Buckingham Palace for years.      Robert James Moore sent hundreds of letters to the Queen and was driven by his obsession to set up home within sight of Buckingham Palace, on an island in St James’s Park.      But somehow his camp that he set up by went unnoticed until a tree surgeon uncovered the remains of his body in October, as many as three years after his death. ||||| British police are treating the discovery of a body on the queen's Sandringham estate as murder.      A woman's body was found on the vast estate in eastern England on New Year's Day, and Detective Chief Inspector Jes Fry said authorities are examining missing person reports and unsolved cases around the country to see if there are any links.      \\"We are at the very early stages of the investigation and it could be a complex inquiry,\\" Fry said Tuesday. \\"The body had been there for some time.\\"      Authorities were doing a post-mortem Tuesday on the body.      A member of the public found the body in a woodland at Anmer, a tiny village 115 miles (185 kilometers) northeast of London. The village is part of the Sandringham estate where the royal family spends some of its holidays.      The hamlet of Anmer is home to several dozen people and sits around three miles (4.8 kilometers) from Sandringham House, which has served as a private residence for British monarchs since 1862. Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip spent part of the holiday season there and were at Sandringham House on New Year's Day.      Sandringham Estate's website says the entire estate is spread over 8,000 hectares (19,768 acres) in Norfolk. Sandringham House and its gardens make up 24 hectares (59 acres), and there are 240 hectares (590 acres) of woods and open countryside in a section that is open to the public free of charge all year.      There are also two stud farms and a fruit farm. The estate employs over 100 full-time staff.      Buckingham Palace referred all questions about the body's discovery back to police. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A woman's body was found on the Queen's Sandringham estate in Norfolk, eastern England, on New Year's Day, launching a major police investigation that is being treated as a murder case.

The Royal College of Music commissioned an official portrait of the composer from Sir Gerald Kelly (1952) which hangs in the college. The Manchester Art Gallery has a bronze sculpture of Vaughan Williams by Epstein (1952) and the National Portrait Gallery (NPG) has drawings by Joyce Finzi (1947) and Juliet Pannett (1957 and 1958); versions of a bronze head of the composer by David McFall (1956) are in the NPG and at the entrance to the Music reading room of the British Library. There is a statue of Vaughan Williams in Dorking, and a bust in Chelsea Embankment Gardens, near his old house in Cheyne Walk.In 1994 a group of enthusiasts founded the Ralph Vaughan Williams Society, with the composer's widow as its president and Roy Douglas and Michael Kennedy as vice presidents. The society, a registered charity, has sponsored and encouraged performances of the composer's works including complete symphony cycles and a Vaughan Williams opera festival. The society has promoted premieres of neglected works, and has its own record label, Albion Records.Composers of the generation after Vaughan Williams reacted against his style, which became unfashionable in influential musical circles in the 1960s; diatonic and melodic music such as his was neglected in favour of atonal and other modernist compositions. In the 21st century this neglect has been reversed. In the fiftieth anniversary year of his death two contrasting documentary films were released: Tony Palmer's O Thou Transcendent: The Life of Vaughan Williams and John Bridcut's The Passions of Vaughan Williams. British audiences were prompted to reappraise the composer. The popularity of his most accessible works, particularly the Tallis Fantasia and The Lark Ascending increased, but a wide public also became aware of what a reviewer of Bridcut's film called \\"a genius driven by emotion\\".

Firstly, the reviewer mentions that the study questions provided are more like quiz questions, which only ensure that the reader has read the book. This indicates that the questions do not encourage thought-provoking conversations or lead to deeper, more meaningful discussions among the group members, which is often a crucial aspect for successful group studies. Secondly, the reviewer points out that they had to write their own questions to foster better-quality discussions within the group, and the study guide only helped with this task to a limited extent. This could signal a potential inconvenience for those who are looking for a comprehensive and well-structured guide to facilitate group studies without having to invest significant time or effort into creating their own materials.

However, they also note that this useful feature is not consistently present throughout the guide. In conclusion, this particular review would likely decrease the chances of purchasing the product if the main intention is for group study sessions and engaging in deeper discussions. The review highlights the limited scope and inadequate support of the study guide in facilitating meaningful conversations, while only acknowledging some minor positive aspects. It is important to consider other reviews and factors before making a decision, as well.

Apart from \\"Fatal Attraction\\" and \\"Indecent Proposal,\\" Lyne has also directed other successful films like \\"Flashdance\\" and \\"Unfaithful.\\" In this proposed biopic about Johnny Stompanato, the choice of Adrian Lyne as a potential director would appear fitting, given his penchant for exploring the dark and complicated nature of human connections. Johnny Stompanato was an enigmatic and controversial figure from the 1950s, often associated with organized crime and romantic relationships with high-profile actresses, including Lana Turner. His life was cut short in 1958, when Turner's teenage daughter, Cheryl Crane, stabbed him in what was later ruled a justifiable homicide due to self-defense. The Stompanato story offers a compelling, dramatic, and intriguing tale that would likely benefit from Adrian Lyne's deft directorial touch. As mentioned earlier, Lyne has a history of helming films that dive into the complexities of human affairs, making him a seemingly strong candidate to direct a biopic about such a controversial and captivating figure like Johnny Stompanato. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Adrian Lyne is the director of 'Indecent Proposal'\\" logically follows the given text and accurately reflects the provided information. Additionally, the potential involvement of Adrian Lyne in the Johnny Stompanato biopic may prove to be a strong match, considering the nature of the story and Lyne's established directorial background."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She sweetens the deal with a 25,000 bonus for solving the case. Of course this comes contingent that The Globe gets the exclusive story. Gentry takes the case and begins the investigation of the murder with Weston in tow. When at the club, Gentry encounters a waitress, Marlene (Hedda Lubin), whose obnoxiousness rivals his. He gets through her to speak to another stripper and gets his first suspect, Joseph Carter. Soon, another stripper, Candy Cane, gets murdered and Gentry expands his suspect list to Grout (Ray Sager), an unstable veteran who takes pride in crushing the heads of corpses he found when on the battlefields of Vietnam. He relieves tension by drawing faces on squashes and tomatoes and then crushing them with his bare hands. Gentry also suspects the leader of a radical feminist group that riots in the strip club, carrying banners with catchy phrases like \\"Lewd is Crude\\", \\"Quit with Tit\\" and \\"Women Right On!\\". Pickles, another stripper, is murdered and has her buttocks mutilated with a meat tenderizer hammer before having it salt and peppered. A badge with \\"Women Right On!\\" is found at the scene.

Gentry ignores this and concentrates on the case. His investigation takes him to the owner of the strip clubs in town, Mr. Marzdone Mobilie (Henny Youngman). Gentry then coerces Mobilie into holding an amateur stripper contest with a 1,000 prize, which also works as the beginning of a plan for Gentry's trap.

Write an article based on this \\"A man who was jailed for 12 years over an international drug trafficking operation is to have more cash seized under proceeds of crime laws.\\" Article:","output":"Title: International Drug Trafficker Faces Additional Financial Consequences Under Proceeds of Crime Laws Introduction: The ramifications of an international drug trafficking operation continue to unfold for a man who was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Authorities have recently announced their intentions to seize more of his assets under proceeds of crime laws, leaving no doubt that justice will be served to its fullest extent. Background of the Case: The male perpetrator, whose name has been withheld for legal reasons, was arrested and subsequently jailed for his notorious involvement in an extensive international drug trafficking operation. After thorough investigation by law enforcement agencies, it was discovered that his criminal activities spanned across multiple countries, which ultimately led to his arrest and a 12-year jail sentence. The Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA): The Proceeds of Crime Act, enacted in various jurisdictions, targets the profits earned through criminal activity. The legislation offers law enforcement agencies the power to confiscate and recover assets, making it highly effective in targeting individuals like the aforementioned convict. By dismantling the financial support structure behind criminal activities, POCA serves as a vital tool in the fight against organized crime. Recent Developments: In light of the convict's prominent role in the international drug trafficking operation and his now known vast financial resources, the authorities have opted to take further action under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Although specific details of the assets to be seized remain undisclosed, it is expected to include properties, vehicles, and cash holdings. This additional seizure will not affect his existing 12-year prison sentence but will ensure that he faces the full consequences of his unlawful actions. Impact on the Convict: The enforcement of proceeds of crime laws and the additional seizure of assets will have a significant impact on the convict's life. Apart from the already imposed sentence, the seizure of his wealth will limit his financial freedom and reduce the likelihood of re-establishing his drug trafficking operations upon his release from prison, demonstrating the efficacy of combining prison sentences with asset recovery measures. Wider Implications: This case highlights the potency of proceeds of crime laws when implemented correctly. By targeting the financial backbone of organized crime, governments can effectively dismantle operations such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, and weapons smuggling. This approach cuts off resources that would otherwise enable criminal enterprises to continue thriving and ultimately pave a way for a safer society. Conclusion: The confiscation of additional assets under proceeds of crime laws emphasizes the seriousness with which authorities will deal with criminals involved in international drug trafficking operations. Seizing assets in conjunction with imposing lengthy prison sentences sends a strong message to would-be criminals hoping to amass wealth through illegal means. Furthermore, it illustrates the importance of coordination between law enforcement agencies and international bodies to combat organized crime effectively. The decisive action taken against this international drug trafficker underscores the need for urgent and cooperative action in dismantling the financial infrastructure of criminal networks. With continued efforts in this regard, society will be better positioned to combat the scourge of organized crime and make the world a safer place for all."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"The supposed perturbation in this scenario would be indirectly impacting a step of the process. Here's a detailed explanation: First, let's break down the original process: 1. Bees go out during the day and gather food. 2. While gathering food, they make wax, which is the building block of their bee hive. 3. Bees make food called honey. 4. They use a sticky, glue-like substance called propolis as a binding to hold their hives together. 5. Bees produce all of the building blocks to build their hive in their own body. Now, let's consider the hypothetical scenario in which more bees produce propolis. The question asks how this change will affect a smaller hive. We can analyze this by examining the impact of this change on each step of the process. 1. Bees go out during the day and gather food: The scenario does not mention any change to the food-gathering process, so this step is not impacted directly. 2. While gathering food, they make wax, which is the building block of their bee hive: The change in propolis production does not affect the bees' ability to make wax, so this step is not impacted directly either. 3. Bees make food called honey: The production of honey is independent of propolis production, so this step is not directly impacted. 4. They use a sticky, glue-like substance called propolis as a binding to hold their hives together: Here, the change will indirectly impact this step, as having more propolis available could potentially improve the strength and durability of the hive. In the case of a smaller hive, this might mean a more secure and well-constructed hive overall. 5. Bees produce all of the building blocks to build their hive in their own body: This step is indirectly impacted because we are assuming that more bees produce propolis, thereby increasing the availability of this building material for hive construction. In summary, the supposed perturbation of having more bees produce propolis is indirectly impacting a step of the process, as it does not directly change any specific step, but instead alters the amount of propolis available for constructing and maintaining hives. This indirect impact could potentially result in a stronger, more durable, and better-built smaller hive."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A man jumps onto the hood of a car that begins to follow the Jeep, and the car drives out of the frame.      Police said in a Facebook post the man was the girl’s father, and he was attempting to stop the theft.      The video then shows the girl getting up and the man walking back into the frame, and the two hug. Police said neither the girl nor her father was hurt.      Beacon-News attempts to reach the father Tuesday were unsuccessful.      Tyrelle L. Pulley, 20, of Chicago, has been charged with aggravated vehicle hijacking, aggravated unlawful possession of a stolen motor vehicle and fleeing and eluding police, according to Aurora police. They are searching for an accomplice, and asked anyone with information to call the Aurora police investigators or Aurora Area Crime Stoppers.      Police have said Pulley got out of a blue Dodge Charger that had pulled up next to the Jeep, and both vehicles drove off.

Question: What does Marty vomit? Movie title: Blood Simple Movie plot: The film opens with a short voice-over monologue voiced by M. Emmet Walsh as various images of the Texas landscape are shown. The film then shifts to a conversation between Abby (Frances McDormand) and Ray (John Getz) in a car as it drives through a heavy downpour at night. They seem to be discussing Abby's bad marriage and Ray indicates that he's driving her to Houston. But instead of driving Abby to Houston, Ray drives to a motel and they have sex. We later find out that Julian Marty (Dan Hedaya), who owns a Texas bar, has suspected Abby's affair with Ray, one of his bartenders, so he hires private detective Loren Visser (M. Emmet Walsh) to take photos of them. When Visser reports back to Marty, he teases him about being cuckolded. The morning after their tryst, Marty makes a silent phone call to Ray and Abby. The following day Ray goes to the bar to collect his earnings, two weeks worth of work, but instead confronts Marty and quits his job. Marty threatens Ray's life and advises him not to trust Abby, that she will one day tell him she \\"hasn't done anything funny\\" and he won't believe her. Marty then hires Visser to kill the couple. Visser suggests he take a fishing trip to Corpus Christi to establish an alibi. He then breaks into Ray's home, steals Abby's gun, and photographs the sleeping couple through the bedroom window. Visser presents an edited photo of their fake corpses to Marty, who dumps four dead fish on his desk. Marty goes to the bathroom to vomit, then opens the safe to give Visser his 10,000 fee. Visser then shoots Marty with Abby's gun in a double cross, leaving her gun at the scene as evidence that she killed Marty. But he accidentally leaves his cigarette lighter and does not realize that Marty has stolen one of the incriminating photographs and locked it in the safe. Ray returns to the bar to get his last paycheck and accidentally kicks Abby's gun, firing it. He finds a motionless Marty and decides to cover up the murder. He cleans up the blood and disposes of evidence in a backyard...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget.  It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. Question: What does the narrator probably think of dried foods? Answer:","output":"The text does not provide explicit information on what the narrator thinks about dried foods. However, based on the narrator's emphasis on fresh ingredients, it would seem the narrator would likely not promote dried foods as a first choice. Dried foods might be considered more processed than fresh or frozen ones, thus not strictly adhering to the principles of clean eating as described in the context. However, since the narrator acknowledges the potential for budget constraints and the need to be practical, it is possible they might see dried foods as an acceptable option in certain circumstances, especially if the drying process is natural and doesn't involve the addition of sugars or preservatives. These are conjectures since the narrator's exact stance on dried foods is not specified in the context. The safest assertion we can make is that the narrator highly values fresh and least processed foods for a clean eating lifestyle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: Bob was a homeless boy who lived in a house for homeless children. He always felt lonely and sad. He felt he was a nobody in this world. One day, he said to Mr. White, head of the house, \\"Why did my parents bring me to this world? What value do I have now?\\" Mr. White gave Bob a stone and said to him, \\"Take it to the market, but don't sell it no matter how much money they pay you. Bob took the stone to a market called Green Market. A man wanted to buy it for 100 pounds, and Bob wouldn't sell it. Later, another buyer would pay more for the stone, but Bob still wouldn't sell it. The next day in Center Market, the people would buy it at a much higher price. But Bob wouldn't sell it. The third day, Bob took the stone to Street Market. This time, the people there offered a price which was ten times higher than that in Green Market. But Bob wouldn't sell it. Bob couldn't understand. He asked Mr. White, \\" Why did they pay me so much money for just a stone?\\" \\" Even for a stone, if you think it valuable, it will be valuable, \\" said Mr. White. ,. Question: For what reason didn't Mr. White want Bob to sell the stone? Options: A: Bob wanted a higher price. B: The stone is very expensive. C: Mr. White wanted to teach Bob a lesson. D: Mr. White wanted to play a joke on Bob. Answer:","output":"C: Mr. White wanted to teach Bob a lesson. In the referenced article, we read about Bob, a homeless boy living in a home for destitute children, feeling useless and questioning his worth. Mr. White, the head of the house, gives Bob a seemingly ordinary stone and advises him to not sell it, regardless of the amount offered. Bob follows this instruction; he takes the stone to various markets, and while numerous interested parties willingly up their offers, Bob refuses to sell.  The actions of Mr. White implies he used this scenario as a lesson for Bob, rather than for regards to the stone's potential economic value (which we don't have any indication about within the article) or trying to incite Bob to get a higher offer. He did not give the stone to Bob to make a profit, nor was there any indication that this was a joke.  Upon being shown different high-priced offers, Bob is left bewildered about the stone's escalating value. When he returns to Mr. White, the latter uses this as an opportunity to impart a wisdom, saying, \\"Even for a stone, if you think it valuable, it will be valuable.\\" The intention behind the exercise was to make Bob understand the concept of self-worth – that value isn't attached to one's status, property, or what others think, but is instead a product of one’s personal belief.  Regardless of Bob’s circumstances or others’ opinions of him, if he perceives himself as valuable, then he is. This unambiguous observation directs us to conclude that the correct answer is 'C: Mr. White wanted to teach Bob a lesson.'"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the specific name of the heavenly figures whose heads are highly circular and who wear round haloes?  Perhaps influenced by van Eyck's Madonna in the Church, Lochner closely detailed the fall and gradient of light. According to the art historian Brigitte Corley, the clothes of \\"protagonists change their hues in delicate reaction to the influx of light, reds being transformed through a symphony of pink tonalities to a dusty greyish white, greens to a warm pale yellow, and lemon shading through oranges to a saturated red\\". Lochner employed the notion of supernatural illumination not just from van Eyck, but also from von Soest's Crucifixion, where light emanating from Christ dissolves around John's red robe, as yellows rays eventually become white. There is a real possibility that a number of the faces of saints are modelled on historical persons, i.e. as donor portraits of the commissioners and their wives. Figures fitting this theory include St Ursula and St Gereon panels from the City Saints altarpiece.Unlike the painters in the Low Countries, Lochner was not so concerned with delineating perspective; his pictures are often set in shallow space, while his backgrounds give little indication of distance and often dissolve into solid gold. Thus, and given his harmonious colour schemes, Lochner is usually described as one of the last exponents of the International Gothic. This is not to say his paintings lack contemporary northern sophistication; his arrangements are often innovative. The worlds he paints are hushed, according to Snyder, achieved with the symmetry of subdued use of colour and the often repeated stylistic element of circles. Angels form circles around the heavenly figures; the heavenly figures' heads are highly circular and they wear round haloes. According to Snyder, the viewer is slowly \\"drawn into empathy with the revolving forms\\".Because of the paucity of surviving attributed works, it is difficult to detect any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of...

This name change took place in 1996 when the Indian government decided to officially rename the city. Chennai is the capital of the Tamil Nadu state in southern India and one of the four major metropolitan cities in the country, along with Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata. The name change was part of a broader effort across India to replace Anglicized colonial names with their indigenous or historical names. The name \\"Madras\\" is believed to have been derived from the term \\"Madrasapattinam,\\" which was a fishing village near the city's location during the British colonial era. However, after India's independence, there were discussions and efforts to revert the city's name to its original, more culturally-rooted name, Chennai. Chennai has a rich history that spans several centuries, with its existence dating back to the 1st century CE. Initially, the area was inhabited by the Pallavas, a South Indian dynasty, followed by the Chola Dynasty in the 9th century. The region also faced colonization by the Portuguese, Dutch, and, eventually, the British. The city is known for its diverse and vibrant culture, with a foundation in South Indian customs and traditions. It is home to many classical Indian dance and music performances, particularly in Carnatic music. Its history and tradition make it a hub for promoting Tamil literature, and Chennai is occasionally referred to as the \\"Cultural Capital of South India.\\" Economically, Chennai has evolved into a significant industrial and technology center, boasting the nickname \\"The Detroit of India\\" due to its thriving automobile industry. Additionally, Chennai is home to a robust information technology (IT) sector, with numerous IT parks and export centers. The city also has a well-developed transport infrastructure, supporting an extensive road network, an international airport, a sea port, and the Chennai MRTS (Metropolitan Rapid Transit System). These facilities foster the growth of trade and commerce, enhancing the city's overall development. In summary, the city of Madras is now known as Chennai, a vibrant and culturally rich metropolis with a distinguished history and a thriving economic landscape. The name change reflects the city's efforts to preserve its cultural identity and move towards a post-colonial future."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Cohan, was an American entertainer, playwright, composer, lyricist, actor, singer, dancer and producer. Cohan began his career as a child, performing with his parents and sister in a vaudeville act known as \\"The Four Cohans.\\" Beginning with Little Johnny Jones in 1904, he wrote, composed, produced, and appeared in more than three dozen Broadway musicals. Cohan published more than 300 songs during his lifetime, including the standards \\"Over There\\", \\"Give My Regards to Broadway\\", \\"The Yankee Doodle Boy\\" and \\"You're a Grand Old Flag\\". Cohan was born in 1878 in Providence, Rhode Island, to Irish Catholic parents. A baptismal certificate from St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church (which gave the wrong first name for his mother) indicated that he was born on July 3, but Cohan and his family always insisted that George had been \\"born on the Fourth of July!\\" George's parents were traveling vaudeville performers, and he joined them on stage while still an infant, first as a prop, learning to dance and sing soon after he could walk and talk.  Cohan started as a child performer at age 8, first on the violin and then as a dancer. He was the fourth member of the family vaudeville act called The Four Cohans, which included his father Jeremiah \\"Jere\\" (Keohane) Cohan (1848-1917), mother Helen \\"Nellie\\" Costigan Cohan (1854-1928) and sister Josephine \\"Josie\\" Cohan Niblo (1876-1916). In 1890, he toured as the star of a show called Peck's Bad Boy and then joined the family act; The Four Cohans mostly toured together from 1890 to 1901. He and his sister made their Broadway debut in 1893 in a sketch called The Lively Bootblack. Temperamental in his early years, Cohan later learned to control his frustrations. During these years, Cohan originated his famous curtain speech: \\"My mother thanks you, my father thanks you, my sister thanks you, and I thank you.\\"  As a child, Cohan and his family toured most of the year and spent summer vacations from the vaudeville circuit at his grandmother's home in North Brookfield, Massachusetts, where Cohan befriended baseball player Connie Mack. The family generally gave a performance at the town hall there each summer, and Cohan had a chance to gain some more normal childhood experiences, like riding his bike and playing sandlot baseball. Cohan's memories of those happy summers inspired his 1907 musical 50 Miles from Boston, which is set in North Brookfield and contains one of his most famous songs, \\"Harrigan\\". As Cohan matured through his teens, he used the quiet summers there to write. When he returned to the town in the cast of Ah, Wilderness! in 1934, he told a reporter, \\"I've knocked around everywhere, but there's no place like North Brookfield.\\"Answer this question using a quote from the following article: where was he born","output":"George M.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What were the names of the pupils who revered Saint-Saëns as a genius?, using the article: Charles-Camille Saint-Saëns (French: [ʃaʁlkamij sɛ̃sɑ̃s]; 9 October 1835 – 16 December 1921) was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the Romantic era. His best-known works include Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso (1863), the Second Piano Concerto (1868), the First Cello Concerto (1872), Danse macabre (1874), the opera Samson and Delilah (1877), the Third Violin Concerto (1880), the Third (\\"Organ\\") Symphony (1886) and The Carnival of the Animals (1886). Saint-Saëns was a musical prodigy; he made his concert debut at the age of ten. After studying at the Paris Conservatoire he followed a conventional career as a church organist, first at Saint-Merri, Paris and, from 1858, La Madeleine, the official church of the French Empire. After leaving the post twenty years later, he was a successful freelance pianist and composer, in demand in Europe and the Americas. As a young man, Saint-Saëns was enthusiastic for the most modern music of the day, particularly that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner, although his own compositions were generally within a conventional classical tradition. He was a scholar of musical history, and remained committed to the structures worked out by earlier French composers. This brought him into conflict in his later years with composers of the impressionist and dodecaphonic schools of music; although there were neoclassical elements in his music, foreshadowing works by Stravinsky and Les Six, he was often regarded as a reactionary in the decades around the time of his death. Saint-Saëns held only one teaching post, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and remained there for less than five years. It was nevertheless important in the development of French music: his students included Gabriel Fauré, among whose own later pupils was Maurice Ravel. Both of them were strongly influenced by Saint-Saëns, whom they revered as a genius., what would be the answer ?

It's unrealistic to think a parent wouldn't reward their children with material things sometimes, says Robin Lanzi, a clinical psychologist and mother of four who's the research director at the Center on Health and Education at Georgetown University. \\"But you want to make sure that they match the behavior, so it's not something huge for something small,\\" Lanzi says. She recalls hearing about a father who offered his child a Nintendo Wii game system for scoring a couple goals in a soccer game. Elizabeth Powell, a mother of two young daughters in Austin, Texas, knows what she means. \\"You want to raise them in a way that they're respectful and appreciate things,\\" Powell says of her children. \\"But sometimes, you wonder now if kids appreciate even a new pair of shoes. \\" Question: Parenting experts are worried that   _   .

A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy. Come to find out the child had his picture made with that very Santa a few days prior. Very ironic. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When was the curtain that exposed Santa's body opened? Options:  A. not enough information  B. While the boy and his mother were passing by.  C. Before Santa's suit was cut into shreds.  D.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Every profession or trade, every art, and every science has its technical vocabulary, the function of which is partly to refer to things or processes which have no names in ordinary English, and partly to secure greater exactness in expression. Such special dialects, or jargon, are necessary in technical discussion of any kind. Being universally understood by the devotees of the particular science or art, they have the precision of a mathematical formula . Besides, they save time, for it is much more economical to name a process than to describe it. Thousands of these technical terms are very properly included in every large dictionary, yet, as a whole,  _  Different professions, however, differ widely in the character of their special vocabularies. In trades and handicrafts and other professions, such as farming and fishing, that have occupied great numbers of men from remote times, the technical vocabulary is very old. It consists largely of native words, or of borrowed words that have worked themselves into the very fiber of our language, hence, though highly technical in many particulars, these vocabularies are more familiar in sound, and more generally understood than most other technicalities. The special dialects of law, medicine, and philosophy have also become pretty familiar to cultivated person, and have contributed much to the popular vocabulary. Yet, every profession still possesses a large body of technical terms that remain essentially foreign, even to educated speech. And the proportion has been much increased in the last fifty years, particularly in the various departments of natural and political sciences and in the mechanic arts. So new terms are coined with the greatest freedom, and abandoned with indifference when they have served their turn. Most of the new coinages are restricted to special discussions and seldom get into general literature or conversation. Yet no profession is nowadays, as all profession once were, a closed guild  .

The European Union shifts all at once, at 01:00 UTC or 02:00 CET or 03:00 EET; for example, Eastern European Time is always one hour ahead of Central European Time. Most of North America shifts at 02:00 local time, so its zones do not shift at the same time; for example, Mountain Time is temporarily (for one hour) zero hours ahead of Pacific Time, instead of one hour ahead, in the autumn and two hours, instead of one, ahead of Pacific Time in the spring.

CHAPTER VI: FIRKET   June 7, 1896  Since the end of 1895 the Dervish force in Firket had been under the command of the Emir Hammuda, and it was through the indolence and neglect of this dissipated Arab that the Egyptian army had been able to make good its position at Akasha without any fighting. Week after week the convoys had straggled unmolested through the difficult country between Sarras and the advanced base. No attack had been made upon the brigade at Akasha. No enterprise was directed against its communications. This fatal inactivity did not pass unnoticed by Wad Bishara, the Governor of Dongola; but although he was nominally in supreme command of all the Dervish forces in the province he had hardly any means of enforcing his authority. His rebukes and exhortations, however, gradually roused Hammuda, and during May two or three minor raids were planned and executed, and the Egyptian position at Akasha was several times reconnoitred.  Bishara remained unsatisfied, and at length, despairing of infusing energy into Hammuda, he ordered his subordinate Osman Azrak to supersede him. Osman was a Dervish of very different type. He was a fanatical and devoted believer in the Mahdi and a loyal follower of the Khalifa. For many years he had served on the northern frontier of the Dervish Empire, and his name was well known to the Egyptian Government as the contriver of the most daring and the most brutal raids. His cruelty to the wretched inhabitants of the border villages had excluded him from all hope of mercy should he ever fall into the hands of the enemy. His crafty skill, however, protected him, and among the Emirs gathered at Firket there was none whose death would have given greater satisfaction to the military authorities than the man who was now to replace Hammuda.  Answer this series of questions: 1. Who was in command? 2. who was neglected? 3. when was he in command from? 4. was akasha attacked? 5. was the inactivity go unnoticed? 6. how often was convoys deployed? 7. who was in supreme command? 8. what was his other occupation? 9. of where? 10. did any one have the ability to enforce his rule? 11. when were the raids? 12. how many raids? 13. what position was changed? 14. was he satisfied? 15.

Given the question: Process:  - You inhale - The air enters the mouth and nose - The diaphragm contracts - Air fills all the sacks in the lungs - Oxygen passes through the sacks into capillaries - The blood is passed to the blood in the capillaries - The blood carries the oxygen to the heart - The heart pumps the oxygenated blood to the body.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose gene manipulation achieved happens, how will it affect greater lung capacity.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you've proposed suggests that gene manipulation could potentially lead to increased lung capacity. If this were achieved, it could indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the process of respiration. Direct effects:  1. Enhanced lung capacity: The increased volume of air that the lungs can hold would allow for a more efficient exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. This means that with each inhalation, more air would enter the lungs, providing a greater amount of oxygen for the body to use. 2. Improved gas exchange: With greater lung capacity, the surface area of the alveolar sacs (where the oxygen is transferred to the capillaries) could also increase. This would improve the efficiency of gas exchange, allowing more oxygen to be absorbed by the blood and more carbon dioxide to be removed. Indirect effects: 1. Enhanced physical performance: With more oxygen available to the body, an individual could potentially experience improved physical performance, endurance, and reduced muscle fatigue due to more efficient oxygen and nutrient delivery to the organs and muscles. 2. Adaptation to high altitudes: Greater lung capacity could prove advantageous in situations where oxygen is scarce, such as at high altitudes or during intense physical activities. An increased lung capacity might alleviate some of the negative impacts of these situations by providing larger oxygen reserves and more efficient gas exchange. It is essential to note that while gene manipulation may hold promise for enhancing lung capacity in theory, many ethical, safety, and scientific concerns would need to be addressed before such an intervention could be considered viable. In addition, the interactions between genetics, environment, and individual variables would need to be carefully examined to evaluate the specific effects of gene manipulation on lung capacity and respiration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Avoid letting your dog get familiar with toileting indoors if you'd like it to toilet outside. If you have a place in your yard where you'd like your dog to toilet, bring it to the spot immediately. Before you even go into your house, let it sniff around the yard until your dog urinates or defecates. When your dog does urinate or defecate, give your dog lots of verbal praise and attention so your dog associates going to the bathroom outside with being praised. In order to make your French bulldog a good household member, begin potty training your dog as soon as you get it. If you wait to begin training and let your dog toilet on puppy pads, it will take longer to potty train it and you dog will be confused about where to toilet. You'll need to be very consistent and encouraging when you begin housebreaking your French bulldog. Most dogs will show signs that they need to toilet, so watch your French bulldog to become familiar with your dog's specific signs. You should also be in the habit of frequently giving it  the opportunity to toilet. Signs that your dog needs to toilet include:  Panting Pacing or sniffing around the house Barking Wandering off to a quiet area If you didn't notice your dog's cue to toilet or your dog accidentally goes in the house, thoroughly clean up the mess. You'll need to use a product designed for pet messes or a special pet-urine enzymatic cleaner. This will completely remove the scent of urine so your dog doesn't return to the same spot to toilet later. Don't scold or hit your dog for having an accident. Your dog won't be able to associate the punishment with the action (toileting inside) and your dog will learn not to trust you.

Once her father died, Cinderella's stepmother became very mean to her and made her do all of the chores around the house, like cleaning up after her two evil stepsisters. One day the King sent out a message to all of the single women to attend the Royal Ball in honor of his son, to find a wife. Of course, Cinderella didn't get to go, but her stepsisters did. Cinderella was very upset and thought that there was no way she could attend the Royal Ball, until her fairy godmother appeared.

When it comes to exercise, many people seem to fall into two distinct camps: those who love a vigorous, sweat-soaked workout and those who view it as a form of torment. With hopes of getting more people up and moving, scientists are looking at the body's biological and chemical processes for clues to understanding what's behind differing attitudes toward exercise. That could mean there are factors beyond motivation and discipline to explain why some people enjoy exercising and others don't. One finding so far: How people interpret their body's sensations during and after exercise plays a large role in whether they enjoy it. Also, researchers at Iowa State University found that people's physical capacity could be much lower than many realize, so many people push beyond their limits without realizing it. For example, for sedentary people, just cooking dinner could count as exercise and they need to build up to even walking, the researchers found. Dan Cederholm has tried for years to find some type of exercise he could stick with. He finds the gym boring and basketball and baseball leagues unappealing. As for running? \\"My shins always hurt like hell,\\" says Mr. Cederholm, 38, a Web designer from Salem, Mass. His friend Rick Johnson, on the other hand, competes in 20 road races a year. He remembers that even as a kid, when he was told to run a lap during gym class, he would ask to do extras. \\"To me, it seems very foreign to say I don't enjoy sweating or running,\\" says Mr. Johnson, 41, an editor who also lives in Salem. From couch potatoes to Olympic athletes, everyone has a physical capacity for exertion, beyond which the body becomes stressed and begins to feel bad. How much stems from genetic factors—things like lung capacity, oxygen transport and the rate at which oxygen is used in the muscle cells—is still a subject of scholarly debate. Estimates vary from 10% to 50%, says Panteleimon Ekkekakis, a professor of kinesiology at Iowa State who has been studying the psychophysiology of exercise. But many sedentary people push beyond their intrinsic range when they try to exercise too quickly or intensely, which can make them hate the activity and want to stop, says Dr. Ekkekakis. The idea hinges on something called the \\"ventilatory threshold.\\" Normally when people breathe, they expel an amount of carbon dioxide that is equal to the amount of oxygen taken in. But beyond the ventilatory threshold, the release of carbon dioxide begins to exceed the body's intake of oxygen. This excess release of carbon dioxide is a sign that the muscles have become more acidic, which the body finds stressful. For most individuals, the ventilatory threshold is around 50% to 60% of the way to their maximum capacity, though there is tremendous individual variation. For elite athletes, the threshold may be as high as 80%, while sedentary people may hit it at 35%. By using tricks such as listening to music, people can continue to feel good even slightly past their ventilatory threshold, Dr. Ekkekakis and his colleagues have found. As people approach their maximum capacity, however, the feel-bad reaction is unavoidable. And while both ventilatory threshold and maximum capacity can be slowly increased, people have to have enough positive experiences to stick with exercise over time so they actually can boost these limits. In continuing studies of obese, sedentary but otherwise healthy middle-aged women, Dr. Ekkekakis found that some individuals reach their ventilatory threshold after just one minute at a slow pace on a treadmill. Some women's thresholds are so low that they would reach their maximum capacity simply by doing the dishes or cooking, says Dr. Ekkekakis. This means that though many weight-loss interventions suggest walking as the primary form of physical activity, it is probably too hard for many people. How people interpret some of the physical sensations of exertion or fatigue, such as buildup of lactic acid in muscle or increases in body temperature, can also influence whether they stick with an exercise routine. Some people tend to read such physical cues as a sign of a good workout or progress, whereas many sedentary people just find them uncomfortable or painful, say researchers. Elite athletes have even been dubbed \\"benign masochists\\" because they appear to enjoy the pain of exertion, says Dominic Micklewright, a researcher and curriculum director at the Centre for Sports & Exercise Science at the University of Essex in the U.K. The sensation of how hard one is working also can be influenced by some surprising external factors. In one study published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology last year, Dr. Micklewright and his team examined how the color of the imagery participants viewed while cycling would affect their mood and perceived feelings of exertion. After viewing scenes that involved green trees, participants reported feeling happier and their exercise less difficult than when the same scenes appeared in black-and-white or red, suggesting that exercising in nature or simulated green spaces could be helpful for exercisers, says Dr. Micklewright. It wasn't until age 48 that Sharon Weinbar (in black) of Hillsborough, Calif., found a workout she looked forward to: rowing. Researchers have found several other psychological factors and cognitive tricks that can help boost the motivation to move. Three that appear critical include how competent a person feels, whether he or she feels they have some control or choice in the matter and, for many, whether the activity fosters social relatedness, says Sarah Ullrich-French, a professor in kinesiology at Washington State University in Pullman, Wash. Adults can be discouraged from exercising by not knowing what to do or how to do it. Those who were athletic in childhood may be frustrated by how their abilities have deteriorated over time. Dr. Ullrich-French suggests that adults try new activities where they won't be comparing themselves. For Mr. Cederholm, the Web designer from Salem, going back to hockey, which he had enjoyed as a boy, wasn't an option. But the first time he played squash was an epiphany. \\"It was fun at the level that you don't even realize you're sweating your butt off,\\" says Mr. Cederholm, who now plays three to four hours a week with a friend or practices shots by himself on the court. Sharon Wienbar, a venture capitalist in Hillsborough, Calif., became a rower at the age of 48 because she enjoys the feeling of speeding along on the water, discussing her workout routines with her teammates and having a coach who helps her get better. \\"A couple months into rowing, it was like a light switch going on in my head,\\" she says. Once a \\"geeky, bookish\\" child who was always picked last for gym, Ms. Wienbar says rowing is now part of her identity and has prompted her to think of herself as an athlete. And at age 51, she says she enjoys the physical feeling of pushing herself. \\"I don't even feel like I've reached the maximum,\\" says Ms. Wienbar. \\"I'm in better shape now than I was 10 years ago. Maybe I'll be in even better shape in a decade.\\" Write to Shirley S.

Beneath his pleasant facade, however, he is a sociopath with violent sexual tastes. As a teenager, Lou was caught raping a five-year-old girl by Mike, his older step-brother. Mike pleaded guilty to the crime and served prison time to protect Lou. After being released, Mike was hired by the construction firm of Chester Conway (Ned Beatty). One day on the job, Mike had a fatal accident. Lou believes that Conway planned the accident.At the prodding of Sheriff Bob Maples (Tom Bower), Lou visits Joyce Lakeland (Jessica Alba), a prostitute who is having an affair with Conway's son, Elmer (Jay R.

News article: Texas sheriff mistrusts Mexico's border lake inquiry By Kevin Johnson, USA TODAY The Texas sheriff leading the U.S. investigation into the fatal shooting of an American man said Mexican officials are trying to discourage the victim's wife from pushing for a fuller inquiry. Zapata County Sheriff Sigifredo \\"Sigi\\" Gonzalez said Sunday that Tiffany Hartley was subjected to 12 hours of questioning by Mexican investigators Friday in an effort to \\"intimidate and discourage her from doing anything.\\" Hartley is scheduled to meet with Mexican prosecutors and investigators today, Gonzalez said. He said the questions asked by Mexican investigators were not aimed at resolving the Sept. 30 incident, when Hartley says her husband, David, was shot by Mexican pirates. His body has not been recovered. \\"It's wrong. It makes no sense,\\" Gonzalez said. He said he received an account of the meeting from U.S. officials who attended the session in McAllen, Texas. Mexican officials could not be reached for comment Sunday. Gonzalez's account contradicts a statement released Saturday by the Mexican attorney general's office. It said Hartley's wife provided new information about the Jet Ski outing on Falcon Lake, which spans the U.S.-Mexican border. \\"Mrs. Hartley provided valuable information that will allow federal investigations to continue,\\" the Mexican government's statement said. The statement did not elaborate on the nature of the information provided by Hartley, who has expressed concern that the investigation and search would be abandoned. Tiffany Hartley has said she and her husband were attacked when they ventured into Mexican waters on Jet Skis to photograph the ruins of a church. She said her husband was shot in an assault by gunmen in boats. She said she tried but failed to pull her husband onto her Jet Ski and fled to the Texas side of the border as the gunmen continued firing on her craft. Gonzalez said the gunmen are believed to be members of the violent Zetas drug cartel. Last week, the Mexican inquiry into the Hartley shooting was shaken when the severed head of the commander in the case, Rolando Flores Villegas, was found. Gonzalez said Villegas' killing is one of the reasons Mexican authorities do not want to proceed with the investigation. During the questioning Friday, Gonzalez said, Mexican investigators asked Hartley to participate in a re-enactment of the incident. Gonzalez said the request was inappropriate because it posed a clear risk to Hartley's safety. \\"She's never hinted at not cooperating with them,\\" he said. \\"But she's not going to go do that, and you can't blame her.\\" \\"They don't want to investigate this,\\" Gonzalez said. \\"Their position is, 'We hope we can discourage her enough so that she won't continue to go forward with it.' \\" You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Ed, who's in town for the Spirit of Detroit Music Festival, then tweets out, \\"If you see this rude bar owner, give him a smack from me,\\" which leads to nearly every person who stops by the bar hitting Justin in the head. Nicki's getting married this weekend, and Justin's pretty bummed out, so Danny tries to cheer him up by watching Scandal. Only, Danny flips out upon learning that Justin thinks Scott Foley is better looking than him. A super-hot girl (Victoria Justice) at the next table overhears his tantrum and thinks the best friends' banter is hilarious. This prompts the two idiots to try to one up each other for the lovely Amanda's affections. Amanda's a backup singer in town for the musical festival, so of course, Justin immediately starts singing. When Amanda leaves, Danny announces he's going to bow out of the competition so Justin has a chance with her. This infuriates Justin, leading to a face-off between the roommates. If Amanda picks Justin, Danny has to wax his chest, and if she picks anyone else, Justin has to wax his chest… live. Meanwhile, Brett complains that people from Detroit are horrible tippers, but Leslie kindly reminds him that he's not exactly the nicest bartender. At a table nearby, Shelly's retirement home coworkers Zach (Zach Braff) and Donald (Donald Faison) agree with Leslie - Brett was a bitch to them, too! So nice-guy Shelly challenges the snarky Brit to see who can earn the most tips by the end of the night. Shelly, being the adorable teddy bear that he is, quickly fills up his bucket with tips from pretty ladies (Christa Miller and Minnie Driver - Version 1; Christa Miller and Kate Walsh Version 2) while Brett's is totally empty. Dr. Drew, who's been sitting at the bar, notices and tells Shelly he's worried about Brett, prompting Shelly to give his bucket money to Dr. Drew to give to Brett. Dr. Drew pockets most of it, but throws a 50 at Brett, making him the winner! Upstairs, Candace is hiding a big secret: her ex-boyfriend Trent! When Leslie and Burski spot him they're livid - Trent's an absolute jackass who treated Candace terribly. Candace swears he just needed a place to crash and they're not getting back together. Leslie and her new boyfriend Mike (Mike Catherwood) explain that Candace is just backsliding, but that'll all change the second she meets someone who makes her forget about him. Downstairs, Justin preps for Amanda's return by trying out pick-up lines on Candace. Only, she inadvertently gets sucked in by his charm and Leslie realizes Candace is definitely not thinking about Trent anymore... But when Amanda comes back, Justin comes on a bit too strong, while Danny's smooth moves win him a movie date. Burski tells Danny that he should do what Shelly did - let his best friend win because it means more to him. Danny reluctantly agrees and decides to coach Justin into beating him. He suggests picking on his insecurities and then brings out the big guns: TV's Scott Foley! Scott gives Justin a pep talk, slaps him for Ed Sheeran and then convinces Danny to drive him to the airport just by using the power of his intoxicating green eyes. When Amanda stops by for her date with Danny, Justin tries out Danny's aggressive approach but quickly realizes he's not being himself. He apologizes to Amanda and spills that he's just a guy looking for a serious relationship. Unfortunately, Amanda's not looking for anything serious, and while Danny was at the airport with TV's Scott Foley, she made other plans. Looks like nobody won, so Justin doesn't have to wax his chest. But Danny clarifies that the bet was if Amanda ended up with anyone else... and she ditched Danny for Trent! Sorry Justin, that wax job looks painful!

Movie title: The Four Musketeers Movie plot: (Sequel to The Three Musketeers)Porthos (Frank Finlay) recaps the events leading to D'Artagnan (Michael York) becoming a musketeer. The original trio, including Porthos' companions Aramis (Richard Chamberlain) and Athos (Oliver Reed) find themselves on a rescue mission behind enemy lines during the battle of La Rochelle. D'Artagnan's enemy Rochefort (Christopher Lee) was caught spying and is enduring a wait before an amateur firing squad learning to load their rifles on the job. While they figure out how to blindfold a condemned man who has only one eye, Athos and Aramis prepare to launch a smoke bomb as cover while Porthos brings the horses for their escape, but the fuse goes out just as the order is given to fire. Fortunately the entire firing squad misses their target, and while they reload the trio manages to extract the spy. He is returned to his master, Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston), then is sent to obtain D'Artagnan's lover Constance (Raquel Welsh). She is the dressmaker and confidante to Queen Anne (Geraldine Chapman) and a valued hostage if they are to deal with Anne's affair with the Protestant sympathizer, the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward).Rochefort and his men find D'Artagnan and Constance shopping in the public market.

Hypothesis: We don't have more information at this time. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"In order to answer whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we must first break down and analyze both the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: Further information The given premise indicates that there might be additional information that is to be provided or accessed. It suggests that the current information may not be sufficient or complete and that there could be more information relevant to a certain topic or situation. The premise does not state whether this further information is readily available or not, so one cannot be certain about its accessibility. Hypothesis: We don't have more information at this time The stated hypothesis asserts that additional or more information is currently unavailable or simply not present. This could mean the accessible information pool is limited and that, at this moment, there is no other information to provide or gather about the situation or topic. Now, let's analyze if the premise entails the hypothesis. Entailment occurs when the truth of one statement (premise) guarantees the truth of another statement (hypothesis), i.e., if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true. In this case, the premise refers to the existence of further information, while the hypothesis relates to the unavailability or absence of more information at the moment. Therefore, the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. In fact, they appear as contrasting views on the availability of further information. The premise has an implication that there might be more information, and the hypothesis states that no such information is present or accessible. However, it's important to note that these statements could be contextually compatible depending on the circumstances under discussion. For example, it's possible that there exists additional information, but it is not possible to obtain or access it at this time. In this scenario, the premise and hypothesis could co-exist. In conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. They do not strictly follow the entailment relation, though they could be contextually compatible depending on the situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

A plume of black smoke rose over Cairo early Friday after a powerful explosion hit the city's police headquarters, killing at least four people and wounding more than 50 others, Egyptian authorities said. The blast struck a key symbol of authority in a country that has been shaken by political turmoil and violent unrest in recent years. It was followed by two smaller explosions near police stations in the Cairo area, one of which killed one person. And later, a fourth explosion outside a movie theater in Giza city, near Cairo, killed one person and injured seven others, state television said. The blasts took place at a time of high tension -- the day before the third anniversary of the 2011 revolution that eventually brought down authoritarian leader Hosni Mubarak. And they come amid the instability ushered in by the military's overthrow last year of the democratically elected former President, Mohamed Morsy, and the ensuing crackdown by security forces on the Islamist movement that supported him, the Muslim Brotherhood. Suicide bomber suspected. The first blast appeared to have been caused by a suicide attacker who tried to drive a vehicle laden with explosives into the police headquarters, said Maj. Gen. Hany Abdel Latif, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, citing preliminary reports. Guards stationed in front of the headquarters in the Abdeen district of Cairo opened fire at the vehicle, and the explosion went off in the building's vicinity rather than inside, he told state news agency Egynews. The blast destroyed the front of the first and second floors of the eight-story building, he said, and damaged the third floor. Most of the building's windows appeared to have been blown out. Air-conditioning units dangled by cables from the shattered facade. At least 51 people were wounded in the explosion, state-run broadcaster Masriya TV reported, citing the Health Ministry. Visiting the ruined building, Egyptian Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim condemned the bombing. \\"These are nothing but desperate attacks in an attempt to create chaos, but the citizens here will remain resilient,\\" he told Masriya TV. Ibrahim said security forces will ensure that Egyptians will be able to celebrate the anniversary of the revolution Saturday \\"as if nothing happened today.\\" A powerful blast. CNN's Reza Sayah said the blast appeared to be \\"the most powerful bomb attack that we've seen here in central Cairo in recent memory.\\" Speaking from near the scene of the blast, he said the attack will probably intensify the fight between Egypt's military-backed government and the groups that oppose it. It wasn't immediately clear who was behind that bombing. Friday is a holiday in Egypt, so the police headquarters is unlikely to have been as busy as it would have been on a weekday. The blast happened around 6:30 a.m., according to state media. Hundreds of people -- some stunned, some angry -- gathered around the scene, Sayah said. Many of those in the crowd were quick to blame the Muslim Brotherhood, despite no official word on who might be to blame. The Muslim Brotherhood denied responsibility for the bombing and issued a statement condemning it. \\"The Muslim Brotherhood condemns any acts of violence or killing, regardless of who are the perpetrators, and the (Muslim Brotherhood) emphasizes that the revolution that has continued for seven months is a peaceful revolution and it will insist to remain peaceful.\\" Separately, the Muslim Brotherhood called for protests and sit-ins across multiple sites in and out of Cairo in a show of defiance. The group said security forces fired live ammunition on demonstrators in Beni Suef on Friday; surrounded and mistreated worshippers at a mosque in Suez on Friday; and thugs attacked a funeral in Alexandria on Thursday, among other grievances. Police arrested 111 protesters across the country, the Interior Ministry said. Egypt's armed forces condemned the bombings, as did the U.S. government. \\"It should be clear to all ... Egyptians that violence has not and will not move Egypt's political transition forward,\\" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. \\"Ongoing unrest and cycles of violence surrounding protests hurt Egypt's prospects for political and economic stability.\\" A U.S. State Department official said that Washington is \\"aware of reports\\" that one of its citizens \\"has been detained in Egypt.\\" But the official said the U.S. government wouldn't comment any more than that. Fears of more turmoil. Friday's second explosion was much smaller and went off near a police station in Dokki, a residential area of Cairo, wounding several people, authorities said. And in the Al-Haram district of Giza city, a small bomb was thrown at a moving police vehicle near a police station, killing one person, deputy Giza security chief Mahmoud Farouk told state TV. This new wave of violence follows a referendum earlier this month in which Egyptian voters overwhelmingly approved a new constitution proposed by the military-backed government, according to the country's electoral commission. But supporters of the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood had boycotted the vote in response to a continuing government crackdown. Rights groups have expressed concern about what they call an increasingly repressive environment in Egypt, where more than 2,200 people have been killed since Morsy's ouster. Some anti-government groups have resorted to violence. Bomb attacks and shootings against the security apparatus have taken place across the country in recent months -- a situation described by some as a low-level insurgency. The government has blamed the Muslim Brotherhood for many of the attacks, even though the movement has condemned them. The bombing of the Cairo police headquarters suggested the violence is taking on a more serious, high-profile form. \\"The fear is there's a very difficult and tumultuous phase ahead for this country,\\" Sayah said.

It is best to apply hair gel while the hair is still wet.  Drop a small amount of gel in the palm of your hand and rub your hands together.  Run your fingers through your hair over the area of the cowlick.  Massage the gel into the roots of your hair and rub it in all directions for full coverage.  Once the gel is massaged into the roots, press and comb the cowlick in the direction you would like it styled. Some gel is heat-activated.  Use a hair dryer to style your hair the way you would like it after applying the hair gel. Apply pomade to dry hair to help style it in the direction you wish the hair to run.  Run your forefinger and middle finger through the pomade to pick up some of the wax.  Rub these fingers against your thumb to spread the pomade.  Grab the area of hair you would like to adjust and pull it from root to end with these two fingers and thumb, covering the area with pomade, and pulling the hair in the direction you would like it styled.  Choose a pomade with a matte finish. Avoid using more than a thin layer of pomade or your hair may appear wet until you wash the pomade out. Root brushes are specifically created for getting to the root and adjusting the direction of hair growth.  While your hair is wet, repeatedly run the brush over the cowlick in the opposite direction of the hair growth.  The bristles are very flexible to keep from tangling in the  hair follicle.

In the United Kingdom, sociologists and other scholars influenced by Marxism, such as Stuart Hall (1932–2014) and Raymond Williams (1921–1988), developed cultural studies. Following nineteenth-century Romantics, they identified \\"culture\\" with consumption goods and leisure activities (such as art, music, film, food, sports, and clothing).

In her storage room-turned-office, Jennifer Baum works under an expanding leak that is causing the ceiling to turn brown and crumble. Mold grows in the buckets positioned to catch the water. She shrugs it off. Outside her office she has taped up a clear plastic suit, and a sign that reads, \\"All employees must don protective gear before coming in.\\" Such is life in limbo. Nearly a year after Sept. 11, the Legal Aid Society-the lawyers for New York's poor and homeless-remains, well, homeless. The nonprofit has been barred from returning to its 90 Church St. headquarters, across from the World Trade Center site, because of environmental concerns. Legal Aid has uncomfortable company. More than 11,500 New Yorkers continue to work out of temporary space, according to analysis by Manhattan-based real estate brokerage TenantWise.com Inc. and Crain's New York Business. That's 8% of the 137,000 workers who lost their offices or access to them when the Twin Towers collapsed. Legal Aid's 450 displaced attorneys and staffers have spent the past 12 months spread among previously unused spaces-some unused for good reason-in the nonprofit's other offices. It could be another year and a half before they return to their old desks. They have contended with difficult working conditions as demand for Legal Aid's services is on the rise because of Sept. 11 and the deteriorating economy. The civil division is spread among a few boroughs. Their papers and documents, some 20,000 boxes worth, are stuck in a storage facility in Linden, N.J. \\"I am counting the days till we can have all the parts back in one place,\\" says Steven Banks, Legal Aid's associate attorney in chief. In the memories of the exiled workers, the old office has achieved mythical proportions. They say the wood paneling and rugs had the ability to cool emotions and lift spirits. The Legal Aid office on Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights, where 65 displaced workers have cobbled together space amid the faded and scratched walls, looks more like a bargain basement.

In this article, I’ll address a real mainstay of modern medicine: laboratory tests that require drawing blood. This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself. In this article, I’m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older...

Step 4: Identify negative points to address  - Uninspired story  - Lack of character development  - Weak humor  - Predictable plot Step 5: Write the review, focusing on the negative sentiment \\"The Emoji Movie\\" sadly misses the mark in delivering an entertaining experience. Despite taking place in the innovative and vibrant world of a smartphone, the storyline is uninspired and mundane. The characters, while visually appealing, lack depth and development, making it difficult for the audience to connect with them. Furthermore, one would expect a comedic film like this to have a strong sense of humor; however, this movie falls flat in that aspect. The jokes are often forced and weak, eliciting few laughs from a disappointed audience. The Emoji Movie's plot is also painfully predictable, leaving viewers without any surprises or twists to keep them engaged. Unfortunately, this movie proves to be a lackluster waste of potential, and I cannot recommend it to anyone seeking a quality animated experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The prescription was for a preparation of arsenic, which Matilde had formerly taken for some time. The chemist would not make any difficulty about preparing twenty doses of it for the Countess Macomer, though the whole quantity of arsenic contained in so many would probably be sufficient to kill one not accustomed to the medicine, if taken all at once. But though Matilde was so anxious to have the stuff before luncheon, she had a number of doses of it put away in a drawer, which she took out and counted, after Elettra had gone. She opened one of the little folded papers and looked at the fine white powder it contained, took a little on the end of her finger and tasted it.

This sentence informs us that Scatarie Island is an island within the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. This island is situated in the Atlantic Ocean, and its geographical location is specifically off the coast of Baleine, a region on the southeastern extremity of Cape Breton Island. Cape Breton Island itself is also a part of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, and it is one of the largest islands in Canada. 2. Cape Breton Island is an island located in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, off the coast of Baleine, Scatarie Island. In contrast, this sentence is describing Cape Breton Island, which is an island within the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. It is worth noting that the sentence construction is not entirely accurate and appears to be attempting to relate the locations of Cape Breton Island and Scatarie Island. Cape Breton Island, mentioned in both sentences, is the northern part of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia and measures approximately 10,311 square kilometers. It is connected to the mainland of Nova Scotia by the Canso Causeway, a long narrow strip of land that carries the Trans-Canada Highway.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: A week, as they say, is a long time in football. By that reckoning, six weeks is almost an eternity. For fans of one of English football's oldest clubs, it certainly feels that way. On Boxing Day 2012, former European champions Nottingham Forest lined up to play Leeds United in a second flight match in the English Championship. After going a goal behind, Forest roared back to an emphatic 4-2 victory that had a certain swagger about it. Watching at the time, it was hard to escape the feeling that things were finally coming together for a side that has come to embody the term 'sleeping giant'. One point and one place outside the playoffs, that afternoon Forest fans would have tucked into their turkey sandwiches with a sense of satisfaction and thoughts of good things to come. But just hours after the final whistle the club's Kuwaiti owners, the Al Hasawi family, fired the club's quietly progressive manager, Sean O'Driscoll. Baffling decision. For fans and observers alike it was a baffling decision. \\"We cannot speak highly enough of Sean as a man,\\" said Chairman Fawaz Al Hasawi. \\"He was appointed at an extremely difficult time for the club and can count himself unlucky to have lost his job with the team just one point away from the top six. But we have a responsibility to look to the future for this great Club because we have huge ambitions for it.\\" Fast forward just a few weeks, and O'Driscoll's replacement, Alex McLeish, has followed his predecessor to the exit. January had also seen the sudden and unceremonious exits of Forest's CEO, its head of recruitment, and the popular club ambassador (and former player and manager) Frank Clark. McLeish departed 'by mutual consent' after just one win in seven games and a transfer window that bordered on farcical, as key target George Boyd's switch to the club foundered after the player apparently failed an eye test. Forest fans took to social media once more in a bewildered daze as headlines painted a picture of a shambolic club in disarray. Days later another former Forest manager, the combative Billy Davies, was reinstalled in this hottest of managerial hot seats. But before he could properly take charge his team duly lost 2-0 to a Bristol City side now, somewhat poetically, managed by none other than Sean O'Driscoll. Blackburn woes. This odd story will have particular resonance in England's north west, where another of English football's most venerable institutions, Blackburn Rovers, has collapsed from mid table comfort in the English Premier League (EPL) to relegation and ignominy. The club's owners, India's Venky's Group, began their tenure by sacking the widely respected Sam Allardyce in December 2010. Since then they appear to have embarked on a kamikaze PR strategy, which has led to ridicule off the pitch and confusion on it. In the latest chapter, Shebby Singh, the former TV pundit brought in by Venky's as the club's 'global advisor', is reportedly at loggerheads with managing director Derek Shaw, amid allegations of interference with football matters and disputes over players' contractual deals. The culture clash between the old and the new sides of the club looks wider than ever. Rovers are now onto their third manager of the season and a swift return to the EPL looks wildly improbable. Venky's and the Al-Hasawi family are the latest in a wave of foreign owners taking control of clubs in the English leagues. Few on the growing list are strangers to controversy. Mixed feelings. Cardiff City's new Malaysian owners changed the club's colors from blue to red, causing outrage -- but perhaps they will be forgiven as they are currently well set for promotion to the EPL. The Glazer family's takeover of Manchester United sparked a supporter's revolt that saw the formation of a completely new team -- FC United of Manchester -- by fans alarmed at the level of debt (currently around Â£360million - 550m) foisted upon the club. Then there's Roman Abramovich's Chelsea, whose phenomenal success has been tempered by the owner's propensity to fire managers; and Sheikh Mansour of Manchester City, whose investments in the club stretch UEFA's concept of Financial Fair Play to the limit, and very probably beyond. The attitude of football fans to these types of investor is pretty schizophrenic. On the one hand the very prospect of a new owner, awash with cash, coming in and transforming a club's fortunes would get many salivating, regardless of where the money is from and who is taking the reins. English football, or at least the Premier League, is an enormously attractive stage and clubs make for interesting playthings for the super-rich. Meanwhile, fans are attracted to the idea of quick-fix success. Community connection. On the other hand, with spiraling ticket prices driven largely by players' wages and the increasingly erratic pictures being painted by some of these new owners, there is a sense that clubs' connections with the communities in which many have existed for over a century are being undermined. Then of course there's the idea of what constitutes super rich in the context of football. Away from the financial machinations of the Glazers, Randy Lerner's more straightforward commitment to Aston Villa appears to have run dry, with the team staring at a relegation battle and the purse strings tied tightly shut. In the Championship, Watford's owners have enjoyed remarkable success by filling their side with loan signings from another club, Italy's Udinese, which they also own. And then, in England's League One, there's Portsmouth. If the Glazer's ownership of Manchester United appears complex, the background to Portsmouth's stewardship is positively arcane. An excellent blog by Portsmouth fan SJ Maskell recently dissected the baffling raft of creditors currently being pored over in the English courts. The club, which enjoyed a Premier League berth and an FA Cup win just five years ago, is facing relegation to England's fourth tier and possible ruin. It has seen a succession of owners, offshore companies, and paper trails leading all over the world drive it into successive demotions and financial collapse. Wayward club. A group of fans has formed the Portsmouth Supporters' Trust, which is looking to gain control of this wayward club and finally wrestle it back from a course to apparent doom. All logic points to their being given the chance to do so, but this is a club that has defied logic for years and a decision in their favor is by no means certain. The Portsmouth Supporters Trust faces a battle, but it is perhaps this kind of institution that points to a more stable future for clubs and the sport of football in England. The problem with many of the new wave of owners in English football is not that they are foreign. Football is a global game, and the EPL is filled with players from all over the world, so it would be illogical to deny owners from overseas the chance to take part too. But the disconnect between the fans that pay to watch these clubs, the communities in which they operate, and even the armchair fans that follow them from afar, is an issue. A report launched this week by the football community trust Supporters Direct outlines a range of measures primarily focused on the physical manifestations of clubs -- the stadia in which they play, and the various off-shoots of these buildings. At the report's core are recommendations designed to protect the relationship between clubs and their communities, including joint ownership of stadia, 'golden shares' to be held by supporters collectively, and clubs that are owned by or formed as so-called Community Benefit Societies. In essence, it is about taking a degree of control into the hands of supporters. The sentiment behind this applies not just to the bricks and mortar of a football stadium. Clubs like Barcelona in Spain and throughout Germany's Bundesliga are protected from extreme and erratic behavior by the fact that fans are directly involved in a democratic ownership arrangement. The worst excesses of owners, who can act on a whim to often disrupt and damage the course of some of the long established institutions at the heart of communities, can be curbed by what is basically a democratic, rather than autocratic structure. Allied to initiatives such as UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules, perhaps this will see a game in England that is balanced less precariously, and fit for a long term and sustainable future. For now, however, English football fans should perhaps be careful what they wish for. Highlights:","output":"- Nottingham Forest faced some unexpected changes as the Al Hasawi family fired the club's manager, Sean O'Driscoll, after a 4-2 victory against Leeds United in 2012. - English football has seen multiple instances of foreign owners taking control, leading to mixed feelings and controversy among fans. - High-spending owners can lead to an unstable environment for clubs and their connection to their communities. - To regain stability, some suggest a more democratic ownership structure, allowing fans more control and involvement in the clubs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Halloween II Context: After being attacked by Michael Myers (Dick Warlock), who vanished after being shot six times and falling from a second story balcony on October 31, 1978, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is rushed to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital that same night while Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) continues to search for Michael. Seeking shelter to recover from his injuries, Michael steals a kitchen knife from an elderly couple's house and kills their teenage neighbor. He learns that Laurie is at the local hospital after listening to a radio broadcast and heads there. Paramedic Jimmy Lloyd (Lance Guest) starts to develop romantic feelings for Laurie, despite the chagrin of head nurse Virginia Alves (Gloria Gifford) and explains to her about Michael; he soon realizes Laurie is in a comatose state. When Loomis sees Ben Tramer (who is wearing a mask similar to Michael's) walking towards him, he mistakes him for Michael and attempts to shoot him, but Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers) tries to stop him when an oncoming police car hits a van and explodes, accidentally killing Ben. Once Michael arrives at the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, he cuts the phone lines, and after killing most of the hospital personnel using various tools and methods, he reaches Laurie's room, but finds it empty. When Jimmy goes to get help, he discovers Mrs. Alves's corpse in the surgery room. While trying to run out of the room, he slips in a pool of blood on the floor and loses consciousness. Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis follows clues Michael left at a school he broke into when his colleague Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens) and a marshal (John Zenda) arrive with orders to transport Loomis back to Smith Grove's Sanitarium. During the drive, Marion tells him that Laurie Strode is Michael's sister.

Answer:","output":"In the movie Halloween II, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) experiences flashbacks of a burning body while being treated at the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital. These flashbacks are specifically of the burning body of Michael Myers (Dick Warlock), the masked killer who attacked her earlier on October 31, 1978, and who has continued to terrorize the town in search of her. These flashbacks are symbolic of Laurie's ongoing trauma and fear, knowing that Michael is still alive and may come for her again. After Michael Myers discovers Laurie's location at the hospital, he proceeds to kill most of the hospital staff and eventually reaches Laurie's room. Laurie, realizing she is in danger, manages to elude Michael and escape her room before he can harm her. Throughout the movie, characters such as Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) and paramedic Jimmy Lloyd (Lance Guest) are involved in the efforts to stop the relentless killer and protect Laurie from the terror that she continuously faces.

Reality Check says: There is evidence for this and charging fees for employment tribunals has led to a bigger fall in the number of claims than the government expected. The fees were introduced when they were in government with the Conservatives in July 2013 - taking a case to an employment tribunal had previously been free. At the time one of the reasons it gave was that fees could: \\"disincentivise unreasonable behaviour, like pursuing weak or vexatious claims\\". Weak claims are presumably ones that are less likely to be successful, while strong ones would be more likely to be successful. The Labour manifesto said the party would \\"reverse the unfair employment tribunal fees which literally price people out of justice\\". There was no mention of employment tribunals in the Conservative or UKIP manifestos. Employment tribunals are devolved - we'll start with the situation in England and Wales. Individual claimants now have to pay a claim fee of £160 or £250 depending on the type of case and a further £230 or £950 if the case goes to a hearing. There is means-tested help available with paying tribunal fees. If you win the case then your employer might be forced to pay your tribunal fees but that is not automatic. After the fees were introduced the average number of total cases fell from about 5,000 a month to about 1,500 a month. The government had a review earlier this year to look at the impact of charging fees. It concluded that the introduction of fees had been successful in the sense that it had raised £8.5m to £9m a year and encouraged people to use free mediation services, but it also said that: \\"The fall in claims has been significantly greater than was estimated when fees were first introduced.\\" As a result, the government is consulting on whether changes are needed to the Help with Fees scheme to make it easier for people on lower incomes to get their fees paid. Brian Doyle, president of employment tribunals in England & Wales said in his submission to the review: \\"We do not consider that there has been a reduction in weak or unmeritorious claims. Had that been the case we would have expected the percentage of successful claims to have risen, whereas in fact it has declined slightly.\\" Statistics presented as part of the review show that the proportion of successful claims fell from an average of 15.3% in the nine months before the introduction of charging (62.6% were withdrawn before a hearing) to an average of 12.6% since then (with 59.0% being withdrawn). \\"Cases are being upheld in the same proportions as ever - there are just fewer winners and fewer losers,\\" Gareth Brahams from Brahams Dutt Badrick French, who is chair of the Employment Lawyers Association told BBC News. In Scotland, fees are also charged for employment tribunals. The Scottish National Party has promised to abolish them but has not yet done so. It gained the power to do so as part of last year's Scotland Act. The SNP has also pledged to abolish the fees as part of its Westminster campaign, which means it wants to see them abolished in England and Wales as well. It is also consulting on proposals to move some of its functions to the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland, which brings together a number of other legal functions, although there has been some opposition to this.

They became a transitional group between early hard rock and heavy metal and the new wave of British heavy metal. The band's current lineup includes vocalist Phil Mogg, lead guitarist Vinnie Moore, bass guitarist Rob De Luca, keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Paul Raymond and drummer Andy Parker. They have gone through several line-up changes, leaving Mogg as the only constant member, and had two hiatuses (1983-1984 and again from 1989 to 1991). Tensions had begun to grow between Mogg and Schenker in the late 1970s, possibly from Schenker often leaving before or during shows. Soon after UFO's show in Palo Alto, California on 29 October 1978, Schenker left the band. He made a brief return to the Scorpions before going on to form his own Michael Schenker Group.  After Schenker's exit, UFO rehired Paul \\"Tonka\\" Chapman on guitar who brought over unused track ideas from Lone Star's drummer Dixie Lee. Shortly after, they released their next LP, No Place to Run in January, 1980. Produced by former Beatles producer George Martin, No Place To Run failed to match up to the success of its predecessors, though it fractionally missed the UK Top 10. Paul Raymond left the band at the end of the No Place To Run tour and was replaced by John Sloman from Uriah Heep for a couple of months and then by former Wild Horses guitarist and keyboardist Neil Carter, who helped fill the void in the songwriting left by Schenker's departure. Carter debuted with UFO on stage at the three-day Reading Festival on 23 August 1980, when the band played as the Saturday night headline act. At the beginning of the following year, UFO released the self-produced The Wild, the Willing and the Innocent, which had a lighter pop rock sound, which was popular at the time. The album achieved mild success in the UK, reaching the UK Top 20, and the single \\"Lonely Heart\\" was released.  In February 1982 the band released Mechanix. It was very successful in the UK, where it reached No.8, the band's highest ever placing. Later that year, founding member Pete Way left the band to form Fastway with Motorhead guitarist \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke and then his own band, Waysted. He was replaced by Talas bassist, Billy Sheehan. UFO released Making Contact in 1983, but the album was a critical and commercial failure. Thus, that March, UFO decided to disband. The band played a UK farewell tour with Paul Gray (ex Eddie and the Hot Rods and The Damned bassist). However, there was a hint that this might not be permanent, when UFO released a compilation album featuring songs by UFO (as well as other groups featuring ex-members of UFO) entitled Headstone, the sleeve of which showed a headstone, denoting UFO with their formation date but an incomplete end date.  This proved to be a short hiatus as, just short of two years later, in late 1984, Mogg assembled a new UFO line-up, featuring Paul Gray on bass again, ex-Diamond Head drummer Robbie France (replaced in 1985 by former Magnum drummer Jim Simpson), and Atomik Tommy M (Tommy McClendon), a former roadie who also wrote lyrics for Loudness, on guitar, with Paul Raymond rejoining shortly after and released Misdemeanor. This was followed by the 1988 EP Ain't Misbehavin. Despite the renewed activity of the band, neither release was financially successful and they officially disbanded again in 1989 after a string of guitarists replacing McClendon: Myke Gray of Jagged Edge in late 1987, in 1988 former Legs Diamond guitarist Rik Sanford and Tony Glidewell, while Pete Way rejoined on bass, and finally in 1989 future Cold Sweat guitarist Erik Gamans.

Two game companies, Antenna Research and Cortical Systematics, compete against each other. In addition, a group of \\"realists\\" fights both companies to prevent the \\"deforming\\" of reality. Antenna Research's Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the world's preeminent game designer, is testing her latest virtual reality game, eXistenZ, with a focus group at a seminar. She is shot in the shoulder by an assassin named Noel Dichter (Kris Lemche) with an organic pistol, which is undetectable by security. As Dichter is gunned down by the security team, security guard (and marketing trainee) Ted Pikul (Jude Law) rushes to Geller and escorts her outside. Allegra discovers that her pod, which contains the only copy of the eXistenZ game, may have been damaged due to an \\"UmbyCord\\" being ripped out as the game was being downloaded. To test it, she must plug into the game in tandem with another player she can trust, and talks a reluctant Pikul into installing a bio-port in his own body so he can play the game with her. Pikul, one of a dwindling few who has refused to have a bio-port installed to this point, at first objects due to a phobia about \\"surgical penetration\\", but eventually gives in. They head to a gas station run by a black-marketeer named Gas (Willem Dafoe) to get it installed. Gas deliberately installs a faulty bio-port and the game pod is damaged. Gas (a shotgun in hand) reveals that he is going to kill Allegra for the bounty on her head, but Pikul shoots him with the rivet gun used to install the port. The pair make their way to a former ski lodge used by Allegra's mentor, Kiri Vinokur (Ian Holm). He and his assistant repair the damaged pod and give Pikul a new bio-port.

Options: 1). semi truck 2). Tesla Model S 3). Ford Explorer 4). Toyota Tundra The answer is:","output":"The Tesla Model S would make less pollution among the given options.  Here's a detailed analysis of each vehicle's environmental impact: 1). Semi-truck: Semi-trucks usually run on diesel fuel, which emits various pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2). In addition, the large engines used in these trucks consume more fuel, leading to higher emissions. Therefore, semi-trucks contribute significantly to air pollution and have a considerable environmental impact. 2). Tesla Model S: The Tesla Model S is an electric vehicle powered by an electric motor, which uses electricity stored in rechargeable batteries. Since electric vehicles (EVs) do not have internal combustion engines, they do not emit tailpipe pollutants. Electricity, as stated in the fact, causes less pollution than gasoline. While the production of electricity may generate some pollution, its overall environmental impact is still lower than that of gasoline. Furthermore, as more renewable energy sources are used to produce electricity, the carbon footprint of EVs will keep decreasing. 3). Ford Explorer: The Ford Explorer is a gasoline-powered vehicle, which means it has an internal combustion engine with emissions including CO2, NOx, and other pollutants. Gasoline vehicles emit considerable greenhouse gases and pollutants that contribute to air pollution and climate change. Consequently, the Ford Explorer has a higher environmental impact when compared to electric vehicles like the Tesla Model S. 4). Toyota Tundra: The Toyota Tundra is a large pickup truck with an internal combustion engine powered by gasoline or, in some models, flex-fuel (a blend of gasoline and ethanol). Vehicles of this type usually have lower fuel efficiency, which means they consume more fuel and produce more emissions per mile than smaller, more efficient vehicles.

First, we have a math problem that looks like this: -4297 * a + 1491 = -4794 * a Our mission is to find out what \\"a\\" is. So, let's follow these steps: 1. Let's keep the parts with \\"a\\" together. To do that, we're going to take -4297 * a and add 4794 * a to both sides of the problem. Here's what it looks like: -4297 * a + 4794 * a + 1491 = -4794 * a + 4794 * a 2. Now, let's add the two parts with \\"a\\" together on the left side.  (-4297 + 4794) * a + 1491 = 0 * a 3. Next, let's find out how much is -4297 + 4794: 497 * a + 1491 = 0 4. Now, we're going to move that 1491 to the other side of the problem to get closer to finding \\"a\\". To do that, we'll subtract 1491 from both sides, like this: 497 * a + 1491 - 1491 = 0 - 1491 5. The left side becomes: 497 * a = -1491 6. The last step is to find what \\"a\\" is. To do that, we'll divide both sides by 497: (497 * a) / 497 = -1491 / 497 7. When we divide, we'll find out what \\"a\\" is: a = -3 And there you go! Our answer is a = -3.

The 1980 Bank Robbery in Central Nyack that was medically managed at the Nyack Hospital where I responded to the ONLY Code 66 of my career. That “66”indicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage. Private doctors reported to help; many are not trained or current in emergency medicine; much is left to critical care nurses in a community hospital that is not a teaching institution with residents and interns on staff.

They tried all to like John.","output":"By the strictest standards, the sentence \\"They tried all to like John\\" would not be considered correct by a linguist for a variety of reasons. Language is based on a system of rules known as grammar, morphology, syntax, and semantics. Each component contributes to the construction of well-formed sentences that convey clear meanings. Let us look at the issues present in the given sentence and provide a corrected version. 1. Syntax issues: Syntax is the study of the arrangement of words and phrases to create coherent sentences in a language. The given sentence has incorrect word order, leading to confusion about its intended meaning. Corrected version: \\"They all tried to like John.\\" In the corrected version, the word \\"all\\" is placed before the verb \\"tried\\" to modify the noun \\"they,\\" which clarifies the subject of the action. 2. Semantics issues: Semantics is the study of meaning in language. In the given sentence, it is unclear whether \\"all\\" refers to a group of people's collective effort to like John or a single individual trying with their entire being to like John. Corrected version: \\"They all tried to like John.\\" The semantics issue is resolved in the corrected version, as \\"all\\" now clearly modifies \\"they,\\" indicating that each person in the group made an effort to like John. 3. Diction issues: Diction refers to word choice and the way words are used in speech and writing. In the given sentence, \\"all\\" is not the best word to convey the intended meaning. Alternate versions: - \\"Everyone tried to like John.\\" - \\"Each of them tried to like John.\\" These alternate versions improve diction by using \\"everyone\\" or \\"each of them\\" to describe the group's effort more explicitly. In conclusion, the given sentence would not be considered correct by a linguist, mainly due to syntax and semantics issues. By reordering the words and carefully selecting the appropriate diction, the sentence can be corrected to effectively convey the intended meaning. The corrected version of the sentence is \\"They all tried to like John,\\" with alternate versions being \\"Everyone tried to like John\\" or \\"Each of them tried to like John.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If all else was the same, the wire that Ron had more resistance or less resistance.?    Assuming that:  Longer wires have more resistance than shorter wires. The answer to this question is:","output":"Based on the assumption that longer wires have more resistance than shorter wires, the wire that Ron ran would have more resistance than the wire that Chris ran. Let's look deeper into the concept of resistance and the factors that influence it to better understand the situation. Resistance (R) is a property of a material that opposes the flow of electric current. It depends on several factors, including the length (L) of the wire, the cross-sectional area (A) of the wire, and the resistivity (ρ) of the material it is made of. The relationship between these factors can be expressed using the formula: R = (ρ * L) / A In this case, the length of Chris's wire is 3 feet and the length of Ron's wire is 10 feet. Since all else is the same (the resistivity and cross-sectional area of the wires are equal), we can compare their resistances directly using their lengths: R_Chris = (ρ * 3) / A R_Ron = (ρ * 10) / A  Since ρ and A are the same for both wires, we can relate their resistances directly as: R_Ron = (10 / 3) * R_Chris Because 10 is greater than 3, this equation tells us that: R_Ron > R_Chris In other words, the wire that Ron had (10-foot long) has more resistance than the wire that Chris had (3-foot long). It is important to note that this conclusion is based on the assumption that longer wires have more resistance than shorter wires, and other factors such as resistivity and cross-sectional area remain consistent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She has just completed writing her first play to mark her brother's homecoming and plans to stage it later that day with her visiting cousins. Looking out of her bedroom window, she spies on her older sister, Cecilia, and the housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner, on whom Briony has a crush. Cecilia is undressing and dips into the fountain pool; a moment later, she climbs out, her undergarments wet, all while Robbie watches. Cecilia had gone to the pond to fill a vase, Robbie grabbed one of the handles, and it broke. A part fell into the pond, and Cecilia jumped in to retrieve it, but to Briony, it looked as if Robbie had ordered Cecilia to undress and go under the water. Robbie drafts a series of notes to Cecilia apologizing for the incident, namely breaking the vase and laughing about it. One contains an explicit expression of his sexual desire for her, including frequent and crude usage of the word \\"cunt\\": he writes it only as a joke, and it makes him laugh to himself. He writes another, more formal letter, and asks Briony to deliver it. Only after she has gone does he realise he has given her the explicit letter. Briony reads the letter before giving it to Cecilia. Later, she describes it to her older visiting cousin, Lola, who calls Robbie a \\"sex maniac\\". Paul Marshall, a visiting friend of Briony's older brother's and a chocolate magnate, introduces himself to the visiting cousins and appears to be attracted to Lola.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize: Your doctor will try available medications to control your arrhythmia before resorting to an invasive therapy option or inserting a rhythm-stabilizing device. If your arrhythmia doesn’t respond to medication, the medications produce too many side effects, or your doctor determines that you’re at risk for serious complications that require more than medication, then they will discuss your options. Which option is right for you will depend on your medical history and type of arrhythmia. If none of the anti-arrhythmic medications have effectively controlled your arrhythmia, then you may be a candidate for electrical cardioversion. Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are the most common forms of arrhythmia that respond to electrical cardioversion. The procedure involves delivering a small electrical signal to your heart to stabilize the rhythm. An electrophysiologist can use catheter ablation to correct a variety of arrhythmias, including AFib, atrial flutter, and ventricular tachycardia, which is potentially life threatening. For this procedure, your doctor will insert a small catheter into your heart and deliver high-frequency currents to the tissue causing the arrhythmia. This essentially “disconnects” the faulty pathway, resulting in a normal heartbeat.  Because this procedure is more invasive than electrical cardioversion, your doctor may try the latter option first, followed by ablation if necessary. This is a short procedure (two to four hours), and you can typically resume normal activities within a few days with a low risk of any complication. If your arrhythmia causes your heart to beat too slowly, then your doctor will likely discuss the option of a pacemaker. Unfortunately, no medications are available to treat a slow heart rate (bradycardia). A pacemaker includes a very small set of wires that measure the electrical activity in your heart. They connect to a small pulse generator that delivers a signal to normalize your heart’s rate whenever it detects an abnormality.  Though it sounds very invasive, the procedure is considered very safe and requires only one night in a hospital while the team monitors your heart rate and rhythm to ensure proper functioning of the device.  Because of their ability to interfere with your pacemaker, you should avoid strong magnetic fields and power-generating equipment (getting an MRI or using arc welding equipment, for instance). You should also avoid storing an electronic device such as your cell phone in your chest pocket next to your pacemaker. An ICD is similar to a pacemaker (leads inserted into the heart connected to a pulse generator), but they are used to treat a wider range of arrhythmias, especially ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, both of which can be life threatening.  Before you consider an ICD, your arrhythmia must be life-threatening and originate from an uncorrectable cause such as: acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), myocardial ischemia (inadequate blood flow to the heart muscle), or electrolyte imbalance and drug toxicity. If you choose an ICD, you can maintain a normal lifestyle, including taking part in sports and exercise. Your ICD may need to get checked several times a year, although their batteries last between five and seven years. To help protect the ICD’s pulse generator, you will need to avoid large magnetic fields and energy-generating equipment (such as MRIs and arc welding equipment, for example). You should also avoid placing your cell phone or headphones within six inches of the device. If nothing else has controlled your atrial fibrillation, then your doctor may discuss the option of a heart Maze procedure, which can be minimally invasive cardiac surgery or is an open heart surgery. In the surgery, the doctor creates small cuts that are stitched together and scar tissue forms, which interferes with abnormal impulses.","output":"Your doctor will first attempt to control your arrhythmia using medications before considering invasive therapy or inserting a rhythm-stabilizing device.

Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome. I still feel for her. I wish I had contact information, so I could touch base, and express those thoughts personally. But that's the most personally resonant version of false advertising affecting someone that I've seen. Question: What is probably true about R? Answer: Answer:","output":"It is probably true that R was initially naive about false advertising and believed in the claims made by the \\"miracle cure\\" company.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the platform conspiracy theorists argue is a mobile version of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program?  Ford Island continues to be used by the US Navy. It hosts the 34,000-square-foot (3,200 m2) Pacific Warfighting Center for exercises, training and battle simulations. The Admiral Clarey Bridge enabled the Navy to develop a 331 million Pacific tsunami warning center named after Senator Daniel Inouye, replacing the aging facility on ʻEwa Beach. The center's location is controversial because of its location in a tsunami-vulnerable area and the Navy's tsunami-evacuation plan calls for the island's only access point—the Admiral Clarey Bridge—to be opened for ship evacuation (making the bridge inaccessible to land vehicles). The island also continues to host a military brig.Nominally based in Alaska, the Sea-based X-band Radar (SBX-1) arrived on Ford Island in 2006 for maintenance and repairs and has returned several times since. Primarily used as a warhead-detection radar system on a self-propelled floating platform in the Pacific, its presence on the island has been controversial. The platform, with a cost reaching nearly 1,000,000,000, has never actually made it to Alaska and conspiracy theorists argue that the platform is a mobile version of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program.In 2013, the Navy unveiled a 4-million training facility, using simulators and virtual reality, at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport on Ford Island. The Fleet Integrated Synthetic Training/Testing Facility (FIST2FAC) was developed to save on training costs with a reusable facility which could emulate electronic, mine and anti-air warfare scenarios instead of real-world training requiring fuel, logistics and deployment costs for ships.

Abstract: In an effort to determine whether life in industrialized societies can have an effect on hearing, 90 natives from Easter Island over 45 years old were evaluated. They underwent complete clinical and audiological assessment and were divided into groups according to those having lived only on the island or those having lived in modern civilization. With all factors being equal, except exposure to modern civilization, our results showed that living in civilized societies has a significant negative effect on hearing; the severity is directly proportional to the years of exposure. The median hearing thresholds of natives always living on the island (men and women combined) was found to be similar to those of female citizens of the United States; there was no significant difference in hearing thresholds between men and women among these natives. These results suggest that there are no significant inherent racial differences nor significant inherent differences between males and females in the sensitivity of hearing. A relationship between aging and hearing was noted and interpreted as true or intrinsic presbycusis. There were no cases of otosclerosis, Meniere's disease, or exostoses of the external ear canal among natives who had always lived on the island. Pure natives were found not to be prone to otitis media in spite of having an extremely high incidence of severe upper respiratory tract allergies.

Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What happened when there was a forced coupling of children? Context: The Greek kingdom of Bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the Seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control. Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus. The answer is:","output":"The answer to the question \\"What happened when there was a forced coupling of children?\\" isn't clearly written in the context provided.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a smaller vessel is used happens, how will it affect FASTER boiling.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of using a smaller vessel does have an effect on the process, both directly and indirectly, leading to faster boiling of the water in certain conditions.  In general, the boiling process depends on various factors such as the size of the vessel, water volume, heat transfer rate, stove efficiency, and surface area of the vessel in contact with the heat source. When a smaller vessel is used, several factors contribute to the faster boiling of water: 1. Direct Effect: A smaller vessel typically has a smaller volume capacity, meaning it would hold a lesser amount of water compared to a larger vessel. Keeping the heat source power constant, the energy required to raise the temperature of a smaller volume of water is less than that for a larger volume, making the water in the smaller vessel heat up and boil faster. This is due to the direct relationship between heat applied, mass of the water, and temperature change, as represented by the formula Q = mcΔT, where Q is the heat applied, m is the mass of the water, c is the specific heat capacity of water, and ΔT is the change in temperature. 2. Increased Heat Transfer Rate: Depending on the material the smaller vessel is made of, it may conduct heat more efficiently, allowing the water to receive more heat energy in a shorter period and, thus, boil faster. Thinner walls can also lead to improved heat transfer rates. 3. Increased Surface Area to Volume Ratio: A smaller vessel usually has a higher surface area to volume ratio, enabling the heat to be more evenly distributed across the water surface. The increased surface area in contact with the heat source can allow a more uniform and efficient transfer of energy, leading to faster boiling.  4. Indirect Effect: The process of observing small bubbles and waiting until the water starts to bubble a lot is affected when using a smaller vessel. As the water heats up faster, these visual cues will appear more quickly, and the user will progress through the process steps more rapidly. It is essential to note that these effects are heavily influenced by other factors like the vessel's shape and material, the heat source intensity, and the specific conditions in which the boiling takes place. In some cases, the difference in boiling time may not be significant if other conditions are unfavorable. Nevertheless, the use of a smaller vessel can lead to faster boiling of water due to the direct and indirect effects that it introduces to the boiling process."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - Piracetam (sold under many brand names) is a nootropic drug in the racetams group, with chemical name \\"2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide\\". It shares the same 2-oxo-pyrrolidone base structure with pyroglutamic acid. Piracetam is a cyclic derivative of GABA (gamma-Aminobutyric acid). Presently piracetam is used in many European countries, Asia and South America. In the United States, it is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for any medical use and it is not permitted to be sold as a dietary supplement. In the UK, piracetam is prescribed mainly for myoclonus, but is used off-label for other conditions. Evidence to support its use for many conditions is unclear.  - Levetiracetam, marketed under the trade name Keppra among others, is a medication used to treat epilepsy. It is used for partial onset, myoclonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It is the S-enantiomer of etiracetam.  - Phenylpiracetam (INN: fonturacetam, brand names Phenotropil, Carphedon), also called is a phenylated analog of the drug piracetam which was developed in 1983 in Russia where it is available as a prescription drug. Research on animals has indicated that phenylpiracetam may have anti-amnesic, antidepressant, anticonvulsant, antipsychotic, anxiolytic, and memory enhancement effects.  - Anticonvulsants (also commonly known as antiepileptic drugs or as antiseizure drugs) are a diverse group of pharmacological agents used in the treatment of epileptic seizures. Anticonvulsants are also increasingly being used in the treatment of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder, since many seem to act as mood stabilizers, and for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Anticonvulsants suppress the rapid and excessive firing of neurons during seizures. Anticonvulsants also prevent the spread of the seizure within the brain. Some investigators have observed that anticonvulsants themselves may cause reduced IQ in children. However these adverse effects must be balanced against the significant risk epileptic seizures pose to children and the distinct possibility of death and devastating neurological sequelae secondary to seizures. Anticonvulsants are more accurately called antiepileptic drugs (abbreviated \\"AEDs\\"), and are often referred to as antiseizure drugs because they provide symptomatic treatment only and have not been demonstrated to alter the course of epilepsy.  - Etiracetam is a chemical compound belonging to the racetam family, which was developed as a nootropic drug. It is racemic; its biologically active enantiomeric form is levetiracetam, now marketed as an antiepileptic drug.  - Stimulants (also referred to as psychostimulants) is an overarching term that covers many drugs including those that increase activity of the body, drugs that are pleasurable and invigorating, or drugs that have sympathomimetic effects. Due to their rendering a characteristic \\"up\\" feeling, stimulants are also occasionally referred to as \\"uppers\\". Depressants or \\"downers\\", which decrease mental and/or physical function, are in stark contrast to stimulants and are considered to be the functionally opposite drug class. Stimulants are widely used throughout the world as prescription medicines as well as without a prescription (either legally or illicitly) as performance-enhancing or recreational drugs. The most frequently prescribed stimulants as of 2013 were lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, and amphetamine. It is estimated that the percent of the population that has abused amphetamines, cocaine and MDMA combined is between .8% and 2.1%.  - Motivation is a theoretical construct used to explain behaviour. It gives the reasons for people's actions, desires, and needs. Motivation can also be defined as one's direction to behavior, or what causes a person to want to repeat a behavior and vice versa. A motive is what prompts the person to act in a certain way, or at least develop an inclination for specific behavior. According to Maehr and Meyer, \\"Motivation is a word that is part of the popular culture as few other psychological concepts are.\\"  - Nootropicsalso called smart drugs or cognitive enhancersare drugs, supplements, or other substances that improve cognitive function, particularly executive functions, memory, creativity, or motivation, in healthy individuals. The use of cognition-enhancing drugs by healthy individuals in the absence of a medical indication is one of the most debated topics among neuroscientists, psychiatrists, and physicians which spans a number of issues, including the ethics and fairness of their use, concerns over adverse effects, and the diversion of prescription drugs for nonmedical uses, among others. Nonetheless, the international sales of cognition-enhancing supplements exceeded billion in 2015 and the global demand for these compounds is still growing rapidly.  - In medicine, an adverse effect is an undesired harmful effect resulting from a medication or other intervention such as surgery.  - Epilepsy is a group of neurological diseases characterized by epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking. These episodes can result in physical injuries including occasionally broken bones. In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur, and have no immediate underlying cause. Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy. People with epilepsy in some areas of the world experience stigma due to the condition. The cause of most cases of epilepsy is unknown, although some people develop epilepsy as the result of brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, infections of the brain, and birth defects. Known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases. Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal nerve cell activity in the cortex of the brain. The diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms such as fainting and determining if another cause of seizures is present such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems. This may be partly done by imaging the brain and performing blood tests. Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an electroencephalogram (EEG), but a normal test does not rule out the condition. Epilepsy that occurs as a result of other issues may be preventable. Seizures are controllable with medication in about 70% of cases. Inexpensive options are often available. In those whose seizures do not respond to medication, then surgery, neurostimulation, or dietary changes may be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed. As of 2013 about 22 million people have epilepsy. Nearly 80% of cases occur in the developing world. In 2013 it resulted in 116,000 deaths up from 112,000 deaths in 1990. Epilepsy is more common in older people. In the developed world, onset of new cases occurs most frequently in babies and the...  - A drug is any substance (other than food that provides nutritional support) that, when inhaled, injected, smoked, consumed, absorbed via a patch on the skin, or dissolved under the tongue, causes a physiological change in the body.  - Oxiracetam (ISF 2522) is a nootropic drug of the racetam family and very mild stimulant. Several studies suggest that the substance is safe even when high doses are consumed for a long period of time. However, the mechanism of action of the racetam drug family is still a matter of research. Oxiracetam is not approved by Food and Drug Administration for any medical use in the United States.  - Executive functions (collectively referred to as executive function and cognitive control) are a set of cognitive processes  including attentional control, inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility, as well as reasoning, problem solving, and planning  that are necessary for the cognitive control of behavior: selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions gradually develop and change across the lifespan of an individual and can be improved at any time over the course of a person's life. Similarly, these cognitive processes can be adversely affected by a variety of events which affect an individual. Neuropsychological tests are used to measure executive functions, and are usually performed as part of a more comprehensive assessment to diagnose neurological and psychiatric disorders.  - Racetams are a class of drugs that share a pyrrolidone nucleus. Some, such as piracetam, are considered nootropics. Some such as oxiracetam and phenylpiracetam are also stimulants. Others such as levetiracetam and seletracetam are anticonvulsants.  - Etiracetam is a nootropic drug of the racetam family . It is racemic ; its biologically active enantiomeric form is levetiracetam .  - Seletracetam (UCB 44212) is a pyrrolidone-derived drug of the racetam family that is structurally related to levetiracetam (trade name Keppra). It was under development by UCB Pharmaceuticals as a more potent and effective anticonvulsant drug to replace levetiracetam but its production has been halted.  - In chemistry, an enantiomer, also known as an optical isomer, is one of two stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other that are non-superposable (not identical), much as one's left and right hands are the same except for being reversed along one axis (the hands cannot be made to appear identical simply by reorientation). Organic compounds that contain a chiral carbon atom usually have two non-superposable structures. These two structures are mirror images of each other and are, thus, commonly called enantiomorphs (\\"enantio\\" = opposite ; \\"morph\\" = form), hence this structural property is now commonly referred to as enantiomerism.    What entity does 'etiracetam' has the relation 'instance of' with?","output":"Etiracetam has the relation 'instance of' with the entity \\"chemical compound\\" and belongs to the racetam family of drugs. It is a nootropic drug and its biologically active enantiomeric form is levetiracetam."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In Britain, further experiments in the genre boosted its appeal. House and rave clubs such as Lakota and Cream emerged across Britain, hosting house and dance scene events. The 'chilling out' concept developed in Britain with ambient house albums such as The KLF's Chill Out and Analogue Bubblebath by Aphex Twin. The Godskitchen superclub brand also began in the midst of the early 90's rave scene. After initially hosting small nights in Cambridge and Northampton, the associated events scaled up in Milton Keynes, Birmingham and Leeds. A new indie dance scene also emerged in the 90's. In New York, bands such as Deee-Lite furthered house's international influence. Two distinctive tracks from this era were the Orb's \\"Little Fluffy Clouds\\" (with a distinctive vocal sample from Rickie Lee Jones) and the Happy Mondays' \\"Wrote for Luck\\" (\\"WFL\\") which was transformed into a dance hit by Vince Clarke. The late Robert Miles also produced house tracks such as \\"One and One\\" with Maria Nayler, \\"Fable\\" and his biggest hit, \\"Children\\". In England, one of the few licensed venues was The Eclipse, which attracted people from up and down the country as it was open until the early hours. Due to the lack of licensed, legal dance event venues, house music promoters began organising illegal events in unused warehouses, aeroplane hangars and in the countryside. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 was a government attempt to ban large rave dance events featuring music with \\"repetitive beats\\", due to law enforcement allegations that these events were associated with illegal club drugs. There were a number of \\"Kill the Bill\\" demonstrations by rave and electronic dance music fans. The Spiral Tribe dance event at Castle Morten was the last of these illegal raves, as the bill, which became law, in November 1994, made unauthorised house music dance events illegal in the UK.

In 1996, Jindal was appointed secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals and in 1999, at age 28, he was appointed as the youngest president in the history of the University of Louisiana System. In 2001, President George W. Bush appointed Jindal as principal adviser to the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. He first ran for governor of Louisiana in 2003, but lost in the run-off election to Democratic candidate, Kathleen Blanco. Jindal had been mentioned as a potential candidate for the 2012 presidential election. On December 10, 2008, Jindal indicated that he would likely not run for president in 2012, saying he will focus on his re-election in 2011 and that this would make transitioning to a national campaign difficult, though he did not rule out a possible 2012 presidential bid. Speculation increased when Republicans chose Jindal to deliver the response to President Obama's first address to a joint session of Congress.  The Jindal for President Draft Council Inc. PAC was formed in 2009 to raise funds for a future presidential run. Jindal has stated that he has no involvement with the PAC.  In April 2010, while speaking at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference, Jindal ruled out running for the Republican nomination for President in 2012.  In 2012, Jindal traveled across the country in support of the Mitt Romney-Paul Ryan ticket. Because Louisiana and other Deep South states voted heavily for the GOP, Jindal could hence devote his campaign time elsewhere. In August 2012, Politico reported that \\"Bobby Jindal would be considered [for] and would likely take\\" appointment as United States Secretary of Health and Human Services in a potential Romney cabinet.  After the defeat of Romney-Ryan, Jindal called for his party to return to \\"the basics... If we want people to like us, we have to like them first,\\" he said on the interview program Fox News Sunday. As the incoming president of the Republican Governors Association, which had thirty members in 2013, Jindal questioned Romney for having criticized President Obama as having provided \\"extraordinary financial gifts from the government\\". In reply to Romney, Jindal said, \\"You don't start to like people by insulting them and saying their votes were bought.\\" Jindal said that his party must convince a majority of voters that it supports the middle class and the principle of upward mobility. He also criticized what he termed \\"stupid\\" remarks regarding rape and conception made in 2012 by defeated Republican U.S. Senate nominees Todd Akin in Missouri and Richard Mourdock in Indiana.","output":"This text is about Piyush \\"Bobby\\" Jindal, an American politician who served as the 55th Governor of Louisiana between 2008 and 2016.

(Associated Press)      The lucky trio did not immediately identify themselves, but they bought their tickets in the small working class town of Munford, Tennessee; in the quiet Los Angeles suburb of Chino Hills; and at a supermarket in affluent Melbourne Beach, on Florida's Space Coast.      They overcame odds of 1 in 292.2 million to land on all the numbers: 4-8-19-27-34 and Powerball 10. They can let their winnings be invested and thereby collect 30 annual payments totaling an estimated 533 million, or take their third of 983.5 million in cash all at once.      Getting such a windfall is the start of a \\"new journey\\" and the winners should be prepared with lawyers, accountants and financial planners before they come forward, California Lottery spokesman Russ Lopez said.      Too many lottery winners unaccustomed to sudden wealth have gone bankrupt, been victimized or experienced other losses because they were unprepared for an onslaught of unwanted attention, said Andrew Stoltmann, an Illinois attorney who has represented winners. He compared it to \\"throwing meat into a shark-infested ocean.\\"      But they shouldn't wait too long: California gives its top winners up to a year to contact lottery officials before the money automatically goes to schools. Winners in Tennessee and Florida must claim their winnings within 180 days of Wednesday night's drawing.      State and local taxes can eat up nearly half the winnings for many lottery players around the country, but these three could be even more lucky if they live in Florida or Tennessee, which have no state income tax, or California, which exempts winnings from lottery tickets bought in-state. They would still owe federal taxes, topping out at 39.6 percent.      The huge draw also produced eight 2 million Power Play winners and 73 1 million winners nationwide who matched all five white balls but missed the red Powerball, said Sally Lunsford of the Kansas Lottery.      The California ticket was sold at a 7-Eleven; the Florida ticket at a Publix supermarket and the Tennessee ticket at a family-owned grocery store, where the owner, Dana Naifeh, received a 25,000 check.      \\"I need to digest this,\\" said Naifeh, who plans to share some of her modest bounty with store employees.      Florida's store collects 100,000, and California's 1 million bonus will be shared between the Chino Hills store owner and the 7-Eleven company.      California Lottery spokesman Alex Traverso said officials there heard plenty of stories about possible jackpot winners, but no one had come forward to cash in the ticket as of late Thursday afternoon.      Munford auto body shop worker Jerry Caudle said he was \\"freaking out\\" when he heard a winning ticket was sold in his town, but then saw that he matched only two numbers and the Powerball, for a prize of 14. He wore a wistful smile as he left the Short Stop gas station and convenience store, where Tipton County's \\"best chicken on a stick\\" costs 3.69.      \\"It's been tough,\\" Caudle said. \\"The hardest winter for me here in 17 years.\\"      The California store and its surrounding strip mall suddenly became a popular gathering spot in the rural suburb of 78,000, where cows still graze on hillsides. Hundreds of people crowded into the 7-Eleven store, chanting \\"Chino Hills! Chino Hills!\\"      Store owner Balbir Atwal worked as an electronics salesman after immigrating from India in 1981, and bought his first 7-Eleven franchise at the age of 27. Now he owns four. He said he has sold winning tickets before, but never like this one.      \\"I was just joking, I said, this is the time someone's going to hit it,\\" laughed Atwal. He said he would share his part of the store's bonus with employees and family, and give some to charity.      Michael Fahim, 48, real estate broker from Chino Hills, said he bought 20 lottery tickets Wednesday night just up the street. \\"I'm happy it's in Chino Hills. I think it put us on the map — all over the world,\\" he said, adding that his brother called from Australia overnight to learn if he won.      Melbourne Beach's 3,100 residents live on a spit of beachfront no bigger than one-square mile. Unlike parts of the Space Coast dominated by high rises, the affluent town has large single-family homes on its beaches. Nobody emerged to claim their winnings, but excitement was palpable outside the Publix where the ticket was sold.      \\"The winner could be as close as your neighbors!\\" said Lisa Londini, a professional caregiver shopping at the market. \\"I wish it was me!\\"      Ticket sales and payouts had risen steadily as weeks came and went without a winner since Nov. 4, when the jackpot amount was reset at 40 million. In addition to three jackpot winners, more than 26 million other winning tickets will pay out total cash prizes of 273,869,373, Lunsford said.      For Wednesday night's drawing alone, Powerball sales totaled 1,270,206,274. People were buying 37,000 Powerball tickets a minute in California, where 386 million in Powerball tickets were sold since Nov. 4, the most of any state and more than California sold in the entire previous fiscal year, spokesman Russ Lopez said.      \\"You get a lot of new players with a large jackpot,\\" California Lottery Director Hugo Lopez said. \\"Our goal is to have a lot of people play a little bit.\\"      A big chunk of the profits go to schools, although not enough to solve all their budget problems, officials said.      Sales for this jackpot generated nearly 115 million since November for education in Florida, which uses the lottery to provide 6 percent of the education budget, Florida Lottery Secretary Tom Delacenserie said. California's share represents 154 million for its schools, Russ Lopez said — not enough \\"to get schools out of trouble.\\"      ___      Contributors include David Pitt and Scott McFetridge in Iowa City, Iowa.

The 62-year-old nurse was even identified by her employer, Park Avenue Health & Wellness Center in Pomona, California, who also may have fallen for the prank.      Shlomo Rechnitz, right, purchased Powerball tickets for all of his 15,000 employees for Wednesday night’s historic drawing. David Livingston / Getty Images ID: 7772707      The story spread quickly in local news broadcasts and social media, but it began to quickly unravel after details surrounding the ticket emerged.            One of the woman’s daughters told the New York Daily News that the ticket, and the picture, had in fact been part of a prank from one of her siblings.            California Lottery officials told BuzzFeed News they were skeptical about the win for a couple of reasons, including the fact that no one had come forward to claim the prize.            “No one from that group has come forward,” Alex Traverso, assistant deputy director of the California Lottery, told BuzzFeed News.      He said a picture of the supposed winning ticket also appeared to have been purchased at the wrong retailer.      “We checked out the ticket, and the retailers don’t check out,” he said.      Meet the Calif. nurse who won the big 1.6 billion Powerball jackpot and didn't quit her job https://t.co/EIho5hj0ZC — New York Daily News (@NYDailyNews) ID: 7772724      A spokesperson for Shlomo Rechnitz, who owns the health facility where the nurse is employed, told BuzzFeed News that he had bought Powerball tickets for each of his 15,000 employees in 80 health care facilities.      “I asked him what spurred him to commit this act of generosity,” Josh Nass, a spokesman for Rechnitz said. “He said people are looking for hope, and he was hoping to bring hope into his employees.”      Nass declined to identity the woman, but said she was a mother of seven.            She and her colleagues began to celebrate at the nursing home Wednesday night after the numbers were announced, Nass said, believing she was a big winner.      He told BuzzFeed News he and her employer had been unable to contact the woman after news spread she might have been the victim of a prank.      “If it is indeed the case that someone pulled a prank on her, that’s reprehensible,” Nass said.      At this point, Nass said it was unclear what happened.      “She’s a wonderful lady, and an incredible employee,” Nass said. “She stayed to finish her shift.”            The real winning ticket was purchased at a 7-Eleven in Chino Hills, California. A picture of the woman’s ticket, however, showed it came from a different store, Traverso said.      Two other jackpot winning tickets were purchased in Florida and Tennessee. None of the winners have been identified.      Traverso said it is also rare for winners to make any sort of public announcement before claiming the winnings with the California Lottery.      “They usually play it really close to the vest,” he told BuzzFeed News. “They don’t want people to know they’re big winners. My assumption is that it’s not a legitimate ticket.”             ||||| Revelers celebrate at 7-Eleven where 1.5 billion Powerball jackpot winning ticket sold https://t.co/lGimxMqT72 https://t.co/KJOXwJAU5O — ABC7 Eyewitness News (@ABC7) January 14, 2016      Sorry, your browser doesn't support Flash , needs a Flash update , or has Flash disabled.

The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a great film, and often regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. I never much paid attention to how the film was lit, but on examination I don’t know what I think of the lighting. Maybe i’m totally wrong, but the lighting seems quite obvious when you pay attention to it, which makes me thing it could have been done better? Certainly the lighting is masterfully done, in the way it properly exposes the characters faces and splashes off and around certain props and objects, adding a great deal of dimension to many of the shots. But it does look quite obvious, once you pay attention to it, especially when you can see multiple shadows coming from a single character. All that said, the lighting is still pretty masterful and I’m very intrigued to properly analyse it. The first shot of the scene has extremely beautiful (even though it is obvious 😉 ) lighting. As the cowboy stands in the hallway you can tell that there is a strong key light coming from the left of the frame, that will light his face once he steps out of the shadows. It seems like there is another light, maybe coming from high up near the roof, lighting the right hand side of the frame, near the back of the hallway. Most likely facing towards the character to light him from his right hand side, to seperate him from the background. The lighting setup of this shot is extremely beautiful the way it enhances the various pieces of wood and props within the frame, and how they’ve managed to keep the cowboy drenched in shadows as he sneaks around, even though there is quite a lot of light within the frame. It looks like they may have used a cutter to achieve that effect as its a very specific area, essentially just the top half of the cowboy thats drenched ins shadow. Theres also this curious black circular shadow which exists at the very top of the door near the cowboys head which permanently stays extremely dark, much darker than the rest of the shadows in the frame. I wonder how they achieved this effect? Maybe a...

Please briefly summarize this news article: COMICS SYNDICATES: As Universal editor changes titles, Trudeau, Watterson, Johnston, Thompson and Tatulli salute an influential figure SYNDICATION EXECUTIVES, by the nature of the beast, seldom gain wider acclaim in comics. They work offstage, undetected beyond the panels and unseen behind the balloons. As former senior vice president Lisa Klem Wilson underscored last year when United Media shuttered its doors, the focus is on the talent instead of the suits. Sometimes, however, a momentary exception must be made. Lee Salem, a four-decade figure at Universal Uclick, now deserves a little time in the center-spot. The Kansas City-based syndicate recently announced that Salem will move from the editorial side of the business, as the Universal Uclick president drops “Editor” from his title — as a baton is passed to capable hands and the talented John Glynn becomes Editorial Director. Since Salem joined Universal Press Syndicate in 1974, he has helped discover and/or nurture dozens of stellar strips, including Bill Watterson’s “Calvin and Hobbes,” Lynn Johnston’s “For Better or for Worse,” Richard Thompson’s “Cul de Sac” and Mark Tatulli’s “Lio” — as well as editing Garry Trudeau’s “Doonesbury,” which won a Pulitzer the year after Salem arrived. “In the strips Universal launched, the writing was paramount, and Lee had a great eye for lively writers and a real understanding of what makes a comic strip work,” Watterson tells Comic Riffs. LEE SALEM: After 38 years as part of Universal Uclick’s editorial department, the executive transitions from that side of the business. (CAVNA / The Washington Post ) . “Lee has a smart sense of humor and he understands good comic timing,” Johnston tells us. “He can be funny and fun to be with, but he can also be a tough opponent if need be.” And Trudeau tells Comic Riffs: “I’ve depended on Lee’s friendship, guidance, protection and occasional interventions for decades, and I have no intention of giving all that up.” As Salem eases into his transition with his usual wisdom and grace, Comic Riffs asked those five cartoonists to share their thoughts on his legend and legacy, his editorship and his friendship. “I’m in complete denial about his move. I’ve depended on Lee’s friendship, guidance, protection and occasional interventions for decades, and I have no intention of giving all that up. He’ll just have to keep making room for me in his schedule. This isn’t open to discussion.” I think a big part of Lee’s editorial legacy is in bringing to newspapers a new generation of cartoonists — including women — and introducing an entirely new range of subjects and voices to the comics page. In the strips Universal launched, the writing was paramount, and Lee had a great eye for lively writers and a real understanding of what makes a comic strip work. He always seemed to find strips with highly individualistic takes on the world, and a strong sense of voice. This has become more or less the standard model for newspaper comics now, but it was quite different from the plug-in-the-gag, committee-drawn strips of the ‘50s and ‘60s, and I think it brought the comics a new sharpness and relevance. Because I admired and respected so many of Universal’s strips, I completely trusted Lee’s judgment in editing my work: I never argued for a strip he questioned. Of course, his “New England reserve” took some getting used to. In the early days, I’d save a week’s mailing time by handing Lee a stack of roughs to edit whenever he swung through the area on a business trip. He’d read through a month of my cartoons in a few minutes, and he could have been reading obituaries for all the delight he radiated. I’d crawl under the couch and lie in a tight ball until he was back on the plane. You can imagine what it was like to negotiate a contract with him. But of course, that unflappable quality was a real virtue in the other part of his job, which was to step into a circle of furious readers and newspaper editors, and take all the bullets. Lee was a great defender of my work, and I’ll always be grateful for his long and vigorous support. I’ve really enjoyed having Lee as my editor all these years, and he’s been a great friend to cartooning. \\"Lee Salem changed my life. I always wanted to make comics professionally, and I had been trying for syndication for some time. But it wasn't something real until 1997, when I sent a bunch of “Heart of the City” sample strips to Lee through the mail and he called to offer me a development deal. And from then on my life changed. It was because Lee Salem, the first guy with real comic-strip power, said, “Yes.” When I first started to work with Universal Press, Lee Salem was my editor. He was the one who suggested the name “For Better or For Worse\\" for my comic strip, and I have to admit, it suited the work I did. For the first few months, he worked with me to develop something that had consistency and balance. He was an excellent editor. Writing funny stuff is a personal venture, so the editor who says, “Hey, that's not funny!” better be right ... and Lee usually was. Whenever I traveled to Kansas City, he'd come to the airport to meet me [in his car]. It was old and comfortable with evidence of kids and family still in the trunk and the door compartments. The syndicate was then headquartered on the second floor of a plain square building on Squibb Avenue. A dusty plastic jade plant was at the top of the stairs, which gave me comfort. There was a lack of pretense everywhere and a real sense of camaraderie among the staff. Lee's office was small and cramped, but orderly. He had a window with a view of the farmlands outside and a secretary who sometimes put her dresses on backwards. I was lucky enough to have been there when [co-founder] Jim Andrews was alive. In fact, I think it was Jim who went to bat for me when others might have asked me to wait until I had something worth consideration. My first impression of Lee was that he was competent, thoughtful, honest and fair. He still is! I was well out of my league with a daily comic strip, but his confidence and easygoing manner made the job so much easier. Lee has a smart sense of humor and he understands good comic timing. He can be funny and fun to be with, but he can also be a tough opponent if need be. We have disagreed, heartily at times, and yet we have never fought. ... I believe his impregnable stare and calm demeanor — when under duress — is kind of a gift. Managing cartoonists can't be easy. We are all so capable of devastating a weak superior with a withering remark or a hideous drawing that it's best, perhaps, to keep us guessing when the gloves are off! What I'm saying here is...we all appreciate authority when it comes with class. Lee is a class act and I'm grateful to have been one of “the cast.” Late in 2005, out of the blue, I got an e-mail from Lee Salem; his subject line was: “Syndication?” I’d been asking myself the same question since I was about 10 years old, and the answer had always been, “Maybe some other time.” But such is the reputation, sway and authority of Lee Salem that my immediate response was: “Sure!” In the seven years since that e-mail, Lee has gently guided me into a life-changing career in the noblest calling: newspaper comic strip cartoonist. He didn’t do it alone, of course — it’s taken a team of ace specialists to convince me I know what I’m doing. But Lee’s lower-case e-mails encouraged me like nothing else, and his dinnertime conviviality sure helped, too. I’m proud to cal him my editor and friend.” Summary:","output":"Lee Salem, a big helper at Universal Uclick, has been in the company for 40 years and is now changing his job. He used to help pick and take care of many popular comic strips in newspapers that people love, like \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\" and \\"For Better or For Worse.\\" People who make those comic strips are saying nice things about him and telling stories about how he has helped them along the way. They are grateful for his support and friendship and are happy to have worked with him."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. I can use this background: When a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, only the matter at the surface of the solid is exposed to other reactants. If a solid has more surface area, more of it is exposed and able to react. Therefore, increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate. Look at the hammer and nails pictured in the Figure below . Both are made of iron and will rust when the iron combines with oxygen in the air. However, the nails have a greater surface area, so they will rust faster.

Blunt-spoken and popular with military personnel, Kelly, 66, was born and raised in Boston. He initially enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1970, and was discharged from active duty as a sergeant in 1972. He returned to the Marine Corps after graduation from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 1976. Kelly rose through the ranks to serve as the commanding general of the Multi-National Force West in Iraq from February 2008 to February 2009, and as the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North in October 2009. He succeeded General Douglas Fraser as commander of U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) on Nov. 19, 2012. As the head of USSOUTHCOM, Kelly was in charge of the military jail at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and also was exposed to immigration, drug trafficking and other cross-border problems over a sprawling area that encompasses 32 countries in the Caribbean, Central America and South America.

Question: \\"Chen is?\\"  Context: \\"The original idea of a Chinese satellite navigation system was conceived by Chen Fangyun and his colleagues in the 1980s. According to the China National Space Administration, the development of the system would be carried out in three steps:\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"Chen Fangyun is a prominent Chinese scientist, engineer, and one of the pioneers in the Chinese satellite navigation system. With his remarkable vision, technical expertise, and leadership, Chen Fangyun played a crucial role in the conception and development of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), which has put China on the global stage in satellite navigation technology. During the 1980s, China recognized the growing importance of satellite navigation technology for both military and civilian applications. Relying on foreign systems such as GPS (United States) or GLONASS (Russia) raised concerns about national security and technological independence. To address these concerns, Chen Fangyun and his colleagues, leveraging their extensive knowledge in satellite systems and related fields, proposed the development of a homegrown Chinese satellite navigation system. Chen's plan was ambitious and consisted of a three-step development strategy to ensure the success of this monumental project. The China National Space Administration adopted this strategy, highlighting the importance of Chen Fangyun's contribution to the country's navigation satellite technology. Step 1: Experimental Satellite System In the first phase, a two-satellite experimental system was created, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of a comprehensive and operational satellite navigation system. By successfully launching two experimental satellites in 2000 and 2003, China demonstrated its capability to develop and deploy its own satellite navigation system. Step 2: Regional Satellite Navigation System The second phase focused on developing and deploying a regional satellite navigation system. This system would provide navigation, positioning, and timing services for the Chinese territory and the surrounding areas. Between 2009 and 2012, China successfully launched 10 more satellites, gradually extending the coverage of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System to the Asia-Pacific region. Step 3: Global Satellite Navigation System In the final phase, China aimed to expand the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System into a global network, offering seamless, worldwide navigation services. With the help of additional satellites, the system extended its coverage to other continents, ultimately resulting in a complete global constellation of BeiDou satellites. This ambitious goal was achieved in 2020, with the successful launch of the last BDS-3 satellite into orbit. Chen Fangyun's foresight and dedication to the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System have been instrumental in its conception, development, and successful deployment. Under his guidance, China successfully transitioned from relying on foreign satellite navigation systems to becoming a major player in the field. Today, the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System is one of the four major satellite navigation systems globally, alongside GPS (United States), GLONASS (Russia), and Galileo (European Union). This achievement is a testament to Chen Fangyun's outstanding engineering and leadership skills and his unquestionable legacy in the field of satellite navigation technology."},{"instruction":"Information:  - The Office of the First Minister was a portfolio within the Scottish Government .

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the first name of the person who calculated critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper? ?  At Birmingham, Oliphant's team had reached a different conclusion. Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, who could not work on Oliphant's radar project because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. Francis Perrin had calculated the critical mass of uranium to be about 40 tonnes (39 long tons; 44 short tons). He reckoned that if a neutron reflector were placed around it, this might be reduced to 12 tonnes (12 long tons; 13 short tons). Peierls attempted to simplify the problem by using the fast neutrons produced by fission, thus omitting consideration of moderator. He too calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper written in 1939 to be \\"of the order of tons\\".Peierls knew the importance of the size of the critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.Niels Bohr had theorised that the rare uranium-235 isotope, which makes up only about 0.7% of natural uranium, was primarily responsible for fission with fast neutrons, although this was not yet universally accepted. Frisch and Peierls were thus able to revise their initial estimate of critical mass needed for nuclear fission in uranium to be substantially less than previously assumed. They estimated a metallic sphere of uranium-235 with a radius of 2.1 centimetres (0.83 in) could suffice. This amount represented approximately 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235. These results led to the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the initial step in the development of the nuclear arms programme in Britain. This...

High speed cameras allow researchers to see things that they would normally miss, from the beating wings of a hummingbird to how a boat cuts through water. Now researchers in Japan have developed what they believe is the world’s fastest camera, which can take 4.4 trillion images a second. The device uses a new technique to take high-speed images so it can capture chemical reactions and heat conduction, which were impossible to photograph before. Researchers in Japan have developed what they believe is the world’s fastest camera, which can take 4.4 trillion images a second. The large machine contains a pulse source, temporal and spatial mapping devices and an image sensor (illustrated) to take high resolution photographs at the rate of 4.4 trillion frames a second. The new camera uses a technique called motion-based femtophotography to capture movement. It visually maps the movement of an object over time in a ‘burst stream’ of timed photographs organised in the correct sequence, to show an object’s ‘time varying spatial profile’. The device claims to be 1,000 times faster than the previous ‘fastest’ camera, while still being able to produce high resolution images. The previous fastest cameras used a ‘pump-probe process’ where light is pumped at the object being photographed and then ‘probed’ for absorption by a laser, in order to collect vital data used to construct an image. Up until now, the fastest cameras used a ‘pump-probe process’, where light is pumped at the object being photographed and then probed for absorption by a laser, in order to collect vital data used to construct an image, Phys.org reported. But this technique relies on repetitive measurements to construct an image. Instead, the new camera uses a technique called motion-based femtophotography to capture movement. The camera visually maps the movement of an object over time in a ‘burst stream’ of timed photographs organised in the correct sequence, to show an object’s ‘time varying spatial profile,’ according to the journal Nature Photonics. It was developed by scientists at the University of Tokyo and Keio University in Japan. The new camera will make it possible for scientists to capture chemical reactions and heat conduction that occurs at a sixth of the speed of light. One day it could also be used in medicine and to gain new insights into the manufacturing of computer chips (pictured) including their tiny semiconductors. The device claims to be 1,000 times faster than the previous ‘fastest’ camera. It has high pixel resolution of 450 x 450 pixels to provide scientists with a lot of detail about the object they are photographing. The new camera is called Sequentially Timed All-optical Mapping Photography (Stamp) and will be used to capture chemical reactions and heat conduction that occurs at a sixth of the speed of light. It has taken three years to develop and the next step is make the device smaller, as it measures around three square feet (one square metre). The experts who developed the machine believe it could one day be used in medicine and to gain new insights into the manufacturing of semiconductors, for example. The computer chip components are tiny and by looking at detailed images of the manufacturing process, experts might be able to spot opportunities to make efficiencies. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Researchers in Japan have created a super fast camera that can take 4.4 trillion pictures in just one second! This amazing camera is a thousand times faster than the previous fastest camera. It can help scientists see things that happen really, really quickly, like chemical reactions and heat conduction.

Hypothesis: Vacationers enjoy a day at the beach. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"If the premise is true, we know that there is a line of people carrying luggage on the side of the road; however, we cannot directly conclude that the hypothesis is true from this premise alone. The hypothesis suggests that these vacationers are enjoying a day at the beach. There are several factors to consider and additional information needed before making such a conclusion. 1. Location: The first thing to consider is the location of this line of people. Are they close to a beach, or are they in an area where access to a beach is not feasible? Knowing their location would provide more context to accurately determine if they are indeed heading to the beach. 2. Type of luggage: Analyzing the type of luggage being carried by the people can offer some clues as to the nature of their destination. If the luggage mainly consists of beach-related items such as beach umbrellas, towels, swimming suits, and sunscreen, it might be more likely that they are indeed going to the beach. Conversely, if the luggage predominantly contains non-beach related items, then the hypothesis may not hold true. 3. Season and weather: Considering the time of year and the current weather conditions can also help inform the hypothesis. If it is the summer season and the weather is warm and sunny, it might be more likely that people would head to the beach for leisure. However, if it is a cold and rainy day, it seems less plausible for vacationers to be enjoying a day at the beach. 4. Alternative explanations: Beyond assessing the location, luggage type, and weather conditions, it is essential to consider other possible explanations for the line of people carrying luggage on the side of the road. They could be waiting for a bus, a taxi, or some form of transportation for a different destination altogether. Alternatively, they could be a part of a guided tour or participating in an organized outdoor event, which requires them to carry luggage. 5.

Article: Weather has a strong effect  on people. It influences health, intelligence   and feelings. In August, it is very hot and wet in the southern part of the United States. People there easily have heart trouble and other kinds of health problems during this month. In the Northeast and the Middle West, it is hot at some times and very cold at other times. People in those states will have heart trouble after the weather changes in February or March. The weather can also influence intelligence. For example, in a 1983 study by scientists, the IQ scores of some college students were very high during storm, but after the storm, their scores were low. Storms can increase intelligence. Very hot weather, on the other hand, can decrease  it. Students in many schools of the United States often do badly in exams in the hot months of the year(July and August). Weather also has a strong effect on people's feeling. Winter may be a bad time for thin people. They usually feel cold during these months. They might feel depressed during cold weather. In hot summer weather, on the other hand, fat people may feel unhappy. At about 65F, people become stronger. Low air pressure  makes people feel free, but it also increases forgetful- ness. People leave more bags and umbrellas on buses and in stores on low pressure days. There is a\\"perfect weather\\"for work and health.

Given the question: Sheila split open and the air was filled with gumballs. Yellow gumballs. This was awful for Stan, just awful. He had loved Sheila for a long time, fought for her heart, believed in their love until finally she had come around. They were about to kiss for the first time and then this: yellow gumballs. Stan went to a group to try to accept that Sheila was gone. It was a group for people whose unrequited love had ended in some kind of surrealist moment. There is a group for everything in California. After several months of hard work on himself with the group, Stan was ready to open a shop and sell the thousands of yellow gumballs. He did this because he believed in capitalism, he loved capitalism. He loved the dynamic surge and crash of Amazon's stock price, he loved the great concrete malls spreading across America like blood staining through a handkerchief, he loved how everything could be tracked and mirrored in numbers. When he closed the store each night he would count the gumballs sold, and he would determine his gross revenue, his operating expenses, his operating margin; he would adjust his balance sheet and learn his debt to equity ratio; and after this exercise each night, Stan felt he understood himself and was at peace, and he could go home to his apartment and drink tea and sleep, without shooting himself or thinking about Sheila. On the night before the IPO of gumballs.com, Sheila came to Stan in a dream. She was standing in a kiddie pool; Stan and his brothers and sisters were running around splashing and screaming; she had managed to insert herself into a Super-8 home movie of Stan's family, shot in the late 70's.

She had a horrible aggressive cancer that ravaged her whole body and needed very regular doses of strong pain relief which - as she had a terminal illness and was receiving end of life care - did not have an upper limit so to speak. She had pain relief as and when needed to make her comfortable and that often results in people ultimately overdosing. Mum had Alzheimer's and was howling and writhing in agony so we were giving her pain relief but daughters knew it would probably result in her death - which they were right about possibly happening and in their grief and panic, started trying to prevent us from doing anything. Didn’t want us getting near her at all and we had to go through an awful scenario of trying to explain what we had to do for Mum and why and when they still wouldn’t have it or allow us near, we had to do what nobody wants and go against their wishes by administering the pain relief anyway. One daughter screamed the place down, threatened to have me arrested and struck off / said she would go to the papers and tell them about how we killed her Mum and in the end she had to be removed from the bedroom. Her Mum was given the pain relief, immediately relaxed and fell asleep then died peacefully in her sleep about 15 mins later.

Options: - carpark - hospital - building - garage - bus stop  The answer is \\"bus stop\\" because Answer:","output":"The answer is \\"bus stop\\" because a bus stop is the appropriate location for someone without a car who needs to get somewhere. A bus stop is a designated place where buses stop to pick up and drop off passengers. This allows the person to use public transportation to travel to their desired destination without needing their own car.  Other options mentioned are not suitable for this purpose: - Carpark: A carpark is a place where people park their cars, and since the person has no car, this option does not help them with transportation. - Hospital: A hospital is a location for medical care and treatment, and while one can potentially find transportation options there, it is not a primary transportation hub and does not serve all destinations. - Building: A building is a very generic term and could refer to any structure. It does not provide any specific solution for the person's transportation needs. - Garage: A garage is a place generally utilized for parking, repairing or servicing vehicles. Since the person does not have a car, visiting a garage does not address their need for transportation to another location.

Her love for designer clothes, extravagant shoes, and the latest accessories has left her with a daunting pile of credit card bills and debt, but she manages to hide it from everyone successful – including Alex (played by a charming actor), her attractive and hardworking colleague with whom she shares a love-hate relationship. The story begins with Rebecca struggling to maintain her glamorous designer-filled lifestyle and her job at a reputable financial magazine called \\"Successful Saving,\\" which is edited by Alistair West (played by a famous actor). She is asked to write a piece on the dangers of consumerism and the importance of budgeting. Despite being a shopaholic, Rebecca takes on this task, hoping to use her own experiences to give depth to the story and impress her boss.  Rebecca attends Shopaholics Anonymous meetings for research purposes, where she meets various characters, each with their own unique addiction to shopping. However, those meetings slowly start making her reflect upon her habits, and she realizes that she needs to change. Her shopping addiction begins to unravel at the worst possible time when a rival journalist, Janet (played by a well-known actress), starts investigating a piece to expose the hypocrisy of \\"Successful Saving.\\" Janet stumbles upon Rebecca's debt problems and blackmails her: either get her insider information on Alistair West and the magazine, or she'll expose Rebecca's secret to the world. Caught between her loyalty to her job and the fear of being exposed, Rebecca reluctantly agrees to get Janet the information she wants. During this time, Rebecca gets closer to Alex as they work together on multiple projects. Their bond strengthens, and Alex share his own struggles with Rebecca, developing a romantic interest in her. However, as Rebecca becomes more entangled in the blackmail, she starts to realize the gravity of her actions and the consequences they would have on her colleagues and the magazine. Faced with her reality, she attends a Shopaholics Anonymous meeting and, for the first time, genuinely acknowledges her addiction and the problems it has caused.  Guided by her newfound clarity and determination, Rebecca decides to come clean and confess her addiction and the blackmail to Alistair and Alex. To her surprise, she is met with understanding and support. Alistair gives her a second chance and agrees to help her with her addiction. Alex admires her courage and confesses his feelings for her, sealing their romantic bond. Together, with the support of their colleagues and members of Shopaholics Anonymous, they devise a plan to outsmart Janet. They succeed in protecting the magazine and expose Janet's unscrupulous reporting. The movie concludes with Rebecca learning how to balance her love for shopping with her newfound understanding of financial responsibility. She continues to work at the magazine, and with Alex's help, she writes a heartwarming and inspiring article on her own journey as a recovering shopaholic. \\"The Unraveling of Rebecca Bloomwood\\" is a touching romantic comedy-drama that explores self-discovery, the battle with addiction, and the importance of support from loved ones.

Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles. Takeaways: Middle managers are one step above one-celled organisms. They can, and will try to get you to do non-role work, with no intention of ever paying you more.

Answer the following question: Given the following context:  Other scholar-bureaucrats were wary of Wang's heterodoxy, the increasing number of his disciples while he was still in office, and his overall socially rebellious message. To curb his influence, he was often sent out to deal with military affairs and rebellions far away from the capital. Yet his ideas penetrated mainstream Chinese thought and spurred new interest in Taoism and Buddhism. Furthermore, people began to question the validity of the social hierarchy and the idea that the scholar should be above the farmer. Wang Yangming's disciple and salt-mine worker Wang Gen gave lectures to commoners about pursuing education to improve their lives, while his follower He Xinyin (何心隱) challenged the elevation and emphasis of the family in Chinese society. His contemporary Li Zhi even taught that women were the intellectual equals of men and should be given a better education; both Li and He eventually died in prison, jailed on charges of spreading \\"dangerous ideas\\". Yet these \\"dangerous ideas\\" of educating women had long been embraced by some mothers and by courtesans who were as literate and skillful in calligraphy, painting, and poetry as their male guests.The liberal views of Wang Yangming were opposed by the Censorate and by the Donglin Academy, re-established in 1604. These conservatives wanted a revival of orthodox Confucian ethics. Conservatives such as Gu Xiancheng (1550–1612) argued against Wang's idea of innate moral knowledge, stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain. These two strands of Confucian thought, hardened by Chinese scholars' notions of obligation towards their mentors, developed into pervasive factionalism among the ministers of state, who used any opportunity to impeach members of the other faction from court.  answer the following question:  What were the full names of the two people who died in prison?

For professors who use pre-made quizzes from their \\"instructor's edition\\" textbooks, purchase a copy. Find the correct edition of the book online and buy it. Before a quiz memorise the answers to the questions. This method is good for entry level science, foreign language and/or history classes that pull their quizzes straight from the book. This can be done by talking to an old student or by talking to other students who might have connections in the class. Study straight from the exam, or if you suspect that the exam will be the same, study the answers straight. If you know a professor or teacher will let you come back to finish a test, purposefully don't finish the exam and ask to come back on a later date. Make sure to memorise the topics or questions so that you can look up the answers before finishing the test later. Claim to be sick, go to thee bathroom towards the end of the exam until its over. Or pace yourself slowly. Be sure that your professor will let you come back before using this method as you could actually do worse if he/she doesn't let you finish. As you turn in your exam, if your professor isn't at her/his desk, use a pencil you brought up with you to change or write in answers from the test at the top of the pile. (This is a high risk!)

Passage:The name \\"Lord Haw-Haw of Zeesen\\" was coined in 1939 by the pseudonymous Daily Express radio critic Jonah Barrington, but this referred initially to Wolf Mittler (or possibly Norman Baillie-Stewart). When Joyce became the best-known propaganda broadcaster, the nickname was transferred to him. Joyce's broadcasts initially came from studios in Berlin, later transferring (because of heavy Allied bombing) to Luxembourg and finally to Apen near Hamburg, and were relayed over a network of German-controlled radio stations that included Hamburg, Bremen, Luxembourg, Hilversum, Calais, Oslo, and Zeesen. Joyce also broadcast on and wrote scripts for the German Büro Concordia organisation, which ran several black propaganda stations, many of which pretended to broadcast illegally from within Britain. His role in writing the scripts increased over time, and the German radio capitalized on his public persona. Initially an anonymous broadcaster, Joyce eventually revealed his real name to his listeners; and he would occasionally be announced as \\"William Joyce, otherwise known as Lord Haw-Haw\\". Urban legends soon circulated about Lord Haw-Haw, alleging that the broadcaster was well-informed about political and military events to the point of near-omniscience.  Links: a. Radio Luxembourg b.

Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy. Come to find out the child had his picture made with that very Santa a few days prior. Very ironic. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: The doctors probably spent how long trying to save Santa? Options:  A. A couple of hours.  B. not enough information  C. All night.  D. Several days.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Remember a film you seemed to enjoy in the past that doesn't quite meet those same feelings as an adult? That occurred to me when I went back to school..the National Lampoon's Class Reunion. The film has a perfect opportunity for laughs, but surprisingly wanders aimlessly as we see a bizarre collection of characters such a woman who sold her soul to the devil and can shoot out flames of fire from her mouth, a man who appears to be a vampire, and a lunatic killer dressed as a woman and wears sacks over his head. You have the class president who believes he's the best thing since sliced bread(but as we see in the film, he's a coward and joke), a couple of pot smokers who don't even know they are at their own class reunion, and a man named Gary for whom know one even knew existed(and no one can seem to remember his name..this is the one running joke I enjoyed). There is a plump pervert who likes to grab women in inappropriate places, a deaf and blind woman who has a screeching holler when calling for her dog, and the cook(you know her from \\"goonies\\" and \\"Throw Mama From The Train\\")who loves to place food on people's plates with her hands! The film is essentially about a nutcase who is(or at least attempting to)taking revenge on his classmates for a gag they pulled on him(they arranged for him to sleep with his own twin sister!). The film follows the characters as they search for the killer canvasing darkened, trashed hallways of the old high school. They were told of the killer by his psychologist who seems a bit odd himself. The film has a few good gags that work(pretty much early on), but the film slowly gets worse each passing minute. The film's true problem is that it really doesn't know where to go. The film is pretty much a one-joke premise for it has unassured direction..if it really has any direction at all. The cast is enthusiastic enough, but the material they are to make funny just doesn't have the quality to hold any interest. It's a curio for fans of early 80's comedy relics that are forgotten(this one rightfully so).","output":"In simple words, the person who wrote this review didn't really like the movie as much as they thought they would. They liked some jokes and the cast's enthusiasm, but the movie didn't have a clear direction and it got more boring as it went on. So, the sentiment of this review is mostly negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Can you tell me the answer to who drove the number 1 car in nascar??","output":"NASCAR, which stands for the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, is a hugely popular sport in North America. The drivers who have had the privilege of driving the prestigious number 1 car in NASCAR's history are numerous, and include plenty of talented individuals. It's important to keep in mind, however, that the drivers of the number 1 car can change frequently due to sponsorships, contractual obligations, team changes, or retirements.  Let's look at a few of the notable drivers who've been behind the wheel of the number 1 car in chronological order: 1. **Bob Welborn**: Bob Welborn, mainly known for his success in convertibles, drove the number 1 car in the late 1950s. 2. **Billy Wade**: Another known driver of the car in the sixties was Billy Wade, who won 4 consecutive races. 3. **Donnie Allison**: Allison drove the number 1 car in the late sixties to early seventies. 4. **Martin Truex Jr.**: The early 2000s saw Martin Truex Jr. driving the number 1 car. He even won the NASCAR Xfinity Series Championship twice in 2004 and 2005. 5. **Jamie McMurray**: After Truex, Jamie McMurray took over the number 1 car and drove it for Chip Ganassi Racing from 2010 to 2018.  6. **Kurt Busch**: The number 1 car was driven by Kurt Busch from 2019 to 2020. He competes full-time in the NASCAR Cup Series for Chip Ganassi Racing. Kurt Busch even managed to bring victories for the team while driving the number 1 car. 7. **Ross Chastain**: Most recently, the number 1 car was taken over in 2021 by Ross Chastain, who previously raced in number 42. It's an intriguing piece of motorsports history to see how the number 1 car has passed through various teams and drivers throughout the years. Unfortunately, detailing the drivers of all the NASCAR cars is beyond the scope of this response, but I hope this gives some insight into some of the main drivers of the number 1 car in NASCAR.    For the most accurate and up-to-date information, it's advisable to see the current team listings on the official NASCAR website. Please note that the information will change from season to season and sometimes even during a season, as drivers can change teams or be replaced due to injuries or other factors. NASCAR itself is a world full of ever-changing dynamics, and the legacy of the number 1 car is just one fascinating storyline among many in the sport."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a \\"a).\\" movie review (Possible answers: a). negative. b). positive.).","output":"a). Negative Movie Review: \\"The Hyped Disappointment\\" As a movie buff, I usually look forward to new releases with an earnest anticipation. So when \\"The Hyped Disappointment\\" hit the theaters after a massive marketing campaign, I was eager to see what all the fuss was about. Sadly, I soon discovered that the movie was a prime example of how even a star-studded cast and an experienced director can't save a film with a mediocre script and problematic plotlines. Starting off with the storyline, \\"The Hyped Disappointment\\" offers a promising premise, highlighting the action-packed adventures of a group of unlikely heroes who are thrown together to save the world from an imminent, otherworldly threat. However, the writers and director severely underdelivered, leaving us with a jumbled mess of half-baked plotlines that don't build on each other and fail to make any discernible sense. The pacing of the film further derails the watching experience. Character introductions are rushed and unsatisfying, and the pacing rarely pauses for breath or for any non-action scenes. The climax of the film is reached so abruptly that it feels unnatural, like the writers were trying to force a resolution in a lackluster fashion. Unfortunately, this pacing issue hinders any character development, so we never feel invested in the heroes or their motives throughout the film, leaving us indifferent to their struggles and victories. Moreover, \\"The Hyped Disappointment\\" just can't seem to find its voice as it is riddled with comedy that falls flat, dramatic scenes that make us cringe, and action sequences that come off as uninspired. This leads to an odd blend of genre elements colliding in an unpleasant way, making viewers question the genre this film was trying to inhabit. A film's cast can make or break its success, and while this movie features a bevy of talented actors and actresses, it failed to make good use of their skills. Lackluster performances, perhaps stemming from an uninspired script, rendered characters one dimensional and dull. It appeared as if the actors, too, were disappointed with the material they were given, making it even more challenging for the audience to engage with the story. Additionally, the heavy-handed use of CGI in \\"The Hyped Disappointment\\" lent the movie an artificial feel, detracting from its visual appeal. Although it is evident that the production team invested significantly in special effects, their overuse diminished the value of practical effects and overshadowed the human elements of the story. In conclusion, \\"The Hyped Disappointment\\" falls short of expectations in almost every respect, with a weak script, poor pacing, an inconsistent tone, and a squandered cast. With so much potential, it's a genuine shame that this film turned out to be yet another costly misfire for both the fans and the production team. This lackluster offering is one to be missed, and one can only hope that the creators will learn from their mistakes and return to the drawing board for any future attempts in a similar vein."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They argue about the Bible but support each other during difficult times. Step 2: Identify possible reasons for contradictions Let's examine some possible reasons for why these contradictions may occur: 1. Diverse perspectives: People come from different backgrounds and have their own views, experiences, and beliefs, which can lead to different interpretations of the same text. 2. Human nature: It's a part of human nature to have some level of inconsistency in beliefs and actions. Often, people may not be aware of the contradictions in their views and actions. 3. Emphasizing personal opinions: Some people may prioritize their own opinions and experiences over official teachings of the church, leading to contradictions. 4. Lack of clear guidance on certain topics: The Bible can sometimes be vague or open to interpretation on certain issues, making it difficult for people to reach a consensus. Step 3: Formulate a concise answer Based on the analysis of the reasons mentioned above, we can now answer the question: The congregation at the church events experiences contradictions due to diverse perspectives, human nature, strong personal opinions, and, at times, the lack of clear guidance on certain topics in the Bible.

He worked as a session keyboard player and guitarist in the 1960s, as a member of The Mighty Mystics and the Now Generation Band, both of which also included his brother, guitarist Mikey Chung, and Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry's band The Upsetters, among others. He began working as a producer in the 1970s, initially with Sharon Forrester on her debut album, and set up his Edge productions company in 1974. His productions included work by The Abyssinians, The Heptones, and Marcia Griffiths. He also worked with Ras Michael's Sons of Negus band, on the 1975 album Rastafari Dub, playing synthesizer, organ and piano, and worked regularly with singer Pablo Moses, both as keyboard player and producer, including his first and best-known recording \\"I Man a Grasshopper\\". Chung also produced the recordings that would be released as the first two albums from Ijahman Levi. In the early 1980s he became resident engineer at the Dynamic studios, where he mixed several albums by Peter Tosh, and he co-produced early recordings by Frankie Paul. In the late 1980s he relocated to Miami, where he established his own recording studio. In 1991 he produced and engineered Maxi Priest's Best of Me album.

Options: + negative. + positive.Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible .","output":"The following phrase can be considered as predominantly negative due to a combination of various factors. Let's analyze the different elements that support this interpretation: 1. \\"trying to make head or tail of the story\\": This part of the phrase suggests that the story is difficult to understand or decipher, which is usually interpreted as a negative aspect. When something is described as challenging to make sense of, it implies that the person expressing this view does not find the content easily accessible or enjoyable. 2. \\"in the hip-hop indie snipes\\": This phrase references the context of the story, and mentioning \\"snipes\\" has a negative connotation because it suggests that there are conflicts or tensions within the hip-hop indie scene. Although this part does not directly express a positive or negative view, it provides a background for the overall negative perspective. 3. \\"is enough to give you brain strain\\": This segment explicitly conveys a negative sentiment. By stating that trying to comprehend the story causes \\"brain strain,\\" the speaker implies that the effort required to understand the narrative is so significant that it may lead to mental discomfort or exhaustion. This part is a strong indicator that the phrase should be considered negative. 4. \\"and the pay-off is negligible\\": This final part of the phrase is also negative in nature, as it conveys that the outcome or reward obtained from trying to understand the story is minimal or insignificant. In other words, the speaker believes that the effort put into making sense of the content is not worth the eventual outcome, highlighting a sense of disappointment or dissatisfaction. In summary, the phrase should be considered negative due to the presence of various elements that express disappointment, difficulty, and dissatisfaction with the story in question. Although there is a mention of the context, it does not significantly impact the overall negative sentiment expressed in the phrase."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"No, these two questions are asking about different things, but they are related in terms of economics. Let me explain it to you in a simpler way.  Imagine you have a candy shop. If you have lots of candies (lots of goods in the economy), but not a lot of people buying it (not enough demand), you might lower the price to sell more candies. This is like unemployment: if there are a lot of workers but not enough jobs, then there will be more people unemployed. On the other hand, inflation is like if you decided to print more candy money that kids use to buy candies. If now there's more candy money around but the same amount of candy, each candy's price will go up. This is like inflation: if there's more money in the economy but the same amount of goods, then prices in general will go up. As for the second question, debt is like if you borrow candy from someone promising to pay them back more later. If there's inflation (if candies' prices go up), then the extra candy you have to give back won't be as big a deal. But if there's deflation (candies' prices go down), that extra candy might be harder to get. So, although these two questions are asking about two different topics (inflation & unemployment, and inflation & debt), they are both related because they discuss how inflation impacts different aspects of our economy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On a rainy December morning it's business as usual, so no one notices the non-descript man sitting in plain sedan across the street from Joe's building, checking off names of every employee as they enter.Inside, Joe looks for an answer to a letter he'd sent to the main CIA office at Langley. He has a theory about connections he's noticed between operations in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and other locations around the world, but so far there's no response. Noon approaches, and it's his turn to go out for lunch. Since it's still raining, he ducks out the basement door (which is against regulations) and cuts through several back alleys to the deli. Meanwhile, the sedan out front quietly pulls away after signaling to 3 men (one is a mailman) waiting in the street. They move in with quiet determination and knock on the front door. The mailman stands in view of the camera while the other two wait behind him.At the deli around the block, Joe picks up lunch for the others and then runs back.

Rick Snyder, left, fills jugs with filtered Flint, Mich., tap water alongside Cheryl Hill at Hill's house where he drank his first glass of the local water Monday, April 18, 2016, on the... (Associated Press)      LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder will drink Flint water at home and at work for at least a month to show to residents it is safe with the use of a faucet filter, he said Monday.      The Republican governor, who has apologized for his administration's role in the city's lead-tainted water crisis, visited a house owned by Cheryl Hill and Todd Canty that was confirmed to have high levels of lead. Snyder, who left with five gallons of filtered water, said he understands people feel that if officials say the water is OK, then he should drink it, too.      \\"What better way to help show support,\\" said Snyder, who will get refills from other homes as needed.      Hill and Canty told The Flint Journal that they appreciate the governor's visit but still have a lead service line running to their home and don't know if and when it will be replaced.      \\"I wouldn't want to be in his position right now,\\" Canty said. \\"I believe this is just one of those cases where personally he just has a lot of work to do.\\"      For nearly 18 months, Flint residents drank and bathed with improperly treated water that had coursed through aging pipes and fixtures, scraping away lead. By the time Snyder announced in October that Flint would return to its earlier source of treated water, the Detroit municipal system, dangerously high levels of the toxic metal were detected in the blood of some residents, including children, for whom it can cause lower IQs and behavioral problems.      On Monday, Snyder again urged residents to drink the water as long as a filter is in place. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, however, says bottled water is safest for children under age 6 and pregnant or breastfeeding women.      Meanwhile, a state water-quality official who told the city of Flint that a chemical wasn't needed to prevent lead corrosion from pipes has taken a different job in the state Department of Environmental Quality.      Mike Prysby, who was a district engineer with the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance and had been responsible for Genesee County, home to Flint, began working in the Water Resources Division's Transportation and Flood Hazard Unit on March 28. That was the day before a supervisor at Flint's water plant, Mike Glasgow, testified at a legislative hearing that Prysby told him before Flint switched to a local river for water in 2014 that phosphate wasn't required.      DEQ spokeswoman Melanie Brown said Prysby took a position that opened up when someone was promoted, and his switch was not a forced transfer.      \\"The department continues to cooperate with internal investigations regarding staff actions in Flint,\\" she told The Associated Press in an email.      A message seeking comment was left Monday for Prysby, who has declined previous requests for an interview.      Snyder has blamed \\"career bureaucrats\\" in state and federal governments. A task force appointed by Snyder has said the DEQ was the primary culprit because regulators misinterpreted a federal rule in telling Flint water officials not to treat the Flint River for corrosion until after two six-month monitoring periods.      The DEQ's director and communications director resigned in December. Snyder fired the department's top drinking water official, and a district supervisor is on paid leave after being suspended five days without pay in January for actions related to the Flint crisis — the maximum allowed under civil service rules.      ___      Follow David Eggert at http://twitter.com/DavidEggert00 .

Write a question about the following article: The Bolshevik forces reached the Lithuanian territory on July 7, 1920, and continued to push the Polish troops. The Lithuanian Army moved to secure territories abandoned by the retreating Polish forces. They took Turmantas on July 7, Tauragnai and Alanta on July 9, Širvintos and Musninkai on July 10, Kernavė, Molėtai, and Giedraičiai on July 11, Maišiagala and Pabradė on July 13. On July 13 the Polish command decided to transfer Vilnius to the Lithuanians in accordance with the resolution of the Spa Conference. Lithuanians moved in, but their trains were stopped by Polish soldiers near Kazimieriškės. This delay meant that the Bolsheviks were the first to enter Vilnius on July 14. By the time first Lithuanian troops entered the city on July 15, it was already secured by the Soviets. Poland sought to have Russians in the city as it would create much less complications when Polish Army counterattacked. Despite the Peace Treaty, the Soviets did not intend to transfer the city to the Lithuanians. Indeed, there were indications that the Soviets planned a coup against the Lithuanian government in hopes to re-establish the Lithuanian SSR. Despite the setback in Vilnius, the Lithuanians continued to secure territories in the Suwałki Region. They took Druskininkai on July 17, Vištytis, Punsk, Giby, and Sejny on July 19, Suwałki on July 29, Augustów on August 8.

Review: in this dreary mess  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"The movie review sentence, \\"in this dreary mess,\\" can be understood as negative. The choice of words used to describe the movie evoke an unfavorable impression. The adjective \\"dreary\\" means dull, bleak, or lacking in excitement. Using this word to describe a movie suggests that the film was uninteresting, unappealing, or monotonous. It could imply a lack of engaging content, poor pacing, or unimpressive visual and audio components. The word \\"mess\\" in this context typically refers to a situation, event, or in this case, a movie that is disorderly, chaotic, and disorganized. This word further emphasizes that the film failed to present a cohesive and coherent narrative, potentially leaving the audience confused or frustrated. By describing the movie as a \\"mess,\\" the reviewer could be saying that its storyline, structure, character arcs, and production quality were subpar or haphazardly thrown together. Both of these words used together further reinforce the negative tone of the review, implying that the experience of watching the movie was not only dull and disheartening but also marred by disorder and lack of clarity. This tells the reader to expect an unsatisfactory and disappointing film experience if they were to watch it. Of course, it is important to keep in mind that individual opinions about movies can vary widely, and what one reviewer perceives as a \\"dreary mess\\" might be seen as an intentional artistic choice by another viewer.

When Mrs Edwards came running up to him, she shouted their neighbours for help. And he saw her and heard her voice for the first time in nearly ten years. The news of Robert's regaining his sight and hearing quickly spread in his area. And many doctors came to prove the truth of the news. Most of them said that he gained sight and hearing again obviously from the knock of lightning; none of them could give convincing reasons, however. The only reasonable explanation given by one doctor was that, since Edwards lost his sight and hearing as a result of sudden shock in a terrible accident, perhaps the only way for them to regain was by another sudden shock.

While primarily regarded as a touching and offbeat love story with elements of science fiction, it offers an opportunity for introspection and reflection on humanity's connection to the universe. John Carpenter's direction is praised as one of his best works, although some reviews mention the predictability of the plot and a departure from his usual style in favor of a more commercial approach.

Ensinnäkin olemme huolestuneita EU:n ulko- ja turvallisuuspolitiikan yhtenäisyyden ja tehokkuuden puutteesta. Kuten tiedämme, unionin jäsenvaltioiden väliset erimielisyydet ovat joskus haitanneet kykyämme toimia tehokkaasti ja yhtenäisenä kansainvälisellä näyttämöllä ja kehittää johdonmukaista ja vahvaa Euroopan unionia, joka pystyy puolustamaan etujaan ja perusarvojaan maailmassa. Toiseksi, vaikka me vihreät kannatamme voimakkaasti monenvälisyyttä ja rauhanomaisen konfliktinratkaisun periaatteita, emme voi olla näkemättä joitakin niistä haasteista ja uhkista, joihin Eurooppa kohtaa nykyisessä kansainvälisessä tilanteessa. Näitä ovat esimerkiksi terrorismin, joukkotuhoaseiden leviämisen, kyberhyökkäysten, hybridiuhkien ja laittoman siirtolaisuuden aiheuttamat turvallisuusriskit. Siksi kehotamme EU:ta ja jäsenvaltioita lisäämään yhteistyötään näiden haasteiden kohtaamiseksi tehokkaan yhteisen ulko- ja turvallisuuspolitiikan puitteissa. Kolmanneksi uskomme, että EU:n ulko- ja turvallisuuspolitiikassa tulisi olla vankempi ihmisoikeuksia ja demokratiaa edistävä ulottuvuus. Tämä tarkoittaa, että meidän tulisi tukea aktiivisesti kansalaisyhteiskuntaa, ihmisoikeuspuolustajia ja demokraattista oppositiota niissä maissa, joissa niiden tilaa ja toimintaa rajoitetaan ja jopa vainotaan. Neljänneksi, haluaisimme korostaa tarvetta uudistaa EU:n turvallisuus- ja puolustusarkkitehtuuria sekä tehostaa unionin yhteistyötä Naton ja muiden kumppaneiden kanssa. Tässä yhteydessä tuemme EU:n pyrkimyksiä kehittää yhteismarkkinoita ja -toimintaa puolustusalalla sekä parantaa sotilaallisia kyvykkyyksiä ja valmiuksia. Lopuksi meidän on mielestämme tarpeen päivittää EU:n globaali strategia ja tarkistaa unionin strategiset painopisteet ottaen huomioon muuttuvan maailmanjärjestyksen ja Venäjän palauttamisen kulmakivet, Kiinan nousu, Yhdysvaltain kääntyminen sisäänpäin sekä uudet teknologiset haasteet ja ympäristöön liittyvät kysymykset, kuten ilmastonmuutos ja biologinen monimuotoisuuden heikkeneminen. Tämä edellyttää aiempaa rohkeampaa ja yhtenäisempää eurooppalaista toimintaa sekä parempaa ja kestävämpää liittoutumista ja kumppanuuksia kansainvälisten toimijoiden kanssa. Arvoisa puhemies, edellä mainituista syistä osoitamme kriittisyytemme ja toivomme, että nämä kysymykset otetaan huomioon EU:n ulko- ja turvallisuuspolitiikassa tulevina vuosina."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Walk slightly ahead of them, carrying menus and silverware to the table where you want them to sit. Ask if the table is okay before the customers sit down. Most customers expect to wait at least 10 minutes to be seated at a restaurant, especially if they didn’t have a reservation. If your guests have waited much longer than that, offer a sincere apology as you show them to their table. Ask management if it’s okay to comp them a free drink or appetizer (but don’t offer it to the guests until you get permission). If the restaurant is slow, try to seat guests at a table that’s not directly next to another full table. Of course, if the restaurant is very busy, guests will have to sit near other diners, but try to make sure all of your guests have enough space to be comfortable. By seating guests in rotating sections, you’ll help ensure that all of your servers are able to make money for the night. Rotating stations will also help keep servers from becoming overwhelmed by getting several tables at the same time. You never want to throw all of the menus down on a table, as this seems rude and dismissive.

The baby liked playing with the rattle more than playing with the ball because the","output":"sound it produced was enchanting to his little ears. The bright colors of the rattle also seemed to interest him more than the plain blue ball that lay forgotten in the corner of the playpen. His eyes sparkled with joy as he shook the rattle, listening intently to the sound it produced, creating a symphony that only he could fully appreciate. One day, as the baby sat on the carpet, shaking his beloved rattle, a tiny beam of sunlight streamed in from a small crack in the curtains. The light reflected off the rattle, casting an array of colors across the room. The baby, completely captivated by the dazzling sight, stopped shaking the rattle for a moment. He then tilted it from side to side, watching as the colors danced along the walls and ceiling. His mother, Ella, stood in the doorway with a smile as she watched her little one play. Her heart swelled with love and pride as she saw him discovering the world around him. The simple joys of a child, Ella thought, had a certain magic to them that rejuvenated even the most tired and weary soul. As the baby continued to play with the rattle and the sunlight, he suddenly noticed something peculiar. The sound of the rattle seemed to change, to take on a different quality. It was as if each shake of the rattle was forming a pattern of sound, an intricate melody that he had never heard before. The baby was fascinated by this development and began to shake the rattle even more intently, experimenting with different speeds and movements to see what sounds he could create. As he continued, he noticed that every time he created a unique melody, the colorful patterns produced by the sunlight changed too, almost as if they were responding to the music. Intrigued and delighted, he continued to play, creating an ever-changing display of colors and sounds that filled the room with a sense of wonder. As Ella watched, she couldn't help but feel amazed at the incredible luck of having such a curious and imaginative child. She had always believed that the key to a fulfilling life was to never lose one's sense of wonder and curiosity, and seeing her baby explore new combinations of sounds and lights with his simple rattle filled her with an indescribable sense of happiness. The baby's father, Jack, joined Ella in the doorway and wrapped his arms around her. Together, they watched their little one play, completely absorbed in his world of color and sound. Jack whispered into Ella's ear, \\"We made that. We created that incredible little person.\\" Ella nodded, tears welling up in her eyes as she felt the enormity of the responsibility and the love they had for their child. They both knew that their lives had changed forever the moment their baby was born, and every day since had been a new adventure filled with joy, laughter, and learning. As the sunlight slowly began to fade, the vibrant colors on the walls receded, and the once enchanting melody returned to its original simple sound. The baby eventually grew tired and let the rattle fall onto the carpet with a gentle thud. His eyes fluttered shut, and he drifted off to sleep, his mind filled with beautiful dreams of the colorful symphony he had created.

Answer:","output":"In the 2016 live-action adaptation of \\"The Jungle Book,\\" the song \\"I Wanna Be Like You\\" is performed by Christopher Walken, who voices the character King Louie. This iconic song was originally written by Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman for the 1967 animated film by Disney. The 2016 version of the song maintains the classic jazz elements and upbeat rhythm while adding a few modern twists. In this contemporary adaptation directed by Jon Favreau, King Louie is portrayed as a gigantic Gigantopithecus, an extinct species of great ape, instead of an orangutan as in the original animated film. The song \\"I Wanna Be Like You\\" is featured during the scene where King Louie tries to convince Mowgli, the human boy raised by wolves, to give him the secret of the 'red flower' (fire). King Louie believes that by obtaining the power of fire, he can become more human-like and establish his rule in the jungle. He sings this song to express his desire to be like Mowgli and harness the power that humans possess. Walken's performance adds an extra layer of depth to King Louie's character, showcasing both his ambition and charisma. The 2016 adaptation of \\"The Jungle Book\\" features a star-studded cast, including Neel Sethi as Mowgli, and voice talents such as Bill Murray as Baloo, Ben Kingsley as Bagheera, Idris Elba as Shere Khan, Lupita Nyong'o as Raksha, and Scarlett Johansson as Kaa. The movie seamlessly blends live-action with advanced CGI technology to create a visually stunning and immersive experience for its audience. Much like the 1967 animated film, the 2016 version also incorporates other cherished songs such as \\"The Bare Necessities\\" and \\"Trust in Me\\" into its soundtrack."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He glances at his watch, growing slightly impatient as the train is delayed by a couple of minutes. The landmark of Audley End is visible not far from the station. Samantha, a petite woman in her mid-20s with long, wavy auburn hair, steps out of the train and looks around, scanning the bustling station for Henry. She wears a summer dress with a floral print and a nervous, yet excited smile. As soon as she spots Henry, she waves and shouts his name, her voice barely audible amidst the noise around her.) Samantha: Henry! Over here! (Henry spots Samantha and waves back, a grin instantly appearing on his face.) Henry: Samantha! Glad to see you! It took you quite a bit of time getting off the train. Samantha: I know, right? That train was so crowded, I had to squeeze past a bunch of people to get to the door. But anyhow, I'm here now! (Henry walks over to greet Samantha, giving her a friendly hug.) Henry: It's so nice to see you again. How was your journey? Samantha: It wasn't too bad, thanks. Mostly smooth, aside from a few minor delays. Audley End looks beautiful from the train. Oh, and that sandwich shop in the station had the most delicious-looking food! Henry: Ah, yes! Their sandwiches are quite famous around here! By the way, here's a little surprise for you! (He hands her a bouquet of roses, making Samantha's eyes widen with delight.) Samantha: Oh Henry, you didn't have to do this! They're gorgeous, thank you so much! Henry: I thought you'd like them. Now, let's head to the car and get your luggage in. (They walk together towards Henry's car, chatting all the way.) Samantha: So, what have you been up to lately, Henry? Henry: I've been working on a local reforestation project. It's been keeping me pretty busy lately, but I absolutely love it. We've already planted hundreds of trees in the area near Audley End. Samantha: That sounds incredible! It's great to see you doing something you're passionate about. Maybe I can come by and see the project sometime? Henry: Of course! I'd love to show you around, and I'm sure my colleagues would be happy to meet you as well. (They reach the car, and Henry efficiently places Samantha's bags in the trunk.) Henry: There we go. Are you hungry? We can grab something to eat before heading to my place - or, if you prefer, we can just head home and relax. It's been quite a long day for you. Samantha: I am actually quite famished. Maybe we could go to that sandwich shop you told me about? Henry: Of course! Let's head back to the station, and I'll buy you one of their famous sandwiches. Samantha: Sounds perfect. Good food and great company - I couldn't ask for more!

Scoop its entire body up in your hand in a single movement. When you’re holding the dragon, make sure to support its full body, including legs and tail.  If you pick a dragon up suddenly from the rear, it may mistake your hand for a predator and bite you. Never pick a dragon up by its tail. Unlike other lizards, their tails do not regenerate. You could cause serious harm to your lizard by grabbing it by its tail. If your dragon becomes aggressive and tries to bite you once you have picked it up, hold its body firmly with one hand (so its jaws can’t reach your fingers) and use your other hand to stroke its back. This will soothe the dragon and teach it that human contact is not a cause for fear.  If the dragon continues to act aggressively—or becomes even more aggressive—set it back in its cage. Wait 5 minutes, and pick the dragon up again. Be careful, however, as this effectively \\"rewards\\" the dragon for acting aggressively. If possible, it's better to hold the dragon until it calms down and then replace it in the cage so that it learns that calm behavior will help it get what it wants. Aggressive dragons take longer to train, but don’t give up hope. Given enough time, they’ll get used to being touched and handled. Frequent human contact is the best way for a bearded dragon to learn that you are not a threat. Hold and handle your dragon daily, for about 10 minutes at a time, and it will become increasingly tame and comfortable with your presence. Dragons will become stressed if they’re handled for long periods of time. It’s better to have multiple, short handling sessions each day rather than a single, long session. Once your dragon has become accustomed to being touched and handled by you, you can train it to eat out of your hand. Simply hold a mealworm between two fingers and extend it near the dragon’s mouth. If your dragon is very comfortable with being handled out of its cage, you can hold a mealworm in your palm and let the dragon eat out of your hand. Prior to this point, you’ll need to feed your dragon in its cage using tweezers. Use the tweezers to drop mealworms down near your dragon. Summary:","output":"When picking up a bearded dragon, move your hand slowly and support its whole body. Don't grab its tail or scare it. If it tries to bite you, hold it firmly and gently stroke its back to calm it down. Practice holding the dragon for 10 minutes each day to help it get used to you. Once it's comfortable, you can teach it to eat from your hand. Remember not to handle it for too long, and use tweezers to feed it before it's ready to eat from your hand."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: When Jane put out the idea of homeschooling to her parents, the first reaction they gave was, \\"You are cutting the child off the world.'' \\"Did the child really get cut off or did the child socialize better?\\" The moment we hear of homeschooling, we think the child will have no opportunities to interact with peers. However, in my friend's opinion, we forget that when attending a regular school, the child is not into socializing all the while. The child is restricted to so many other activities. Studies take a major role in a child's life. The child hardly has the time to interact at school. The child might be meeting and studying along with many peers; however, how many kids interact with all the kids in a class? But in homeschooling system, as my friend mentioned, the kid has all the time and can plan his day accordingly. During the day the child studies just like other school-going kids but with no burden of homework and project work, the child has so much free time in the evening as to effectively interact and play with peers. The quality time the child spends in education is really impressive. Homeschooled kids have the opportunity to socialize more often as they have a lot of time in their hands. They can also make socializing a regular habit. Just as my friend said, her child goes to a neighboring park almost every day and has a set of friends who go there daily. Other children get back home to finish off homework and project work whereas her child who is already through with studies gets the opportunity to spend time with family members. When I heard this, I really felt how lucky the child was. Definitely the child had a better opportunity to socialize when compared with my kid. However, I might not consider homeschooling for my kid, as I am so used to the conventional schooling system and feel regular schooling the safest bet. Question: What is the biggest advantage of homeschooled children? - They will become braver. - They can be more popular. - They can socialize better. - They will know how to arrange time.

Add the oil to a room temperature skillet and place on the stove. Heat the oil over medium-high heat for a minute or two. Pick from: -- Stir the oil frequently until it begins to brown and become very moist. The oil should be steadily sizzling and bubbling. -- Let it remain near the heat until the oil is both heated and a translucent film forms. Alternatively, you can use non-stick skillet. -- This should keep the oil from burning throughout your rice. Using a large skillet can cause the oil to sizzle. -- The oil should be glossy and smooth, but it should not smoke at any point during the cooking process. If the oil begins to smoke, it means that the fat has begun to break down, which, in turn, means that the flavor will be thrown off.","output":"Next, proceed with the following steps to finish making chipotle rice: 1. Prepare your ingredients: Before you start, make sure you have all the necessary ingredients handy. You'll need the following: long-grain white rice, water, chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, garlic, onion, salt, and optional ingredients like cilantro, lime juice, and frozen vegetables. 2. Rinse and drain the rice: Place the rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse it under cold, running water until the water runs clear. This step helps remove excess starch, which can make the cooked rice sticky. Drain the rice well to prevent adding extra moisture to the skillet. 3. Sauté the onion and garlic: Once the oil is heated and glossy, add the diced onion to the skillet. Cook the onion until it starts to soften and become translucent, about 3-4 minutes. Then, add the minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds, stirring continuously to prevent burning. 4. Add the rice and chipotle peppers: Add the rinsed and drained rice to the skillet, stirring it to coat the grains evenly with the oil, onion, and garlic mixture. Allow the rice to cook for a minute or two to toast, giving it an aromatic, nutty flavor. Then, add the chipotle peppers and adobo sauce, stirring to distribute them throughout the rice. 5. Add water and salt: Carefully pour in the measured water, ensuring that all the rice is submerged. Add salt to taste (about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon, or as desired) and stir gently. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet with a tight-fitting lid, and let the rice simmer gently. 6. Cook the rice: Allow the rice to cook undisturbed for about 15-20 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed, and the rice is tender yet firm. Do not lift the lid or stir the rice during this time, as this can disrupt the steaming process and cause unevenly cooked rice. 7. Fluff the rice and add optional ingredients: Remove the skillet from the heat and let it stand for 5 minutes with the lid still on. Then, using a fork, fluff the rice gently to separate the grains. At this point, you can mix in optional ingredients like chopped cilantro, a squeeze of lime juice, or frozen vegetables that have been defrosted and reheated. 8. Serve the chipotle rice: Transfer the rice to a serving dish and enjoy it as a flavorful side or as part of a meal, such as a burrito bowl, alongside grilled meats, or with your favorite Mexican-themed dishes."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The Battle of Leyte Gulf was arguably the largest naval battle in history and was the largest naval battle of World War II. It was a series of four distinct engagements fought off the Philippine island of Leyte from 23 to 26 October 1944. Leyte Gulf featured the largest battleships ever built, was the last time in history that battleships engaged each other, and was also notable as the first time that kamikaze aircraft were used. Allied victory in the Philippine Sea established Allied air and sea superiority in the western Pacific. Nimitz favored blockading the Philippines and landing on Formosa. This would give the Allies control of the sea routes to Japan from southern Asia, cutting off substantial Japanese garrisons. MacArthur favored an invasion of the Philippines, which also lay across the supply lines to Japan. Roosevelt adjudicated in favor of the Philippines. Meanwhile, Japanese Combined Fleet Chief Toyoda Soemu prepared four plans to cover all Allied offensive scenarios. On 12 October Nimitz launched a carrier raid against Formosa to make sure that planes based there could not intervene in the landings on Leyte. Toyoda put Plan Sho-2 into effect, launching a series of air attacks against the U.S. carriers. However the Japanese lost 600 planes in three days, leaving them without air cover.

It tastes exactly like the more expensive kind with the astronaut on the package, for a fraction of the price. After receiving this, I understand why it costs less than the \\"astronaut\\" kind. The packaging stinks on ice.  Normally, freeze dried items are packaged in air tight, foil type packages, so as to not permit light, and most importantly, air into the package. Air is the enemy of freeze dried items, because it contains moisture. The product arrives it is in an air tight can, which you need to open with a can opener. Inside, the individual servings of ice cream are in paper wrappers that will NOT keep air out of the product.  It gets worse. The paper wrappers are not only NOT air tight, but they are also ALL slit open. Every serving is slit open in several places. The can says to transfer the servings into a ziplock bag and get as much air out as possible. This may or may not keep the product fresh, but doing so is better than leaving the ice cream in the can.  With mine, I got as much air out of the bag as I could, by closing the bag as much as possible around a straw. I then sucked the air out until I could get no more air out, then slipped the straw out, whilst closing the bag in one swift motion. You MUST do this every time you open the bag to retrieve a serving, or air will ruin the delightful texture of the ice cream. So be prepared with large ziplock bags and a straw if you order this product.","output":"Part #1: Define review content classification. Usage: Classify the review as negative or positive. In this case, the review has both positive and negative aspects. The taste of the freeze-dried ice cream is described positively, while the packaging is criticized.

Luckily I was not the target or victim of this road rage, but I was a first hand witness. Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one. How long did it take the driver to get to his workplace? - one minute - not enough information - one year - one day","output":"To determine how long it took the driver to get to his workplace, we can consider the following information from the story: - The workplace was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd from the scene of the road rage incident. - The driver floored his accelerator and sped off to his workplace after witnessing the shooting. Based on this information, we can conclude that the answer is \\"not enough information\\" as we don't have an exact speed or time given. However, if we assume that the driver was traveling at a reasonably fast speed after witnessing the shooting, it could have been a very short duration of time, maybe a few minutes or less."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What can the problem be? Second question: Should you leave the car engine in idle for a while before turning it off after a long drive? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Choose your answer from: + no; + yes;","output":"First question: Since you have ruled out the battery and you mentioned that you filled up recently, there are several potential reasons why your car's engine died while driving. Here is a detailed list of some possible causes: 1. Fuel pump or fuel filter failure: It's possible that the fuel pump or fuel filter has become clogged or failed. This would prevent fuel from reaching the engine, causing it to stall. 2. Ignition switch problems: Issues with the ignition switch can cause a loss of power to the engine and other electrical components, leading to the engine suddenly cutting out. 3. Engine timing issues: If there's a problem with the timing belt or chain, it may cause the engine to stop running. An out-of-sync timing belt could result in engine misfires or piston-valve contact, both of which can lead to engine stalling. 4. Ignition system problems: Problems with the ignition system components such as the ignition coil, spark plugs, or spark plug wires can cause the engine to die while driving. 5. Electronic Control Module (ECM) malfunction: The ECM manages various engine functions, and if it malfunctions or fails, it can cause the engine to stall. 6. Sensor failure: A throttle position sensor or a mass airflow sensor might be faulty, leading to incorrect signals being sent to the engine control system and causing the engine to stall. 7. Vacuum leak: A vacuum leak in the engine can cause running issues and stalling. 8. Overheating: If the engine was overheating, it may stall as a protective measure to prevent damage. It is worth noting that this list is not exhaustive, and a professional mechanic should be consulted to diagnose and address the issue with your car. Second question: It is generally a good practice to let your car engine idle for a short period (usually around 30 seconds to a minute) after a long drive before turning it off. This allows the engine to cool down gradually and can help prevent issues such as overheating or turbocharger damage (if your car is equipped with a turbo system). It is especially important for turbocharged engines, as the turbocharger uses engine oil for lubrication and cooling, and turning the engine off immediately after a long drive can cause the oil to remain stagnant in the hot turbocharger, potentially leading to premature failure. To answer the third point, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question is asking about potential causes for an engine dying while driving, while the second question is about whether it is necessary to let the car engine idle before turning it off after a long drive.

The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.

'Let it be an arms race': Trump appears to double down on nuclear expansion Read more      Paul began with an explanation of the event, which takes its name from a holiday celebrated as an alternative to Christmas by the character Frank Costanza. “The airing of grievances” is one of the traditions of Festivus.      “On the media & #fakenews,” Paul wrote, “Festivus is real, media, so don’t try 2 fact check it.”      In reference to a recently suspended and rehabilitated NBC News anchor, he added: “And @TheOnion is more accurate than a Brian Williams report.”      “New administration is lookin [sic] good,” he continued. “Haven’t seen this many billionaires in 1 place since I staked out Bilderbergs w/ [conspiracy theorist and Trump supporter] Alex Jones. Good times.”      Subsequent tweets were critical of the tech billionaire Peter Thiel, who shares some of Paul’s libertarian views but who has been supportive of Donald Trump, and potential Trump appointments.      Of the George W Bush-era UN ambassador and noted foreign intervention hawk John Bolton, much to Paul’s dismay touted as a possible undersecretary of state, the senator wrote: “I know I’ve said a lot about @AmbJohnBolton so you’re probably expecting me 2 say something nice for the holidays. Nope. #AiringofGrievances.”      Of Rick Perry, who famously failed to name the Department of Energy as one he would abolish but who has now been nominated to lead it, Paul wrote: “My favorite cabinet pick is what’s his name, umm it’s that guy who wanted to eliminate the Dept of @ENERGY. Hang on I’ll think of it...”      Lest proceedings become too riotous, Paul proceeded to aim a barrage of tweets at what he alleged to be examples of federal government profligacy with taxpayers’ dollars.      Such targets included a state department grant to develop a Pakistani superhero, a study of Ugandan gambling practices, and a National Parks Service study of “Knowledge, Experience and Beliefs of the Supernatural Environment”. The last tweet came complete with a cat gif.

Rude.      “For the folks at @MSNBC, that was a joke.”      Lest anyone grow too excited, the senator also had a message for members of the press looking for something to write about on the last Friday afternoon before Christmas.      “For those of you ‘media’ writing serious stories about my Festivus jokes,” he wrote, “I don’t even know what to say, just stop...” ||||| Tweet with a location      You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Lesser charges: Richard Bowler, 35, (left) and David Connor, 23, (right) both of Canterbury, Kent, have had manslaughter charges against them in relation to the death of gay chef Alun Williams, but still face a lesser manslaughter by gross negligence charge The trial then heard OPTIONS: - Alun Williams's call after he was transferred to an ambulance service operator who told him how to carry out CPR. - Canterbury's call after he was transferred to an ambulance service operator who told him how to carry out CPR. - Canterbury Crown Court's call after he was transferred to an ambulance service operator who told him how to carry out CPR. - David Connor's call after he was transferred to an ambulance service operator who told him how to carry out CPR. - Kent's call after he was transferred to an ambulance service operator who told him how to carry out CPR. - Lesser's call after he was transferred to an ambulance service operator who told him how to carry out CPR. - P&O Ferries's call after he was transferred to an ambulance service operator who told him how to carry out CPR. - Richard Bowler's call after he was transferred to an ambulance service operator who told him how to carry out CPR. - Shepherdswell's call after he was transferred to an ambulance service operator who told him how to carry out CPR.","output":"David Connor's call after he was transferred to an ambulance service operator who told him how to carry out CPR. Explanation: In this situation, David Connor is one of the men on trial for negligence in Alun Williams' death. It makes sense that the next sentence would involve him contacting the ambulance service for help. The other options refer to places (Canterbury, Kent, Shepherdswell), companies (P&O Ferries), or things (Canterbury Crown Court, lesser charges) that would not make a call to an ambulance service. Additionally, Alun Williams is the victim, so he could not have made the call."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Instead of lunches at Lut��ce, they caucus at the Palace Diner in Queens. Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street corners, not securing box seats at Madison Square Garden. To make ends meet, one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse. Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab. A sign of failure, of a feeble economy, perhaps? Hardly. They are heeding the call of a growing pool of law schools, which are for the first time pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to get there. Forget the lure of large firms, the security of a government post. Here is how to grapple \\"in the service of justice,\\" as many of the schools put it, instead. Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely dent the nation's legal needs, the law schools are urging graduates to buck tradition, pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start their own, all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford. This is not pro bono legal work; it is \\"low bono,\\" a term the schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are training students for. While its practitioners do charge for their services, they are also dead set on turning no one away - or at least as few as possible. \\"When you go into this kind of social justice law, it's really brutal and you're almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of years before there's a light at the end of the tunnel,\\" said Fred Rooney, director of the Community Legal Resource Network at City University of New York School of Law, from which the lawyers of the newly formed Cates, Katalinic & Lund graduated last May. \\"But if our graduates don't do it, the millions of people who cannot access justice in this country will continue to soar.\\" The movement, primly called the consortium, started four years ago by CUNY, Northeastern University, the University of Maryland and St. Mary's Law School in Texas.

One advantage is, well, the water. There's plenty of it and it's all around. Therefore, most aquatic plants do not need adaptations for absorbing, transporting, and conserving water. They can save energy and matter by not growing extensive root systems, vascular tissues, or thick cuticle on leaves. Support is also less of a problem because of the buoyancy of water. As a result, adaptations such as strong woody stems and deep anchoring roots are not necessary for most aquatic plants.   Q: What type of plants do not typically require deep roots or woody stems?

It merely describes a snapshot of a moment where two dogs are gazing out into the street. The fact that they are sitting next to a bicycle might as well be coincidental and unrelated to the perceived sense of security they may provide.  Secondly, we are not given any information about the dogs' temperament, behavior, or training. They might simply be relaxing and enjoying the view rather than actively watching out for potential threats. Even if the dogs were intentionally keeping a lookout, we are not offered any evidence of their ability to protect or respond to danger effectively. Additionally, the statement doesn't clarify whether the dogs are keeping an eye on their surroundings to ensure safety or merely observing passing events out of curiosity or interest. Canine behavior can have various motivations, and without further information, it's impossible to determine the exact purpose behind their actions. Lastly, the notion of a \\"good job\\" in terms of safety is highly subjective. Safeguarding entails a variety of tasks such as deterring potential intruders, alerting others to possible threats, and responding effectively in case of an emergency. With the limited information given, we cannot ascertain whether these dogs possess the necessary skills to perform these tasks or whether they have a history of successfully ensuring safety.

Here is a news article: Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption US President Barack Obama said Nelson Mandela lived \\"a life like no other\\"      Tens of thousands of South Africans have joined dozens of world leaders for the national memorial service for former President Nelson Mandela.      The service was held in front of a vociferous crowd in the FNB stadium in Johannesburg.      US President Barack Obama said Mr Mandela was a \\"giant of history\\", describing him as the last great liberator of the 20th Century.      The former South African president died last Thursday, aged 95.      The country is observing a series of commemorations leading up to the funeral on Sunday.      At the scene \\"It took a man like Madiba to free not just the prisoner but the jailer,\\" US President Barack Obama said, to a standing ovation. He said Nelson Mandela embodied the spirit of \\"uBuntu\\", which means \\"I am because you are\\". Thousands braved the unseasonably cold weather and rain to pay their respects to the country's first black president at the FNB stadium in Soweto. This is where he addressed the nation on the day of his release in 1990. The crowds were in high spirits but were asked to \\"behave\\" after booing President Jacob Zuma a number of times. But despite a difficult start, President Zuma delivered his message, describing Madiba as \\"truly one of a kind\\". He said Mr Mandela was a kind man but had a sharp tongue, especially when it came to something he believed in. Mr Zuma will have been relieved to hear some cheering at the end of the speech. Mandela memorial binds South Africans      'A mighty life'      The memorial service, which began at about 12:00 (10:00 GMT), lasted about four hours.      It was one of the biggest gatherings of international dignitaries in recent years, with more than 100 current or former heads of state or government attending.      There had been fears people would be turned away. But with heavy rain, security and transport issues, and the fact that Tuesday was not declared a national holiday, areas of the 95,000-capacity stadium remained empty.      Introducing the proceedings, the master of ceremonies, Cyril Ramaphosa, said that Mr Mandela's \\"long walk is over... and he can finally rest\\".      Current South African President Jacob Zuma made the keynote address but was booed in some parts of the ceremony.      He said Mr Mandela was \\"one of a kind... a fearless freedom fighter who refused to allow the brutality of the apartheid state to stand in way of the struggle for the liberation of his people\\".      Mr Zuma announced he was renaming the Union Buildings in Pretoria, where Mr Mandela will lie in state, as the Mandela Amphitheatre.      Earlier Mr Obama delivered his address, carried on the White House web site, to huge cheers. He said: \\"It is hard to eulogise any man... how much harder to do so for a giant of history, who moved a nation towards justice.\\"      He said Nelson Mandela had taught the world the power of action and the power of ideas, and that it had taken a man like Mr Mandela to free not only the prisoner but also the jailer.

While I will always fall short of Madiba (Mr Mandela's clan name), he makes me want to be a better man.\\"      On his way to the podium, President Obama shook hands with Cuban President Raul Castro, an unprecedented gesture between the leaders of two nations that have been at loggerheads for more than half a century.      A White House official later said the two had not planned to meet.      \\"This wasn't a pre-planned encounter,\\" the official said, quoted by AFP news agency.      \\"Above all else, today is about honouring Nelson Mandela, and that was the president's singular focus at the memorial service.

He was one of our greatest teachers. He taught by example. He sacrificed so much and was willing to give up all he had for freedom and democracy.\\"      The first speaker, friend and fellow Robben Island inmate Andrew Mlangeni, said Mr Mandela had \\"created hope when there was none\\".      Many people stood in the rain waiting for several hours to get into the stadium, the BBC's Pumza Fihlani reports from the scene.      She says the crowds were in high spirits - singing and dancing, stomping their feet - and the stadium had the feel of a political rally.      Rather than seeing the rain as a dampener, many in South Africa have welcomed it.      Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula said: \\"It's a blessing from the ancestors welcoming a son of the soil.\\"      Analysis That Jacob Zuma was booed at the Nelson Mandela memorial is unfortunate. This was not an occasion to take pot shots. But it shows that South Africa is a robust democracy - such booing would not have been tolerated in many other countries. People would have been too afraid to voice their rage at the president. Nevertheless, Mr Zuma ought to be worried - will it be the death knell for his political career? He is due to lead the ANC into elections next year. A faction is bound to lobby for him to be ousted, in favour of Cyril Ramaphosa, his deputy in the party. Acting as master of ceremonies, Mr Ramaphosa received a far better reception from the crowd. He was next to Mr Mandela when he was released from prison in 1990, and was the chief architect of South Africa's democratic constitution. At the time, he was widely seen as Mr Mandela's heir but was outmanoeuvred in the political chess game within the ANC to choose the legend's successor.      One of those attending, Shahida Rowe from Johannesburg, told the BBC: \\"The core of Mandela's life was humanity. That is why I am here today and the world is celebrating.      \\"Thanks to him, I was recognised as a human being.\\"      Mr Mandela's widow, Graca Machel, arrived at the stadium to huge cheers as she was shown on the big screen.      There were cheers too of \\"Winnie! Winnie!\\" for ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who hugged and kissed Graca Machel.      Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, Chinese Vice-President Li Yuanchao, President Hifikepunye Pohamba of Namibia and Indian President Pranab Mukherjee also made speeches.      The ceremony was closed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who asked the crowd to rise to their feet for a final tribute.      The BBC's Mike Wooldridge in Johannesburg says the line-up of world leaders is a sign of how South Africa has seen its partners and place in the world since Nelson Mandela became president.      But, he adds, today is as personal as it is political - a recognition that there are lessons for the wider world in everything Nelson Mandela sought to achieve.

How much harder to do so for a giant of history, who moved a nation toward justice, and in the process moved billions around the world.      Born during World War I, far from the corridors of power, a boy raised herding cattle and tutored by the elders of his Thembu tribe, Madiba would emerge as the last great liberator of the 20th century. Like Gandhi, he would lead a resistance movement -- a movement that at its start had little prospect for success. Like Dr. King, he would give potent voice to the claims of the oppressed and the moral necessity of racial justice. He would endure a brutal imprisonment that began in the time of Kennedy and Khrushchev, and reached the final days of the Cold War. Emerging from prison, without the force of arms, he would -- like Abraham Lincoln -- hold his country together when it threatened to break apart. And like America’s Founding Fathers, he would erect a constitutional order to preserve freedom for future generations -- a commitment to democracy and rule of law ratified not only by his election, but by his willingness to step down from power after only one term.      Given the sweep of his life, the scope of his accomplishments, the adoration that he so rightly earned, it’s tempting I think to remember Nelson Mandela as an icon, smiling and serene, detached from the tawdry affairs of lesser men. But Madiba himself strongly resisted such a lifeless portrait. Instead, Madiba insisted on sharing with us his doubts and his fears; his miscalculations along with his victories. “I am not a saint,” he said, “unless you think of a saint as a sinner who keeps on trying.”      It was precisely because he could admit to imperfection -- because he could be so full of good humor, even mischief, despite the heavy burdens he carried -- that we loved him so. He was not a bust made of marble; he was a man of flesh and blood -- a son and a husband, a father and a friend. And that’s why we learned so much from him, and that’s why we can learn from him still. For nothing he achieved was inevitable. In the arc of his life, we see a man who earned his place in history through struggle and shrewdness, and persistence and faith. He tells us what is possible not just in the pages of history books, but in our own lives as well.      Mandela showed us the power of action; of taking risks on behalf of our ideals. Perhaps Madiba was right that he inherited, “a proud rebelliousness, a stubborn sense of fairness” from his father. And we know he shared with millions of black and colored South Africans the anger born of, “a thousand slights, a thousand indignities, a thousand unremembered moments…a desire to fight the system that imprisoned my people,” he said.      But like other early giants of the ANC -- the Sisulus and Tambos -- Madiba disciplined his anger and channeled his desire to fight into organization, and platforms, and strategies for action, so men and women could stand up for their God-given dignity. Moreover, he accepted the consequences of his actions, knowing that standing up to powerful interests and injustice carries a price. “I have fought against white domination and I have fought against black domination. I’ve cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and [with] equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.”      Mandela taught us the power of action, but he also taught us the power of ideas; the importance of reason and arguments; the need to study not only those who you agree with, but also those who you don’t agree with. He understood that ideas cannot be contained by prison walls, or extinguished by a sniper’s bullet. He turned his trial into an indictment of apartheid because of his eloquence and his passion, but also because of his training as an advocate. He used decades in prison to sharpen his arguments, but also to spread his thirst for knowledge to others in the movement. And he learned the language and the customs of his oppressor so that one day he might better convey to them how their own freedom depend upon his.      Mandela demonstrated that action and ideas are not enough. No matter how right, they must be chiseled into law and institutions. He was practical, testing his beliefs against the hard surface of circumstance and history. On core principles he was unyielding, which is why he could rebuff offers of unconditional release, reminding the Apartheid regime that “prisoners cannot enter into contracts.”      But as he showed in painstaking negotiations to transfer power and draft new laws, he was not afraid to compromise for the sake of a larger goal. And because he was not only a leader of a movement but a skillful politician, the Constitution that emerged was worthy of this multiracial democracy, true to his vision of laws that protect minority as well as majority rights, and the precious freedoms of every South African.      And finally, Mandela understood the ties that bind the human spirit. There is a word in South Africa -- Ubuntu -- a word that captures Mandela’s greatest gift: his recognition that we are all bound together in ways that are invisible to the eye; that there is a oneness to humanity; that we achieve ourselves by sharing ourselves with others, and caring for those around us.      We can never know how much of this sense was innate in him, or how much was shaped in a dark and solitary cell. But we remember the gestures, large and small -- introducing his jailers as honored guests at his inauguration; taking a pitch in a Springbok uniform; turning his family’s heartbreak into a call to confront HIV/AIDS -- that revealed the depth of his empathy and his understanding. He not only embodied Ubuntu, he taught millions to find that truth within themselves.      It took a man like Madiba to free not just the prisoner, but the jailer as well to show that you must trust others so that they may trust you; to teach that reconciliation is not a matter of ignoring a cruel past, but a means of confronting it with inclusion and generosity and truth. He changed laws, but he also changed hearts.      For the people of South Africa, for those he inspired around the globe, Madiba’s passing is rightly a time of mourning, and a time to celebrate a heroic life. But I believe it should also prompt in each of us a time for self-reflection. With honesty, regardless of our station or our circumstance, we must ask: How well have I applied his lessons in my own life? It’s a question I ask myself, as a man and as a President.      We know that, like South Africa, the United States had to overcome centuries of racial subjugation. As was true here, it took sacrifice -- the sacrifice of countless people, known and unknown, to see the dawn of a new day. Michelle and I are beneficiaries of that struggle. But in America, and in South Africa, and in countries all around the globe, we cannot allow our progress to cloud the fact that our work is not yet done.      The struggles that follow the victory of formal equality or universal franchise may not be as filled with drama and moral clarity as those that came before, but they are no less important. For around the world today, we still see children suffering from hunger and disease. We still see run-down schools. We still see young people without prospects for the future. Around the world today, men and women are still imprisoned for their political beliefs, and are still persecuted for what they look like, and how they worship, and who they love. That is happening today.      And so we, too, must act on behalf of justice. We, too, must act on behalf of peace. There are too many people who happily embrace Madiba’s legacy of racial reconciliation, but passionately resist even modest reforms that would challenge chronic poverty and growing inequality. There are too many leaders who claim solidarity with Madiba’s struggle for freedom, but do not tolerate dissent from their own people. And there are too many of us on the sidelines, comfortable in complacency or cynicism when our voices must be heard.      The questions we face today -- how to promote equality and justice; how to uphold freedom and human rights; how to end conflict and sectarian war -- these things do not have easy answers. But there were no easy answers in front of that child born in World War I. Nelson Mandela reminds us that it always seems impossible until it is done. South Africa shows that is true. South Africa shows we can change, that we can choose a world defined not by our differences, but by our common hopes. We can choose a world defined not by conflict, but by peace and justice and opportunity.      We will never see the likes of Nelson Mandela again. But let me say to the young people of Africa and the young people around the world -- you, too, can make his life’s work your own. Over 30 years ago, while still a student, I learned of Nelson Mandela and the struggles taking place in this beautiful land, and it stirred something in me. It woke me up to my responsibilities to others and to myself, and it set me on an improbable journey that finds me here today. And while I will always fall short of Madiba’s example, he makes me want to be a better man. He speaks to what’s best inside us.      After this great liberator is laid to rest, and when we have returned to our cities and villages and rejoined our daily routines, let us search for his strength. Let us search for his largeness of spirit somewhere inside of ourselves. And when the night grows dark, when injustice weighs heavy on our hearts, when our best-laid plans seem beyond our reach, let us think of Madiba and the words that brought him comfort within the four walls of his cell: “It matters not how strait the gate, how charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.”      What a magnificent soul it was. We will miss him deeply. May God bless the memory of Nelson Mandela. May God bless the people of South Africa. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The article is a detailed account of the memorial service held for former South African President Nelson Mandela, attended by tens of thousands of South Africans and numerous world leaders.

Context: The Cubs enjoyed one more pennant at the close of World War II, finishing 98–56. Due to the wartime travel restrictions, the first three games of the 1945 World Series were played in Detroit, where the Cubs won two games, including a one-hitter by Claude Passeau, and the final four were played at Wrigley. In Game 4 of the Series, the Curse of the Billy Goat was allegedly laid upon the Cubs when P.K. Wrigley ejected Billy Sianis, who had come to Game 4 with two box seat tickets, one for him and one for his goat. They paraded around for a few innings, but Wrigley demanded the goat leave the park due to its unpleasant odor. Upon his ejection, Mr. Sianis uttered, \\"The Cubs, they ain't gonna win no more.\\" The Cubs lost Game 4, lost the Series, and have not been back since. It has also been said by many that Sianis put a \\"curse\\" on the Cubs, apparently preventing the team from playing in the World Series. After losing the 1945 World Series to the Detroit Tigers, the Cubs finished with winning seasons the next two years, but those teams did not enter post-season play.

Potential energy: This is more about the energy that an object has due to its position or form. In the context of a machine's wheels and gears, greasing won't change its potential energy. So this answer would not be considered. 2. Efficiency: The efficiency of a machine refers to how much of the input energy is converted to output energy. Greasing would actually increase efficiency by reducing wasted energy (due to heat from friction). So, this option is incorrect. 3. Output: This refers to the net work or energy produced by the machine. Greasing might increase output indirectly by improving efficiency but it primarily does not directly affect the output. Therefore, this option is not directly correct. 4. Friction: This is the resistance to motion of one object moving relative to another. It's known that machines are greased to reduce friction so that the parts can move more smoothly. This helps in increasing the lifespan of these parts and also improves the machine's efficiency as there's less energy wasted as heat due to friction.

Answer for Question 2: Converting SWF files to PDF files can be done using a specialized SWF-to-PDF converter software or an online conversion service. Below is a method to convert SWF files to PDF using a versatile converter software, XabeSwfToImage: 1. Download and install XabeSwfToImage available at https://github.com/tomaszzmuda/Xabe.FFmpeg 2. Set up the command-line option by opening the Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac). 3. Use XabeSwfToImage to convert your SWF file to an image format (e.g., PNG) using the command: \`\`\` XabeSwfToImage -i input.swf -o output.png \`\`\` Replace 'input.swf' with the path to your SWF file and 'output.png' with the desired output file path. 4. Use a PDF conversion tool (e.g., ImageMagick) to convert the output image to a PDF file with the command: \`\`\` convert output.png output.pdf \`\`\` Replace 'output.png' with the path to the output image file and 'output.pdf' with the desired PDF output file path. Now, you will have a PDF file generated from your initial SWF file. No, the answers to these two questions are not the same.

Article: Children who see their parents drunk are twice likely to get drunk themselves, a survey of young teenagers has suggested. Poor parental supervision also raises the chances of teenage drinking, said the Joesph Rowntree Foundation. If parents don't know where their children are on a Saturday night, or let them watch films of violence, they are more likely to have had an alcoholic drink.     The survey also found the behavior of friends is also a powerful factor in drinking habits. The more time teenagers spend with friends, the more likely they are to drink alcohol. In this survey of 5,700 children aged 13 to 16, carried out by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, researchers found that one in five wanted to have a drink by the time they were 14. By the age of 16, half of those questioned said they had been drunk.     Pamela Bremner, scientist of the survey, said, \\"For the first time in the UK, this study shows what most influences young people's drinking behavior.\\"     \\"It found that the behavior of friends and family is the most common influential factor in determining how likely and how often a young person will drink alcohol.\\"     Don Shenker, Chief Executive of Alcohol Concern, said, \\"Government ministers must also look at some of the causes of why it is so easy for children to get alcohol, usually from the home.\\"     \\"Governments should look to see if they've done everything they can to help the large supermarkets from continuing to sell cheap alcohol which encourages more alcohol sales and therefore results in more alcohol being stored in the home.\\"     The Royal College of Physicians also said it was not surprising that being able to get alcohol easily was an important factor on current drinking problems and drunkenness of teenagers.     A statement said, \\"This shows that the government needs to focus more attention on increasing the price of alcohol, and increasing education and national campaigns for both young people and their families on the dangers of alcohol.\\" Question: How many teenagers admitted that they had been drunk in the survey carried out by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation? Answer: Possible answers: [1]. About 5700.; [2]. About 1200.; [3]. About 2800.; [4]. About 4200.; The answer is:","output":"[3]. About 2800.

Zale Dalen is a Canadian film director. 2. He is proud of his film, \\"The Hounds of Notre Dame.\\" For the first part, the paragraph clearly states that Zale Dalen is a Canadian film and television director. Thus, this part of the hypothesis is true. For the second part of the hypothesis, although it is established that Zale Dalen directed \\"The Hounds of Notre Dame\\" and received a Genie Award nomination for Best Director for the film at the 2nd Genie Awards in 1981, there is no direct information provided on whether he is proud of the film or not. It could be inferred that the nomination might have brought some level of pride or satisfaction for the director, as it typically reflects appreciation and recognition of his work in the film industry. However, since there is no explicit mention of his feelings towards the film in the paragraph, confirming his pride in the film would involve making an assumption based on limited information. In conclusion, the first part of the hypothesis is true, as Zale Dalen is indeed a Canadian film director.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Narendra Damodardas Modi (Gujarati: ['n@re:ndr@ da:mo:d@r'da:s 'mo:di:] ( listen); born 17 September 1950) is an Indian politician serving as the 16th and current Prime Minister of India since 2014. He was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, and is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi. During Modi's second term the rhetoric of the government shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic development. Modi curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivar organisations such as the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), entrenched in the state after the decline of Ahmedabad's textile industry, and dropped Gordhan Zadafia (an ally of former Sangh co-worker and VHP state chief Praveen Togadia) from his cabinet. When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration Modi ordered their eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP. Sangh organisations were no longer consulted or informed in advance about Modi's administrative decisions. Nonetheless, Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. Modi wrote a foreword to a textbook by Dinanath Batra released in 2014, which stated that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies.  Modi's relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee (who asked Modi for tolerance in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat violence and supported his resignation as chief minister) distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. After the elections Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP's electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots.  Questions about Modi's relationship with Muslims were also raised by many Western nations during his tenure as chief minister. Modi was barred from entering the United States by the State Department, in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission on International Religious Freedom formed under the aegis of the International Religious Freedom Act, the only person denied a US visa under this law. The UK and the European Union refused to admit him because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK and the EU lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister he was invited to Washington.  During the run-up to the 2007 assembly elections and the 2009 general election, the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism. In July 2006, Modi criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh \\" for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation\\" such as the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act. He asked the national government to allow states to invoke tougher laws in the wake of the 2006 Mumbai train bombings. In 2007 Modi authored Karmayog, a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging. In it, Modi argued that scavenging was a \\"spiritual experience\\" for Dalits. However, this book was not circulated that time because of the election code of conduct. After the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, Modi held a meeting to discuss the security of Gujarat's 1,600-kilometre (990 mi)-long coastline, resulting in government authorisation of 30 high-speed surveillance boats. In July 2007 Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post, and the BJP won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that year's election.  As Chief Minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth Rs6.6 trillion were signed.  The governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects. By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them. Sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010. As a result, the state's production of genetically modified cotton increased to become the largest in India. The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use led to Gujarat's agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007. Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project only irrigated 4-6% of the area intended. Nonetheless, from 2001 to 2010 Gujarat recorded an agricultural growth rate of 10.97 percent - the highest of any state. However, sociologists have pointed out that the growth rate under the 1992-97 INC government was 12.9 percent. In 2008 Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano after a popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal. Several other companies followed the Tata's to Gujarat.  The Modi government finished the process of bringing electricity to every village in Gujarat that its predecessor had almost completed. Modi significantly changed the state's system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Although early protests by farmers ended when those who benefited found that their electricity supply had stabilised, according to an assessment study corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers.  During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India.  Despite the BJP's shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi's election campaign in 2007 and 2012 contained elements of Hindu nationalism. Modi only attended Hindu religious ceremonies, and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign he twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by Muslim leaders. He did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra. His campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including to Afzal Guru and the killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh. The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the assembly election of 2012. He had published a Gujarati book titled Jyotipunj in 2008, containing profiles of various RSS leaders. The longest was of M. S. Golwalkar, under whose leadership the RSS expanded and whom Modi refers to as Pujniya Shri Guruji (\\"Guru worthy of worship\\"). According to The Economic Times, his intention was to explain the workings of the RSS to his readers and to reassure RSS members that he remained ideologically aligned with them. Modi authored eight other books, mostly containing short stories for children.  While campaigning for the 2012 assembly elections, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies allowing him to reach a large number of people, something he would repeat in the 2014 general election. In the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections, Modi won the constituency of Maninagar by 86,373 votes over Shweta Bhatt, the INC candidate and wife of Sanjiv Bhatt. The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure and allowing the party to form the government (as it had in Gujarat since 1995). In later by-elections the BJP won four more assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats held by the INC, although Modi did not campaign for its candidates. In 2013, the Wharton India Economic Forum (WIEF) at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania cancelled a keynote video-conference speech by Modi following protests by Indian-Americans. After his election as prime minister, Modi resigned as the chief minister and as an MLA from Maninagar on 21 May 2014. Anandiben Patel succeeded him as the chief minister.

This is a question with answer options. Goal: how do you count? Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? Pick your answer from: (1). go upward from number 1.; (2). go downward from number 10.;...I think the answer is","output":"I think the answer is (1). go upward from number 1. Both methods can be used to count but option (1) is more reasonable for accomplishing the goal, and here is a detailed explanation of why: 1. Natural counting process: Starting to count from the number 1 aligns with the most basic and intuitive method of counting. It corresponds to the natural progression of numbers, and hence, it is easier for people to comprehend and perform. Going upward from number 1 mimics the way we have learned to count since childhood, and it is the most commonly used method across various tasks and situations. 2. Universality: Counting from 1 upwards adheres to the standard mathematical notation and conventions used in various cultures and languages around the world. This method is universally understood, which promotes better communication and minimizes confusion. 3. Limitless counting range: When counting upward from number 1, it is easy to keep track of the ongoing count, and there is no particular limit or upper boundary on the numbers. This enables you to count an indefinite amount of items or keep track of progress without any constraints. On the other hand, counting downward from a specific number (such as 10) is limited and requires constant adjustments if the counting range exceeds the starting point. 4. Less cognitive load: Starting to count at 1 and going upwards requires less cognitive effort as opposed to counting down from a higher number. For most people, counting upwards is an automated response, whereas counting down may warrant additional mental exertion due to the need for continuous arithmetic (i.e., subtraction) and the constant updating of the initial number. 5. Practical applications: In real-life situations, counting upwards from 1 is often more practical. For instance, when counting the number of people attending an event, it is logical to start at 1 and continue counting upward as more individuals arrive. Likewise, counting from 1 is useful when measuring things like time, distance, or the amount of a particular object (e.g., inventory, money, etc.). These applications often rely on a starting point of 0 or 1, hence making the upward counting method more suitable. In summary, counting upward from number 1 is the more reasonable method to accomplish the goal of counting because it aligns with the natural counting process, has universal applicability, provides a limitless counting range, requires less cognitive effort, and is more practical for various applications. While counting downward from number 10 can still be used to count, it brings certain limitations and challenges that make option (1) the better choice overall."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Law enforcement lost public's trust after NSA leaks, says UK police chief Law enforcement agencies lost the public’s trust after disclosures on government surveillance by the whistleblower Edward Snowden and must ensure that they strike the right balance between privacy and security, the UK’s most senior police officer said on Thursday. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, commissioner of the Metropolitan police in London, told a conference of senior American police chiefs that authorities must take care “post-Snowden” to use the most intrusive surveillance tools available to them “only where necessary”, or “risk losing them altogether”. “We need to ensure that where law enforcement accesses private communications there is a process of authorisation, oversight and governance that gets the balance right between the individual’s right to privacy and their right to be protected from serious crime,” said Hogan-Howe, whose force that takes the lead on police counter-terrorism efforts in the UK. Speaking at an event in New York on Thursday, Hogan-Howe told fellow chiefs including Bill Bratton, the commissioner of the New York police department: “There is work to be done to restore the public’s trust that we are acting in their best interests.” The remarks appeared to contrast with more strident comments made by other senior British officials including David Cameron, the prime minister, who last year accused Snowden and newspapers such as the Guardian who published his disclosures of “helping our enemies”. However, Hogan-Howe also used his speech to rail against an increase in online security and encryption that has followed the revelations from Snowden, a contractor for the US National Security Agency (NSA) who leaked a cache of documents disclosing controversial electronic surveillance programs run there and at GCHQ, the NSA’s sister agency in the UK. Authorities have complained bitterly in particular about the latest update to the operating system for Apple’s iPhones, which upgraded the encryption on users’ data so as to prevent it from being accessible for handing over to law enforcement agencies. Hogan-Howe claimed that the internet was at risk of becoming a “dark and ungoverned space” because encryption and security measures on communications devices were now “beyond what any genuine domestic user could reasonably require”. Bratton told a press conference afterwards that the Islamic State (Isis) were using “increasingly sophisticated recruiting efforts” such as social media and well-produced websites “to actively recruit and successively recruit” jihadists. Hogan-Howe said that counter-terrorism officials in the UK were removing 1,000 pieces of “illegal content” from the web each week. “We cannot police the whole internet, but we will continue to do what we can.” Stressing that 500 Britons had travelled to join the conflict in Iraq and Syria, the Met police chief said that the threat of these people returning as militarised jihadists must be dealt with. However he also said that recent isolated attacks on police and military personnel in New York and Canada highlighted the need to be watchful of so-called “lone wolf” attackers. After telling the conference that “privacy is important”, Hogan-Howe was asked by the Guardian whether it was acceptable that British security were reported earlier on Thursday to be intercepting traditionally privileged communications between lawyers and their clients. Claiming not to have seen the specific reports, Hogan-Howe said he would be “amazed” if officials at MI5 and GCHQ were routinely eavesdropping on attorney-client conversations, adding: “That is very legally restricted unless the lawyer is involved with crime.” “It’s very clear what the law says, which is obviously that there is a legal privilege that exists between a lawyer and their client,” he said. And that is greatly respected.” The Met police chief said that despite the elevation in the government’s official threat level to “severe” in August this year, there was at present no direct intelligence indicating a planned attack in the near future. He declined to address when asked the likelihood of a terrorist plot being hatched using online communications to which law enforcement agencies no longer had access.

Emily had twelve pet cats.; [B]. Megan had twelve pet cats.;","output":"Emily enjoyed playing with cats and combing their fur much more than Megan did, since Emily had twelve pet cats. This meant that Emily was quite accustomed to their distinct personalities, their individual preferences, and their unique quirks. These adorable creatures had become an integral part of Emily's life, bringing her endless joy and companionship. Emily, over the years, had learned how to expertly care for their needs, ensuring they remained healthy, happy, and well-groomed. Megan, on the other hand, didn't share the same level of enthusiasm or experience with cats as Emily did. Having twelve cats of her own might have allowed her to familiarize herself with their world better, but that wasn't the case. Megan's interests and hobbies differed from Emily's, and the cat-combing activity was enjoyable for her but not as deeply fulfilling as it was for Emily. Additionally, caring for twelve pet cats entailed a significant level of responsibility and commitment, which Emily happily embraced. She always made sure that her feline companions received the best possible care - from nutritious meals to regular vet checkups, from playtime to cozy napping spots. Each of her cats had a special bond with her, and it was evident to anyone who witnessed their interactions. As Emily combed the fur of her beloved cats, she could identify them by their markings, size, and the feel of their fur. There was Fluffy, the giant Maine Coon with majestic fur, Ginger, the feisty and playful orange tabby, and Luna, the elegant silver-furred beauty who adored cuddling with Emily during quiet evenings. Megan, while appreciating the serene presence of these lovable creatures, didn't quite grasp the level of joy that Emily drew from these moments. Nevertheless, she still respected and admired Emily's dedication to her feline companions and participated in the cat-combing sessions, even if it meant playing a supporting role. Emily knew that Megan didn't share her passion for cats, but it never caused a rift between them. Instead, Emily felt grateful for having a friend who accepted her love for cats and joined her in taking care of them, even if sometimes it was just to keep Emily company. They had their shared interests, of course - movie nights, shopping trips, and lazy Sunday brunches - but in the end, the friendship flourished despite the differing levels of affinity towards their plushy little furballs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Also, without more information or context, we can't assess whether the name was unusual to this person due to their specific circumstances or cultural background, or because it’s universally bizarre. What is considered outlandish could differ from person to person based on their experiences or cultural contexts. A name that seems unusual in one cultural or linguistic context might be relatively normal in another.

Two Jessops stores will open today in London's Oxford Street and Birmingham, with four others opening over the Easter weekend in Manchester, Aberdeen, High Wycombe and St Albans. Up to 30 more Jessops stores are due to re-open in April, as part of a £5 million investment. Scroll down for video.

Open: Peter Jones stands outside the Jessops store in Oxford Street, central London. Relaunch: Staff pose for pictures inside the newly opened Jessops store in Birmingham. Jessops called in administrators PwC in January, leading to the closure of all 187 Jessops stores and the loss of almost 1,500 jobs. Later that month Mr Jones and other investors bought the brand and certain assets. The entrepreneur is the sole owner of the relaunched camera store chain. The company has pledged to create 500 jobs with its relaunch - with the majority going to former Jessops staff who lost their jobs when the chain collapsed. Mr Jones, who appears as an investor on the BBC reality TV series about entrepreneurs, will take the role of chief executive and chairman. He said: 'I believe Jessops is an iconic British brand which can lead the retail resurgence on Britain's high streets, powered by new innovations and world-leading, expert staff. 'Image is everything, and even in the mobile and tablet era, there's no substitute for a quality camera when it comes to taking the perfect picture.' Re-opened: Peter Jones (right) and comedian James Corden (left) pose for photographs in a re-opened branch of the Jessops camera retail chain on Oxford Street in London.

Closure: Jessops called in administrators PwC in January, leading to the closure of all 187 Jessops stores and the loss of almost 1,500 jobs. Mr Jones opened the Oxford Street store today with TV comic James Corden. The. relaunched company is forecasting sales of at least £80 million in its. first year, which it said will give it 15 per cent of the DSLR camera. market in the UK. Jessops also promised greater integration with its. online presence, including an option to collect internet orders at. store. The camera giant was. the first high-profile retail casualty of 2013, after suffering from. online competition and a boom in camera phones in recent years, which. hit demand for digital cameras. Hands-on: The relaunched company is forecasting sales of at least £80 million in its first year. At its appointment, PwC said the company's core market had seen a 'significant decline' in 2012, while forecast profits over Christmas did not materialise, squeezing its funding. Jessops had struggled since 2007, when it underwent a major overhaul with a swathe of store closures. The firm began life in 1935 when Frank Jessop opened his first shop in Leicester. Writing in The Sun today, Mr Jones said while 'so-called experts' say the High Street no future, he believes 'the facts say otherwise'. 'Devastating effect': Staff from the Warrington branch of Jessops plastered their photos in the window of the store in the hope of finding new employment after its closure was announced. Mr Jones said shopper numbers on the High Street were up by 2.7 per cent last month compared to the previous year, according to the British Retail Consortium. He said while the business could have been relaunched online, he knew there was a desire for a 'proper shopping experience'. He said: 'I also think it's time we snapped out of our negativity about the economy, and got behind the great British brands and institutions that can lead the recovery. 'That's why I've declared myself \\"in\\" to what I think will be the first step in the revival of our high streets.' He added things were looking up for British shoppers, with Blockbuster also set to re-open in the near future. The High Street has seen some turbulent times in recent years, but the latest development could be a sign of changing fortunes. December 2008: MFI, the furniture retailer, was one of the first major firms to go out of business at the start of the downturn, as retail sales began to fall following a sharp rise in unemploymentWoolworths. January 2009: Woolworths shuttered its 800 stores, bringing home to many the scale of the UK's economic collapse as the country entered recession for the first time. February 2009: Zavvi stopped trading around Christmas - and refused to honour its gift cards, leading to widespread customer anger. In trouble: Electrical giant Comet closed its doors for the last time shortly before Christmas while music chain HMV called in administrators in January. December 2009: Borders was another entertainment behemoth to go under as sale of CDs and DVDs were squeezed by digital downloads and online retailers. October 2012: JJB Sports closed all but 20 of its stores, which were taken over and re-branded by Sports Direct - leading to the death of the JJB brand and 550 employees losing their jobs. December 2012: Comet shut down just before Christmas, leaving nearly 7,000 staff out of work and forcing the taxpayer to pick up a £50million tab related to its bankruptcy, which was blamed on soaring energy prices and a reduction in the number of home buyers. January 2013: Jessops was closed by administrator PwC earlier this month after years of struggling with online competition as customers turned away from traditional photography. January 2013: HMV, which has 239 shops and 4,500 staff, announced that it was calling in administrators. The company came under fire for not honouring gift vouchers which they had been selling all over Christmas. January 2013: Blockbusters, called in administrator Deloitte who announced that 129 stores across the UK would close and 760 employees would lose their jobs. February 2013: Fashion chain Republic collapses into administration putting 2,500 jobs at risk. March 2013: Blockbuster is sold to restrucuring specialists Gordon Brothers Europe for an undisclosed sum, saving 2,00 jobs and 264 UK stores.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Have you ever had the strange feeling that you were being watched? You turned around and, sure enough, someone was looking right at you! Parapsychologists   say that humans have a natural ability to sense when someone is looking at them. To research whether such a \\"sixth sense\\" really exists, Robert Baker, a psychologist at the University of Kentucky, performed two experiments. In the first one, Baker sat behind unknowing people in public places and stared at the backs of their heads for 5 to 15 minutes. The subjects were eating, drinking, reading, studying, watching TV, or working at a computer. Baker made sure that the people could not tell that he was sitting behind them during those periods. Later, when he questioned the subjects, almost all of them said they had no sense that someone was staring at them. For the second experiment, Baker told the subjects that they would be stared at from time to time from behind a two way mirror in a laboratory setting. The people had to write down when they felt they were being stared at and when they weren't. Baker found that the subjects were no better at telling when they were stared at and when they weren't. and they were no better at telling when they were stared at than if they had just guessed. Baker concludes that people do not have the ability to sense when they're being stared at. If people doubt the outcome of his two experiments, said baker, \\"I suggest they repeat the experiments and see for themselves.\\" The purpose of the two experiments is to  _  . A) explain when people can have a sixth sense B) show how people act while being watched in the lab C) study whether humans can sense when they are stared at D) prove why humans have a sixth sense The answer is:","output":"C) study whether humans can sense when they are stared at The purpose of Robert Baker's two experiments was to examine the claim purported by several parapsychologists that humans have an inherent \\"sixth sense\\" enabling them to perceive when they are being observed or stared at by someone else. Both experiments were designed in such a way to test this hypothesis: in the first, he observed people in public without their knowledge and afterwards questioned them about their awareness of being watched; in the second, he mobilized a controlled laboratory setting where subjects knew they could be stared at from behind a two-way mirror and were required to record their feelings of being watched. The results from both experiments led Baker to conclude that humans do not have an inherent ability to sense when they're being stared at, as test subjects weren't able to discern any better than chance whether they were being watched or not."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Recent research from Germany and Italy shows that heart attacks are more common on Monday mornings and doctors blame the stress of returning to work after the weekend break. The risk of having a heart attack on any given day should be one in seven, but a six-year study helped by researchers at the Free University of Berlin of more than 2, 600 Germans showed that the average person had a 20 percent higher chance of having a heart attack on a Monday than on any other day. Working Germans are particularly not protected against attack, with a 33 percent higher risk at the beginning of the working week. Non-workers, by comparison, appear to be no more at risk on a Monday than any other day. A study of 11, 000 Italians proved 8 a. m. on a Monday morning as the most stressful time for the heart, and both studies showed that Sunday is the least stressful day, with fewest heart attacks in both countries. The finding could lead to a better understanding of what is the immediate cause of heart attacks, according to Dr Stefan Willich of the Free University. \\"We know a lot about long-term risk factors such as smoking and cholesterol but we don't know what actually causes heart attacks, so we can't give clear advice on how to prevent them, \\"he said. Monday mornings have a double helping of stress for the working body as it makes a rapid change from sleep to activity, and from the relaxing weekend to the pressures of work. \\"When people get up, their blood pressure and heart rate go up and there are hormonal changes in their bodies, \\"Willich explained. \\"All these things can have an unfavorable effect in the blood system and increase the risk of a clot which will cause a heart attack.\\" \\"When people return to work after a weekend off, the pace of their life changes.

Standoff: Goerge Pickering, pictured, allegedly threatened to kill a nurse. A distraught father who caused a four-hour standoff with police in a Texas hospital allegedly pointed his gun at a nurse and yelled 'I'll kill all of y'all'. Police said George Pickering, 57, made the threats from a hospital room after becoming inconsolable over the treatment of his son - a patient in critical care at Tomball Regional Hospital, near Houston. Armed police and a SWAT team descended on the medical center - and eventually convinced Pickering to surrender after a four-hour standoff on Saturday night. Pickering was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and is being held on a 30,000 bond, a statement from the Tomball Police department said. Detectives said Pickering was in the room with his son and family, waited for a nurse to come, then aimed his 9mm pistol at her. He then allegedly barricaded the room and threatened to kill anybody who came in. At the start of the confrontation, another of Pickering's sons, who was with him in the hospital room, allegedly wrested the gun away from him and handed it to police. Standoff: George Pickering, 57, allegedly threatened to kill a nurse with his pistol at Tomball Regional Hospital, sparking a police standoff. Response: Police and a SWAT team arrived at the hospital. Pickering reportedly had one gun taken from him, but said he had a second. Pickering then allegedly said, 'You don't think that's the only weapon I have?', prompting fears of a second gun and causing the lengthy showdown with police. But when he gave himself up, police found that he was not in fact armed. Early reports stated that Pickering had taken two hostages, but law enforcement later said there were no captives. A spokesman for the Tomball police department said Picerking fell ill during the standoff and was treated in the hospital overnight - and was still there Sunday afternoon. He does not yet have an attorney. Tense: Pickering was said to be distraught over the condition of his son - a critical care patient.

Step 1: Combine like terms The like terms in the equation are the terms with the variable k.

In 588, a mutiny by unpaid Byzantine troops against their new commander, Priscus, seemed to offer the Sassanids a chance for a breakthrough, but the mutineers themselves repulsed the ensuing Persian offensive. Later in the year they secured a major victory before Martyropolis. The Sassanid commander, Maruzas, was killed, several of the Persian leaders were captured along with 3,000 other prisoners, and only a thousand men survived to reach refuge at Nisibis. The Byzantines secured much booty, including the Persian battle standards, and sent them, along with Maruzas' head, to Maurice in Constantinople. In 590 two Parthian brothers, Vistahm and Vinduyih, overthrew King Hormizd IV and made the latter's son, Prince Khosrau II, the new King. The former Persian commander-in-chief, Bahram Chobin, who had rebelled against Hormizd IV, claimed the throne for himself and defeated Khosrau. Khosrau and the two Parthians fled to the Byzantine court. Although the Senate unanimously advised against it, Maurice helped Khosrau regain his throne with an army of 35,000 men. In 591 the combined Byzantine-Persian army under generals John Mystacon and Narses defeated Bahram Chobin's forces near Ganzak at the Battle of Blarathon.

The county town is Lancaster although the county's administrative centre is Preston. The county has a population of 1,449,300 and an area of . People from Lancashire are known as Lancastrians.  - The metropolitan counties are a type of county-level administrative division of England. There are six metropolitan counties, which each cover large urban areas, typically with populations of 1.2 to 2.8 million. They were created in 1972 and are each divided into several metropolitan districts or boroughs.  - The Borough of Sefton is a metropolitan borough of Merseyside, England and its local authority is Sefton Council. Sefton was formed by the Local Government Act 1972 on 1 April 1974, by the amalgamation of the former county boroughs of Bootle and Southport, and, from the administrative county of Lancashire, the municipal borough of Crosby, the urban districts of Formby and Litherland, and part of the Rural District of West Lancashire. It also formed part of the new county of Merseyside. The borough consists of a coastal strip of land on the Irish Sea, and extends from Bootle in the south, to Southport in the north. In the south-east, it extends inland to Maghull. The district is bounded by Liverpool to the south, Knowsley to the south-east, and West Lancashire to the east.  - Liverpool, in North West England, is a major city and metropolitan borough with an estimated population of 478,580 in 2015 within the City of Liverpool.

Understand the given claim: The claim states that the European Union (EU) should considerably decrease the amount of money it spends on subsidies for agricultural production. 2. Analyze the provided perspective: The perspective provided is \\"Farmers can't survive.\\" This implies that without sufficient subsidies, it would be challenging for farmers to maintain their businesses and livelihoods. 3. Determine if the perspective supports or undermines the claim: In this step, you need to analyze whether the given perspective strengthens the claim (that the EU should reduce agricultural subsidies), or weakens it (suggesting that the EU should maintain or even increase the subsidies). 4. Consider if the perspective could convince someone with a different view: Think about whether the given perspective could sway someone with an opposing opinion on the matter. If it could, the perspective is supporting the claim; if not, it is undermining the claim. Solution: The provided perspective, \\"Farmers can't survive,\\" implies that reducing the amount spent on agricultural production subsidies would have detrimental effects on farmers' livelihoods. This perspective undermines the claim that the EU should decrease its spending on agricultural subsidies, as it suggests that such a reduction could harm farmers' ability to maintain their businesses and provide for themselves and their families. Additionally, this perspective could potentially convince someone with a different view to reconsider their stance on reducing agricultural subsidies, demonstrating that it is an undermining perspective."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Once the test is done, the doctor will send the cell sample to a lab for testing. It usually takes 1-3 weeks for the test results to come back, but your doctor should be able to give you a more accurate estimate. Ask them if you can expect them to call you or if the results will be posted in an online chart for you to view.If you don’t hear back within 3 weeks, call your doctor’s office and ask about the results. Most of the time, pap smear test results come back normal. Sometimes, however, you might get a result of “abnormal” or “unclear.” If this happens, don’t worry! Even an abnormal test result doesn’t necessarily mean that anything is seriously wrong. Talk to your doctor about scheduling a follow-up appointment for further tests.  In rare cases, abnormal cells in a pap smear can be a sign of cancer in your cervix or uterus. If your doctor suspects that your test results might indicate a serious problem, they may have you come in for more tests, like a colonoscopy or a biopsy (tissue sample).  Sometimes, your doctor will recommend that you wait 6 months to a year and then have another pap smear done. If the abnormal cells are still there or if they see major changes since your last exam, they might decide to do further testing. How often you need to get a pap smear depends on a lot of things, such as your age, your medical history, and how high your risk is for problems like cervical cancer or sexually transmitted infections. Work with your doctor to figure out the best time for you to come in for your next routine pap smear and pelvic exam.  Most doctors recommend that you get your first pap smear at age 21, and then follow up every 3 years (or more often if there are abnormal results). Once you’re 30, you can reduce the frequency to once every 5 years unless you have an abnormal pap smear. You can stop having pap smears by the time you’re 65 to 70 as long as you’ve had 3 normal tests within the last 10 years.","output":"This article provides information about the pap smear test process, including waiting for results, understanding abnormal results, and guidelines on the frequency of the test based on age and medical history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question Heading into this game, there were many questions on the run game especially on Legarrette Blount as well as the offensive line who have struggled through the first two games. Plus, the Eagles were dealing with injuries on defense to S Rodney McLeod, CB Ronald Darby and backup S Corey Graham leaving Malcolm Jenkins and Chris Maragos the only healthy safeties. Despite all of the setbacks, The Eagles hosted the 0-2 Giants who have only scored 13 points through the first 2 weeks of the season. Both teams started off in slow fashion, with no first quarter points. A LeGarrette Blount 1 yard touchdown run in the second quarter were the only points of the first half, after the Eagles stopped the Giants from reaching the end zone from 1 yard out to close out the first half. Coming out in the third quarter with a 7-0 lead, the Eagles added the only points of the third quarter with Carson Wentz finding tight end Zach Ertz for a 3-yard touchdown. The Eagles defense (who were playing a solid game) broke down in the fourth quarter allowing the Giants to score 21 unanswered points to start the fourth quarter, as quarterback Eli Manning found his all pro wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. twice for touchdowns, and second year wide receiver Sterling Shepard once for a 77-yard touchdown. Fletcher Cox left the game with a calf injury. Eagles rookie running back Corey Clement ran for a 15-yard touchdown to tie the score at 21. After exchanging field goals, Wentz and the Eagles offense took over, looking to move into field goal range. Wentz connected with Alshon Jeffery for a 17-yard pass, setting up a Jake Elliott 61 yard field goal attempt with 1 second remaining. Elliott converted on the 61 yard attempt, the longest in Eagles franchise history as time expired. Wentz was quietly efficient in the game, completing 21 of 31 attempts for 176 yards and one touchdown despite playing behind a struggling offensive line. The win came at an expense, as running back Darren Sproles was ruled out for the remainder of the season with a broken arm and torn ACL, both of which occurred on the same play. Despite this injury, the Eagles ran the ball efficiently through most of the game. With the close win, the Eagles advanced to 2-1 tying the Cowboys and the Redskins for first place in the NFC East while the Giants fell to 0-3 in the basement of the division.

He appears to be intently focused on constructing a complex mechanical device, carefully studying the design details and following the instructions outlined on the blueprint. The walls of the room in which he's working are lined with shelves filled with parts and equipment: gears, motors, wires, and other various pieces of technology and circuitry. With precision and determination, the man begins to assemble the device. He connects wires, solders components, and glues sections of the structure together, all while referring to his detailed blueprint. After hours of careful work, the device starts to take shape, evolving into an intricate mechanism, revealing the combination of engineering skills and dedication of its creator. As the man works, he occasionally glances at the door to make sure nobody interrupts his work. He is also very attentive to the timer set on the table; it seems that the clock is ticking for the completion of this project. This man is no ordinary inventor, and the device he is building carries great significance and a sense of urgency. Upon finalizing the assembly, the man attaches the last remaining piece – a small radio transmitter. He flips a switch and the device begins to hum softly, indicating that it's operational. The man removes his blue mask, revealing a satisfied yet apprehensive expression. He is well aware that the stakes are high and that his invention has the potential to change the world, for better or for worse. As he packs the blueprint and remaining components into a briefcase, he gets ready to leave his workshop. Taking extra caution to conceal the device, he knows that he will have to make his way discreetly to his final destination - a secretive meeting with some influential individuals who have a vested interest in this invention. The implications of this device could have a profound effect on global politics, economics, and even the environment, and as a result, there are various factions vying for control of this technology. Outside the workshop, a parked car awaits the man. A shadowy figure is standing next to the car, watching the entrance of the workshop intently. This figure is a spy from another faction who has been sent to intercept the device and foil the man’s ambitions. As the man exits the workshop, trying to keep a low profile, the spy approaches him, attempting to gain possession of the briefcase containing the invention. A sudden scuffle breaks out between the two individuals. The man fights skillfully, utilizing his experience in self-defense to try to fend off the stealthy attacker. Locked in struggle, they knock over a nearby trash can, drawing the attention of a passerby who pulls out their cellphone to notify the authorities. As the sirens draw nearer, the man finds an opportunity to break free and jump into his waiting car. With the briefcase safely at his side, he speeds away towards his meeting, constantly checking his rearview mirror to make sure the spy has not followed his trail.

Currently the United States must buy most of its oil from authoritarian and often hostile states such as Saudi Arabia , Venezuela and Iran , or from unstable places like Nigeria . 3. 22 % of US oil comes from the Middle East , 22 % from Africa , and 19 % from Latin America . 4. It is estimated that the oil in offshore reserves could supply US energy needs for two years . 5. When problems occur in these unstable energy producing countries , it often causes oil prices to rise , and the US has no way of avoiding these consequences . 6. Oil prices increased when the crisis in Libya ensued . 7. Additionally , the US loses leverage over many international actors as its hands are tied due to dependence on oil , this is the case with nuclear proliferation in Iran for example . 8. Offshore drilling and increased energy independence could help distance America from anti-democratic regimes and the impact of unrest in these unstable nations . What is the general argument implied by these sentences?","output":"The general argument implied by these sentences is that increasing offshore drilling in the United States would lead to reduced dependency on foreign oil, particularly from authoritarian, hostile, or unstable states.

Both expositions were held in Balboa Park, and many of the Spanish/Baroque-style buildings that were built for those expositions remain to this day as central features of the park. The buildings were intended to be temporary structures, but most remained in continuous use until they progressively fell into disrepair. Most were eventually rebuilt, using castings of the original façades to retain the architectural style. The menagerie of exotic animals featured at the 1915 exposition provided the basis for the San Diego Zoo. During the 1950s there was a citywide festival called Fiesta del Pacifico highlighting the area's Spanish and Mexican past. In the 2010s there was a proposal for a large-scale celebration of the 100th anniversary of Balboa Park, but the plans were abandoned when the organization tasked with putting on the celebration went out of business.

He failed to find a wide audience during his lifetime, but his work has since achieved wider recognition.Drake signed to Island Records when he was 20, while a student at the University of Cambridge, and released his debut album, Five Leaves Left, in 1969. By 1972, he had recorded two more albums, Bryter Layter and Pink Moon. Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release. His reluctance to perform live or give interviews contributed to his lack of commercial success. No footage of the adult Drake has been released, only still photographs.Drake is believed to have suffered from depression, reflected in his lyrics. After making Pink Moon, he withdrew from performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. At the age of 26, Drake died from an overdose of approximately 30 amitriptyline pills, a prescribed antidepressant. His cause of death was determined as suicide.The 1979 release of the retrospective album Fruit Tree triggered a reassessment of Drake's music.

There would have been no messages, no song in her garden. But I was sure Diane was dead. There was nothing but a memory of a younger time to check my feelings for Nicolette. And then, when I found Diane again, I could not have her. I had lost her forever. So at last I wrote again to Nicolette. But tonight, when Nicolette would have let me make love to her - and how I want her! - I could not go beyond an embrace and a kiss. Not as long as I still love Diane.

The director and two stars of LAURA (1944) were reteamed for this solid policier: Dana Andrews is the son of a criminal who becomes a cop to cut all ties with the past but cannot keep his inherited violent ways in check while interrogating suspects and, one night, he goes too far; Gene Tierney is the estranged wife of his victim, a decorated war hero who has become involved with the town's leading racketeer and Andrews' No. 1 nemesis, Gary Merrill (who had himself been the protégé of Andrews Snr.)! As usual with Preminger, this is a well-crafted movie with a notable opening credits sequence and enlivened by a good cast that also includes Karl Malden (as Andrews' incumbent superior), Tom Tully (as Tierney's motor-mouth taxi driver dad) and Neville Brand (as Merrill's chief thug), with notable support also coming from Craig Stevens (as the slimy, wife-beating victim), Bert Freed (as Andrews' sympathetic partner) and Robert F. Nolan (as Andrews' stern outgoing superior). Having already been warned by the latter to mend his ways or else, Andrews panics and impersonates Stevens for a couple of hours following his murder to put the police on the (in this case) wrong tracks of Merrill; however, after Tully becomes the prime suspect (by which time Andrews and Tierney are romantically involved), the cop goes by himself in Merrill's lair fully intending to get bumped off and 'frame' the racketeer for his own murder! Clearly, the protagonist is a complex character and Andrews rises to the challenge with a first-rate characterization that is typically complemented by the in-house Fox noir style.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is it possible to conclude that \\"a boy runs through the puddle.\\" if \\"the kid ran through the water on the ground on his birthday\\"?","output":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that \\"a boy runs through the puddle\\" if given the statement \\"the kid ran through the water on the ground on his birthday,\\" assuming certain elements and context are clarified and inferred. To understand the connection between the two statements, we need to analyze each element mentioned. 1. \\"A boy\\" and \\"the kid\\": Both terms refer to a young male child. While \\"a boy\\" is general and could refer to any young male, \\"the kid\\" could denote that the speaker might have specific knowledge about the child, referring to a specific boy. 2. \\"Runs\\" and \\"ran\\": These are different verb forms in the present (runs) and simple past (ran), but they are related as they belong to the same verb \\"to run.\\" Based on this information, we can understand that the child is performing the same action in both statements; the only discrepancy is the time frame. 3. \\"Through the puddle\\" and \\"through the water on the ground\\": These phrases refer to similar settings but with slight variations. A puddle is generally defined as a small pool of liquid, typically water, on the ground. \\"Water on the ground\\" is a more general description that could include a puddle or any other body of water that happens to be on the ground. 4. \\"On his birthday\\": This phrase provides a specific time frame and context in which the event occurred. The child was running through the water on his birthday, and this context was not mentioned in the first statement. Based on the elements mentioned above, we can conclude that it is possible to draw a connection between the two statements, but we must take into consideration the differences in time frame and context. If we assume the simplified action of a boy running through the water on the ground and that \\"the kid\\" is indeed a boy, we can infer that \\"a boy runs through the puddle\\" is a simplified or more generalized version of the original statement.  However, it's important to note that this conclusion is based on assumptions and lacks the specifics, mainly the time frame, that the child performed this action on his birthday. So to provide an accurate and comprehensive understanding, one could say: \\"On his birthday, a boy ran through the puddle,\\" ensuring that the context is maintained in the new statement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: With almost two years left of my law degree, and with no intention of doing anything so idiotic as actually attending lectures or studying law, I had plenty of time to come up with my next bid for online fame. The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media.

Michigan will lose 2 million in federal funding and 600,000 in state funding to provide legal aid to the poor in 2003, according to Deierdre L. Weir, executive director of the Legal Aid and Defender Association, Inc., the state's largest provider of legal services to the poor. Current federal funds of nearly 10.7 million from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) will drop to 8.7 million for next year, according to Weir. She said that the reductions reflect a decline in the number of persons in the state who are living in poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 census. LSC uses census data to determine funding across the nation, and according to the census, the state's poverty population fell from an estimated 1.2 million in 1990 to an estimated 968,000 in 2000. The state's legal aid agencies are also bracing for yet another cut in 2003 of some 600,000 of state funding. A portion of filing fees paid by litigants in the state's circuit courts, and a portion of interest on lawyers trust accounts (IOLTA) are earmarked for Michigan legal aid programs. These funds are expected to drop from currently 7.5 million in 2002 to 6.9 million when the Michigan State Bar Foundation makes distributions next year. Most of the decrease is attributed to the past year's low interest rates. \\"The irony of these funding cuts is that while there may be fewer poor people in Michigan today, the demand for service will not change because the poverty population remains so large and the legal aid funding so little that local providers will never able to serve all who need our service,\\" said Weir. \\"It's as if the poor will be victimized twice-once for being poor and again as victims of these funding cuts.\\" The U.S. Census Bureau, in spite of its best efforts, cannot locate every poor person living in a census tract, therefore the poor are also undercounted, added Weir. The brunt of these cuts will be felt most in Wayne County where according to the census some 333,000 poor people live, the largest concentration of poverty in the state. LAD will lose more than 870,000 for legal aid in Wayne County, nearly half of the state's total loss, said Weir. While difficult to measure, the loss of funds will mean that several thousand of Michigan's poor in need of legal service will not receive it, or they will receive significantly limited service. Cutbacks will include service in such civil legal matters as landlord-tenant, bankruptcy, consumer, child custody, predatory lending, mortgage foreclosure, utility shutoffs, social security, wills, and probate. \\"Local providers will have to work harder and smarter and use more technology instead of staff to provide as much service as we can with fewer dollars,\\" said Weir. \\"We will be providing more selfhelp training to clients enabling them to navigate the legal system on their own in routine matters, more assistance on the telephone, and less direct representation by attorneys in specific, high impact matters. Currently, Michigan has 13 legal aid agencies covering the state's 83 counties.  Question: \\"How is Legal Aid and Defender Association planning to cope with the funding drops?\\" Answer: \\"Cutbacks in legal services\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"No, the provided answer is not a direct and detailed answer to the question. Below is a more accurate and detailed answer: The Legal Aid and Defender Association (LAD) plans to cope with the funding drops by implementing several strategies to continue providing service to as many clients as possible under the reduced budget. Deierdre L. Weir, the executive director of LAD, mentioned the following approaches: 1.

Birch town's population was affected by viral respiratory diseases, while Free town's population caught bacterial respiratory diseases.  Which town has fewer people that caught the flu?  Hint: Many respiratory diseases are caused by pathogens. A pathogen is an organism that causes disease in another organism. Certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi are pathogens of the respiratory system. The common cold and flu are caused by viruses. The influenza virus that causes the flu is pictured below ( Figure below ). Tuberculosis, whooping cough, and acute bronchitis are caused by bacteria. The pathogens that cause colds, flu, and TB can be passed from person to person by coughing, sneezing, and spitting. Illnesses caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics. Those caused by viruses cannot. A:","output":"Based on the information provided, it cannot be determined which town has fewer people that caught the flu. The details given indicate that Birch town's population was affected by viral respiratory diseases, whereas Free town's population was affected by bacterial respiratory diseases. It is important to note that the flu (influenza) is caused by a virus.  While we know that viral respiratory diseases are present in Birch town, we don't have enough data on the number of people affected (specifically by the flu) in compared to those with bacterial respiratory diseases in Free town. Furthermore, we are not given any information on the total population of both towns or the prevalence of the diseases in each town.

Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"What description was not used to describe Mary: accursed or holy?\\" is in \\"It is admitted that the doctrine as defined by Pius IX was not explicitly mooted before the 12th century. It is also agreed that \\"no direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture\\". But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers. Their expressions on the subject of the sinlessness of Mary are, it is pointed out, so ample and so absolute that they must be taken to include original sin as well as actual. Thus in the first five centuries such epithets as \\"in every respect holy\\", \\"in all things unstained\\", \\"super-innocent\\", and \\"singularly holy\\" are applied to her; she is compared to Eve before the fall, as ancestress of a redeemed people; she is \\"the earth before it was accursed\\". The well-known words of St. Augustine (d. 430) may be cited: \\"As regards the mother of God,\\" he says, \\"I will not allow any question whatever of sin.\\" It is true that he is here speaking directly of actual or personal sin. But his argument is that all men are sinners; that they are so through original depravity; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God, and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin \\"of every sort\\" (omni ex parte).\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"Based on the text provided, the description that was not used to describe Mary is \\"accursed\\". This deduction is obtained from the phrases used in the text such as \\"in every respect holy\\", \\"in all things unstained\\", \\"super innocent\\", and \\"singularly holy\\", and \\"the earth before it was accursed\\". All these epithets show Mary in a positive light, using words like \\"holy\\", \\"unstained\\", and \\"super innocent\\". When the text says \\"she is compared to Eve before the fall, as the ancestress of a redeemed people; she is the earth before it was accursed\\", it's saying she is likened to the earth before it fell under any curse. This implies she isn't described as \\"accursed\\", but as something pure and pristine instead. Thus, the description \\"accursed\\" wasn't used to describe Mary, based on this passage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S.  Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs  the highest level  playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities  Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University  consist entirely of chairback seating.)  - Basketball is a sport that is played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court. The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop in diameter and mounted at a height of to backboards at each end of the court.

Write some highlights for the following article: Around 90 new pieces of gold and silver have been unearthed in the field where the Staffordshire Hoard of Anglo-Saxon treasure was found three years ago. The fresh discoveries, made in recent weeks at Hammerwich, near Lichfield, include what is thought to be a part of a helmet and an eagle-shaped object, Staffordshire County Council said. Speaking at a press conference in Stoke-on-Trent, council leader Philip Atkins confirmed that many of pieces weighed less than a gram. Newly discovered Anglo Saxon treasure is unveiled at a press conference at the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery in Stoke on Trent, Staffordshire today. Eighty-one of the items were declared treasure trove. They include part of a helmet, an eagle and a cross. The new items were found in the same. field where over 3,900 pieces of gold, silver and some copper alloy. objects were found in 2009. The first discovery was made by a metal detectorist, who had permission to scan the land. Archaeologists discovered the largest ever find of Anglo Saxon gold and. silver metal work from this country. In total the hoard included over 5kg of gold, 1.5kg of silver and thousands of small garnets. Mr Atkins said: 'The ploughing of the same field has unearthed a small number of other gold and silver finds. 'While it is far too early to say exactly what they are, or how old they are, they are certainly interesting finds.' South Staffordshire Coroner Andrew Haigh is expected to rule whether the haul of 90 items should be declared treasure at an inquest on January 4. The five hectare field was examined by a team of archaeologists - who have previously worked on battlesites at Bosworth and Hastings - once it had been ploughed at the end of November. South Staffordshire Coroner Andrew Haigh will rule at an inquest planned for January 4 if the metalwork pieces are part of the Anglo Saxon collection and should be declared treasure. Staffordshire County Council Leader Philip Atkins, said: 'The Staffordshire Hoard was an amazing discovery, and we have been immensely proud to play our part in helping to discover and tell the story of a collection of such international importance. 'We will now have to wait for the inquest, to discover if the objects are a significant part of our national history.' The new items were found in the same field where over 3,900 pieces of gold, silver and some copper alloy objects were found in 2009. The new artefacts have tentatively been dated to the 7th or 8th centuries, placing the origin of the items in the time of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia. The latest find includes parts of a helmet. The team has been using x-ray images to piece together objects they find. The first discovery was made by a metal detectorist, who had permission to scan the land. Following the discovery three years ago, English Heritage immediately recognised the exceptional significance of the finds and provided emergency funding at the start of the dig together with continued expert advice, support and funding for the research and preservation of the Staffordshire Hoard. Archaeologists working with Staffordshire County Council later carried out the excavation of the field and discovered the largest ever find of Anglo Saxon gold and silver metal work from this country. In total the hoard included over 5kg of gold, 1.5kg of silver and thousands of small garnets. Treasure is defined by the law as any gold or silver objects, or coins, more than 300 years old which were deliberately hidden. Under the 1996 Treasure Act, any treasure found in England and Wales belongs to the Crown. Anyone who finds what they suspect may be treasure must report it to the local coroner within 14 days of discovery. If they don't, they risk a three-month jail sentence or a £5,000 fine. If an inquest declares that a find is treasure, it is offered to the British Museum or a local museum who has it officially valued by an independent board of antiquities experts. If they want the find, they must pay the market value of the treasure to the finder and/or landowner. If they don't, the finder can keep it. Normally, any treasure belongs to the landowner. However, a landowner can agree to split the reward with a metal detector enthusiast. They include a bishop’s pectoral cross, a large folded cross, a helmet cheek piece, a filigree seahorse and numerous sword fittings including hilt plates and pommel caps. The pieces appear to date from the seventh century, although there is some debate among experts as to when the hoard first entered the ground. The dig was closed when archaeologists were confident they had retrieved everything that was recoverable at the time. Last month, a team of archaeologists and experienced metal detectorists from Archaeology Warwickshire returned to the field when it was ploughed and recovered further material. These are currently being examined and x-rayed at a specialist archives laboratory. After the Staffordshire Hoard was declared treasure a huge fundraising campaign was launched to bring the treasure back to the West Midlands. The discovery, circled in red, was made in the same field where the Staffordshire Hoard, the largest collection of Anglo Saxon treasure was recovered in 2009. Staffordshire County Archaeologist Stephen Dean addresses a press conference about newly discovered Anglo Saxon treasure  at the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery in Stoke on Trent, Staffordshire. The Hoard was valued at £3.3m by independent experts at the British Museum - the most valuable treasure discovery ever made. The fundraising campaign was led by The Art Fund, and featured a major donation from the National Heritage Memorial Fund. The Staffordshire Hoard is the largest collection of Anglo-Saxon gold and silver metalwork ever found, anywhere in the world. The two men who fell out over £3.3million after finding Saxon treasure. could scoop another fortune - after more artefacts were found in the. same field. Terry Herbert, 57, discovered the ancient gold and silver haul on 68-year-old farmer Fred Johnson's land three years ago. Their find, dubbed the Staffordshire Hoard, was sold to museums after. becoming an international sensation after the discovery on July 5, 2009. - leaving the men rich. But the duo fell out over the cash, with Terry claiming Fred wanted it all for himself. He even said his find of 3,900 artefacts - Britain's largest ever. haul of Anglo-Saxon treasure - was a curse and blamed it on ruining his. friendship with Fred. But yesterday it emerged the pair, who have not spoken since their. rift, are set to earn hundreds of thousands of pounds more after 90. gold and silver items were unearthed close to the original find. Experts are currently examining the finds and South Staffordshire. Coroner Andrew Haigh will rule at an inquest on January 4 if the pieces. are part of the Anglo-Saxon collection. If they are ruled to be from the same collection they will be officially declared treasure before being valued. The proceeds from the sale of the treasure will then be split between Terry and Fred. Discovered in a field near the village of Hammerwich, on 5 July 2009, it consists of more than 3,900 items. The artefacts have tentatively been dated to the 7th or 8th centuries, placing the origin of the items in the time of the Kingdom of Mercia. One of the new items of Anglo Saxon treasure being examined by archaeologists. Over 90 small items were discovered. The artefacts have tentatively been dated to the 7th or 8th centuries, placing the origin of the items in the time of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia, and include part of a helmet (shown here) and an object resembling an eagle. The find includes what is believed to be part of a cheekguard from a golden helmet. The Staffordshire haul consisted of over 3,500 items that are nearly all martial in character and contains no objects specific to female uses. Highlights:","output":"1.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"An earlier draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, titled Go Set a Watchman, was controversially released on July 14, 2015. This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\" This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\".

News article: Appointing Billie Jean King to the Sochi Olympics 'US delegation' isn't enough Only one world leader has said they won't attend the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi because of anti-LGBT abuses in Russia. Photograph: ZUMA / Rex Features President Obama has been getting great press in the past 24 hours for his decision to include tennis legend – and out lesbian – Billie Jean King in the United States delegation attending the 2014 Winter Olympics. He's being lauded for sending a \\"clear message\\" to Russia about its treatment of LGBT people. Don't get me wrong, I'm a true Billie Jean King fan, but here's why I'm not joining the chorus praising Obama – or other leaders. There's no mention of Russia's human rights abuses in the US president's announcement, or any suggestion of genuine political action. Just the use of the word \\"diversity\\" twice. It hardly qualifies as a \\"strong signal\\", but that hasn't stopped the American press from spinning it that way. In the past 10 days alone, five western political leaders have said they'll be skipping the 2014 winter games in Sochi. There wasn't much response to the first public declaration, by Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk. But German President Joachim Gauck soon followed suit, as did European Union Commissioner for Justice, Citizenship and Fundamental Rights, Viviane Reding. The next day's announcement by President Obama that he was \\"unlikely\\" to attend was followed closely by French President Francois Hollande's declaration that neither he nor any high-ranking French officials would appear. None but Reding has publicly declared their decision to be a boycott of Sochi, or said anything about Russia's draconian anti-LGBT legislation. Still, the press has quickly, and perhaps mistakenly, concluded that the brutal oppression of LGBT Russians is these figures' primary concern – a conclusion that may make them seem more courageous than they really are, and handily covers for other agendas. In the absence of any declarations or salient political responses to Russia's anti-LGBT laws from Germany, the US, France, or Poland, it seems reasonable to wonder if, in fact, something else is at play here. Fear of being caught on the wrong side of history? Or a desire to humiliate and isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin for doing virtually everything imaginable to tick off the west, from sheltering Edward Snowden to jailing protestors from Greenpeace to Pussy Riot, to supporting the Syrian and Ukrainian regimes, while posing as the voice of reason in the New York Times? But why get into all of this nastiness when it's possible to stay home, remain silent, and have your behavior construed as moral rectitude? Whatever the true feelings of any of these western leaders when it comes to LGBT rights, this much is safe to say: none of them is eager to have a photo op with Putin right now. Not when his aggressive consolidation of power and quashing of any opposition is so blatant. And not at an event where there's so much potential for violence and bad press – all of it recorded in real time by dozens of broadcasters and blasted across the universe via Twitter and Facebook and through every imaginable online site. All of the signs of potential danger are flashing yellow. Months ago, Putin declared virtual martial law in Sochi, banning all protests, marches, and public gatherings for the duration of the Olympics. Unsurprisingly, the \\"protest zones\\" that Putin unveiled recently, in an attempt, one supposes, to calm increasingly anxious corporate sponsors and western nations, will be something of a joke – more of a snare for catching dissidents than a venue for free speech. And who will be the brave political advisor to tell the president that having Russian security forces kill four alleged terrorists near Sochi earlier this week may in fact not be the kind of thing that makes the average American feel better about visiting? And yes, it's a particularly bad time for world leaders to be seen with Putin, now when the true implications of Russia's anti-LGBT laws and the atmosphere of violence they've encouraged have become so readily apparent. On Monday, Tonight Show host Jay Leno conveyed to his millions of viewers the same message that LGBT journalists and activists have been trying to get across for months, and that NBC, which has paid 4bn to broadcast in the United States, has been so eager to downplay: contemporary Russia looks increasingly like early Nuremberg-era Germany, with its insistence that Jews were a threat to the purity of its bloodline and the moral fiber of its children. Each successive day's news makes it harder to ignore Russia's movement towards fascism – or the similarities between the Kremlin's venal campaign and what came to be Germany's Final Solution. Not with last week's call, by a Russian TV star before a cheering audience, for a Holocaust rerun – for his kids' sake. Ivan Okhlobystin, the star of a Russian copy of \\"Scrubs\\", told fans in the city of Novosibirsk on Sunday: I'd burn them all alive in ovens. It's Sodom and Gomorrah, as a religious person I can't be indifferent to it, it's a living threat to my children. It would be one thing if Okhlobystin were a lone outlier. But he isn't the only Russian celebrity to have made such pronouncements to an enthusiastic crowd. Last year, that honor fell to Russia's leading news anchor, Dmitry Kiselyov, who said – before a live TV audience in the run-up to the enactment of the anti-LGBT laws: I believe it is not enough to impose fines on gays for engaging in the propaganda of homosexuality among adolescents. We need to ban them from donating blood and sperm, and if they die in car accidents, we need to bury their hearts in the ground or burn them, as they are unsuitable for the aiding of anyone's life. Will Kiselyov bring his same flare for Third Reich rhetoric to Russia's TV coverage of the Sochi Olympics this winter? Viewers will have a chance to see, now that he's been appointed head of the new Kremlin-dominated network that Putin created last week, after liquidating RIA Novosti, and with it any pretense of an independent media outlet. It remains to be seen whether there will be any truly brave, outspoken political opposition to Putin's witch-hunt. Certainly Germany's Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Britain's Prime Minister, David Cameron, are now under pressure to act. But more interesting is the question of whether others will prod Western leaders from Europe and the United States into genuine political engagement with Russia over its human rights abuses. Imagine how the stakes will rise if Argentina's President, Cristina Elisabet Fernández de Kirchner – who took on her country's Catholic hierarchy and staked her reputation on making LGBT marriage legal years before Germany, France, or the United States – decides to offer political asylum to the thousands of LGBT Russians terrified that a new law will strip LGBT people with children of their parental rights? What if Chile's President-elect Michele Bachelet puts the politicians responsible for the country's draconian anti-LGBT laws on a visa ban list? It would certainly be a welcome change from what we're seeing now: these low-risk, high-gain gestures from Gaucke, Obama and Hollande. The kind that tap the gAyTM at reelection time and earn plenty of free publicity, but without the expenditure of any serious political capital. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article is talking about how some world leaders, like President Obama, are not attending the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. This is because of Russia's bad treatment of LGBT people. People are happy that Obama included Billie Jean King, a famous tennis player and openly gay woman, in the US delegation, but the article says that this is not enough. Many other leaders from places like Germany, France, and Poland, are not attending the Olympics, but they are not giving specific reasons like Russia's anti-LGBT laws. The article questions if these western leaders are avoiding the Sochi Olympics for other reasons, like not wanting to be seen with Russian President Vladimir Putin or because they are worried about potential violence and bad press at the event. The article also talks about how some Russian celebrities have made terrible comments about LGBT people, and it mentions the possibility of other countries like Argentina and Chile taking stronger actions against Russia's human rights abuses. In the end, the article wants to see more genuine political engagement with Russia instead of just avoiding the Olympics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

President's party takes hits in South Korean midterm elections Candidates supporting President Lee Myung-bak, who has worked closely with the Obama administration in responding to the ship's sinking, won six out of 16 races for metropolitan mayor and provincial governor, according to the National Election Commission. The main opposition Democratic Party -- which accuses Lee of using the ship's sinking for political gain, and whose leaders have stridently criticized an investigation that blames the incident on North Korea -- won seven major races, returns showed. About 48 percent of voters supported candidates from the Democratic Party and two other opposition parties, while 40 percent voted for candidates from Lee's ruling Grand National Party (GNP), according to the election commission. In midterm elections four years ago, GNP candidates won more than 50 percent of the vote. In Seoul, the capital and largest city, Mayor Oh Se-hoon of the GNP won a narrow reelection victory, while independent candidates and small parties won the other major races. Still, the Democratic Party claimed a victory. \\"The people handed a solemn judgment to the Lee Myung-bak administration,\\" spokesman Woo Sang-ho said, calling the results a \\"public verdict against the Lee government's arrogance and self-righteousness.\\" A ruling party spokesman, Cho Hae-jin, said the GNP \\"humbly accepts the voice of the public expressed in this election.\\" Party chief Chung Mong-joon said Thursday that he would resign in the wake of the setback. Turnout was unusually high, nearly 55 percent, the highest for a non-presidential election in 15 years. \\"The public sentiment to check the GNP and keep the balance seemed to have reduced the gap between the ruling and opposition parties,\\" said Jeong Han-wool, executive director at the East Asia Institute, a Seoul-based research group. \\"The ship incident seems to have reinforced the existing conservative votes for the ruling party, but was not enough to change the minds of independent and left-leaning voters.\\" Even before the ship sank two months ago, killing 46 sailors and triggering a major international security crisis, Lee and his ruling party appeared likely to lose ground in nationwide voting to fill nearly 4,000 local positions. An international investigation -- run by South Korea with the help of experts from the United States, Australia, Sweden and Britain -- determined two weeks ago that a North Korean mini-submarine fired a North Korean-made torpedo that ripped apart the 1,200-ton Cheonan in late March. Evidence showed overwhelmingly, the investigation said, that the North Korean military plotted to sink the ship. As part of punitive measures against the North, Lee last week announced trade and transport sanctions, as well as anti-submarine exercises to be held with U.S. Navy ships in the Yellow Sea. Those exercises are scheduled to begin next week. Recent polls had shown that most voters would take the Cheonan's sinking into consideration. They also showed that Lee's move to punish North Korea had majority support and that the president's popularity had risen from the mid-40s to just over 50 percent. The main opposition Democratic Party, however, has accused Lee's party of manipulating news about the ship's sinking to win votes. Special correspondent Yoonjung Seo contributed to this report. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important aspects of this text highlight the results and implications of the South Korean midterm elections. The ruling party led by President Lee Myung-bak, the Grand National Party (GNP), faced setbacks, winning only six out of 16 mayoral and gubernatorial races. In contrast, the main opposition Democratic Party (DP) won seven major races. The total vote shares showed a drop in support for the GNP, garnering only 40% compared to 50% four years prior. The opposition Democratic Party accused the GNP of using the Cheonan ship sinking incident for political gain in the elections. The high voter turnout, the highest for a non-presidential election in 15 years, up to 55%, indicates the public's desire for a more balanced political landscape in South Korea. Although President Lee Myung-bak's popularity and support for his decision to punish North Korea had increased, it wasn't enough to sway independent and left-leaning voters. Overall, the election results demonstrate the public's dissatisfaction with Lee Myung-bak's administration and their desire for more political balance in the country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Time      If Melania Trump is first lady, she'll focus efforts on putting an end to bullying on social media.      In her first solo speech since the Republican National Convention, Melania Trump on Thursday called for an end to online bullying of children and teenagers, saying, it is \\"absolutely unacceptable when it’s done with no name hiding on the internet.\\"      “Technology has changed our universe. But like anything that is powerful it can have a bad side. We have seen this already. As adults, many of us are able to handle mean words — even lies. Children and teenagers can be fragile. They hurt when they are made fun of or made to feel less in looks or intelligence. This makes their life hard and forces them to hide and retreat. Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough especially to children and to teenagers.”      \\"We have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other,\\" she continued. She did not make any reference to the fact that her husband has engaged throughout the campaign in bare-knuckled personal attacks on his political opponents, the media, random celebrities and a host of others.      Hello! We’ve got complete midterm election coverage right here. Let’s begin!      Her speech in Berwyn, Pa. — a suburb of Philadelphia — was directed at suburban women, a group that could be critical if Trump wants to pull-off a win next week.      \\"People have asked me, if Donald is the President, what kind of First Lady will you be?\\" Melania Trump said. \\"It will be my honor and privilege to serve this country. I will be an advocate for women and for children.\\"      Trump’s wife has stayed mostly out of the spotlight since her speech at this year’s Republican National Convention, which included a section taken directly from Michelle Obama’s 2008 convention speech. She was joined on the trail Thursday by Indiana Gov. Mike Pence's wife Karen — who gave a glowing introduction.      Melania Trump focused on her upbringing in Slovenia and making it to America.      \\"I'm an immigrant and let me tell you no one values the freedom and value of opportunity more than me,\\" Melania Trump said. She said it took her 10 years to become a U.S. citizen. \\"Love for this country is something we immediately shared when I met Donald.\\"      \\"He certainly knows how to shake things up — doesn’t he?\\" she asked, eliciting cheers from the crowd.      Washington Post-ABC News tracking polls released this week have Donald Trump losing white, college-educated women by roughly two dozen points. Mitt Romney won the group by 6 points according to exit polls.      One way the campaign has tried to appeal to suburban voters in Pennsylvania is to dispatch some of his less bombastic surrogates to the area. His daughter Ivanka Trump held a series of “coffee with Ivanka” events in the Philadelphia suburbs last month.      Melania Trump delivers remarks at a campaign rally in Berwyn, Pa. Nov. 3, 2016. (Photo: Mandel Ngan, AFP/Getty Images)      Pennsylvania is one of a handful of states critical to Donald Trump's election. Currently, Clinton leads by an average of 3 points, but polls over the last week have shown a tightening in the race.      “Pennsylvania is a state that we are confident winning. It’s a state (whose) makeup fully relates to Mr. Trump’s message as well as Mrs. Trump’s message,” Boris Epsteyn, a senior adviser to the campaign, told USA TODAY on Thursday.      The campaign has spent a significant amount of time in Chester County, a Philadelphia suburb, where the city of Berwyn is located.      It’s a county in battleground Pennsylvania full of white, college-educated voters, a demographic with which Donald Trump has struggled.      Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2eYmJvH ||||| Here is our bleak present: a time in which Melania Trump can stand before a Pennsylvania audience to denounce “mean words” and bullying on social media.      In a speech on Thursday, Melania Trump—a woman who has utilized her own social media presence to encourage the harassment of journalist, and is the wife of a man who uses Twitter as a place to settle personal affronts, perceived or otherwise—described “our culture” as “too mean and too rough.”            In a speech rich with apparently unnoticed irony, Trump said:      Like anything that is powerful, it can have a bad side. We have seen this already. As adults, many of us are able to handle mean words, even lies. Children and teenagers can be fragile. They are hurt when they are made fun of or made to feel less in looks and intelligence. [...] Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough, especially for children and teenagers. It’s never okay when a 12-year-old child is mocked. [...] We have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other...      Advertisement      Trump’s speech was a carefully threaded needle that differentiated between adults, some of whom are “able to handle” mean words and lies, and children who are victims of a culture of meanness (Who created this culture? Who’s to say?). Mocking a 12-year-old is, apparently, out of bounds, but ogling teenage girls is fine. Also fine, we can assume: sexual assault, harassing female journalists, calling adult women “mean words,” boy’s talk, and unabashed racism. The only delineation is that such tactics cannot be employed against anyone under 18; once someone is old enough to vote, then go ahead.      Just a quick recap: words can hurt children, but the looming threat of political correctness hurts us all.       ||||| (CNN) Melania Trump says she'd work to improve a social media culture that has gotten \\"too mean and too tough\\" -- riddled with insults based on \\"looks and intelligence\\" -- if she becomes first lady.      But she didn't make any mention of the Twitter activities of her husband, Donald Trump, who has relentlessly attacked his political foes, journalists, critics and other entertainers for years with demeaning comments based on their appearances and intelligence.      In a rare appearance on the campaign trail -- and her first solo speech since the convention this summer -- the wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump discussed her vision for her role in the White House for the first time Thursday in suburban Philadelphia.      \\"It is never OK when a 12-year-old girl or boy is mocked, bullied or attacked. It is terrible when it happens on the playground, and it is absolutely unacceptable when it is done by someone with no name hiding on the internet. We have to find a better way to talk to each other,\\" Melania Trump said.      \\"We must find better ways to honor and support the basic goodness of our children, especially in social media,\\" she said. \\"It will be one of the main focuses of my work, if I am privileged enough to become your first lady.\\"      In September, after Clinton cited Trump's reference to 1996 Miss Universe Alicia Machado as \\"Miss Piggy\\" and \\"Miss Housekeeper\\" during their first presidential debate, Trump said in a 3 a.m. Twitter rant that Machado is \\"disgusting\\" and a \\"con\\" and directed followers to check out a non-existent Machado sex tape.      Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Melania Trump's speech will not serve to highlight her husband's most controversial and inflammatory tweets.      \\"It won't for responsible journalists who wish to cover her entire speech/life journey,\\" Conway said, adding a shot at the Democratic nominee and the FBI investigation into her private email server. \\"And under that premise, would President Hillary Clinton never be able to talk law enforcement or corruption investigations again? Would she just abolish the DOJ and FBI?\\"      It was Melania Trump's first speech since her appearance at the Republican National Convention, where her remarks triggered controversy because one section plagiarized Michelle Obama's 2008 Democratic National Committee speech. A speechwriter later apologized.      She cast her husband as someone who's in touch with America's working class.      \\"Every time my husband learned of a factory closing in Ohio or North Carolina or Pennsylvania, I could see him get very upset,\\" she said as she made the case that the Republican nominee can fix the nation's economic woes.      Trump opened the speech by discussing her youth in Slovenia before immigrating to the United States, saying that \\"America meant if you could dream it, you could become it.\\"      She said she went through a 10-year process of becoming a United States citizen, which she called \\"the greatest privilege in the world.\\"      \\"I'm an immigrant, and no one values the freedoms and opportunities of America more than me,\\" she said.      Melania Trump hasn't had a very public role on the campaign trail and has made it clear, publicly and privately, that her first priority is raising their 10-year-old son, Barron.      But her speech Thursday was the first of what Donald Trump said in an interview with ABC would be two or three major speeches before the November 8 election.      The speech took place in Berwyn, Pennsylvania -- in the suburbs of Philadelphia -- and was designed to help Trump win over the middle-class women in the region who could tip the balance of Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes for Trump or Clinton.      Conway worked with Melania Trump on the speech and was in attendance Thursday. Conway, Trump advisers said, has built a positive relationship with Melania over the course of the campaign. And Melania has privately been very supportive of Conway's role as the head of her husband's campaign.      Melania Trump was introduced by Karen Pence, the wife of the Republican nominee's running mate Mike Pence.      \\"I know that America will fall in love with her just as much as she loves the American people,\\" Karen Pence said. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"In her first solo speech since the Republican National Convention, Melania Trump, wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, pledged to combat cyber-bullying as the first lady.

Finally, I'll analyze if the two categories overlap. Step 1: Identifying the goals ====== Best questions: The goal of the best questions is to thoroughly evaluate the candidate's qualifications, experience, and fit for the job and the company culture. They should also allow the interviewee to showcase their skills, problem-solving abilities, and values that align with the company's mission. Most interesting questions: The goal of the most interesting questions is to engage the candidate in a deep conversation and reveal unique and personal traits. These questions can lead to unexpected answers and insights, allowing the candidate to think outside the box and demonstrate their creativity and intelligence. Step 2: Listing examples of the best questions ====== 1. Can you please describe your job history and significant achievements within those roles? 2. What makes you the ideal candidate for this position? 3. Can you describe a challenging situation you faced at work and how you handled it? 4. How do you stay updated with industry trends and new technologies? 5. What types of work environments do you thrive in, and how do you contribute to a positive team culture?

Article: Plastic-cutting blades have a higher tooth count than a standard wood-cutting blade. This allows for a smoother cut without having jagged edges. It also helps prevent kickback if you’re using an electric saw. Ensure you’re using a blade meant for cutting plastic. Use a thicker blade so the plastic does not melt and stick back together. If you are trying to cut out smaller windows in larger sheets or making small handheld crafts, use a craft blade to chip away small bits of plastic. Drill holes to use as starting points for the blade and shave away the plastic until you reach the guide lines. Clamp a piece of straight wood across the plastic with the line you intend to cut hanging slightly over the edge to cut a straight line. Guide the saw through the plastic sheet, keeping your hand on the wide portion of the saw shoe. Jigsaws allow for better mobility as you make curved cuts into the plastic. Using a blade with 10 teeth per inch, turn the plastic to make the shapes you need.  Drill holes in the plastic along the guide lines so your blade has places to start and stop easily.  Make straight relief cuts from the outside of the plastic to the curves. This will help prevent the plastic from warping and shortens the cutting distance. Leave room between the guide lines you’ve drawn and where you cut. You can always file these down later. This type of saw makes cuts only when you pull it, unlike other hand saws that cut when you push and pull it. A pull saw helps make a cleaner, smoother line in your plastic and may be easier for making shorter straight cuts than an electric saw. Use your thumb to guide the blade when you make the initial cut. From there, place the saw into the line you’ve made and pull the saw through. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article discusses the process of cutting plastic using various tools and techniques. It emphasizes the importance of using a plastic-cutting blade with a higher tooth count for smoother cuts and prevention of kickback.

Today we're going to talk about how a taxi app from London called Hailo stopped working in the United States and let two other popular apps, Uber and Lyft, run the show instead. Once upon a time, there were many taxi apps in the world, and one of them, from London, was called Hailo. Hailo was a special app that helped people find taxis really easily. All they had to do is tap on their phone, and a friendly taxi would come to take them where they wanted to go. But Hailo wanted to make even more people happy, so it decided to try working in the United States too. In the United States, there were already two very popular taxi apps called Uber and Lyft. These apps were also helping people find rides, just like Hailo. When Hailo arrived in the United States, it tried super hard to make people happy and show them that it could be as good as Uber and Lyft. But it wasn't easy because Uber and Lyft were already very popular, and they had lots and lots of friends who liked using them. Hailo tried so hard, but it wasn't easy for them. People in the United States liked Uber and Lyft more, and Hailo couldn't find enough people who wanted to use their app. As we know, even our favorite superhero needs to be strong to keep fighting the big battles. Sadly, Hailo wasn't strong enough, and it didn't win against Uber and Lyft in the United States. So, after some time, Hailo decided that it couldn't keep fighting Uber and Lyft in the United States. It decided to go back to London and other places where people liked it and used it every day. Hailo knew it just couldn't win this battle in the United States, and it was time to focus on making people happy in other countries. Even though Hailo didn't win in the United States, it still works hard every day to help people find taxis and get where they need to go in other parts of the world. Hailo learned that sometimes, it's okay not to win every battle, as long as you keep trying and doing your best where you can. And that's the story, little friends, of how the London Taxi App Hailo stopped working in the United States and let Uber and Lyft take over.
