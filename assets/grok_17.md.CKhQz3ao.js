Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: It is 1955, somewhere in rural England. Wealthy Victor Hazell owns a vast estate, and drives his expensive car proudly around it to survey his domain. He drives past several signs that show he has acquired much of his property recently, by buying out surrounding smallholdings. There are hundreds of prime pheasants wandering around his property, and as he drives along his two gamekeepers, Rabbetts and Springer, wish him a good morning. However, he does not acknowledge their presence, throws his cigar out the window and drives on proudly, much to their disgust.Hazell's good mood is ruined when he stops on a hillside and spots, in the distance, the garage and filling station owned by William Smith and his nine-year-old son, Danny. Hazell gets out of his car and peers at the structure through a set of field glasses, watching Danny fill the tank of a customer's car. In high bad humor, he returns to his own car and proceeds down the hill towards the filling station.In the garage, William and Danny have just finished repairing a car another customer left behind. Danny asks permission to drive it out of the garage, and William lets him do so. Hazell's car comes barreling down the hill at the same time as Danny is backing the car out of the garage, and both he and Hazell are forced to slam brakes to avoid a collision. William praises Danny for his quick thinking and Hazell, putting on a friendly tone, does the same. He then asks William if he'd be willing to sell his land - the Smiths own six acres of field and the garage, filling station, and an old caravan which serves as their home - but William tells him he already explained to the solicitor from Hazell's estate he was not interested.Hazell explains to William that his land is smack in the middle of the rest of his estate, and is preventing him from achieving his goal of having one of the biggest and best pheasant shoots in that part of England. He offers him 2,000 pounds, then 2,500, but William remains unmoved. Hazell frustratedly demands why the obviously poor...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: “Despite all that good news, there’s plenty of horror stories being told. All are untrue, but they’re being told all over America.” –Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), remarks on the floor of the Senate, Feb. 26, 2014 “I can’t say that every one of the Koch brothers’ ads are a lie, but I’ll say this: Mr. President, the vast, vast majority of them are.” –Reid, a few hours later By popular demand from readers, we will take a look at these statements by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) He made his comments as part of a harsh attack on the billionaire Koch brothers, who have backed Americans for Prosperity, a political group that has spent 30 million in the past six months, virtually all on ads attacking Democrats who support the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare. At one point, he even declared, the brothers had “no conscience” and were “un-American” — political rhetoric that some might argue goes too far, given Reid’s office. Taken by itself, as a blanket comment that all tales of woe under the new law are false, Reid’s first statement appears ridiculous. But we don’t like to play gotcha here at The Fact Checker. From the context — the focus on the Koch brothers — Reid appeared to be focusing on the tales told in the ads sponsored by AFP. After an eruption on Twitter and other social media, Reid returned to the floor to amend his statement: “I can’t say that every one of the Koch brothers’ ads are a lie, but I’ll say this: Mr. President, the vast, vast majority of them are.” “Senator Reid wanted to be accurate so he went back to the floor to correct the record,” said his spokesman Adam Jentleson. “Senator Reid’s argument is with the shadowy, secretive billionaires behind the ads who are spending millions to rig the system to benefit themselves and the corporations they control, not the people in the ads.” In other words, it appears Reid misspoke the first time, so we will evaluate his second statement. For the record, The Fact Checker awards Pinocchios but shies away from the word “lie” because it is such a harsh, personal judgment. The Pinocchio scale is based on the idea that there are various types of misstatements, some worse than others. By our count on You Tube, Americans for Prosperity has run about 50 anti-Obamacare ads since July. Many are repetitive or on the same theme, frequently citing PolitiFact’s designation of an Obama statement on the law as “Lie of the Year.” Some of the Obamacare ads even feature actors, not real people, which some people might argue crosses a line. But many of these ads have never been vetted by fact checkers. However, those that have faced scrutiny generally have not fared well. The Fact Checker, for instance, has examined five of these ads, and has given four of them Two Pinocchios. However, one received just a single Pinocchio, and we praised it for sticking relatively close to the facts for an attack ad. One ad The Fact Checker evaluated starred a women in Michigan named Julia Boonstra. We raised serious questions about her allegations in this ad—as did our colleagues at PolitiFact—and our analysis was cited by Paul Krugman in the New York Times. Reid, in turn, cited Krugman in his floor speech. PolitiFact, meanwhile, has looked at six of these ads. In two cases, it said it did not have enough facts for its Truth-O-Meter, but otherwise it awarded one “half true,” two “mostly false,” and one “false” for these ads. Our colleagues at FactCheck.org do not use a rating system, but have faulted two of the ads for lacking context or being wrong. We should note that AFP is very aggressive with its ads. In the past, it has earned Four Pinocchios from The Fact Checker, and more than 80 percent of its PolitiFact ratings have been Pants on Fire, False or Mostly False. (The percentage declines if you include ads that did not yield a rating.) It has never earned a True or Mostly True rating, which for some political organizations might be a badge of honor. Reid claimed that a “vast, vast majority” of AFP’s Obamacare ads are lies. Vast majority is an imprecise and hackneyed phrase, but presumably it is above 75 percent. We’re not sure what a “vast, vast majority” would be. We also are not sure what would qualify as a “lie” though on balance we might reserve that for Four Pinocchio or Pants on Fire and/or False statements. (Others might add “mostly false” and Three Pinocchio statements to the “lie” pile, but personally that seems to go too far.) But only one of the Obamacare ads vetted by the Fact Checker or PolitiFact achieved such ratings, though all had various problems and statements that went too far. Meanwhile, our colleague Greg Sargent has noted that two recent AFP ads, released after controversial Boonstra ad, appeared to go out of their way not to make statements that could be called into question. In this case, even Reid’s revised rhetoric went too far. He would have been on safer ground if he dropped the harsh rhetoric and had simply said that many of the ads have serious problems and even rely on actors, not real people.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.  - Christian metal, also known as white metal or heavenly metal, is a form of heavy metal music usually defined by its message using song lyrics as well as the dedication of the band members to Christianity. Christian metal is typically performed by professed Christians sometimes principally for Christians who listen to heavy metal music and often produced and distributed through various Christian networks.  - Strange Celebrity was a Christian rock band, formed in Nashville, Tennessee, composing of four members: Luke Brown (lead vocals, guitar), Rick Wilson (drums), Quinton Gibson (guitar), and Tracy Ferrie (bass guitar). The band is now defunct, as Luke Brown has pursued a solo career.  - Timothy \\"Tim\\" Gaines (born Timothy Hagelganz; December 15, 1962) is an American bass guitarist. He is most known for being the bassist of the Christian metal band Stryper.  - Tracy Ferrie is the current touring bass player for the classic rock band Boston and was the former bass player of Christian metal band Stryper . Beginning in 1996 , Tracy played bass for Michael Sweet 's solo band and was also a member of the bands Electrik , Sally Steele , Seraiah , Whitecross , Guardian , Rebecca St. James , Plumb , Sonicflood and Strange Celebrity . He is from Elkhart , Indiana and a national roller skating champion . Tracy is a Berklee College of Music alumni and a prominent session bass player . He participated on stage in the Boston Strong Benefit along with Aerosmith , J. Geils , Jimmy Buffet , Carol King and James Taylor . As a member of Stryper , Tracy was joined By Tom Scholz and Gary Phil to play \`\` Peace of Mind '' for the Station nightclub fire benefit for the families and victims of the tragic fire in Rhode Island . Some of his recording credits are with Stryper , Plumb , April McLean , Strange Celebrity , Whitecross , Jeff Deyo , Boe Braswell , Kristy Starling , Danielle Bollinger , Paul Alan , and Kimberly Locke . Tracy is the Assistant Minister at Grace Church of East Dennis on Cape Cod. During mid- 2012 , Ferrie toured with Boston , replacing Kimberley Dahme .  - Whitecross is a Christian metal band that formed in 1985 in Waukegan, IL releasing their first recording in 1987. Their early albums, which often invite comparisons to Ratt, are laced with fast, technical guitar work. In 1994, Rex Carroll split with lead vocalist Scott Wenzel. Scott retained the use of the name \\"Whitecross\\" while Carroll went on to form King James with Jimi Bennett (see below). At this point the band's sound underwent a drastic change.  - Stryper is an American Christian heavy metal band from Orange County, California. The group's lineup consists of Michael Sweet (lead vocals, guitar), Oz Fox (guitar), Tim Gaines (bass guitar), and Robert Sweet (drums). In 2004, Gaines left the band and was replaced by Tracy Ferrie (bass guitar) but rejoined in 2009.  - Michael Harrison Sweet (born July 4, 1963) is a singer from Whittier, California; he is the co-founder, writer, lead guitarist, lead singer and front man of the Christian metal band Stryper.

It may seem some people are just naturally better at word games than others, but it's not all down to luck - there are some tricks you can use to steal points from your opponents. According to UK Scrabble expert and Countdown champion Barry Grossman, there are at least 100 different tips players can use to win, or at least boost their overall score. These include how to remember unusual words, why two-letter words, especially involving the 'X' tile, are so important and when it is acceptable to use proper nouns, which are usually banned. According to UK Scrabble expert Barry Grossman, there are at least 100 different ways players can win, or at least boost their score. These include how to remember unusual words, why two-letter words are so important and when it is acceptable to use proper nouns. Grossman suggests the more words in a person's vocabulary, the better, and knowing the more rare and unusual words can benefit the most in Scrabble. For example:. Epopoeia - an epic poem. Psst - a word used to capture someone's attention inconspicuously. Brrr - used to signify being cold. Barry - another word for a blunder. Euoi - cry of Bacchic frenzy. Qat - a variant spelling of the word khat, which is an evergreen shrub. Jiao - a monetary unit in China. In his book, 101 Ways to Win at Scrabble, Grossman explains that although proper nouns aren't generally accepted, there are some exceptions. For example, his own name Barry can be used as another word for a blunder or mistake. It is Australian slang. Equally 'danny' and plural 'dannies', is acceptable to describe a child's hand. Elsewhere in his book, Grossman explains that two-letter words are important because they can be used to get rid of tiles towards the end of the game, but they can also be used to connect words. He goes on to say the 'X' tile, worth eight points in the game, either preceded or succeeded by a vowel gives a high-scoring combination for a low number of tiles used. These include 'ax', 'ex', 'xi' and 'xu'. Many dictionaries now have a page detailing all the accepted two-letter words, described as the 'glue' of Scrabble including jo, es and ta. Equally, there are a host of three-letter words, such as iff, roc, and ulu that can be useful. Grossman's book adds that there are a handful of four-letter words that don't contain any vowels that are also accepted in Scrabble. These include psst, pfft, brrr and grrl - although Grossman points out that only these spellings are accepted, and extra 'F's, 'R's and 'S' can't be added. Another way to steal points from the words already placed on the board by opponents, as listed in Grossman's book, is to take advantage of prefixes and suffixes. These included 'ed', 'ing' and adding the letter S to the end of words, yet Grossman adds the suffix 'ish' is rare and equally effective, especially on words such as pixyish. Elsewhere in his book, Grossman explains two-letter words are important because they can be used to get rid of tiles towards the end of the game, and to connect other words. Described as the 'glue' of Scrabble, these include jo, es and ta. Equally, three-letter words, such as iff, roc, and ulu can be useful. The letter 'S' and the blank tile should be used sparingly, according to Grossman's book. An S, for example, should only be used when adding it increases the overall score by around five points, otherwise it's a 'waste'. Another key thing to remember is that the letter 'Q' doesn't always need to be followed by a 'U'. In the two-letter list the word QI is 'a variant of chi'. While Qat (a variant spelling of the word khat; an evergreen shrub), Qaid (a Muslim chief) and sheqalim (the plural of sheqel, the currency of Israel) are examples of longer words where this technique can be used. Grossman suggests the more words in a. person's vocabulary, the better they are at Scrabble, and knowing the more rare and unusual. words can benefit the most. He doesn't insist players learn the dictionary, but it is worthwhile familiarising themselves with some of these unusual words, or words that use unusual letter combinations including epopoeia, an epic poem, and tchick, a clicking sound. For words that are difficult to spell, Grossman suggests creating a mnemonic to help players remember them, such as 'John Is Always Out' for the word jiao, a monetary unit in China. Ultimately, Grossman claims that sometimes tiles need to be swapped, which means that player misses a go, but they may get a better selection of letters and a higher score as a result. The National Scrabble Championship final takes place on Sunday. Highlights:","output":"1. UK Scrabble expert and Countdown champion, Barry Grossman, has compiled a list of at least 100 winning tips for word game enthusiasts to boost their overall game score. 2. Grossman's strategies include remembering unusual words, the tactical usage of two-letter words especially those involving an 'X', and knowing when it's permissible to use proper nouns. 3. Expanding one's vocabulary improves gameplay, and particularly benefits from knowing rare and unusual words, such as 'epopoeia'(an epic poem), 'psst', 'brrr', 'euoi'(cry of Bacchic frenzy), 'qat'(an evergreen shrub), and 'jiao'(a monetary unit in China). 4. His book, '101 Ways to Win at Scrabble,' explains the importance and strategic usage of two-letter words as a method for offloading tiles towards the end of a game and connecting other words. 5. Grossman advises the sparing use of 'S' and the blank tile. For example, an 'S' should only be utilised when it can increase the overall score by approximately five points. 6. Evidently, the letter 'Q' is not always required to be followed by 'U', with words like 'QI', 'Qat', 'Qaid' and 'sheqalim' serving as examples of this rule. 7. Players don't have to know the entire dictionary, but familiarising themselves with some of the unusual words or words involving uncommon letter combinations can be beneficial. 8. Grossman suggests using mnemonics to remember difficult-to-spell words, and swapping tiles if needed, despite losing a turn, for the potential for higher scoring letters.  These strategies are expanded upon in his book, '101 Ways to Win at Scrabble,' a useful resource for those aspiring to increase their Scrabble proficiency.

Now as a senior citizen, I have been feeding the cardinals who live in my yard and I just love this book. Gene Stratton Porter is a very descriptive writer so you feel like you are seeing what she saw. I wish they would put The Keeper of the Bees on Kindle. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","output":"The review provided for \\"The Song of the Cardinal\\" by Gene Stratton Porter can be considered to depict the product in a predominantly flattering light, with a minor unflattering aspect. The reviewer's change in perspective and appreciation for the book over time contributes to an overall positive impression. Here are the reasons why: 1. The reviewer's change in opinion: The review mentions that the individual initially found the book boring when they were young. However, as a senior citizen, their experiences with cardinals in their yard have led them to love the book. This change in perspective highlights that personal growth and experiences can greatly influence one's appreciation for a piece of literature. This aspect suggests that the book may be better suited for readers with a developed appreciation for nature or more life experiences to relate to the content or the author's writing style. 2. Descriptive writing praise: The review specifically commends Gene Stratton Porter's descriptive writing, stating that the reader feels like they are seeing what the author saw. This suggests that the book effectively immerses the reader in its world and allows them to connect with the author's experiences and emotions. This type of writing style will likely appeal to readers who enjoy vivid imagery, as it enables them to engage with the content on a deeper level. 3. A request for another book: The reviewer expresses their interest in seeing another Gene Stratton Porter book, \\"The Keeper of the Bees,\\" made available on Kindle. This request implies that they have enjoyed other works by this author and believe that their books are worth sharing with a wider audience. This further reinforces the positive image of the author, consequently reflecting positively on \\"The Song of the Cardinal.\\" However, the unflattering aspect arises from the reviewer's initial experience with the book. Their statement of finding the book boring when they were younger does create a slightly negative impression. This detail may discourage potential readers who are concerned that the book might not suit their taste, especially if they do not yet share the reviewer's newfound love and admiration for cardinals or have not yet experienced similar connections with nature. In conclusion, despite the initial negative impression, the review ultimately paints a largely flattering image of \\"The Song of the Cardinal.\\" The reviewer's personal growth, their praise for the author's writing style, and their interest in other works by the author contribute to an overall positive and appreciative impression of the book."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person whose work's increased value has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries? is inside the article: Since his death, Thomson's work has grown in value and popularity. Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \\"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\\". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \\"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as the Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind.\\" For Canadian artists Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee, he is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity\\".As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was Early Spring, Canoe Lake, which sold in 2009 for CAD2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute., can you guess it ?

The rationalist Barrett is rudely sceptical of Tanner's Christian faith and spiritual beliefs, asserting that there is nothing but unfocused electromagnetic energy in the house. Barrett brings a machine he has developed, which he believes will rid the house of any paranormal presence or force.Though not a physical medium, Tanner begins to manifest physical phenomena inside the house. When, after a quarrel with Tanner, Barrett is attacked by invisible forces, he suspects that Tanner may be using the house's energy against him. Meanwhile Fischer remains aloof, with his mind closed to the house's influence, and is only there to collect the generous pay offered him to return.Edith Barrett is subjected to erotic visions late at night, which seem linked to her lackluster sex life. She goes downstairs and, in a seeming trance, disrobes and demands sex from Fischer. He instead strikes her, snapping her out of the trance, and she returns to herself, horrified and ashamed. A second incident occurs a day or so later (this time, she is awake but uninhibited due to alcohol); her husband arrives a moment later to witness her advances to Fischer and is resentful, stating to Fischer's face that he believes that Fischer no longer has any psychic ability and that \\"Mr. Deutsch is...","output":"The house in \\"The Legend of Hell House\\" is described as the \\"Mount Everest of haunted houses.\\" It was originally owned by the notorious Emeric Belasco, who was a perverted millionaire and supposed murderer.

[-] it is not possible to tell. [-] no.","output":"[-] no. Based on the information given in the premise, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true. The premise \\"A runner is being chased by a man in a penguin costume\\" gives us specific information about a particular scenario. Here, the main action involves a person running, who is being pursued by another individual wearing a penguin costume. The hypothesis, on the other hand, \\"A runner is sitting on the bench next to a penguin\\" presents a completely different setting. In this situation, the runner is now sedentary, supposed to be seated on a bench and also alongside a penguin (which could be interpreted as a real animal, a statue or another person in a penguin suit). The two scenarios differ greatly. The sentence structure, subjects, verbs, and context all contrast fundamentally with each other. Even assuming the man in the penguin suit is referred to as a 'penguin' in the hypothesis, the runner's action changes from 'being chased' to 'sitting'. We have no information about any occurrence of the runner stopping and sitting next to the penguin. Therefore, these differing contexts create enough discrepancy between the premise and the hypothesis, implying that if the premise is true, we cannot automatically affirm the hypothesis to be true.

A BBC Crimewatch reconstruction showed that one or more people broke into the house, confronted Brickwood, stabbed him, and took cash and jewelry before fleeing the scene. The horrifying experience of identifying his father's body and informing his siblings of the tragedy has left a lasting impact on Dale. One year later, the family is still desperately searching for answers, and Gary painfully reflects on his final moments with his father, wishing he had stopped by one more time before the deadly attack. Driven by grief and anger, Gary urges the people of Northampton to come forward with any information about the murderers, accusing them of being \\"gutless and spineless\\" for keeping silent. Despite their persistence, the family has not seen justice served for their father, and they remain hopeful that the community will ultimately come together to help solve the case. In an effort to keep the case alive and encourage new leads, the family held a candlelit vigil on Monday, and the police are expected to re-appeal for information regarding the murder."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

DRIVING IN AMERICA Covering 800 miles of American freeways in less than 10 days is something I never thought I’d do to be honest – an inexperienced driver at best I’ve driven short distances (and through a Florida tropical storm from Cape Canaveral back to our Orlando apartment) – but somehow we survived unscathed driving diagonally the length of Louisiana from New Orleans to Shreveport, through the crazy traffic of Dallas and along the long, undulating motorways of Texas. I’ll be honest, and admit that did we encounter a couple of challenging and scary situations – a truck driver changing lanes not allowing me enough time to enter a motorway (I luckily just popped into a shoulder lane), getting lost in the middle of Dallas skyscrapers (we jammed every device we had onto navigation), accidentally assuming a road was much narrower than it really was (luckily the road was relatively quiet so I just guided her nimbly over to the correct lane) and dodging some of the twits who pulled out in front of us – one with a trailer full of wood – but overall it really was fine.

Information:  - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects.   - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form.  - Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its periodthe time interval between beatsis half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats). Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio (sound) signals, radio waves, and light.  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish. The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function.  - Ernie Manouse ( born September 1 , 1969 , in Binghamton , New York ) is an American television host , radio personality , writer and producer . He currently hosts the interview show InnerVIEWS with Ernie Manouse , produced by HoustonPBS . His work with HoustonPBS has met critical acclaim in the southern United States , earning him numerous KATIE awards and regional Emmy Awards  - The amplitude of a periodic variable is a measure of its change over a single period (such as time or spatial period). There are various definitions of amplitude (see below), which are all functions of the magnitude of the difference between the variable's extreme values. In older texts the phase is sometimes called the amplitude.  - Binghamton is a city in, and the county seat of, Broome County, New York, United States. It lies in the state's Southern Tier region near the Pennsylvania border, in a bowl-shaped valley at the confluence of the Susquehanna and Chenango Rivers. Binghamton is the principal city and cultural center of the Binghamton metropolitan area (also known as Greater Binghamton, or historically the Triple Cities), home to a quarter million people. The population of the city itself, according to the 2010 census, is 47,376.  - The Southern Tier is the counties of New York west of the Catskill Mountains along the northern border of Pennsylvania. It generally includes the counties that border Pennsylvania west of Delaware County, but definitions of the region vary widely.  - Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German: \\"Pennsylvaani\\"), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. The commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east.  - The Binghamton Metropolitan Statistical Area, also called Greater Binghamton or the Triple Cities, is a region of southern upstate New York in the Northeastern United States, anchored by the city of Binghamton. The MSA encompasses Broome and Tioga counties, which together had a population of 251,725 as of the 2010 census. From 1963 to 1983, the MSA also included neighboring Susquehanna County in Pennsylvania, part of which still falls in the Binghamton, NYPA Urban Area. In addition to these three counties, the greater region includes parts of Delaware and Chenango counties in New York; portions of Cortland and Otsego counties in New York and Wayne County, Pennsylvania are sometimes considered part of the region as well.

Movie title: Cyrano de Bergerac Context: In seventeenth-century Paris, poet and supreme swordsman Cyrano de Bergerac (JosÃ© Ferrer) stops a play from being shown because he ostensibly cannot stand the bombastic style of the principal actor, Montfleury (Arthur Blake). An annoyed aristocratic fop, the Vicomte de Valvert (Albert Cavens), provokes him into a duel by tritely insulting Cyrano's enormous nose. Cyrano first mocks his lack of wit, improvising numerous inventive ways in which Valvert could have phrased it (much to the amusement of the audience). He then composes a ballade for the occasion on the spot and recites it during the sword fight. With the last line, he stabs his opponent. Cyrano's friend Le Bret (Morris Carnovsky), Captain of the Gascony guards, warns him he has made powerful enemies of his victim's friends, but he is unconcerned. When Le Bret presses him to reveal the real reason he hates Montfleury, Cyrano admits that he became jealous when he saw his beautiful cousin Roxane (Mala Powers) being smiled at by the actor. He confesses that he is in love with her, but harbors no hope of it being returned because of his nose. When he receives a request from Roxane to see her in the morning, he is finally emboldened to act. Then pastry chef and fellow poet Ragueneau (Lloyd Corrigan) approaches him for help. Ragueneau has learned that a nobleman he had mocked with his verses, the Comte De Guiche (Ralph Clanton), has hired a hundred ruffians to teach him a lesson. Cyrano escorts him, kills eight of the horde, and drives off the rest. The next day, before he can tell Roxane of his feelings, she informs him that she has fallen in love with a handsome guardsman, Christian de Neuvillette (William Prince), though she has not even spoken to him. Cyrano hides his devastation and agrees to help her. Cyrano befriends the young man and discovers that he is infatuated with Roxane, but is too inept with words to woo her.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Humans have been keeping animals as pets for tens of thousands of years, but Dr Jean-Loup Rault, an animal scientist at the University of Melbourne in Australia, believes new companions are coming: robot pets. \\"Technology is moving very fast,\\" Rault told ABC News, \\"The Tamagotchi in the early 1990s was really the first robotic pet, and now Sony and other big companies have improved them a lot.\\" This may not _ pet lovers. After all, who would choose a plastic toy over a lovely puppy? But Rault argues that the robotic kind has a lot going for it: \\"You don't have to feed it, you don't have to walk it, it won't make a mess in your house, and you can go on a holiday without feeling guilty.\\" The technology also benefits those who are allergic to pets, short on space, or fearful of real animals. It's not clear whether robot pets can replace real ones. But studies do suggest that we can bond with these smart machines. People give their cars names and kids give their toy animals life stories. It's the same with robots. When Sony stopped its repair service for its robot dog Aibo in March 2014, owners in Japan held funerals. As an animal welfare researcher, Rault is concerned about how robotic pets could affect our attitudes towards live animals. \\"If we become used to a robotic companion that doesn't need food, water or exercises, perhaps it will change how humans care about other living beings,\\" he said. So are dogs and cats a thing of the past, as Rault predicts? For those who grew up with living and breathing pets, the mechanical kind might not do. But for our next generation who are in constant touch with smart technology, a future in which lovely pets needn't have a heartbeat might not be a far-fetched dream.

When I talked about backing out of it , he would just say , \\" Hey , it 's up to you , \\" but with a deliberate look that said , \\" Failure is part of success . Do n't give up . \\" I knew that I would be letting him down if I did n't try , and the thought of disappointing him was unbearable to me . What does the father 's look tell the narrator ?","output":"The father's look communicates a powerful and meaningful message to the narrator, one that is both encouraging and subtly persuasive. Through this nonverbal cue, the father conveys his belief in the importance of resilience, determination, and the acceptance of failure as an essential part of the journey towards success. He does not force his child to participate or continue on with the decision they initially made, but rather offers the choice with an understanding that it is ultimately up to them. However, his deliberate look serves to emphasize and remind the narrator of the underlying values he wishes to instill. This look appears to have a profound impact on the narrator, as it stirs a deep sense of responsibility and desire to live up to their father's expectations. The fear of disappointing him becomes a driving force for the narrator to push past any hesitations or doubts they may have about following through with their decision. It is evident that the narrator holds their father's opinion in high regard, and thus, this unspoken encouragement resonates deeply and motivates them to take their father's message to heart. The father's look, in essence, tells the narrator that they should not be afraid to face and overcome challenges, and should strive to embrace failure as an opportunity to learn and grow. It serves as a gentle reminder of the life lessons that the father wants to pass on to his child, emphasizing the importance of perseverance and determination in the pursuit of success. Simultaneously, it also conveys unconditional support and trust in the narrator's ability to make their own decisions, while silently urging them to push themselves and not give up."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Passage: The Rams meet the Broncos at home for the first time since their home opener in 2006. The Rams won 18-10. The injury-riddled Denver Broncos (7-2) travel to St. Louis, looking to extend their lead in the AFC West, but it was too late as the Rams defense harassed Peyton Manning and the Broncos offense all day long. Rams' quarterback Shaun Hill returned from injury and took over for Austin Davis, who started only a few games. Among the game's highlights was Rams safety Rodney McLeod taking a hit on Broncos' wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders, forcing Sanders to leave the game with a concussion. Officials later confirmed that the McLeod hit on Sanders was not illegal. The Rams won 22-7 and are tied one game apiece against all AFC West opponents.  Question: How many total points did the Rams score in the two games against the Broncos?  Answer type: Number  A:","output":"To answer this question, first, we need to find out how many points the Rams scored in each game against the Broncos. From the passage, we can see that: 1. In their home opener in 2006, the Rams won 18-10. 2. In the second game, the Rams won 22-7. Now, we need to add the number of scored points from each game: 18 (first game) + 22 (second game) = 40 So the total points scored by the Rams in the two games against the Broncos is 40.

To protect its seagoing interests and trade routes, Portugal established strategic garrisons in Goa (India), Malacca (East Indies), and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal's greatest misfortune struck on All Saint's Day, 1 November 1755.  After reading the above, is \\"Sebastiao led 18,000 followers in a vain crusade in Morocco which led to their deaths\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What created a crisis of succession following this era of increased trade?\\"? pick from the following. (a). no (b). yes","output":"(b). yes Sebastião led 18,000 followers in a vain crusade in Morocco which led to their deaths. This crisis of succession occurred because Sebastião's untimely demise left the throne empty with no clear heir, setting the stage for a crisis of succession. The excerpt mentions that the only rightful claimant was the elderly Prince Henry, who also died heirless two years later, ultimately leading to Spain occupying the power vacuum."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They feel foolish for having done so.  (B). They save the world.","output":"Option (B): They save the world After the weeks-long incessant work, the team of scientists, led by the prodigious doctor, finally managed to develop a cure. This was no mean feat; it was a synthesis of breakthrough techniques, time, effort, global cooperation, and most importantly, the relentless hope that kept them all united. There was a palpable sense of relief, a moment of renewed hope, and an odd taste of victory over the microscopic enemy amongst them. The implications of their revolutionary discovery were clear: they might just have saved the world.  Yet, their journey was just beginning. With the cure in hand, the group immediately began testing, ensuring the safety and efficacy of the treatment before they could apply it on a global scale. They worked carefully, abiding by the rigorous process required when making medical interventions, keeping in mind the repercussions of any oversight. As each day unfolded, the cure seemed to hold promise. It worked exceptionally well in the lab conditions — it was effective, efficient, and seemed to have no critical side effects.  As they moved to the next phase, field trials, anxiety trickled into their hearts. The disease had spread far and wide, spanning continents and affecting millions. They knew that their greatest challenge lay ahead. Yet, fortified by the success they had seen in the lab, the scientists proceeded with the trials, administering the cure to a wide demographic spread while monitoring the reactions closely.  Trials revealed substantial success. The disease's rampant spread started halting, its ferocity dwindling, the World Health Organisation reported. Statistics showed a decrease in infection rates, and slowly but surely, they witnessed a significant drop in the mortality rate. Assured by the early success, health institutions across the world began mass production and global distribution of the cure, aiming to reach the furthest corners and help as many individuals as possible.  The struggle wasn't over, yet milestones were being met, hope was being rekindled, lives were being saved, and slowly the world started returning to normalcy. The fear started to lift, replaced instead with gratitude for the team of scientists who had dedicated their lives to developing this cure. These were the unsung heroes who had, in more ways than one, managed to save the world. From classrooms to dinner tables, talk of the disease transitioned from fear to a story of human resilience. The team's effort became an inspiration, a telling tale of the power of collaborative innovation. The tireless scientists didn't merely develop a cure, they became a symbol of humanity's unyielding spirit and its ceaseless fight against adversity. Humanity awakened to its possible demise, only to be steered back on the course by its protectors – the scientists who could, indeed, save the world.  Thus is the choice worded: They save the world — not in the past tense, but in the present. For while the disease was indeed conquered, the effects of the scientists' work reverberated far beyond the cure itself. It transformed society's view of science, underlined the importance of global cooperation, and raised the level of respect for these diligent workers who, behind the scenes, safeguard humanity's survival every day. Herein lay their true victory: they did more than develop a cure; they left a lasting impact on human civilization. So indeed, they saved the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Let's Go to Prison Movie plot: John Lyshitski (Dax Shepard) has spent most of his life being a slimeball, thanks to Judge Nelson Biederman III, who has been giving him hard sentences ever since he stole a car at the age of eight. Now he wants revenge, but finds that the judge died an all too peaceful death three days previous to Johns release from prison.He turns his attention to Nelson Biederman IIIs obnoxious son, Nelson Biederman IV (Will Arnett). At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John hops into Nelson's BMW, steals his change, spits in his coffee and uses up his inhaler. In the BMW after the ceremony, Nelson IV yells at his attorney (who has the speakerphone on in the fully occupied board room), starts to sing, and when he goes for the inhaler, finds it empty. He stops at a pharmacy, panicked, and starts knocking items off the shelf in an attempt to find a replacement inhaler. The pharmacy owners think he's another junkie robber, and that the inhaler he finally finds is a tiny pistol, and call the police. Nelson ends up convicted on that robbery and demands that the Biederman foundation call the governor to dismiss his charges. Even though the governor owes the foundation a favor, the board of directors decide to let Nelson go to prison as they have grown tired of his asinine deportment. John is not satisfied with Nelson just going to prison, however, so John decides to join him in prison by selling marijuana to undercover police officers. At his sentencing he pleads guilty to the same judge Nelson IV had, and asks for the same sentence (3-5) at the same prison. After negotiating with the judge and bribing a few guards, he ends up as Nelsons cellmate, and here he pretends to be his friend, all in an attempt to give him the wrong advice on surviving life in prison.Somehow, Nelson gets himself out of a numerous array of jams, even discovering that he's gay and meeting the love of his life, gang leader Barry (Chi McBride), a hulking, burly gay caballero with the heart of a dashing romantic hero beating within his massive, hairy...

Summarize this article: BOSTON (Reuters) - The rising cost of higher education is dogging Americans into retirement, with people aged 65 and older still carrying some 18.2 billion in unpaid student loans, according to a federal report released on Wednesday.      While the Government Accountability Office report noted that relatively few U.S. households headed by people 65 or over are carrying student loans, the value of the unpaid debt had spiked from 2.8 billion in 2005, before the financial crisis.      That debt is concentrated in a small number of homes. Just 4 percent of households headed by someone 65 or older carried student loan debt as of 2010, up from 1 percent in 2004.      \\"Some may think of student loan debt as a just a young person's problem,\\" said U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, who heads a Senate committee on aging and held a hearing on the findings on Wednesday. \\"As it turns out, that's increasingly not the case.\\"      The 18.2 billion figure includes loans related to both the holders' education, often for those who have returned to school later in life, and their children's education, the report found.      Across the United States, about 40 million Americans are paying back some 1.1 trillion in student loan debt.      Student loans are a particular concern because unlike credit card debt or mortgages, they are typically government-backed and cannot be written off in bankruptcy proceedings, leaving retirees facing the risk of having their Social Security payments garnished to cover student loans.      The cost of higher education in the United States has steadily increased over the past decade, with one year's costs for tuition, room and board, and other fees at the average four-year U.S. college coming to 23,872 for the 2012-2013 academic year, according to Department of Education data. That is up 21 percent, accounting for inflation.      \\"Education debt has become a significant factor for younger workers, threatening a middle-class standard of living and at times even forcing some to delay their retirement,\\" said Debra Whitman, an executive vice president at AARP, the largest lobbying group representing retired Americans. \\"Student loan debt is also becoming a matter of serious concern for some older Americans many of who are still paying off their kids' debt or helping their grandkids well into their ‎retirement.\\"      (Reporting by Scott Malone; Editing by Mohammad Zargham) ||||| Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images      Most conversations about the dangers of student debt rightfully focus on the young. But a surprising number of elderly Americans are also still paying back education loans. And today, the Government Accountability Office unveiled a rather depressing report about how the government may be driving some of those retirees into poverty in its attempts to collect on their debt.      Jordan Weissmann Jordan Weissmann is Slate’s senior business and economics correspondent.      The problem stems from the way Washington handles defaults. Once a borrower has failed to pay back his federal loan for 425 days, the government has the power to withhold Social Security retirement and disability payments to offset the debt. In 2013, the GAO reports that 155,000 Americans, including 36,000 individuals older than 65, saw their benefits garnished in this fashion.      Advertisement            Because Social Security is designed to keep the elderly and infirm from falling into destitution, Congress very sensibly limited how much money the Treasury Department could withhold from their benefits when collecting on a student loan. Much less sensibly, the cap wasn’t indexed for inflation and hasn’t been updated since the 1990s. As a result, the GAO reports that, \\"the current limits may result in monthly benefits below the poverty threshold for certain defaulted borrowers.\\"      To translate that into the clearest terms possible: Due to Congress' neglect, our government is now probably pushing somebody's grandparents into poverty so that they can settle up a bad college debt.            Get Slate in your inbox.      How many people are we talking about here? The report’s numbers are slightly opaque, but it looks like about 129,000 Americans total, including 27,000 senior citizens, would have kept more of their Social Security payments if the withholding limits had kept pace with the poverty line.1 We don’t know for sure that every one of these individuals is being driven into poverty, since some of them may have income from other sources. But the fact that we even have to worry about the possibility is disturbing.      In the end, we’re only talking about a problem afflicting a relative handful of people. But that also means it would be fairly painless to fix. Fixing the withholding limits to make sure nobody’s benefit payments fell below the poverty level would have cost just 94 million in 2013. This does not seem like a hard trade-off to make.      Of course, the really humane thing would be to finally let Americans discharge their student loans in bankruptcy, so they aren’t dogged by their borrowing mistakes deep into old age. But baby steps first.      * * * ||||| Financial Aid      Elderly Americans have more student loan debt than ever and are more likely to become chronically unable to make payments than younger borrowers. Those findings from a new report by the Government Accountability Office took center stage at Wednesday’s Senate hearing on how seniors deal with unprecedented education debt.      Federal student debt among Americans 65 and older increased sixfold since 2005, reaching 18.2 billion in 2013, according to the report. Over 80 percent of elderly borrowers were still struggling to pay off loans they took out to pay for their education, which suggests that the debt ballooned, in part, due to interest.      United States Government Accountability Office      Seniors hold a small minority of all student debt in the country, but their fate is a cautionary tale for today’s students taking out more and bigger loans. It is also a sign of financial stress to come for people who are heading toward retirement.      Some 31 percent of the student loans held by Americans aged 65 and older were in default last year. That makes the elderly about twice as likely to hold defaulted loans as Americans under the age of 50. Defaulting on student loans is bad for anyone: It can harm your credit and multiply your debt by adding fees. For older Americans, the consequences can be especially dire.      United States Government Accountability Office      More elderly Americans are seeing retirement benefits cut to order to repay education debt, as Bloomberg Businessweek reported last month. The government reduced the Social Security payments or other retirement benefits of 155,000 people last year to pay off student loans, according to the new GAO report, up from just 31,000 in 2002.      A 1998 law specified that the government could not seize more than 15 percent of people’s retirement benefits or leave them with a check of less than 750. At the time that limit was above the poverty line. The limit hasn’t since increased and is now about 181 under the poverty threshold for a person over the age of 65.      Most of those who saw Social Security payments slashed to repay student loans in 2013 were living on benefit income that was under the poverty line. “If the offset limit had been indexed to match the rate of increase in the poverty threshold,” the report noted, “in 2013, 68 percent of all borrowers whose Social Security benefits were offset for federal student loan debt would have kept their entire benefit.” |||||","output":"According to a federal report, the rising cost of higher education is causing issues for older Americans, with people aged 65 and above still carrying around 18.2 billion in unpaid student loans.

Context: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

It's made up of 118 tiny islands in the Adriatic Sea. The area, however, may be in over its head. But now scientists have a new plan to save the city. Because the city was built on soft soil, it has been sinking under the pressure of its own weight. Scientists estimate that Venice sinks at a rate of nearly 2 inches every 100 years. Rising sea levels could make Venice go under even faster, some experts say. Earth's temperature is slowly increasing. That is causing sea ice to melt, which makes the world's waters rise, they say. To keep the city afloat, experts want to pump about 40 billion gallons of sea water beneath Venice. The liquid would expand the sand under the city, which would help support the islands, explains lead scientist Giuseppe Gambolati. Experts are rushing to save Venice because of its rich history. The city was once a strong sea power. \\"Many famous artists and opera singers have come from Venice. Some of the world's greatest paintings can be found on the city's museum walls,\\" explains Melissa Conn, who is a director of Save Venice Inc. While scientists work to get their water-pumping plan approved, Venice's residents go about their normal routines. When the tide rolls in, the locals have ways of keeping everyone dry. Cafe owners move tables to higher ground, and hotels pass out high boots to guests. Still, dealing with the rising water does not give the city's residents a sinking feeling, just ask Erla Zwingle.

The first step is to move the term with the variable (3*i) from the left side of the equation to the right side. To do this, we subtract 3*i from both sides. This gives us: 424 = 56*i - 3*i 2. Next, we need to simplify the right side of the equation by combining like terms (the terms with the same variable, i.e., i). In this case, both terms have the variable i, so we can combine them: 424 = 53*i 3. Now, we need to isolate the variable i by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable (53). Dividing by 53, we get: 424 / 53 = 53*i / 53 4.

In recent years, use of chemicals in agriculture has seen reduced number of large birds in Germany. But in some places in France farmers are cautions about using chemicals in agriculture. As a result, large bird population had been stable in France.  But I can use this background: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem.

Now, let's connect these pieces of information: - In Germany, the use of chemicals in agriculture has reduced the large bird population. - Since large birds are predators of rodents, this could lead to an increased number of rodents in Germany. - Increased rodent population might result in more crop consumption, leading to less overall crop production. On the other hand: - In France, the stable large bird population due to the cautious use of chemicals might keep the rodent population in check. - Fewer rodents would mean less consumption of crops, which might result in more overall crop production. Based on this analysis, it seems that Germany would likely see less crop production compared to France due to the reduced number of large birds and potential increase in rodent population consuming crops. However, it's important to keep in mind that many other factors could influence crop production in both countries. This answer is based solely on the provided information about large birds, rodents, and chemical use in agriculture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Richard Sherman, who has not intercepted a pass in the first 12 games of the season, recorded his first in the third quarter. The game was a shootout as Russell Wilson, playing on his 27th birthday, passed for 345 yards and threw five touchdown passes (three of them to WR Doug Baldwin). Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger passed for 456 yards against the Seahawks' defense, which are the most passing yards the Seahawks have ever allowed to an opposing quarterback. With the win, the Seahawks improved to 6-5 and earned their first win of the season against a team with a winning record. The victory was bittersweet, however, as Jimmy Graham suffered an apparent leg injury in the third quarter. It was later revealed that Graham tore the patellar tendon in his knee.

OPT: a). yes; b). it is not possible to tell; c). no; Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"To determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, let's analyze the meanings of the two sentences step by step: 1. In the first sentence, the speaker is expressing their anticipation for \\"one of those days.\\" They use \\"oh\\" to emphasize their enthusiasm, and the phrase \\"look forward to\\" denotes that the speaker feels excitement or eagerness about a specific situation or event. 2. In the second sentence, the speaker simply states that they \\"looked forward to those days.\\" This sentence conveys that the speaker was anticipating a series of instances or events in the past. Here, the focus is on the past tense, whereas, in the first sentence, the focus is on the present tense and anticipation of future events. Now, let's see if the second sentence can be logically derived from the first sentence: - The first sentence talks about looking forward to one instance (\\"one of those days\\"). - The second sentence talks about looking forward to multiple instances (\\"those days\\"). Given this differentiation in the number of instances, we cannot conclude that the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence.

To date, no e¡ective and speci¢c therapeutic method can be used to treat patients su¡ering from SARS-CoV infection. RNA interference (RNAi) is a process by which the introduced small interfering RNA (siRNA) could cause the degradation of mRNA with identical sequence speci¢city. The RNAi methodology has been used as a tool to silence genes in cultured cells and in animals. Recently, this technique was employed in anti-virus infections in human immunode¢ciency virus and hepatitis C/B virus. In this study, RNAi technology has been applied to explore the possibility for prevention of SARS-CoV infection. We constructed speci¢c siRNAs targeting the S gene in SARS-CoV. We demonstrated that the siRNAs could e¡ectively and speci¢cally inhibit gene expression of Spike protein in SARS-CoV-infected cells.

Step 1: Understand the first sentence. \\"Origin in sensation\\" seems to suggest the beginning or source of a sensation, which leads us to think that the word \\"origin\\" is used here to represent the commencement or the base of something. Step 2: Understand the second sentence. \\"The rumor had its origin in idle gossip\\" implies that the rumor started from or began with idle gossip. Here, the word \\"origin\\" also represents the starting point or source of the rumor. Step 3: Compare the usage of \\"origin\\" in both sentences.

Who was British Prime Minister from 1922-23, shortly before he died?","output":"The British Prime Minister from 1922-1923, shortly before he died, was Andrew Bonar Law. Born on September 16, 1858, in Rexton, New Brunswick, Canada, Bonar Law was a prominent British Conservative politician who served as the leader of the Conservative Party from 1911 to 1921 and became Prime Minister following the resignation of David Lloyd George in October 1922. Bonar Law's tenure as Prime Minister was brief, spanning only from October 23, 1922, to May 20, 1923. During his time in office, his government focused on supporting the restoration of the British economy, which had been severely affected by World War I. He also worked towards the resolution of the Irish Question and signed the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which established the Irish Free State and ended the Irish War of Independence. The circumstances surrounding Bonar Law's ultimate departure from office were tragic. In early 1923, he began experiencing severe throat pain, which was subsequently diagnosed as terminal throat cancer. Recognizing that his health was rapidly deteriorating and that he was unable to fulfill the demanding responsibilities of a prime minister, Bonar Law submitted his resignation on May 20, 1923, after serving just 211 days – making his tenure one of the shortest in British history. Tragically, Bonar Law succumbed to his illness just six months later, passing away on October 30, 1923. Despite his brief time as Prime Minister, Bonar Law's influence on British politics was significant. Throughout his political career, he was highly regarded for his moral integrity, dedication to public service, and pragmatic, non-confrontational leadership style – all of which endeared him to colleagues and the public alike. While his lasting impact may be difficult to quantify due to the brevity of his time in office, Bonar Law is remembered as a respected and influential figure in early 20th-century British politics."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

OPT: +Yes. +No. The answer is:","output":"No. The right answer to the question \\"beef jerky is what?\\" is not \\"wet,\\" given that beef jerky is preserved. Beef jerky is a popular snack made from lean cuts of beef (or other types of meat, such as turkey) that have been trimmed of fat and then dried or smoked to preserve them.  First, the meat is marinated in a mixture of spices, herbs, and other flavorings, which typically includes salt, sugar, soy sauce, and various spices. The marination process not only adds flavor but also helps to preserve the meat by introducing antimicrobial agents and reducing the water content. After marinating, the meat is placed on racks or hung in a smoker (if available) to allow for even air circulation during the drying process. It can be dried using a dehydrator, smoker, or even in an oven with the door slightly ajar at a low temperature. The drying process generally takes several hours, depending on the thickness of the meat and the desired level of dryness. During the drying process, the water content of the meat is reduced, which inhibits the growth of bacteria and helps preserve the meat for an extended period. The final product is a chewy, flavorful snack that can be stored for months without refrigeration. As a result, labeling beef jerky as \\"wet\\" is incorrect, as the preservation process aims to reduce moisture levels and reveal a predominantly dry texture. Instead, it would be more accurate to describe beef jerky as a dehydrated, preserved, and seasoned meat snack. The low moisture content, combined with added preservatives and salt, contributes to its relatively long shelf life and makes it a popular and convenient option for travel, camping, or simply a protein-packed snack."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Given the following context:  The album  was recorded in Los Angeles, California with Reign in Blood producer Rick Rubin. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they \\"couldn't top Reign in Blood\\", and that whatever they recorded would be \\"compared to that album\\", he believed they \\"had to slow down\\", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona.

Sir Osbert Lancaster, CBE (4 August 1908 – 27 July 1986) was an English cartoonist, architectural historian, stage designer and author. He was known for his cartoons in the British press, and for his lifelong work to inform the general public about good buildings and architectural heritage.  The only child of a prosperous family, Lancaster was educated at Charterhouse School and Lincoln College, Oxford, at both of which he was an undistinguished scholar. From an early age he was determined to be a professional artist and designer, and studied at leading art colleges in Oxford and London. While working as a contributor to The Architectural Review in the mid-1930s, Lancaster published the first of a series of books on architecture, aiming to simultaneously amuse the general reader and demystify the subject. Several of the terms he coined as labels for architectural styles have gained common usage, including \\"Pont Street Dutch\\" and \\"Stockbrokers' Tudor\\", and his books have continued to be regarded as important works of reference on the subject. In 1938 Lancaster was invited to contribute topical cartoons to The Daily Express. He introduced the single column-width cartoon popular in the French press but not until then seen in British papers. Between 1939 and his retirement in 1981 he drew about 10,000 of these \\"pocket cartoons\\", which made him a nationally known figure. He developed a cast of regular characters, led by his best-known creation, Maudie Littlehampton, through whom he expressed his views on the fashions, fads and political events of the day. From his youth, Lancaster wanted to design for the theatre, and in 1951 he was commissioned to create costumes and scenery for a new ballet, Pineapple Poll. Between then and the early 1970s he designed new productions for the Royal Ballet, Glyndebourne, D'Oyly Carte, the Old Vic and the West End.

As such, I don't have the accent, but still connect deeply to my culture; Hindi is my first language, and I visit Delhi to see my family every year. I grew up pretty well-off, but both of my parents grew up in abject poverty, and raised me humbly. The school I went to was filled with rich kids, who would often not realize the privileged position they were in. Casual conversation at my school was often about which holiday home in the Mediterranean they were visiting this spring, and I generally felt pretty out of place.  Many of my friends are British, and often fiercely patriotic. They have a tendency to make jokes that make me feel uncomfortable, such as attending a fancy dress party dressed as \\"the Sun setting on the British Empire\\", and saying things such as \\"you're only allowed to be proud of where you're from if you're from Britain\\", among countless other examples. Whenever I previously expressed discomfort, they would often play it off as them trying to be \\"edgy\\" or \\"ironic\\". One comment that made me particularly outraged was when one of them got into a fight with one of our mutual friends, who is Japanese, and blurted out \\"President Truman didn't do enough; he should have dropped three bombs\\" (or something to that effect) (I went absolutely ballistic at her for that one. Haven't had a conversation with her since, don't intend to). For a while, I kept mute. I'm generally not outgoing, and have found a group of friends who I generally enjoyed hanging out with, aside from in instances like this. I am afraid of jeopardizing that. Recently however, particularly after the New Zealand attacks, I've been calling them out. In one heated exchange, I told a friend that her \\"jokes\\" were what normalized white supremacy. I'm certain that the comments they make don't come from genuine malicious intent, but I feel as though I'm drifting from my group of friends because I don't find them funny. I feel as though that sort of normalization is what often leads me to feel ashamed of my own skin color and my heritage.  My family, particularly my grandparents, had a poor relationship with the British. My grandfather lost three of his siblings when he was forced to leave his home during the partition. I understand that I was not a direct victim of colonization, and I also understand that my friends who make these jokes are not the direct perpetrators.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The device in the circuit in Figure above is an ammeter. It measures the current that flows through the wire. The faster the magnet or coil moves, the greater the amount of current that is produced. If more turns were added to the coil, this would increase the strength of the magnetic field as well. If the magnet were moved back and forth repeatedly, the current would keep changing direction. In other words, alternating current would be produced. This is illustrated in Figure below .   Q: What device measures current that flows through wire?   A: A:","output":"An ammeter is the device that measures the current flowing through a wire. In the given paragraph, it is mentioned that the device in the circuit shown in the Figure above is an ammeter. The ammeter's purpose is to measure the amount of electric current that flows through a specific point in a circuit. It can typically do this without interrupting the flow of current.  The paragraph further explains that the faster the magnet or coil moves within the circuit, the greater the amount of current produced. This is due to the changing magnetic field that induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the wire, which ultimately causes current to flow. Adding more turns to the coil within the circuit increases the strength of the magnetic field, resulting in a higher current being generated. Moreover, if the magnet were moved back and forth repeatedly, the current would continually change direction, producing what is known as alternating current (AC). AC is the type of current commonly used in most household and commercial electrical systems, as it allows for easy transmission of electricity over long distances and convenient transformation of voltage levels. In conclusion, an ammeter is the device responsible for measuring the current that flows through a wire in a given circuit. It is an essential tool for understanding and analyzing the behavior of various electronic circuits and systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: What is the full name of the person that is re-making the garden that was seen as a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  John Vass, appointed head gardener in 1939, left in 1957. Called up to the RAF in 1941, he had urged that the hedges be maintained, confident that everything else in the garden could be restored after the war. Ronald Platt succeeded him from 1957 to 1959. In 1959 Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger were appointed as joint replacements. They remained at Sissinghurst until 1991, their contributions, \\"as much, if not more than Vita's, mak[ing] it the most admired and popular 20th-century garden in England\\". In 2006 they were awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria Medal of Honour for their work at Sissinghurst. The pair were followed as head gardener by Sarah Cook, who was succeeded by Alexis Datta.In 2014, Troy Scott Smith, previously head gardener at Bodnant, was appointed – the first male head gardener since the 1950s. He has written of the challenges of maintaining the garden \\"in the manner of its creator, after they have gone\\". In 2018 Scott Smith announced plans to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst beyond the autumn period established by Schwerdt and Kreutzberger, into the winter months, allowing for year-round opening of the garden. The gardening writer and landscape critic Tim Richardson, writing in 2015, described Scott Smith's re-making of the garden: \\"Sissinghurst, more than any other garden I know, inspires extremes of emotion. There is a feeling that this is Britain's leading garden – and so, arguably, the world's, a status that has proven to be both a great boon and an albatross around its neck\\". Scott Smith's plans include the reinstatement of every species of rose known to have been grown by Sackville-West. A new history of the garden by Sarah Raven was published in 2014. Sissinghurst continues to exert considerable influence, being described as a \\"Mecca\\" and a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners from around the world and encouraging many imitators. Answer:","output":"The person who is re-making the garden that was seen as a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners is Troy Scott Smith. He was given the role of head gardener in 2014 and had formerly been the head gardener at Bodnant. Scott Smith is the first male head gardener since the 1950s. He understands the significant challenges that come with taking care of the garden in the manner envisioned by its creator post their departure. He respects and upholds the garden's legacy while also seeking to innovate and enhance its appeal to visitors. In line with his philosophy, he announced in 2018 that he was planning to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst into the winter months. This would pave the way for the garden to stay open throughout the year, as opposed to being restricted to the autumn period which was a norm established by Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger. One of Scott Smith's restoration endeavors involves reintroducing every species of rose that was known to have been cultivated by the previous owner, Vita Sackville-West. He aims to cherish and carry forward the garden's past while also modifying certain aspects to keep up with the contemporary tastes and requirements Well-known gardening writer and landscape critic Tim Richardson, in writing about Scott Smith's overhaul of the garden in 2015, stated that \\"Sissinghurst, more than any other garden I know, inspires extremes of emotion. There is a feeling that this is Britain's leading garden – and so, arguably, the world's, a status that has proven to be both a great boon and an albatross around its neck\\". Despite these pressures and expectations, the changes proposed by Troy Scott Smith have continued to draw considerable appreciation from gardening enthusiasts worldwide, ensuring that Sissinghurst retains its reputation as a beloved \\"Mecca\\" and a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners. The garden continues to exert a profound influence not just by preserving its historical significance but also by fostering innovation and evolution under Scott Smith's stewardship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Deciding to go on a diet is easy, but sticking to a diet is not easy! So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . .  the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle. After each week you should probably  A. think about diet  B. check results  C. weigh in  D. not enough information Answer:","output":"To reach your weight-loss goal, it is crucial to remain committed and motivated throughout the process. Two important tips that can help you achieve your goal are: 1. Take It a Week at a Time: Breaking down your ultimate goal into smaller, manageable chunks is an effective strategy for staying motivated. The Mayo Clinic recommends aiming to lose 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) per week, as this is a healthy and achievable rate. This approach allows you to focus on your week-by-week progress, which can help to boost your confidence and maintain your determination. Be sure to take into account your current health condition and lifestyle, and commit to a healthy diet, regular exercise, and sufficient rest. Keeping your weekly weight-loss target realistic and clear will enable you to more easily stay on track and achieve success over time. 2. Regularly Assess Your Progress: After each week, take the time to evaluate your progress and make any necessary adjustments. This may include:    A. Reevaluating your diet: Assess whether the dietary choices you are making are contributing to your weekly weight-loss goals, and make changes as needed.    B. Checking your results: Monitor your progress by recognizing the achievements you have made toward your goal thus far. If you find that you are not meeting your target, consider whether you need to adjust your expectations or examine your approach.    C. Weighing in: Weekly weigh-ins can help provide accountability and insight into your progress. As long as you keep in mind that weight fluctuations are normal, consistently tracking your weight can help you recognize trends and determine areas for improvement.    D. Honest introspection: Reflect on your experiences and emotions throughout your weight-loss journey. Engage in self-examination to determine whether you are putting too much pressure on yourself, or whether your goals and methods are suitable for your individual situation. Making adjustments to your plan based on your personal reflection can enhance your long-term success. By taking your weight-loss journey one week at a time and consistently evaluating your progress, you can set realistic goals, make necessary adjustments, and ultimately achieve your desired weight-loss results. Remember that there is no \\"one size fits all\\" approach, so finding a plan that works specifically for your lifestyle is essential. With diligence, patience, and commitment, you can successfully reach your weight-loss goal and maintain optimal well-being."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Magic earrings  for the following movie plot:  Valerie [Jaroslava Schallerová] has just come of age with her first bleeding.

Babischka then shows up as Valerie's second cousin Elsa, young, beautiful, and vampire. When Valerie learns that the Vampire is dying and must have blood, she steals a chicken and feeds him the blood off her lips.A visiting priest, another of Babischka's lovers, tells Valerie that her father was also Orlik's father, which greatly disturbs Valerie to find that she and Orlik are brother and sister, but she is more disturbed when the priest attempts to seduce her, so upset in fact that she kills herself with her magic earrings.

The competitive pricing of MacBooks was particularly effective when rivals charged more for seemingly equivalent Ultrabooks, as this contradicted the established \\"elitist aura\\" perception that Apple products cost more but were higher quality, which made these most expensive Ultrabooks seem exorbitant no matter how valid their higher prices were.

As mentioned in the initial text, the MacBook Air took in 56 percent of all Ultrabook sales in the United States through July 1, 2013, despite being one of the higher-priced competitors. The MacBook Air has been able to outshine the competition due to its blend of the OS X experience, full keyboard, superior trackpad, Thunderbolt connector, and high-quality aluminum unibody construction. Furthermore, Apple was often quicker to adopt new technologies like Intel's latest CPUs, which helped the MacBook Air maintain its edge over various Windows Ultrabooks on the market."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hospira, the only U.S. manufacturer of sodium thiopental, stopped making the drug in 2011. The European Union has outlawed the export of any product that could be used in an execution; this has prevented executioners from using EU-manufactured anesthetics like propofol which are needed for general medical purposes. Another alternative, pentobarbital, is also only manufactured in the European Union, which has caused the Danish producer to restrict distribution to U.S. government customers.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Pentobarbital and propofol have in common that they are both anesthetic drugs that have been considered for use in lethal injection executions. Due to anti-death penalty advocacy and the European Union's ban on exporting products that could be used in executions, both drugs have faced supply constraints in the United States, causing difficulties for those seeking to use them in this context.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Sin Nombre Context: Willy, nicknamed El Casper, is a member of the Mara Salvatrucha gang and lives in Tapachula, a Mexican town near the border with Guatemala. He introduces a young boy into his gang, and the boy is given the nickname Smiley after a violent initiation. Casper later helps Smiley to complete this initiation by helping him execute a rival gang-member. Casper is romantically involved with a girl, Martha Marlen. Fearing for the girl's safety, he keeps the relationship a secret from his gang, but his double life causes his gang to doubt his loyalty. When Martha follows Casper to a gathering of his gang, the gang leader, Lil Mago, escorts her out, despite Casper's misgivings. Mago attempts to rape Martha and accidentally kills her. Later, he blithely tells Casper that he will find another. Shortly afterward, Mago brings Casper and Smiley to La Bombilla, a location along the train tracks where potential illegal immigrants stow away on passing trains on their way to the United States. Among the immigrants is a Honduran family introduced earlier consisting of the teenage girl Sayra, her father, and her uncle, who are on their way to relatives in New Jersey. Lil Mago, Casper, and Smiley rob the passengers for any money they have until Lil Mago spots Sayra and attempts to rape her. Casper intervenes, killing Mago and then sending Smiley off. Smiley goes back to the gang and reports about Mago's death. The new gang leader, El Sol, accuses Smiley of collusion, to which Smiley timidly protests and begs to be sent to kill Casper to prove his loyalty. El Sol agrees and Smiley travels north to track down Casper. On the train, the still shocked Casper is avoided by other passengers. When some try to throw him off the train, Sayra warns Casper and keeps on approaching him, despite her father's warnings.

Step 1: Understand the context of the question The question is asking whether bamboo produces less heat when cooking, considering the fact that microwaves cook food using less heat.

This process requires much less heat than conventional cooking methods. Step 3: Analyze the role of bamboo in cooking Bamboo is a versatile and sustainable material, often used for making utensils, bowls, and other cooking tools. In some cooking techniques, bamboo is used as a steamer or a container that holds food while it cooks. However, bamboo itself does not have a direct impact on the amount of heat used for cooking. Step 4: Make a conclusion While using a bamboo container or utensil could contribute to more sustainable cooking practices, the heat generated in cooking depends on the cooking method itself (using less heat in a microwave, for example).

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Love is an American rock group that was most prominent in the late 1960s and early 1970s. They were originally led by singer/songwriter Arthur Lee, who wrote most of the songs, although some of their best known songs were written by Bryan MacLean. One of the first racially diverse American bands, their music drew on a diverse range of sources including folk rock, hard rock, blues, jazz, flamenco and orchestral pop. While finding only modest success on the music charts, Love would come to be praised by critics as one of the finest and most important American rock groups of their era. Signed to the Elektra Records label as their first rock act, the band scored a minor hit single in 1966 with their version of Burt Bacharach and Hal David's \\"My Little Red Book\\". Their first album, Love, was released in March 1966. The album sold moderately well and reached No. 57 on the Billboard 200 chart.  In August 1966 the single written by Arthur Lee \\"7 and 7 Is\\", notable for the exceptional guitar work of Johnny Echols and proto-punk styled drumming by Pfisterer, became their highest-charting single at No. 33 in the Billboard Hot 100. Two more members were added around this time, Tjay Cantrelli (real name John Barbieri) on woodwinds and Michael Stuart on drums. Pfisterer, never a confident drummer, switched to harpsichord.  Their musical reputation largely rests on the next two albums, Da Capo and Forever Changes. Da Capo, released in November 1966, included \\"7 and 7 Is\\" as well as the subsequent singles \\"She Comes in Colors\\" and \\"!Que Vida!\\" and MacLean's \\"Orange Skies\\". Cantrelli and Pfisterer soon left the band, leaving it as a five-piece once again.  Forever Changes, released in November 1967 and recorded and co-produced by Bruce Botnick  is a suite of songs using acoustic guitars, strings, and horns that was recorded while the band was falling apart as the result of various substance abuse problems and tension between Arthur Lee and Bryan MacLean, who wanted more of his songs on the album. The band recorded the album in only 64 hours, though many professional session players were utilized, including some who replaced the actual band members in some songs. Writer Richard Meltzer, in his book The Aesthetics of Rock, commented on Love's \\"orchestral moves\\", \\"post-doper word contraction cuteness\\", and Lee's vocal style that serves as a \\"reaffirmation of Johnny Mathis\\". Forever Changes included one hit single, Bryan MacLean's \\"Alone Again Or\\", while \\"You Set the Scene\\" received airplay from some progressive rock radio stations. By this stage, Love were far more popular in the UK, where the album reached No. 24, than in their home country, where it could only reach No. 154. More recently the album has received recognition as one of the greatest rock albums of all time, appearing on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, being inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and being added to the National Recording Registry. Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"Yes, one interesting aspect from the article is that Love was one of the first racially diverse American bands, drawing inspiration from a wide range of musical genres such as folk rock, hard rock, blues, jazz, flamenco, and orchestral pop."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Based on the sentence \\"A man in a blue shirt walking out a door.\\", is the sentence \\"A person goes through a door.\\" a true sentence?","output":"Yes, fundamentally, the sentence \\"A person goes through a door.\\" can be considered true when compared with the statement \\"A man in a blue shirt walking out a door.\\".  Let's break this down to better understand. Although the two sentences do not have identical wording, they describe a similar action and scenario. In the first sentence, \\"A man in a blue shirt walking out a door.\\" signifies a particular event. It describes a man, specifically one in a blue shirt, who is in the process of walking out a door. The second sentence, \\"A person goes through a door.\\", is more general. It doesn't mention the gender or any specific characteristics of the person, like what they are wearing, nor does it specify the direction of movement, i.e., in or out. What the two sentences share is the primary action, which is someone (either a man or a person) moving through a door.  If we dissect these sentences conceptually: 1. \\"A man\\" in the first sentence is a subset of \\"A person\\". A man is a person.  2. \\"Walking out a door\\" in the first sentence describes a more specific version of \\"goes through a door\\". 'Walking out' and 'going through' ultimately convey the same general event - a person moving through a doorway.  While the first sentence provides more context and details about the scene, the second sentence maintains the core essentials -- a person and a door. They both describe the same basic action - a person moving through a door. Therefore, even though the second sentence is less specific than the first, we can consider the second sentence as essentially a simplified version of the first. Thus, based on the context provided by the first sentence, the second sentence \\"A person goes through a door.\\" can be taken as a true sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Frank Baum, the author of the famous children's novel \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" and its sequels, led a life that spanned different locations in the United States. Born as Lyman Frank Baum on May 15, 1856, in Chittenango, New York, he spent the early years of his life with his family in that region. His parents, Cynthia Ann Cynthia Stanton and Benjamin Ward Baum, were affluent, which influenced the various occupations and pursuits Frank would undertake throughout his life. In 1869, the Baum family relocated to Syracuse, New York, where L. Frank Baum enjoyed the privileges of attending a prestigious school called Syracuse Classical School. Later, he briefly attended Peekskill Military Academy, north of Manhattan, for two years. However, he left the academy due to health issues and returned to Syracuse. In his 20s, Baum moved from New York to South Dakota, motivated by the discovery of gold in the Black Hills. In 1888, he settled in Aberdeen with his wife, Maud Gage Baum, and started a novelty goods store called Baum's Bazaar. A few years later, he shifted his working interests and launched a newspaper named The Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer, which he edited and published. Unfortunately, both the store and the newspaper eventually folded due to financial difficulties. In 1891, Baum and his family moved to Chicago, Illinois. While in Chicago, he worked as a newspaper reporter and also entered into the then-thriving industry of window display design. His experiences in these fields contributed to the foundation of his career as a writer. He began submitting stories, articles, and poems to various publications, often adopting different pseudonyms to increase his chances of being published. It was during his time in Chicago that Baum started writing stories for young readers, culminating in the publication of \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" in 1900. The book's success set the stage for the remainder of Baum's life and career, making him one of the most beloved children's authors of the time. In 1910, Baum decided to move his family once again, this time to California. He settled in the coastal city of Coronado, building a house which he named Ozcot. Baum's fondly creative naming style echoed the whimsical worlds he built through his books. In California, he engaged in filmmaking and scriptwriting as an extension of his storytelling skills. Baum passed away in Hollywood, California, on May 6, 1919. In summary, L. Frank Baum lived in several locations throughout his life, including Chittenango and Syracuse, New York; Aberdeen, South Dakota; Chicago, Illinois; and Coronado and Hollywood, California. Each of these places had an impact on his experiences and the evolution of his writing career, making him a notable figure in American literary history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the sentiment of the following review? Really brief we have used this urgent care twice because it is convenient to our house but we will not go back.  My 35 year old husband went here for prolonged fever over 102 degreesfor six days he was sent home with ATB for sinus infection.  He developed severe abdominal pain after day one and by day 7 was still very sick.  Since we could not get in to see PCP for another week we had to go back there today.  My husband went alone until I could drop off our son and catch up with him before/while he met with the provider.  When I arrived I was told by the front office staff he was meeting with the \\"Dr.\\" (who was actually a PA) and they would not interrupt him.  I explained that I drove there just to be in on the office visit -- I was told someone would come and get me shortly.  About 7 minutes after arriving my husband walked out and said he was told to \\"let it run its course.\\"  I called the office to speak to the office manager regarding the lack of integrating family (myself) into the office visit and was told she would call me back.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to reset his relationship with Africa on Monday, as he hosted Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries. Asked whether those comments came up during his private meeting with Trump, Buhari declined to comment.  \\"I'm very careful with what the press says about other than myself. I'm not sure about, you know, the validity or whether that allegation was true or not. So, the best thing for me is to keep quiet,\\" Buhari said. Question: How does Nigeria feel about Trump's comments? Options: - not enough information   - confused   - humored   - outraged === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"outraged"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. A doctor and a policeman in New Orleans have only 48 hours to locate a killer infected with pneumonic plague. An effective, and classy, little thriller directed by Elia Kazan that blends documentary realism with a race against time pulpy heartbeat. Set and filmed in and around New Orleans, Panic In The Streets is taken from the story Quarantine, Some Like 'em Cold by Edna and Edward Anhalt who won an Oscar for original story. It also boasts a fine ensemble cast that deliver top rate performances for their director. In turn, Richard Widmark {bringing the method a year before Marlon did for Kazan in A Streetcar Named Desire}, Paul Douglas, Jack Palance (as Walter Jack Palance) & the wonderfully named Zero Mostel, all get sweatily moody as the pursuers chase the pursued to halt the onset of a potential Black Death epidemic. Where the film scores its main suspense points is with Kazan's astute ability to cut back and forth between the protagonists without altering the flow and mood of the piece. From Widmark's Public Health doctor, with hypodermic needle in hand, running around trying to locate the bad guys so he can do good; to the bad guys themselves who are bemused as to why there is such a wide scale hunt for them; the tension is stacked up to fever breaking point. To which thankfully the final thirty minutes becomes a cracking piece of cinema. With Palance excelling as a nasty villain that ironically puts one in mind of Widmark's own Tommy Udo from Kiss Of Death three years prior. It's an imaginative and intelligently written story, one that cunningly links rats and criminals to being carriers of disease. A blight on society as it were. It's noirish elements, such as paranoia, blend nicely with its basic procedural thriller being. While some memorable scenes are suitably cloaked by the stifling atmosphere that Kazan has created. Although some of the early character psychologizing threatens to steer the film down some over talky based alleyway, this definitely is a film worth staying with to the end. Not essential film-noir, and maybe not even essential Kazan, but certainly a highly recommended film that begs to be discovered by a new generation of film lovers and reappraised by the old guard who may have missed it back in the day. 7.5/10 Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)?

What is the answer for the question: What was the first name of the descendant of Robert Campbell? from the following article ?  The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904. It remains standing to this day.In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia. Soon afterwards... Answer:","output":"The first name of the descendant of Robert Campbell who purchased Yarralumla is Frederick.

Determine the sentiment: The beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mother's love, the exceptional performances, the steady execution and the quite innovative script. The film tells the story of an Indian woman, Nandini, who lives in Canada with her husband Shekhar and little kid Raja. All of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in India (of whom she had not even known) is in troubles and the couple rush to India. When they get into the village, Nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture; Shekhar's family, ruled by his cruel, highly cynical and merciless father Narasimha, lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless. Nandini starts nagging Shekhar to return home, but he is soon killed by his father's enemies. When she wants to leave, Narasimha refuses to let her take Raja back to India. Here starts the intense struggle which can be called \\"Nandini vs. Narasimha\\". India is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film, but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas, so it may be even correct. The portrayal is in my view fair and not one-sided because the positive side is also presented to an extent. Such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world. The locations are amazing, the music is wonderful, and Krishna Vamshi's direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing. One thing that must be noted is the very ear-pleasing background score by Ismail Darbar, it is beautiful. The characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film. Portrayed realistically throughout, the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch. Its dialogues are superb and intelligently written, and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points, a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tension. The film's biggest strength is the performances. Karisma Kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as Nandini. Her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible. She displays so much intensity, impulsiveness, anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son. Her outbreaks while facing off Nana Patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child. After Fiza, this is her most powerful performance. One of the greatest actors Indian cinema has seen, Nana Patekar is indescribable as Narasimha. He manages to be hateful as Narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him. Patekar displays cruelty, wittiness and even humanity with total conviction. He is outstanding. Another great performance comes unsurprisingly from India's most underrated actress, Deepti Naval, who sensitises her character to perfection. Sanjay Kapoor is just adequate and Shahrukh Khan provides great comic relief. Anyway, do watch Shakti - it could have been better, but it is definitely a must-watch.","output":"The sentiment in this review is mostly positive.

We can do that by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation.

[i] no [ii] yes","output":"[ii] yes Both Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 convey the same information, despite the slightly different structures used in each sentence. They both inform the reader that the 1982-83 season of the National Basketball Association (NBA) was the 37th season of the league. The use of the em dash in Sentence 1 and the phrasing \\"from 1982 to 83\\" in Sentence 2 both indicate the same time period for the season, which is from 1982 to 1983.  While Sentence 1 employs an em dash to separate the date from the main clause, Sentence 2 chooses the preposition \\"from\\" to indicate the same time span. This distinction does not change the overall meaning of both sentences, as they still indicate the same NBA season and its chronological position. The events mentioned in the sentences and the details they provide are the same, albeit presented using alternative wording and punctuation.

She loves them A:","output":"Title: Art of the Heart Genre: Romantic Comedy-Drama Plot Summary: Art of the Heart follows Stephanie, an aspiring film critic and journalist with a passion for cinema, and Guido, an independent filmmaker known for his controversial yet thought-provoking films. The story revolves around the complex and transformative love-hate relationship between Stephanie and Guido's movies, as they navigate through the ups and downs of the competitive film world, ultimately connecting on a personal and creative level. Stephanie, a 28-year-old woman with a Master's in Film Studies, is an avid movie aficionado with a preference for thought-provoking films that challenge viewers' perceptions. Although a sharp critic of commercial mainstream films, Stephanie stumbles across a hidden gem: a collection of rough and edgy movies by the lesser-known but immensely talented Guido. He's an Italian-American filmmaker in his early 30s whose films often tackle societal issues and personal struggles. Initially, Stephanie is transfixed by Guido's movies, praising his work in her blog and even writing an in-depth analysis of one of his films as part of her job application to a prestigious film magazine. Enchanted by Guido's unusual storytelling style, she quickly becomes engrossed in his fusion of social themes with raw, vivid character portrayals. One day, Stephanie gets the opportunity to attend a film festival where Guido is showcasing his latest film. Full of anticipation and excitement, Stephanie eagerly waits for their first encounter, only to witness a polarizing response from the festival audience. Some people love Guido's film, while others criticize it for being too radical and unrestrained. Amid the heated discussion, Stephanie approaches Guido, who is feeling disheartened by the mixed reactions, and they strike up a conversation. She confidently defends his work, sparking a lively debate that leads to a newfound friendship. As Stephanie and Guido grow closer, they discover a shared love for the power of cinema and storytelling, fueling their creative partnership. They collaborate on Guido's next film project, injecting Stephanie's critical perspective and balancing it against Guido's bold filmmaking style. However, as challenges mount during the production process, their relationship begins to strain. During one particularly grueling day on set, Stephanie criticizes Guido's stubborn and uncompromising approach to filmmaking. Simultaneously, Guido accuses Stephanie of prioritizing her career and craving acceptance from the elitist film community, thereby causing the duo to have a falling out. In the aftermath of the argument, both Stephanie and Guido reflect on the meaning and impact of their work and relationship. Stephanie realizes that her love for Guido's films was never about blind adoration but rather an appreciation for the thought-provoking, emotional resonance that his films invoke. Guido comes to understand that Stephanie's criticisms, stemming from her love for him and his movies, have ultimately helped to elevate his art.  In a climactic scene near the end, Stephanie publishes a heartfelt, nuanced review of Guido's latest film. Gaining widespread attention in the film community, the review offers a balanced take on Guido's work – highlighting both its strengths and areas for growth. Guido reads Stephanie's review, finally understanding her perspective, and acknowledges the significance of her influence on his filmmaking. With newfound clarity, Guido reaches out to Stephanie, and they reunite under the dim lights of a classic movie theater, rekindling their love for each other and their shared passion for cinema. As the credits roll on the screen before them, their story illustrates that love and hate reside on a spectrum – and in the art of filmmaking, as well as in matters of the heart, both can play a transformative role."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Against this background, a \\"great assembly\\" was organised by the Manchester Patriotic Union formed by radicals from the Manchester Observer. The newspaper's founder Joseph Johnson was the union's secretary. He wrote to Henry Hunt asking him to chair a meeting in Manchester on 2 August 1819. Johnson wrote: Nothing but ruin and starvation stare one in the face [in the streets of Manchester and the surrounding towns], the state of this district is truly dreadful, and I believe nothing but the greatest exertions can prevent an insurrection. Oh, that you in London were prepared for it. Unknown to Johnson and Hunt, the letter was intercepted by government spies and copied before being sent to its destination. The contents were interpreted to mean that an insurrection was being planned, and the government responded by ordering the 15th Hussars to Manchester. The mass public meeting planned for 2 August was delayed until 9 August. The Manchester Observer reported it was called \\"to take into consideration the most speedy and effectual mode of obtaining Radical reform in the Common House of Parliament\\" and \\"to consider the propriety of the 'Unrepresented Inhabitants of Manchester' electing a person to represent them in Parliament\\".

A military force invades the planet and kidnaps the band (\\"Aerodynamic\\"). A space pilot called Shep is awoken from a dream about Stella by a distress call about the kidnapping, and pursues the kidnappers through a wormhole, where he crashes on Earth (\\"Digital Love\\"). The band are taken to an underground facility, where their memories are removed to disks and their blue skin changed to make them resemble humans. They are fitted with mind-control devices hidden in sunglasses (\\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\"). Their captor, Earl de Darkwood, poses as their manager and presents them as a new band called The Crescendolls, who take the world by storm.(\\"Crescendolls\\").

Article:Thousands defied a ban to protest, taking to the streets of Minsk and other cities. Demonstrators shouted \\"Fascists!\\" at riot police. There have been weeks of sporadic protests against a 230 (Â£185) levy on those unemployed for six months. President Alexander Lukashenko insists the tax will not be scrapped. He says it instils discipline in the workshy, though he has suspended it for this year. Opponents say it punishes those who cannot find a job. Organisers called the protest Freedom Day, evoking the independent Belarus that lasted just six months after the First World War, in 1918. The march in the capital Minsk took place on the 99th anniversary of the proclamation of the Belarusian People's Republic. Demonstrators tried to march down one of the major streets in Minsk, but were blocked by police who began arresting them, along with journalists covering the protest. \\"They're beating the participants, dragging women by the hair to buses. I was able to run to a nearby courtyard,\\" demonstrator Alexander Ponomarev told AP news agency. Earlier, police raided the offices of human rights group Vesna and detained about 30 activists. The authorities had already jailed more than 100 opposition supporters for terms of between three and 15 days in the lead-up to the demonstration, reports said. It seemed like the whole city was in a state of emergency - police everywhere, a lot of police trucks, water cannons, cars with equipment for storming barricades. We heard that people who were unable to get to the first meeting place, the Science Academy metro station, gathered in another place - Yakub Kolas square. There we saw a crowd with white-red-white flags, which are a symbol of opposition in Belarus. The crowd was around 1,000-1,500 strong. We started filming there. People shouted \\"long live Belarus\\". Very soon riot police appeared. In a couple of minutes police blocked the whole street from both sides. Protesters were surrounded. Several police trucks were sent in and arrests started. Riot police started to detain literally everyone, even some journalists and old people were detained. Those who were trying to resist were beaten. Earlier this month Mr Lukashenko said people who worked fewer than 183 days a year would not have to pay the tax this year and said those who had already paid it last year would be compensated if they found a job. According to a recent tax inspection, 470,000 people should have paid the tax but only 50,000 had done so, Reuters news agency said. Mr Lukashenko has run Belarus - a country where little dissent is tolerated - since 1994. He has been described by some Western officials as \\"Europe's last dictator\\". However, Mr Lukashenko has recently been seeking to improve ties with the West and lessen the country's dependence on Russia.

Hypothesis: The man has his eyes closed in the park. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the given premise of a man in a suit taking a nap in the park, we can reasonably infer certain conclusions related to the hypothesis that the man has his eyes closed in the park. When someone takes a nap, it generally implies that the person is briefly resting or sleeping. In most cases, people close their eyes while sleeping. Therefore, it can be inferred that the man in the suit most likely would have his eyes closed as he takes a nap in the park. However, it is important to acknowledge some potential variables that could impact this conclusion. 1. Sleep behavior: Although it is typical for people to close their eyes while sleeping, a small percentage of individuals might exhibit different sleep behaviors, such as partially closed or open eyes during sleep. If the man in the suit belongs to this group, he might not have his eyes fully closed while napping in the park. 2. Resting without actually sleeping: \\"Taking a nap\\" may be interpreted in different ways by different people. Some may view napping as a brief period of actual sleep, while others could see it as just a moment to rest and recharge without falling asleep. If the man in the suit is simply resting without sleeping, he could have his eyes open or closed, depending on his preference. 3. Distractions or interruptions: External factors in the park, such as noise or an uncomfortable resting spot, could cause the man to briefly open his eyes during his nap. In this case, his eyes might not always be closed while he attempts to take a nap. Despite these potential variables, it is generally plausible to conclude, based on the premise, that the man in the suit has his eyes closed while taking a nap in the park.

Falling from grace and teetering on the brink of relegation, both clubs knew that everything was on the line for their fans and the cities they represent. As the final whistle blew, both teams' fate was sealed with a nail-biting draw and a joint sigh of relief. Ewood Park was a mixture of nerves and excitement as Blackburn Rovers and Bristol City geared up to face each other in a match that would not only prove their mettle as Championship contenders but would also help shape the future of the clubs. Moments into the match, it was clear that the stakes could not have been higher. Both teams played with ferocity and determination, eager to climb the ladder and put as much distance between them and the dreaded relegation zone as possible. The expansive green of Ewood Park quickly became a battleground, a stark reminder of the tough sport football can be.

As the first half drew to a close, the goals remained elusive, but the intensity on the pitch continued to rise. The players contested every ball, fought for every inch and tackled fiercely, mindful of what a win would mean for their survival in the league. As the second half kicked off, the urgency ramped up, and more opportunities began to unfold. Fans at Ewood Park held their breath with each chance – no one daring to look away as the drama continued to unfold. Both teams pushed forward, threatening to break the deadlock. Coaches were seen pacing the sidelines, shouting instructions and urging on their players, knowing all too well that a single moment of brilliance or lapse in concentration could make or break the game. Soon, the hard-fought battle spilled into a stream of goals from both sides. The deadlock was broken, and the scoring began in earnest.

The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of being at a very high altitude can have an indirect effect on the rust formation process.  At high altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is lower, which results in lower oxygen concentrations. Since the rust formation process depends on the iron being exposed to oxygen, this reduction in oxygen concentration can slow down the rate of rust formation. Additionally, temperatures at high altitudes can be colder, which may also contribute to the slower rate of chemical reactions, including rust formation. However, high altitude environments can also have higher levels of humidity due to increased cloud cover. Increased humidity can speed up the rust formation process, as water is another essential component for rust to form.

Answer the following question: Information:  - A cement is a binder, a substance used in construction that sets and hardens and can bind other materials together. The most important types of cement are used as a component in the production of mortar in masonry, and of concrete, which is a combination of cement and an aggregate to form a strong building material.  - Europa-Park is a theme park and the largest in Germany, and the second most popular theme park resort in Europe, following Disneyland Paris.  - Asphalt (, occasionally ), also known as bitumen is a sticky, black and highly viscous liquid or semi-solid form of petroleum. It may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product; it is a substance classed as a pitch. Until the 20th century, the term asphaltum was also used. The word is derived from the Ancient Greek  \\"ásphaltos\\".  - Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general use around the world, used as a basic ingredient of concrete, mortar, stucco, and most non-speciality grout. It was developed from other types of hydraulic lime in England in the mid 19th century and usually originates from limestone. It is a fine powder produced by heating materials in a kiln to form what is called clinker, grinding the clinker, and adding small amounts of other materials. Several types of Portland cement are available, with the most common being called ordinary Portland cement (OPC) which is grey in color, but a white Portland cement is also available.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - A lift hill, or chain hill, is an upward-sloping section of track on a roller coaster on which the roller coaster train is mechanically lifted to an elevated point or peak in the track. Upon reaching the peak, the train is then propelled from the peak by gravity and is usually allowed to coast throughout the rest of the roller coaster ride's circuit on its own momentum, including most or all of the remaining uphill sections. The initial upward-sloping section of a roller coaster track is usually a lift hill, as the train typically begins a ride with little speed, though some coasters have raised stations that permit an initial drop without a lift hill. Although uncommon, some tracks also contain multiple lift hills.  - Polymer concretes are a type of concrete that use polymers to replace lime-type cements as a binder. In some cases the polymer is used in addition to portland cement to form Polymer Cement Concrete (PCC) or Polymer Modified Concrete (PMC). Polymers in concrete have been overseen by Committee 548 of the American Concrete Institute since 1971.  - Asphalt concrete (commonly called asphalt, blacktop, or pavement in North America, and tarmac or bitumen macadam in Great Britain and Ireland) is a composite material commonly used to surface roads, parking lots, and airports. It consists of mineral aggregate bound together with asphalt, laid in layers, and compacted. The process was refined and enhanced by Belgian inventor and U.S. immigrant Edward de Smedt. It is increasingly being used as the core of embankment dams.  - Temple of the Night Hawk is an enclosed roller coaster located at Phantasialand . Founded in 1988 after 18 months of construction , the ride was originally called \`\` ' Space Center ' '' . The ride led passengers past models of rockets and emulated asteroids and the darkened hall was dimly lit with thousands of tiny spots of light to resemble stars . Due to the construction of the neighbouring Wurze Town in 2001 , the roller coaster was redeveloped with a fantasy jungle theme and was renamed as the Temple of the Night Hawk . The roller coaster is now completely dark . Until 2006 there were some green moving lights and strobe lights in the first lifthill , still present today , but not operational . In 2008 the Lights on the coaster trains were turned off or broke down and have never been repaired since then . Till 2010 there was a green laser projection with the outlines of a flying hawk and until June 2012 , there were some red strobe - lights at the final brakerun . In 2011 , the park installed new strobe lights in the first lifthill , which broke down after about two months , and were never repaired since then . The ride has four trains and one spare train for repairs each with seven cars . Each car has two rows of seats each holding two people . During the four - minute ride time the trains are lifted by three lift hill chains , 1.174 metres of track . The roller coaster is therefore one of the longest indoor roller coasters in the World , slightly beaten by \`\` Mindbender '' in Galaxyland Amusement Park , Canada . The hall in which the track is located is around 120,000m³ in size and rests on 180 concrete pillars which are 12 metres deep in the ground . In the basement of the hall is the \`\` ' Hollywood Tour '' ' darkride . The total investment for the ride was around 15 million DM . With the redevelopment of the ride in 2001 the park tried greening the roof of the hall by installing an irrigation system , however the results were n't as good as expected .

The park was opened in 1967 by Gottlieb Löffelhardt and Richard Schmidt. Although starting as a family-oriented park, Phantasialand has also added thrill rides, especially during recent years. Furthermore, following the example of Europa-Park, they have decided to attract business customers beside the regular ones, calling it \\"Business der neuen Dimension\\" (\\"business of a new dimension\\").  - Road surface or pavement is the durable surface material laid down on an area intended to sustain vehicular or foot traffic, such as a road or walkway. In the past, gravel road surfaces, cobblestone and granite setts were extensively used, but these surfaces have mostly been replaced by asphalt or concrete laid on a compacted base course. Road surfaces are frequently marked to guide traffic. Today, permeable paving methods are beginning to be used for low-impact roadways and walkways.  - A roller coaster is an amusement ride developed for amusement parks and modern theme parks. LaMarcus Adna Thompson obtained a patent regarding roller coasters on January 20, 1885, which were made out of wood, but this patent is considerably later than the \\"Russian mountains\\" described below. In essence a specialized railroad system, a roller coaster consists of a track that rises in designed patterns, sometimes with one or more \\"inversions\\" (such as vertical loops) that briefly turn the rider upside down. The track does not necessarily have to be a complete circuit, as shuttle roller coasters demonstrate. Most roller coasters have multiple cars in which passengers sit and are restrained. Two or more cars hooked together are called a train. Some roller coasters, notably wild mouse roller coasters, run with single cars.  - Concrete is a composite material composed of coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement that hardens over time. Most concretes used are lime-based concretes such as Portland cement concrete or concretes made with other hydraulic cements, such as ciment fondu. However, asphalt concrete, which is frequently used for road surfaces, is also a type of concrete, where the cement material is bitumen, and polymer concretes are sometimes used where the cementing material is a polymer.

The Cannes Film Festival is a globally recognized event that's often a platform for films to gain international acclaim and recognition. This prestigious festival located in Cannes, France, and it's overseen by a board of directors and a jury that changes annually. The event seeks to draw attention to and raise the profile of films with the aim of contributing towards the development of cinema, boosting the film industry worldwide and celebrating cinema at an international level. After its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, 'The BFG' is then scheduled for wide release in the United States on July 1, 2016. This movie is a significant collaboration from entertainment powerhouses such as DreamWorks, Walt Disney Pictures, and Steven Spielberg. Notably, it's the first Disney-branded film to be directed by Spielberg, a distinguished filmmaker renowned for his impact on the film industry. DreamWorks bought the film rights to Roald Dahl's beloved children's story 'The BFG' in 2010, and although John Madden was initially intended to direct, Spielberg ultimately took on that role. The screenplay was written by Melissa Mathison, who also penned 'E.T.', one of Spielberg's most famous films. This fact carries the expectation that 'The BFG' will possess similar emotional depth and cinematic magic that has become Spielberg's storytelling signature. 'The BFG' tells the delightful story of a young London girl and the mysterious Giant who introduces her to the wonders and perils of Giant Country. Roald Dahl's novels, filled with imagination and adventure, have often been the basis for compelling cinema, and the combination of Dahl's storytelling with Spielberg's direction presents an exciting collaboration. Having Spielberg direct a celebrated children's story from Dahl in collaboration with a script from Mathison, with the backing of DreamWorks and Disney, is a testament to the rich storytelling and broad appeal that 'The BFG' offers. By premiering at the Cannes Film Festival, the movie gets an international platform to showcase this collaborative effort between these masters of storytelling. After its international début at Cannes, it will then be ready for a wide release in the U.S, where it's likely to be a considerable summer draw for viewers of all ages."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

That is the question from the White House in Washington to the Blue House in Seoul — and perhaps also inside the Ryongsong Residence in Pyongyang. Following the historic handshake here between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader, who inked their names to a document with vague but compelling promises, the question emanating from Sentosa's Capella Hotel was what will actually change on the Korean peninsula? Moments after the summit between Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded, VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren and I spent a few minutes with the U.S. president and his secretary of state, at the Capella. Trump was elated and within the hour would make a surprising announcement suspending \\"provocative\\" joint U.S.-South Korean drills on the Korean peninsula. \\"We had a great chemistry,\\" the president, speaking to Van Susteren, said of himself and Kim. \\"We will do business.\\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told us, \\"it's a great day.\\" The president has essentially handed off to Pompeo the hard work of turning a sparse declaration on denuclearization into something truly transformative. Many will question whether Pompeo, who a decade ago was running an oilfield equipment company, is truly the man for the task. In Pompeo's background, however, are indications of his capabilities: First in his class at the U.S. Military Academy, time served on the House of Representative's intelligence committee, a brief stint as director of the Central Intelligence Agency and two meetings with Kim in Pyongyang. Perhaps he is now as astute as any American official on piecing together the Pyongyang puzzle. This correspondent — an observer of the Korean peninsula over five decades, resident in Seoul for several years and once given the opportunity to frankly converse for a week (in 2013) in the North with KPA officers — has gleaned some insight into the world's most reclusive state. Rarely can any collection of a few hundred words adequately encapsulate the geo-political conundrum. It is... What are Kim Jong Un's motivations in meeting with Trump?  A. He admires Trump and is genuinely willing to cut back or eliminate his nuclear program in return for a lifting of sanctions  B. He wants to appear as a competent statesman before the world and his subjects  C. not enough information  D. He plans to take advantage of Trump's political naivete to deceive him A:","output":"Kim Jong Un's motivations in meeting with Trump are likely a combination of factors: A. He admires Trump and is genuinely willing to cut back or eliminate his nuclear program in return for a lifting of sanctions: This motivation could be partially true, as Kim Jong Un might understand the potential benefits that would come from easing tensions with the U.S. and lifting sanctions, which would help improve North Korea's struggling economy. B. He wants to appear as a competent statesman before the world and his subjects: This could be another significant factor in Kim's decision to meet with Trump. By showing the world and his people that he can hold talks with the U.S. president, Kim strengthens his position as a leader and demonstrates a certain level of political prowess. C: not enough information: While we may not have all the information needed to fully understand Kim's motivations, we do have enough to analyze his possible reasons for meeting with Trump based on the available information. D: He plans to take advantage of Trump's political naivete to deceive him: This motivation cannot be ruled out. As a skilled political strategist, Kim Jong Un might attempt to manipulate Trump in order to achieve his objectives while making it appear as if he's making concessions. It is important for the U.S. administration to remain cautious and vigilant during this delicate diplomatic process. In conclusion, Kim Jong Un's motivations for meeting with Trump likely include a combination of factors such as A, B, and D. It is essential to approach this situation carefully and with a clear understanding of North Korea's history and intentions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: Fish species are expected to shrink in size by up to 24% because of global warming, say scientists. The scientists argue that failure to control greenhouse gas emissions will have a greater effect on marine ecosystems than previously thought. Previous research has suggested that changing ocean temperatures would affect both the distribution and the reproductive abilities of many species of fish. This new work suggests that fish size would also be heavily affected. The researchers built a model to see how fish would react to lower levels of oxygen in the water. As ocean temperatures increase, so do the body temperatures of fish. But, according to lead author, Dr William Cheung, from the University of British Columbia, the lower level of oxygen in the water is key. Warmer waters could decrease ocean oxygen levels and greatly reduce fish body weight. On the other hand, rising temperatures directly increase the metabolic rate of the fish's body function. This leads to an increase in oxygen demand for normal body activities. So the fish will run out of oxygen for growth at a smaller body size. The research team also used its model to predict fish movements as a result of warming waters. The group believes that most fish populations will move towards the Earth's poles at a rate of up to 35km per decade. \\"So in, say, the North Sea,\\" says Dr Cheung,\\" one would expect to see more smaller-body fish from tropical waters in the future.\\" Taking these factors into consideration, the research team concludes that fish body size will shrink between 14% and 24%, with the largest decreases in the Indian and Atlantic oceans. When compared with actual observations of fish sizes, the model seems to _ what's actually happening in the seas. The researchers looked at two case studies involving North Atlantic cod and haddock. They found that recorded data on these fish showed greater decreases in body size than the models had predicted. Dr Alan Baudron, from the University of Aberdeen, UK, believes smaller-sized fish could seriously... What is the key factor making the fish smaller now? A) The rising body temperatures.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  Shortly after the return home in November 1936 Riley, together with three other Jarrow councillors who had led the march—James Hanlon, Paddy Scullion and Joseph Symonds—left Labour to form a breakaway group committed to a more direct fight for employment. All four later rejoined the party; Scullion and Symonds both served as the town's mayor, and Symonds was Labour MP for Whitehaven from 1959 to 1970. In 1939 Wilkinson published her history of Jarrow, The Town that Was Murdered. A reviewer for The Economic Journal found the book \\"not quite as polemical as one might have expected\\", but felt that in her denunciation of the BISF Wilkinson had not taken full account of the state of the iron and steel industry in the 1930s. Wilkinson continued her parliamentary career, and from 1940 to 1945 held junior ministerial office in Churchill's wartime coalition government. In the 1945 Labour government she was appointed Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet, a post in which she served until her death, aged 55, in February 1947. In 1974 the rock singer Alan Price released  the \\"Jarrow Song\\", which helped to raise awareness of the events of 1936 among a new generation. Among dramatisations based on the Jarrow March is a play, Whistling at the Milestones (1977) by Alex Glasgow, and an opera, Burning Road (1996), by Will Todd and Ben Dunwell. In what Perry describes as one of the ironies surrounding the march, the opera was performed in Durham Cathedral in May 1997, in retrospective defiance of the bishop who had condemned the march. On 29 October 2017, the Tyne Bridge was closed off and was the venue the Freedom on The Tyne Finale. The Freedom on The Tyne Finale was the finale of the 2017 Freedom City festival. The event, promoted by Newcastle University re-enacted many world civil rights stories throughout history. The final event, revolved around the March, the re-enactment was described as a memorable closing to the finale.

When Patch finally found his way out of the seed-pod, Toro was gone, and there were rats all around him. Some hid beneath the huge black seed-pods, some scuttled in the shadows of the nearby mountain. Patch knew from their smells there were at least a dozen of them. There was another smell too, mixed with that of the rats. The very same unsavory squirrel-smell he had detected in Silver's abandoned drey. \\"What do you want?\\" Patch asked, from his perch atop the mound of seed-pods. He was concerned but not yet frightened. Rats and squirrels were neither friends nor enemies. Squirrels were bigger and stronger, but rats were far more numerous. There were legends of long-ago wars between the two species, but no squirrel Patch knew had ever been attacked by rats. Squirrels lived aboveground, in the sun; rats frequented the night and the dark underworld. Of course, squirrels found rats disgusting and disagreeable -- but so did all other animals. An unusually large rat climbed up to the top of a seed-pod. It was almost as big as Patch himself. Rats usually avoided light, but this one stood unafraid beneath the sun, and demanded: \\"Who are you?\\" \\"I am Patch son of Silver, of the Seeker clan, of the Treetops tribe, of the Center Kingdom,\\" Patch said. \\"Who are you that asks?\\" \\"I am Snout,\\" the rat replied. \\"Why are you here?\\" \\"I came to look for food.\\" \\"This is our food.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"In order to determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to break down the meanings of both statements and analyze their relationship. Premise: \\"The farmers tended their crops.\\" In this statement, we are given the information that the farmers are actively engaging in the process of managing and maintaining their crops. This could involve activities such as planting seeds, watering plants, fertilizing soil, weeding, and harvesting. The term \\"tended\\" indicates a level of care and attention given by the farmers towards their crops. Hypothesis: \\"The farmers took good care of their crops.\\" The hypothesis suggests that the farmers engaged in activities that promote the health and growth of their crops. It implies that the farmers' actions were positive and beneficial for the crops. The statement emphasizes the quality of care the farmers provided to their crops, using the descriptor \\"good.\\" Now that we have a clearer understanding of both statements, we can assess if the premise entails the hypothesis: In this case, the premise does entail the hypothesis. By stating that the farmers tended their crops, we understand that they were engaging in activities to manage and maintain the crops, which aligns with the idea of taking good care of them. The term \\"tended\\" carries a positive connotation, which supports the notion that the farmers were providing good care. However, it's important to note that the term \\"good\\" in the hypothesis might imply a certain level of quality in the farmers' actions that might not be necessarily covered by the premise. If ample evidence supports the fact that the farmers are indeed providing good care, then the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis will be stronger. In conclusion, the premise \\"The farmers tended their crops\\" entails the hypothesis \\"The farmers took good care of their crops\\" as both statements imply an active involvement in managing and maintaining the crops. However, the degree to which the care provided is considered \\"good\\" may require further evidence or clarification."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: suppose less blood plasma available happens, how will it affect the liver having to work SOFTER.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","output":"The option B: less is the correct answer. When there is less blood plasma available, it means that there is a lower volume of blood circulating through the body. This can lead to reduced blood flow to the liver, which in turn would mean that the liver has to work less hard to perform its various functions. The liver is responsible for filtering blood from the digestive tract, producing bile, creating proteins for blood plasma, storing glucose as glycogen, converting ammonia to urea, and regulating blood clotting. With a reduced blood plasma volume, the liver will have fewer substances to process and convert, leading to a situation where it has to work \\"softer\\" or less hard than under normal conditions. However, it is important to note that a decrease in blood plasma could have negative effects on the overall functioning of the body. It can lead to poor nutrient and oxygen delivery to cells and may also compromise the body's ability to fight off infections and maintain equilibrium.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.

The base commander is an old friend, Lt. Col. \\"Mac\\" MacDonald, working with Squadron Leader Barrett (Reginald Denny, himself a World War I aerial observer), who is in charge of the Royal Air Force cadets at the base. Steve says he wants the job because he is too old for combat and the war will be won by pilots trained on bases like Thunderbird, but it is soon clear that he chose this base because his former girlfriend, Kay Saunders, lives nearby with her grandfather, retired Colonel Cyrus \\"Gramps\\" Saunders, also a close friend of Steve's. Steve immediately flies to their ranch and performs stunts over a water tank where Kay is bathing, blowing her robe away and then dropping her his flying coveralls.

In recent years, the countries of Eastern Europe have been told that they should privatise their banks, in other words, that they should subordinate them to Western European banks. Translate to Finnish","output":"Viime vuosina Itä-Euroopan maihin on suositeltu pankkisektorin yksityistämistä eli muun muassa alisteisuutta Länsi-Euroopan pankkien kontrollille. Viime aikoina Itä-Euroopan maat ovat saaneet kuulla, että niiden tulisi yksityistää pankkinsa - toisin sanoen alistaa ne Länsi-Euroopan pankkien alaisuuteen. Tämän taustalla vaikuttava ajatus on se, että pankkisektorin yksityistäminen ja integroituminen osaksi Länsi-Euroopan rahoitusmarkkinoita auttaisivat Itä-Euroopan maita parantamaan taloudellista vakauttaan ja kasvattamaan vaurauttaan. Yksityistämistoimet ovat kuitenkin herättäneet myös kritiikkiä ja keskustelua sekä Itä-Euroopassa että laajemmassa kansainvälisessä yhteisössä. Kritiikin keskiössä ovat usein esimerkiksi paikallisten pankkien aseman heikkeneminen ja pääomasijoitusten mahdolliset riskit. Pankkitoiminnan yksityistäminen Itä-Euroopassa tarkoittaisi pääasiallisesti sen järjestämistä niin, että pankkitoimiala toimisi enemmän länsimaisilla ja yksityisillä markkinaperiaatteilla. Tämä tarkoittaa, että valtioiden rooli pankkitoiminnassa vähenisi ja pankkitoiminnan määräysvalta siirtyisi yksityisiin ja ulkomaisiin käsiin. Tällainen muutos voisi tuoda monia hyötyjä Itä-Euroopan maille, kuten uusia investointeja, teknologista osaamista ja kansainvälistä rahoitusmarkkinoiden osaamista. Länsi-Euroopan pankkien tuoma määräysvalta saattaisi myös tuoda mukanaan parannuksia pankkitoiminnan tehokkuuteen ja sääntelyyn. Toisaalta yksityistäminen voi synnyttää myös huolia ja riskejä. Esimerkiksi valtiollisten pankkien aseman heikkeneminen voi lisätä pankkitoiminnan kontrolloimatonta kilpailua ja keskittymistä. Ulkomaiset sijoittajat saattavat myös pyrkiä hyödyntämään paikallisten pankkien asemaa ja voivat vaikuttaa pankkisektorin vakavuuteen hinta- ja valuuttakurssien vaihteluilla. Lopulta Itä-Euroopan maiden tulee punnita yksityistämisen hyötyjä ja riskejä ja tehdä päätöksiä, jotka parhaiten palvelevat niiden omia taloudellisia, poliittisia ja sosiaalisia tarpeita. Pankkisektorin yksityistäminen ei ole yksiselitteisesti oikea tai väärä ratkaisu, vaan sen toteuttamisessa on tärkeää ottaa huomioon eri näkökulmia ja ehdottaa selkeitä menettelytapoja, joilla voidaan minimoida haitalliset vaikutukset ja maksimoida taloudellinen hyöty kunkin Itä-Euroopan maan tilanteen mukaan."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Switzer began his career as a child actor in the mid-1930s appearing in the Our Gang short subjects series as Alfalfa, one of the series' most popular and best-remembered characters. After leaving the series in 1940, Switzer struggled to find substantial roles owing to typecasting. As an adult, he appeared mainly in bit parts and B-movies. Context: In early 1954, Switzer went on a blind date with Diantha (Dian) Collingwood, heiress of grain elevator empire Collingwood Grain. Collingwood had moved with her mother and sister to California in 1953 because her sister wanted to become an actress. Switzer and Collingwood got along well and married in Las Vegas three months later. In 1956, with his money running out and Diantha pregnant, his mother-in-law offered them a farm near Pretty Prairie, Kansas, west of Wichita. Their son, Justin Lance Collingwood Switzer (now Eldridge), was born that year. They divorced in 1957.  In 1987, former Our Gang co-star George \\"Spanky\\" McFarland recalled a meeting with Switzer when they spoke about the farm:  The last time I saw Carl was 1957. It was a tough time for me--and him. I was starting a tour of theme parks and county fairs in the Midwest. Carl had married this girl whose father owned a pretty good size farm near Wichita. When I came through town, he heard about it and called. He told me he was helping to run the farm, but he finally had to put a radio on the tractor while he was out there plowing. Knowing Carl, I knew that wasn't going to last. He may have come from Paris, Illinois, but he wasn't a farmer! We hadn't seen each other since we left the 'Gang.' So we had lunch. We talked about all the things you'd expect. And then I never saw him again. He looked pretty much the same. He was just Carl Switzer--kind of cocky, a little antsy--and I thought to myself he hadn't changed that much. He still talked big. He just grew up.  In January 1958 Switzer was getting into his car in front of a bar in Studio City, when a bullet smashed through the window and struck him in the upper right arm. The gunman was never caught. That December he was arrested in Sequoia National Forest for cutting down 15 pine trees; he was sentenced to a year's probation and ordered to pay a 225 fine. Question: when did this tragedy happen?. Whats the answer?","output":"The sad tragedy happened on January 21, 1959, when Carl Dean Switzer was shot. Would you like to know more about what happened?

Possible A: murky, confusing, invisible, misunderstood, teacher  Why is \\"invisible\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Invisible\\" is an answer that may be aligned with human common sense because it is connected to the aspect of clarity. In the context of the given question, \\"The class was clear, and that made it almost what?\\" the statement provides a positive perspective on the clarity of the class.

The Scot is the most successful manager in British football, and his status as the longest-serving one in United's history was cemented when the English Premier League champions renamed the biggest stand at Old Trafford in his honor. It is the first time in the ground's 101 years that a section has been named after an individual. Club officials have also commissioned an award-winning Scottish sculptor, Philip Jackson, to build a statue of the 69-year-old to be erected outside the stand's entrance next year. The unveiling of the newly christened Sir Alex Ferguson Stand was truly a significant event in the club's rich history, as it acknowledged the enduring impact that the iconic manager has had on both Manchester United and British football. As a testament to his remarkable achievements, the ceremony was attended by a host of dignitaries from the footballing world as well as Sir Alex's family and friends, who joined together to pay tribute to the man who defied expectations and transformed United into a global powerhouse. Ferguson's journey at the helm of Manchester United began in 1986 when he was appointed as the club's manager, following an impressive tenure at Aberdeen. Despite a challenging start, Sir Alex quickly silenced his critics by rebuilding the team and instilling a never-say-die attitude among its members. This culminated in unparalleled accomplishments that include an astounding 13 English Premier League titles, two UEFA Champions League crowns, five FA Cups, and four League Cups, among numerous other domestic and international honors. It wasn't always a smooth ride, as he faced numerous adversities along the way, from internal conflicts to intense rivalry with other top English clubs. However, Ferguson's unwavering dedication to the club and his relentless pursuit of excellence set him apart, and he became synonymous with the Red Devils' rise to the zenith of European football. Under his stewardship, the club also nurtured and developed several generations of world-class talents such as Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Wayne Rooney, further cementing his reputation as a true football visionary. The anniversary celebration was, in many ways, a microcosm of Ferguson's tenure, as it showcased both the joys and challenges that have marked his extraordinary career. The festivities were heightened by the electrifying atmosphere at the packed Old Trafford stadium, which reverberated with chants and songs in honor of the living legend. The occasion, however, was not without some nervous moments, as the Red Devils' on-field performance seemed to wobble under the sheer weight of expectations. Nevertheless, much like countless times before, Ferguson's side ultimately prevailed, underlining the indelible spirit that he has instilled in his players and the organization as a whole. And as the final whistle blew, emotions, memories, and tributes poured forth once more, reflecting on the lasting legacy of a man who has steadfastly given his all for the love of the beautiful game and etched his name in the annals of football history. In conclusion, Sir Alex Ferguson's 25th anniversary celebration at Manchester United was a fitting blend of highs and lows, reflecting the immense challenges he faced and the incredible success he achieved as the club's manager. As a sign of deep appreciation and respect for his contributions, the christening of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand and the commissioning of a statue in his honor are emblematic of the enduring bond between the legendary manager and the club he has helped define over the past quarter-century."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

As with many canids, one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state, which can be important in getting along with others. In some hunting dogs, however, the tail is traditionally docked to avoid injuries. In some breeds, such as the Braque du Bourbonnais, puppies can be born with a short tail or no tail at all. What does a dog communicate with its tail? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"A dog's tail is an important tool for communication, both with other dogs and with humans. By observing the position, movement, and speed of a dog's tail, one can gain insight into its emotions, intentions, and overall demeanor. Here is a breakdown of the various ways a dog communicates using its tail: 1. Tail position: - A high tail often signifies a dog that is confident, assertive or excited. This can, at times, be a sign of aggression or dominance. - A tail held in its natural position (varying depending on the breed) signals that the dog is relaxed and comfortable. - A low tail, tucked between the legs, indicates fear, submissiveness, or anxiety. 2. Tail wagging: - A slow wag, especially with the tail held low or in its natural position, usually means the dog is uncertain, cautious, or slightly anxious. - A rapid and wide wag, with the tail held at the dog's natural level, signals a happy and excited dog, often seeking attention, play, or affection from others. - A fast, stiff wag, particularly with a high tail, may signify aggression, tension, or alertness to a potential threat. 3. The direction of wagging: - Some studies suggest that a wag that leans more predominantly to the dog's right side indicates a positive emotion or encounter, such as happiness, excitement, or friendliness. - Conversely, a wag that leans more to the dog's left side can suggest negative emotions or experiences, such as wariness, fear, or suspicion. 4. Tail movement speed: - The faster the tail is wagging, the more heightened the dog's emotional state, be it positive or negative. 5. Breed-specific tail considerations: - As mentioned earlier, certain dog breeds have unique tail shapes that can influence the way they communicate with their tails. For example, a Greyhound's natural tail position when relaxed is low and close to its hind legs, while an Akita's natural tail position consists of a curl over its back. It is essential to consider the dog's tail movement and position in conjunction with other body language cues, such as ear position, facial expressions, and overall posture, to better understand the dog's emotional state and intentions. By observing these non-verbal signals, one can form a holistic understanding of a dog's communication and respond appropriately in various situations."},{"instruction":"Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: This product was a wonderful tool to use with children who love the game Jenga.

Players can visit Las Vegas to store their nickel stash and increase their coins at the Cool World bank . Players can visit Las Vegas to store their nickel storage space and increase their coins at the Cool World Bank .","output":"While these two sentences from Wikipedia are similar, they do not convey the same meaning entirely. The subtle differences between them lie in the terms \\"nickel stash\\" and \\"nickel storage space\\" as well as in capitalization of \\"Cool World bank\\" versus \\"Cool World Bank.\\" Here is a comparison of both sentences and how they differ in meaning: 1. \\"Players can visit Las Vegas to store their nickel stash and increase their coins at the Cool World bank.\\" This sentence focuses on explaining the action of players visiting Las Vegas to store their \\"nickel stash.\\" Here, the term \\"stash\\" refers to a collection or a group of nickels that players have accumulated. The sentence implies that storing their nickels at the \\"Cool World bank\\" would also enable players to increase their number of coins. It's important to note that the term \\"bank\\" is not capitalized in this sentence, which could suggest the \\"Cool World bank\\" is a general financial institution within the game environment and not necessarily an official name. 2. \\"Players can visit Las Vegas to store their nickel storage space and increase their coins at the Cool World Bank.\\" In contrast to the first sentence, this version refers to \\"nickel storage space\\" instead of \\"nickel stash.\\" The term \\"storage space\\" might suggest a physical location or a capacity limit for storing nickels. This change makes the sentence slightly more ambiguous and creates confusion about whether players are storing their nickels or increasing the storage capacity for nickels. Furthermore, this sentence includes a capitalized \\"Bank,\\" implying that the \\"Cool World Bank\\" is an official name or a specific institution within the game setting. Though the primary action remains the same—players visiting Las Vegas to increase their coins—using \\"Cool World Bank\\" implies that it is a specific, named location. In summary, while both sentences convey the idea that players are visiting Las Vegas to store their nickels and increase their coins, the first sentence highlights the action of storing a collection of nickels, whereas the second sentence is more ambiguous about whether it is the nickels or their storage capacity that is being stored. Additionally, the capitalization difference implies a more specific location in the second sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Sulfur in the coal combines with oxygen to form sulfur oxides - The sulfur oxides are released into the atmosphere - The sulfides combine with oxygen in the atmosphere to form sulfur trioxide - The sulfur trioxide reacts with water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid, a very strong acid - The sulfuric acid makes the rain acidic - Answer:","output":"The missing first step of the process is \\"Burning of coal\\": 1. Burning of coal: When coal is burned in industries or power plants, it releases a large amount of heat energy, which is used to generate electricity or to power various industrial processes. During combustion, the sulfur present in the coal is exposed to oxygen. 2. Sulfur in the coal combines with oxygen to form sulfur oxides: As the coal burns, the sulfur atoms present in the fuel react with oxygen to form sulfur oxides, predominantly sulfur dioxide (SO2).  3. The sulfur oxides are released into the atmosphere: The sulfur oxides created during combustion are released into the atmosphere as part of the flue gas emissions from power plants and industrial facilities.  4. The sulfides combine with oxygen in the atmosphere to form sulfur trioxide: Once in the atmosphere, sulfur dioxide can undergo a series of chemical reactions with oxygen to form sulfur trioxide (SO3). 5. The sulfur trioxide reacts with water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid, a very strong acid: The sulfur trioxide will then react with water vapor present in the atmosphere to produce sulfuric acid (H2SO4), a highly corrosive and strong acid. 6. The sulfuric acid makes the rain acidic: The resulting sulfuric acid becomes part of the atmospheric moisture, which falls as acid rain when precipitation occurs. Acid rain can have harmful effects on the environment, including causing damage to forests, water ecosystems, and buildings or monuments made from materials such as limestone and marble."},{"instruction":"Question: what is a Four Lokos?

Riots were sparked across the Islamic world in September after a 14-minute trailer for the \\"Innocence of Muslims\\" video was released on YouTube. Troops are now on heightened alert to the risk of another round of protests because a derivative film called \\"The Innocent Prophet\\" is slated to be released on Friday.            The new footage created by an ex- Muslim originally from Pakistan has already inflamed tensions in his former home country ahead of its release.            Coalition forces are prepared for extreme reactions to the provocative video that could hamper their efforts in neighbouring Afghanistan, which is already a tinder box of religious sensitivities.            Defence forces are warned to be wary of inadvertently offending locals as part of their preparations for deployment to the main Australian base in Uruzgan province or other centres of Kabul and Kandahar.            Cultural sensitivity training is a standard element of soldiers' pre-deployment training in Australia.            But the key points are drilled into all military and civilian personnel going to work in Afghanistan in another intensive four day program at the Al Minhad Air Base outside Dubai.            The training includes appropriate ways to handle and store the Koran, which is generally wrapped in a cloth and only opened after the reader has ritually cleansed themselves.            This preparation has taken on extra urgency in the aftermath of an increase in insider attacks against Coalition forces.            Retribution for perceived slights on Islam are thought to be one possible trigger for these turncoat attacks, which claimed three out of the seven Diggers' lives lost in Afghanistan this year.            Coalition forces are wary of violent reactions from Afghans who are upset by breaches of religious protocol.            Days of rioting ensued after Coalition soldiers burned copies of the Koran when they were disposing of old books at the Bagram Air Base near Kabul last February.            US President Barack Obama and the chief of NATO forces in Afghanistan, General John Allen, both issued televised apologies in a bid to quell the outcry, which insurgents have used as justification for attacks.            The Australians' training also covers emergency care of battle casualties, shooting practice and the latest intelligence on the other big killer of troops - improvised explosive devices.            Troops are briefed on the latest threats from explosives, practice travelling through mine fields and detecting suicide bombers.            Simulated rescue missions of injured people from buildings and vehicles while under fire are used to prepare troops for the worst case scenarios they could encounter during their deployment.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Information:  - Apollyon Sun were an industrial metal band formed by singer/guitarist Tom Gabriel Fischer and guitarist Erol Unala in early 1995, after the termination of Celtic Frost, Fischer's prior group. The group was unofficially dissolved in 2001 when Fischer invited Erol Unala to contribute to the reformation of Celtic Frost. Their name is taken from the Celtic Frost demo \\"Under Apollyon's Sun\\".  - Black Sabbath are an English rock band, formed in Birmingham in 1968, by guitarist and main songwriter Tony Iommi, bassist and main lyricist Geezer Butler, singer Ozzy Osbourne, and drummer Bill Ward. The band have since experienced multiple line-up changes, with guitarist Iommi being the only constant presence in the band through the years. Originally formed as a blues rock band, the group soon adopted the Black Sabbath moniker and began incorporating occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and tuned-down guitars. Despite an association with these two themes, Black Sabbath also composed songs dealing with social instability, political corruption, the dangers of drug abuse and apocalyptic prophecies of the horrors of war.  - Necrophilia, also called thanatophilia, is a sexual attraction or sexual act involving corpses. The attraction is classified as a paraphilia by the \\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\\" (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association. The term was coined by the Belgian alienist Joseph Guislain, who first used it in a lecture in 1850. It derives from the Greek words \\"\\" (\\"nekros\\"; \\"dead\\") and \\"\\" (\\"philia\\"; \\"love\\").  - Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal.  - Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration perpetrated against a person without that person's consent. The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, has an intellectual disability or is below the legal age of consent. The term \\"rape\\" is sometimes used interchangeably with the term \\"sexual assault.\\"  - The time signature (also known as meter signature, metre signature, or measure signature) is a notational convention used in Western musical notation to specify how many beats (pulses) are to be contained in each bar and which note value is to be given one beat. In a musical score, the time signature appears at the beginning of the piece, as a time symbol or stacked numerals, such as or (read \\"common time\\" and \\"three-four time\\", respectively), immediately following the key signature or immediately following the clef symbol if the key signature is empty. A mid-score time signature, usually immediately following a barline, indicates a change of meter.  - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.  - Cannibalism is the act or practice of humans eating the flesh or internal organs of other human beings. A person who practices cannibalism is called a cannibal. The expression \\"cannibalism\\" has been extended into zoology to mean one individual of a species consuming all or part of another individual of the same species as food, including sexual cannibalism.  - Siouxsie and the Banshees were an English rock band formed in London in 1976 by vocalist Siouxsie Sioux and bass guitarist Steven Severin. Initially associated with the English punk rock scene, the band rapidly evolved to create \\"a form of post-punk discord full of daring rhythmic and sonic experimentation\\". \\"The Times\\" cited Siouxsie and the Banshees as \\"one of the most audacious and uncompromising musical adventurers of the post-punk era\\".  - Torture (from the Latin \\"tortus\\", \\"twisted\\") is the act of deliberately inflicting physical or psychological pain on an organism in order to fulfill some desire of the torturer or compel some action from the victim. Torture, by definition, is a knowing and intentional act; deeds which unknowingly or negligently inflict pain without a specific intent to do so are not typically considered torture.  - Judas Priest are a British heavy metal band formed in Birmingham, England, in 1969. The band has sold close to 50 million albums to date. MTV ranked them the second greatest metal band of all time. Despite an innovative and pioneering body of work in the latter half of the 1970s, the band struggled with indifferently produced records, repeated changes of drummer and a lack of major commercial success or attention until 1980, when they adopted a more simplified sound on the album \\"British Steel\\", which helped shoot them to rock superstar status. In 1989, they were named as defendants in an unsuccessful lawsuit alleging that subliminal messages on the song \\"Better By You, Better Than Me\\" had caused the suicide attempts of two young men.  - Thomas Gabriel Fischer ( born 19 July 1963 ) , earlier known by his stage name of Tom G. Warrior , is a Swiss metal musician . He is considered to be one of the pioneers of the death metal style of singing , which resembles guttural growling . He led the groups Hellhammer and Celtic Frost , and today is the frontman of the band Triptykon .  - Weimar Republic is an unofficial, historical designation for the German state between 1919 and 1933. The name derives from the city of Weimar, where its constitutional assembly first took place. The official name of the state was still \\"Deutsches Reich\\"; it had remained unchanged since 1871. In English the country was usually known simply as Germany. A national assembly was convened in Weimar, where a new constitution for the \\"Deutsches Reich\\" was written, and adopted on 11 August 1919. In its fourteen years, the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including hyperinflation, political extremism (with paramilitaries  both left- and right-wing); and contentious relationships with the victors of the First World War. The people of Germany blamed the Weimar Republic rather than their wartime leaders for the country's defeat and for the humiliating terms of the Treaty of Versailles. However, the Weimar Republic government successfully reformed the currency, unified tax policies, and organized the railway system. Weimar Germany eliminated most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles; it never completely met its disarmament requirements, and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations (by twice restructuring its debt through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan). Under the Locarno Treaties, Germany accepted the western borders of the republic, but continued to dispute the Eastern border.  - Slasher films are a subgenre of horror films, typically involving a violent psychopath stalking and murdering several people, usually with bladed tools. Although the term \\"slasher\\" is sometimes used informally as a generic term for any horror movie involving murder, analysts of the genre cite an established set of characteristics which set these films apart from other horror subgenres, such as splatter films and psychological horror films.  - In musical terminology, tempo (\\"time\\" in Italian; plural: \\"tempi\\" ) is the speed or pace of a given piece or subsection thereof, how fast or slow. Tempo is related to meter and is usually measured by beats per minute, with the beats being a division of the measures, though tempo is often indicated by terms which have acquired standard ranges of beats per minute or assumed by convention without indication. Tempo may be separated from articulation, or articulation may be indicated along with tempo, and tempo contributes to the overall texture. While the ability to hold a steady tempo is a desirable skill, tempo is changeable, and often indicated by a conductor or drummer. While practicing, an electronic or mechanical device, a metronome, may indicate the tempo, as one usually works one's way up to being able to perform at the proper tempo. In other words it is the speed at which a passage of music is or should be played.  - Atonality in its broadest sense is music that lacks a tonal center, or key. \\"Atonality\\", in this sense, usually describes compositions written from about 1908 to the present day where a hierarchy of pitches focusing on a single, central tone is not used, and the notes of the chromatic scale function independently of one another . More narrowly, the term \\"atonality\\" describes music that does not conform to the system of tonal hierarchies that characterized classical European music between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries . \\"The repertory of atonal music is characterized by the occurrence of pitches in novel combinations, as well as by the occurrence of familiar pitch combinations in unfamiliar environments\\" .  - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?  - A triptych (; from the Greek adjective \\"\\" \\"\\"triptukhon\\"\\" (\\"three-fold\\"), from \\"tri\\", i.e., \\"three\\" and \\"ptysso\\", i.e., \\"to fold\\" or \\"ptyx\\", i.e., \\"fold\\") is a work of art (usually a panel painting) that is divided into three sections, or three carved panels that are hinged together and can be folded shut or displayed open. It is therefore a type of polyptych, the term for all multi-panel works. The middle panel is typically the largest and it is flanked by two smaller related works, although there are triptychs of equal-sized panels. The form can also be used for pendant jewelry.  - Dissection (from Latin ' \\"to cut to pieces\\"; also called anatomization), is the dismembering of the body of a deceased animal or plant to study its anatomical structure. Autopsy is used in pathology and forensic medicine to determine the cause of death in humans. It is carried out by or demonstrated to biology and anatomy students in high school and medical school. Less advanced courses typically focus on smaller subjects, such as small formaldehyde-preserved animals, while the more advanced courses normally use cadavers. Consequently, dissection is typically conducted in a morgue or in an anatomy lab.  - Celtic Frost was a Swiss extreme metal band from Zürich. They are known for their heavy influence on the extreme metal genres. Formed in 1981 as Hellhammer, the band became Celtic Frost in 1984 and was active until 1993. It re-formed in 2001 and disbanded following frontman Tom Gabriel Fischer's departure in 2008. The band was inspired by heavy metal groups such as Black Sabbath, Judas Priest and Venom, but also by gothic rock acts like Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Christian Death, and by the hardcore punk group Discharge.  - Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or universe. \\"Nature\\" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.  - Lovecraftian horror is a subgenre of horror fiction that emphasizes the cosmic horror of the unknown (and in some cases, unknowable) more than gore or other elements of shock, though these may still be present. It is named after American author H. P. Lovecraft (1890  1937).  - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.  - Gothic rock (also referred to as goth rock or simply goth) is a musical subgenre of post-punk and alternative rock that formed during the late 1970s. Gothic rock bands grew from the strong ties they had to the English punk rock and emerging post-punk scenes. Proto-gothic bands include Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, Bauhaus and the Cure.  - Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\". Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \\"divine\\", \\"sacred things\\", \\"faith\\", a \\"supernatural being or supernatural beings\\" or \\"some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\\"  - Mutilation or maiming is an act of physical injury that degrades the appearance or function of any living body.  - Hellhammer was a Swiss extreme metal band from Nurensdorf, active during 19811984. They are regarded as a key influence on black metal, and one of the founders of death metal. In June 1984, Hellhammer became Celtic Frost.  - Triptykon is a musical project of Thomas Gabriel Fischer, founding member of the pioneering heavy metal bands Hellhammer, Celtic Frost and Apollyon Sun. Fischer announced his departure from Celtic Frost in May 2008 and shortly afterwards revealed his new project would be entitled Triptykon. The name of the band is the Greek word for \\"triptych\\", and is aimed at stating that Triptykon is founding member Thomas Gabriel Fischer's third project after Hellhammer and Celtic Frost. The band logo is inspired by a writing pattern used in Weimar Republic.  - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms.  - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics.  - Christian Death is an American deathrock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1979 by Rozz Williams. They became a highly influential act, heralding the American gothic rock and deathrock movements.  - A blast beat is a drum beat that originated in hardcore punk and grindcore, and is often associated with extreme metal and more recently black metal and thrash. It is utilised by many different styles of metal. In Adam MacGregor's definition, \\"the blast-beat generally comprises a repeated, sixteenth-note figure played at a very fast tempo, and divided uniformly among the bass drum, snare, and ride, crash, or hi-hat cymbal.\\" Blast beats have been described as, \\"maniacal percussive explosions, less about rhythm per se than sheer sonic violence\\".  - Satanism is a group of ideological and philosophical beliefs based on the character of Satan. Contemporary religious practice of Satanism began with the founding of the Church of Satan in 1966, although a few historical precedents exist. Prior to the public practice, Satanism existed primarily as an accusation by various Christian groups toward perceived ideological opponents, rather than a self-identity. Satanism, and the concept of Satan, has also been used by artists and entertainers for symbolic expression.  - Mythology refers variously to the collected myths of a group of people or to the study of such myths. Myths are the stories people tell to explain nature, history and customs.    What is the relationship between 'thomas gabriel fischer' and 'zürich'?

While working one day, Matt's high school crush, Tori Frederking walks into the store. After pretending that he doesn't work there and saying that he works at Goldman Sachs in an effort to impress her, Tori invites Matt to a Labor Day party, hosted by Matt's twin sister Wendy's boyfriend, Kyle Masterson, at his hillside home. Later that night, Matt, Wendy, and Matt's best friend, Barry Nathan, head to the party. On the drive over, Barry steals a brand new Mercedes-Benz convertible from the car dealership he got fired from earlier that day, justifying his actions by saying that Matt needs the convertible if he really wants to impress Tori. The trio arrive at the party. While there, Matt catches up with an old classmate (who actually works at Goldman Sachs) and then awkwardly tries to woo Tori. Barry snorts some cocaine he found in the glove box of the stolen convertible and gets involved in a dance-off, and Wendy's boyfriend proposes to her in front of everyone at the party. She says yes, upsetting Matt, who doesn't think that Kyle will support her in her dream to attend graduate school at the University of Cambridge. Tori eventually invites Matt and Barry to another party her boss is hosting in Beverly Hills. Matt takes Tori there in the Mercedes, while Barry rides with her two friends in another car, using the cocaine as an enticement to let him go along. Barry has a wild sexual encounter with an older woman while Matt and Tori continue to mingle with each other, after Matt's successful 'put down' of Tori's boss, a habitual sexual harasser.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Budapest is the capital and most populous city of Hungary, one of the largest cities in the European Union and sometimes described as the primate city of Hungary.

Premise: \\"The Astronomer sighed and said, \\"There are the boys!\\"  \\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The boys were over there.\\"?","output":"The given premise, in which the Astronomer sighs and says \\"There are the boys!\\", suggests that the boys were in the presence of the Astronomer, or at least within his visual range. However, the hypothesis \\"The boys were over there\\" can be evaluated based on various factors that might affect its likelihood of being accurate or imprecise when compared to the given premise. Firstly, it is important to consider the context in which the given premise and hypothesis are placed. The Astronomer's sigh could be interpreted in multiple ways, such as relief, frustration, disappointment, or admiration, depending on the situation and the intentions involved. If the boys were the topic of their conversation or thoughts, the presence of the boys can confirm their position and possibly lend some support to the hypothesis. With the given information, it is possible that the Astronomer's exclamation signifies an acknowledgment of the boys' location, which could be described by the term \\"over there.\\" This might imply a physical distance between the boys and the speaker, but \\"over there\\" is a subjective term and depends on the perspective of the speaker. In this sense, \\"over there\\" could mean that the boys are nearby or far away; therefore, it is not completely certain that the premise entails the hypothesis. Furthermore, the Astronomer's statement doesn't specify the actual direction or position of the boys. Without specific details on the location of the boys in relation to the Astronomer, it is impossible to be certain that the hypothesis \\"The boys were over there\\" clearly follows or contradicts the premise. In conclusion, given the premise \\"The Astronomer sighed and said, 'There are the boys!\\", it is possible that it supports the hypothesis \\"The boys were over there\\" when considering the Astronomer's acknowledgment of their location. However, due to the vague nature of the term \\"over there\\" and the lack of details regarding the boys' actual position in relation to the speaker, the premise doesn't definitely entail the hypothesis.

Refusal: Stephanie Kercher, pictured in 2011, has said her family are not interested in what Amanda Knox has to say in her book. It is one of the most keenly anticipated books of the decade. But Amanda Knox’s million-dollar memoir isn’t to everyone’s taste - the Kercher family have made it clear that they at least will not be reading it. ‘We're not interested in this book, just like we weren't interested in the others about the case, and we won't read it,' Meredith’s sister Stephanie Kercher said, after its US release yesterday. She added: ‘Meredith is the victim in this tragic case.’ Knox served four years in an Italian jail for the 2007 murder of her British flatmate Meredith Kercher in Perugia. She and former boyfriend Rafaelle Sollecito were freed on appeal in 2011, but last month Italy’s highest court dramatically ruled the pair must face retrial. Her memoir Waiting to be Heard, for which Knox was reportedly paid a 2 million pound advance, was published today in the US although plans to sell it in the UK were shelved after its publisher Harper Collins took legal advice. While a new trial is expected to take place by the summer in Florence, US authorities could invoke the principle of double-jeopardy, arguing that a person cannot be convicted of the same offence twice, and so refuse to extradite Knox back to Italy. Stephanie Kercher, the sister of the victim, released a statement in Italian through the family's lawyers Francesco Maresca and Serena Perna in Italy late on Tuesday after excerpts of Miss Knox's first US TV interview were released to publicise the release of her book, Waiting to Be Heard. She also emphasised that Miss Knox could be found guilty in the new trial. She said: ‘The Italian legal system still has an appeal procedure under way and so the case is returning to a new court hearing. The sentence can still be overturned. ‘I have no doubts that on the other side there is a story of pain and loss and enormous mistrust but in the end it is also one of hope and the opportunity to live life. Her story: In pre-interviews ahead of the release of 'Waiting to be Heard', Amanda Knox has said she wants the Kercher family top read her memoirs. Killed: Knox spent four years in jail for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher, 21, in Perugia, Italy, November 2007. ‘Something Meredith will never have and something we can never share with her. Meredith is the victim in this tragic case.’ Knox had earlier expressed the desire that Meredith’s parents would read the book, something she hoped would give her some ‘closure’. ‘The ideal situation in my mind is that they could show me Meredith's grave,' she told USA Today. ‘I wasn't allowed to grieve, either, and that would mean a lot to me’. ‘I really want to go see her grave,\\" repeated Miss Knox, who spent four years in prison before being acquitted. 'And right now I don't feel I have the right to without her family's permission.’ Knox likened her ordeal to being forced to crawl through a 'field of barbed wire' to reach the 'same side' as the Kerchers. In another interview, she told ABC News that she wrote the book to respond in full to accusations that meant ‘for all intents and purposes I was a murderer’. ‘I want the truth to come out. I'd like to be reconsidered as a person,' she said. 'I was in the courtroom when they were calling me a devil. ‘It's one thing to be called certain things in the media, but it's another to be sitting in a courtroom, fighting for your life, while people are calling you a devil.’ What are the important parts of this article?","output":"1.

Help as much as you can. Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What policy serves to protect children according to the church? Context: Jehovah's Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization. The religion has been criticized for its \\"two witness rule\\" for church discipline, based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17, which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing. In cases where corroboration is lacking, the Watch Tower Society's instruction is that \\"the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah's hands\\". A former member of the church’s headquarters staff, Barbara Anderson, says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation, \\"which is an impossibility\\". Anderson says the policies \\"protect pedophiles rather than protect the children.\\" Jehovah's Witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children, adding that the best way to protect children is by educating parents; they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents. A:","output":"The policy that serves to protect children according to the church is educating parents and not sponsoring activities that separate children from parents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"How would Taylor feel afterwards?\\", is \\"like a failure\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"Yes, \\"like a failure\\" can be considered a valid answer to describe how Taylor might feel after missing an important exam due to oversleeping. However, this is a shorthand interpretation, and to better understand Taylor's emotions, it would be helpful to explore the issue more comprehensively, taking into consideration various emotional, psychological, and social factors. First, let's consider the emotional aspects. Missing an important exam due to oversleeping could elicit a range of emotions in Taylor. These emotions might include: 1. Frustration: Taylor might feel frustrated with themselves for not being able to manage their sleep habits and schedule well enough to be awake and prepared for the exam. 2. Sadness: Taylor may experience sadness as they realize the potential consequences of missing the exam, such as a lower grade or poor academic performance. 3. Anxiety: Taylor could feel anxious about how this event will impact their future, whether it concerns their academic progress, career opportunities, or personal goals. 4. Disappointment: Taylor might be disappointed in themselves for not living up to their own expectations or the expectations of others (e.g., teachers, parents, friends). 5. Guilt: Taylor may feel guilty for failing to meet their responsibilities and for potentially letting down others who have invested time and effort in supporting their education. Considering the psychological aspects, Taylor's self-perception could be affected by this incident. They might: 1. Experience reduced self-esteem: Taylor could view themselves as less capable or worthy due to their perceived failure. 2. Develop a negative self-schema: Taylor might start to see themselves as someone who fails frequently, leading to a pessimistic outlook on their abilities. 3. Engage in self-blame: Taylor may attribute the event to internal causes, such as personal flaws, rather than external factors like poor time management or an unpredictable sleep schedule. 4. Feel a loss of control: Taylor could perceive their sleep habits as something they are powerless to change, leading to a sense of helplessness. Finally, let's examine the potential social consequences that might also influence Taylor's emotions: 1. Fear of judgment: Taylor may worry about being judged or stigmatized by their peers, teachers, or family members for missing the exam. 2. Social isolation: Taylor might feel isolated from friends or classmates who successfully completed the exam, leading to further feelings of failure or inadequacy. 3. Damaged reputation: Taylor could be concerned about how this event might impact their relationships and reputation within their social and academic circles. In conclusion, although \\"like a failure\\" can be considered a valid answer to describe Taylor's feelings after missing an important exam due to oversleeping, it is important to recognize that their emotional experience could be more complex and multifaceted. To truly understand their emotions, it is essential to consider the various emotional, psychological, and social factors contributing to Taylor's reaction to the incident."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Now this is perhaps the first generation of American youngsters who have never been close by during of the birth a baby and have never experienced the death of a family member. Nowadays when people grow old, we often send them to nursing homes. When they get sick, we send them to a hospital, where children are forbidden to visit terminally  in patients-- even when those patients are their parents. This deprives the dying patient of family members during the last few days of his life and it deprives the children of an experience of death, which is an important learning experience. Some of my colleagues and I once interviewed and followed about 500 terminally in order to find out what they could teach us and how we could be of more benefit, not just to them but to the members of their families as well. We were most impressed by the fact that even those patients who were not told of their serious illness were quite aware of its potential outcome. It is important for family members, and doctors and nurses to understand these patients' communication in order to truly understand their needs, fears and fantasies  . Most of our patients welcomed another human being with whom they could talk openly, honestly, and frankly about their trouble. Many of them shared with us their great need to be informed, to be kept up - to - date on their medical condition and to be told when the end was near.

Another distinction is the use of \\"this action\\" in contrast to \\"these actions,\\" but this difference does not change the meaning significantly. The second part of both sentences focuses on people trying to find fresh reasons to state why the actions were not the right thing to do. One sentence uses \\"to say this wasn't the right thing to do\\" while the other has \\"why it was not the right thing to do.\\" Still, this difference in phrasing does not alter the primary message of the sentences. Overall, although the two sentences may demonstrate slight variations in their expression, their core meaning is the same, and therefore, I would rate them as being highly similar with a score of 5 on the scale of 0 to 5."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Young accusers to be revealed at Sandusky sex abuse trial STATE COLLEGE, Pa. – The young men who accuse former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky of molesting them have been allowed to remain anonymous through months of intense news coverage and water-cooler conversation about the scandal. When they take the witness stand in a packed Pennsylvania courtroom as early as next week, the alleged victims will be forced to state their names for the record -- traumatizing them all over again, their lawyers and victims' advocates argue, especially given the very real possibility their identities will become common knowledge via social media and the wider Internet. Most traditional media organizations, including The Associated Press, have longstanding policies against using the names of alleged victims of sexual assault, viewing the crime as so intensely personal and the potential effect of public disclosure so traumatic for the accuser that withholding the identity outweighs the public's right to know. But in this anything-goes age of social media and citizen journalists, when anyone with a smartphone can tweet or blog, old media standards may no longer make much difference. Anyone lucky enough to grab one of the 85 courtroom seats reserved for the public could sit in for the day, jot down some of the accusers' names, leave and disseminate them to the world. \\"Most of us want to have some control over who we share intimate details of our lives with,\\" said Karen Baker, director of the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. \\"To have that out there on the Internet, you've totally lost control, and it's a scary thing.\\" Sandusky, 68, faces 52 counts accusing him of sexually abusing 10 boys over a span of 15 years. Prosecutors say the retired coach befriended boys he met through The Second Mile, the charity he founded for youngsters in 1977, then attacked them, in some cases in his home or inside university athletic facilities. He has denied the allegations. Most of the accusers are now in their 20s. Up to now, they have been identified in court papers only as \\"Victim 1,\\" \\"Victim 2\\" and so on. Five of the eight alleged victims who could be called to the stand asked Judge John Cleland for permission to testify under pseudonyms, saying through their lawyers that exposing their names would subject them to shame, ridicule and harassment. An attorney for the accuser known as Victim 4 submitted an affidavit from his psychologist that said public disclosure could trigger symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and interfere with the young man's treatment and recovery. And a coalition of advocacy groups argued that removing the cloak of anonymity would have a chilling effect on victims' willingness to report abuse. Most childhood sexual abuse already goes unreported because young victims fear they will be ridiculed or disbelieved, the groups noted in a brief submitted to the judge. But the judge said there is no authority in Pennsylvania law to allow the alleged victims to remain anonymous. While state law shields the identities of child victims of sexual assault, it affords no explicit protection to adult accusers even if the abuse took place when they were children. Cleland also said there is a public policy consideration at stake. \\"Courts are not customarily in the business of withholding information,\\" he wrote. \\"Secrecy is thought to be inconsistent with the openness required to assure the public that the law is being administered fairly and applied faithfully.\\" With rare exception, Cleland said, all citizens have a duty to testify publicly, \\"no matter how personally unpleasant.\\" In the wake of that ruling, victims' organizations pleaded with the public and the media Thursday to exercise restraint. \\"Victims everywhere should know that their privacy will be respected when they come forward to reveal intimate details of sexual abuse. They participate in the criminal justice process in an effort to do the right thing and testify about their experiences; they should not have to worry about being publicly targeted when doing so,\\" said Baker's group and others said in a statement. John Giugliano, a clinical social worker and associate professor at Widener University, said victims of childhood sexual abuse can suffer anew when their names are publicized because the most humiliating episode of their lives is suddenly open to public inspection and judgment. Common symptoms of abuse -- depression, anxiety, substance abuse, difficulty connecting with others -- can flare up or become more severe, he said. Beth Docherty, who was 15 when her music teacher raped her, said she was grateful her name wasn't released. Even with the court's protection, though, a newspaper account contained just enough detail about her identity -- that she played flute -- that it became known within her school. She said the teacher's supporters sent her hate mail and broke her windows. Docherty, now 43 and president of the board of Pittsburgh Action Against Rape, sees parallels with the Sandusky case. Just as she was blamed for reporting her attacker, Docherty said, some Penn State fans have blamed the accusers for football coach Joe Paterno's firing last fall, just months before his death from cancer. \\"You've gone through this horrible thing, and you have people who don't know you blaming you, saying you caused this icon to be brought down. It stays with you. It affects you for a long time,\\" she said. \\"Having that identity kept from the public is a little bit of a comfort, so I feel for them. It's going to be really traumatic, and I give them a lot of credit to still go through with it and not crush and crumble under all the pressure.\\" If the victims' names do become public knowledge during trial, it probably won't be the result of reporting by the traditional media. \\"We have a firm and longstanding policy not to publish the names of victims of sexual crimes without their consent,\\" Lawrence Beaupre, executive editor of Times-Shamrock Communications, said in an email. The media conglomerate publishes The Times-Tribune in Scranton and several other newspapers and has sent a reporter to the trial. More than 80 media outlets have been credentialed to cover the trial, from broadcast networks and major newspapers to Internet portals, independent journalists and tiny online news operations, some of which told AP that they, too, plan to withhold the accusers' names. At the same time, the issue of whether to shield victims of sex crimes from exposure has launched countless newsroom arguments. Is it fair to the alleged perpetrators to allow accusers to remain anonymous, especially in cases where the charge has turned out to be false? Is such a policy inadvertently perpetuating the notion that victims of sexual abuse have something to be ashamed about? The Society of Professional Journalists' code of ethics does not include a blanket prohibition on using the names of sexual abuse victims; it merely advises news organizations to \\"be cautious\\" about identifying them. Kevin Z. Smith, SPJ's past president and chairman of its ethics committee, said it is his personal belief that media organizations should reconsider their stand against naming. \\"We shouldn't stigmatize victims of sexual assault,\\" he said. \\"I don't think as a society we do ourselves a favor by ostracizing these people, and I don't think the press does a helpful job by perpetuating that by saying, \`We are going to protect you.\\"' Even Giugliano, the social worker, said there can be a benefit to testifying in open court. Some victims find it liberating to confront their abuser, he said. \\"There can be a very positive effect through all of this, a release of shame, having their voice heard and their day in court, a feeling of being vindicated,\\" Giugliano said. \\"Those things can have a very positive, empowering effect.\\" But he said that decision should be left to the individual and his therapist. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"A trial is taking place where some young men are accusing a former football coach, Jerry Sandusky, of sexually abusing them when they were younger.

Albrecht Durer (/'dU@r@r, 'djU@r@r/; German: ['albRect 'dy:Ra]; 21 May 1471 - 6 April 1528) was a painter, printmaker and theorist of the German Renaissance. Born in Nuremberg, Durer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. His vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books. The woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. His well-known engravings include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium. Durer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, perspective and ideal proportions.  After reading the above, is \\"European 1498\\" the correct answer to the question \\"In what town and in what year was Durer born?\\"? Options:  --no  --yes","output":"--no The text states that Durer was born in Nuremberg in 1471, not \\"European 1498.\\" Durer is indeed a renowned European artist, and 1498 is a significant year as it's when he created the \\"Apocalypse\\" series of woodcuts, but these details don't pertain to the city and year of his birth. The information provided shows Durer's broad influence across Europe and the significant events and creations throughout his lifetime, from the start of his career in his twenties with high-quality woodcut prints to his collaborations with major Italian artists of his time. His prolific body of work includes various techniques such as engravings, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours, and books, with a preference for engraving in his latter years. His well-known engravings include pieces like \\"The Knight, Death, and the Devil\\" (1513), \\"Saint Jerome in his Study\\" (1514), and \\"Melencolia I\\" (1514). Durer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists made him an important figure in the Northern Renaissance. His theoretical treatises, which involve the principles of mathematics, perspective, and ideal proportions, also reinforce his significant contribution to the arts. Despite all his achievements, however, the correct answer remains that he was born in Nuremberg, Germany, in 1471. This underlines the importance of accuracy when referencing historical events and figures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Dam building prevents life-threatening situations.","output":"While the given paragraph does not specifically address the issue of dam building preventing life-threatening situations, it does emphasize the importance of tailoring dam construction to the unique requirements of each individual project, taking into consideration factors such as geophysical conditions, social uncertainty, management organizations, operational complexities, and logistics. These considerations can indirectly contribute to reducing or preventing life-threatening situations. However, to determine the truth of the statement \\"Dam building prevents life-threatening situations,\\" we must examine the broader context and objectives of dam construction and their potential impact on public safety and environmental conditions. Dams serve several vital purposes, including flood control, water supply, irrigation, hydroelectric power generation, and recreation. These functions can help mitigate natural disasters, such as floods, or contribute to more consistent water supply and energy production, which can improve living conditions for populations in surrounding areas. In this sense, dam building may indeed help prevent life-threatening situations resulting from water-related disasters or resource shortages. However, dams can also pose risks and create potentially life-threatening situations if not properly designed, constructed, and maintained. Structural failures, such as dam breaches, can lead to devastating downstream flooding, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. Additionally, dams can significantly impact river ecosystems and the people who rely on those ecosystems for their livelihoods, leading to potential societal and environmental repercussions. In conclusion, while it is not possible to definitively conclude that dam building universally prevents life-threatening situations based on the information provided in the paragraph, dam construction can contribute to mitigating certain risks when executed and managed appropriately. The level of public safety and environmental protection offered by a dam largely hinges on the careful consideration of factors mentioned in the paragraph and the implementation of robust engineering, management, and maintenance practices."},{"instruction":"Q:The answer to the question: Which types of boards have four holes where the binding threads were laced through? is inside the article: The boards of the covers, previously assumed to be limewood, are now thought to be birch, an unusual wood in later bindings, but one easily available in northern England.  Both have four holes where the binding threads were laced through; the two threads were run round the inner edges of the cover and knotted back at the holes.  The front cover has an additional 12 holes where the ends of the cords for the raised framing lines went through, at the four corners of the two main frames, and the ends of the horizontal bars between the interlace panels and the central vine motif.The stitching of the binding uses \\"Coptic sewing\\", that is \\"flexible unsupported sewing (produced by two needles and thread looping round one another in a figure-of-eight sewing pattern)\\"  Coptic sewing uses small threads both to attach the leaves together and, knotted together, to attach the pages to the cover boards. Normal Western binding uses thread for the former and thicker cord running across the spine of the book for the latter, with the thread knotted onto the cords.  Coptic sewing is also found in the earliest surviving leather bookbindings, which are from Coptic libraries in Egypt from the 7th and 8th centuries; in particular the design of the cover of one in the Morgan Library (MS M.569) has been compared to the St Cuthbert Gospel.  In the techniques used in the binding, apart from the raised decoration, the closest resemblance is to an even smaller Irish pocket gospel book from some 50 years later, the Cadmug Gospels at Fulda, which is believed to have belonged to Saint Boniface.  This is also in red goatskin, with coloured incised lines, and uses a similar unsupported or cordless stitching technique.  The first appearance of the cords or supports that these \\"unsupported\\" bindings lack is found in two other books at Fulda, and they soon became universal in, and characteristic of, Western bookbinding until the arrival of modern machine techniques.

Randy drew a simple diamond shape in the dirt to help Michael understand. \\"This is the baseball field,\\" he said. \\"There are four bases – first base, second base, third base, and home plate – where we run to when we hit the ball.\\" Randy showed Michael how to stand and hold the bat. \\"Bend your knees a little, and hold the bat like you're about to give it a great big hug,\\" Randy instructed. Michael followed along, trying to copy his friend's movements. Then, Randy taught Michael how to throw the ball. \\"Hold it with your fingers like this,\\" he said, demonstrating how to grip the ball. \\"Then, wind up your arm, and let it fly through the air like a soaring bird.\\" After practicing for a while, Randy and Michael were ready to play a simple game of baseball. They took turns being the batter and the pitcher, trying to hit the ball and catch it. They laughed as they ran around the bases, sometimes tripping over their own feet. As the sun began to set, Randy and Michael were both sweaty, giggly, and tired. But they had a wonderful time learning how to play baseball. Michael couldn't wait to play again soon. And so, Randy's love for baseball spread to his friend Michael. Now they shared a special bond as they played the game together, making memories and having lots of fun under the sun."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Annoying since it's finished jailbreaking...","output":"To describe the sentiment of the tweet, we need to break it down into its different components and analyze the emotions being expressed by the user. The tweet says, \\"Cydia's dying on me. Annoying since it's finished jailbreaking...\\" First, let's understand the context of the tweet. Cydia is a third-party app platform available for iPhones and other Apple devices that have been jailbroken, which means breaking the limitations set by the manufacturer by removing software restrictions imposed by Apple on iOS, thus allowing the user to install unofficial apps and tweaks. In this tweet, the user is expressing frustration regarding an issue they're having with Cydia. Now, let's look at the sentiment behind each part of the tweet: 1. \\"Cydia's dying on me\\": The user is experiencing some form of malfunction or instability with the Cydia app. The term \\"dying\\" often denotes a negative emotion, which in this context suggests that the user is not satisfied with the performance of the app. This statement portrays a negative sentiment. 2. \\"Annoying\\": The use of the word \\"annoying\\" directly shows that the user is experiencing irritation or frustration due to the problem they're facing with Cydia. This reveals that the user's sentiment is of discontent and dissatisfaction. 3. \\"since it's finished jailbreaking\\": This part of the tweet provides the context for the user's frustration. The user has already gone through the jailbreaking process, which presumably was successful, but now, they are being hindered by this issue with the Cydia app. This further emphasizes the negative sentiment of the tweet, where the user feels disappointment in not being able to continue with their desired tasks after completing the jailbreak. In summary, the overall sentiment of this tweet is predominantly negative. The user is expressing multiple emotions like frustration, dissatisfaction, irritation, and disappointment, all of which stem from the issues they are encountering with Cydia after completing the jailbreaking process. The user's experience, as portrayed in this tweet, is clearly not what they had expected or hoped for after jailbreaking their device."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Even before you put on your skates, put on all your safety gear . Step 2: Buckle up! Strap on your skates. Make sure they fit well and are snugly around your ankles. This helps your ankles stay strong and straight. Step 3: Fall down! You probably do not usually try to fall. But it is good to practice falling on skates. Fall forward onto your knee pads. Put out your hands and let your wrist guards hit the ground. See? Are you surprised that it doesn't hurt? Practice falling until it is easy to fall forward and get up again. If you are not afraid to fall, you will try new things. Knowing how to fall will help you be a better skater and find your balance. When you can stay balanced, you won't fall as much. Step 4: Stop! Make sure you can stop on your skates. The quickest and safest is probably the brake stop. The brake is usually on the back of the right skate. The brake stop: Roll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Let your right skate roll a little forward. Bend your knees as if you are sitting down. Then press your right heel down hard. This will make your brake pad drag on the ground until you stop. The T stop: Roll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Then turn your right foot out so the toes are pointing to your right. Drag your right skate. Let the wheels drag on the ground until you come to a stop. Another way to stop is to run or jump onto the grass. Step 5: Roll around! Find a flat, smooth place to practice. Do not skate in streets. Parks and playgrounds are good places to practice. Look for \\"No skating\\" signs to make sure you can skate there. In the step right after \\"Buckle up!\\" you should practice how to   _  . A) skate fast B) brake C) fall safely D) put on gear The answer is:","output":"C) fall safely After the \\"Buckle up!\\" step, it is crucial to practice how to fall safely. This helps you become familiar with falling in a controlled manner, which reduces the risk of injury when you inevitably fall while skating. By practicing falling forward onto your knee pads and allowing your wrist guards to hit the ground, you will build the muscle memory and confidence necessary to handle falls while skating.

Process: - An isotope has too many protons - The isotope is unstable - The isotope emits radiation - The isotope decays - The isotope loses some atomic particles - The isotope turns into a different element - The isotope is finished decaying and emitting radiation.  Question: suppose isotope has less protons happens, how will it affect isotope loses more atomic particles.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"B: less To understand this answer, we must first clarify some misconceptions mentioned in the question. Isotopes are varying forms of a particular element, and to be an isotope, these atoms must have the same number of protons. The only difference between isotopes is in the number of neutrons present in their nucleus. Due to this, an isotope can never have too many or too fewer protons, as suggested in the question. However, for the sake of the discussion, I will assume you meant an isotope with fewer neutrons. When an isotope has too few neutrons, it is considered neutron-deficient and will attempt to stabilize by increasing its neutron-to-proton ratio. In this case, the isotope can undergo beta-plus decay (or positron emission), which involves a proton changing into a neutron, emitting a positron and a neutrino in the process. Now, let's consider the question: Suppose an isotope has fewer neutrons; how will it affect losing more atomic particles? The answer is B: less, and here's why: 1. When an isotope is neutron-deficient, it will undergo beta-plus decay, as previously mentioned. In this process, the isotope only emits a positron and a neutrino, both of which have little effect on the remaining atomic particles. 2. As the neutron-deficient isotope stabilizes through beta-plus decay, it will reduce the number of protons present but increase the number of neutrons. This change can lead to a more stable nucleus, discouraging further decay and reducing the number of lost atomic particles overall. 3. The process of beta-plus decay involves fewer particles than other forms of radioactive decay, such as alpha or beta-minus decay. Alpha decay would result in the loss of 2 protons and 2 neutrons (as a helium nucleus), while beta-minus decay would involve an electron being emitted, though this doesn't remove atomic particles in the nucleus. In conclusion, if an isotope has fewer neutrons, it will be more likely to undergo beta-plus decay in an attempt to stabilize. This process will typically result in fewer atomic particles being lost compared to other decay processes, such as alpha or beta-minus decay. This makes option B: less the most suitable answer to the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.  - Reull Vallis is a valley on Mars that appears to have been carved by water . It runs westward into Hellas Planitia . It is named after the Gaelic word for planet .  - Astrology is the study of the movements and relative positions of celestial objects as a means for divining information about human affairs and terrestrial events. Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE, and has its roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications. Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and some  such as the Indians, Chinese, and Maya  developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. Western astrology, one of the oldest astrological systems still in use, can trace its roots to 19th-17th century BCE Mesopotamia, from which it spread to Ancient Greece, Rome, the Arab world and eventually Central and Western Europe. Contemporary Western astrology is often associated with systems of horoscopes that purport to explain aspects of a person's personality and predict significant events in their lives based on the positions of celestial objects; the majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.  - The Noachis quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Noachis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-27 (Mars Chart-27).  - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.  - The asteroid belt is the circumstellar disc in the Solar System located roughly between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The asteroid belt is also termed the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids. About half the mass of the belt is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. The total mass of the asteroid belt is approximately 4% that of the Moon, or 22% that of Pluto, and roughly twice that of Pluto's moon Charon (whose diameter is 1200 km).  - Hellas Planitia is a plain located within the huge, roughly circular impact basin Hellas located in the southern hemisphere of the planet Mars. Hellas is the third or fourth largest impact crater and the largest visible impact crater known in the Solar System. The basin floor is about deep, deeper than the Moon's South Pole-Aitken basin, and extends about east to west. It is centered at Hellas Planitia is in the Hellas quadrangle and the Noachis quadrangle.  - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.  - A terrestrial planet, telluric planet, or rocky planet is a planet that is composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals. Within the Solar System, the terrestrial planets are the inner planets closest to the Sun, i.e. Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The terms \\"terrestrial planet\\" and \\"telluric planet\\" are derived from Latin words for Earth (\\"Terra\\" and \\"Tellus\\"), as these planets are, in terms of composition, \\"Earth-like\\".  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion.  - An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere, formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. Although Meteor Crater is perhaps the best-known example of a small impact crater on Earth, impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins.  - The Hellas quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Hellas quadrangle is also referred to as MC-28 (Mars Chart-28). The Hellas quadrangle covers the area from 240° to 300° west longitude and 30° to 65° south latitude on the planet Mars. Within the Hellas quadrangle lies the classic features Hellas Planitia and Promethei Terra. Many interesting and mysterious features have been discovered in the Hellas quadrangle, including the giant river valleys Dao Vallis, Niger Vallis, Harmakhis, and Reull Vallisall of which may have contributed water to a lake in the Hellas basin in the distant past. Many places in the Hellas quadrangle show signs of ice in the ground, especially places with glacier-like flow features.  - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System.

It is a recollection of Paulo 's experiences as he made his way across northern Spain on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela . The novel serves as part adventure story , part guide to self - discovery .  - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.  - Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry. Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph.  - Santiago de Compostela, commonly known as Santiago, is the capital of the autonomous community of Galicia in northwestern Spain.  - A narrative or story is any report of connected events, real or imaginary, presented in a sequence of written or spoken words, and/or still or moving images.  - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla.  - Paulo Coelho de Souza (, , ; born August 24, 1947) is a Brazilian lyricist and novelist.

The Smashing Pumpkins (or Smashing Pumpkins) are an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois. Formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar), D'arcy Wretzky (bass), James Iha (guitar), and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums), the band has undergone many line-up changes. The current lineup features Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder. Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary songwriter; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \\"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\\".The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up. In 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles, compilation EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014.

Eric Garth Hudson (born August 2, 1937) is a Canadian multi-instrumentalist. As the organist, keyboardist and saxophonist for Canadian-American rock group the Band, he was a principal architect of the group's unique sound. Hudson has been called \\"the most brilliant organist in the rock world\\" by Keyboard magazine. As of 2018, Hudson and fellow musician Robbie Robertson are the last original members of The Band who are still alive. Under the strict supervision of Hawkins, the Hawks became an accomplished band. They split from Hawkins in 1963, recorded two singles and toured almost continually, playing in bars and clubs, usually billed as Levon and the Hawks. Hudson started work as a session musician in 1965, playing on John Hammond, Jr.'s So Many Roads along with Robertson (guitar) and Helm (drums).  In August 1965, they were introduced to Bob Dylan by manager Albert Grossman's assistant, Mary Martin. In October, Dylan and the Hawks recorded the single \\"Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?\\", and in January 1966 they recorded material with Dylan for what would turn into the Blonde on Blonde album. Dylan recruited the band to accompany him on his controversial 1966 \\"electric\\" tour of the United States, Australia and Europe. (An album of Dylan's 1966 performance with his band, The \\"Royal Albert Hall\\" Concert, was finally released in 1998.) Subsequent to Bob Dylan's motorcycle accident in July 1966, the group settled in a pink house in West Saugerties, New York, near Woodstock. Dylan was a frequent visitor, and Hudson's recordings of their collaborations resulted in The Basement Tapes.  By 1968, the group recorded its debut album, Music from Big Pink. The album was recorded in Los Angeles (at Capitol) and New York (at A&R Studio). Capitol originally announced that the group would be called the Crackers, but when Music From Big Pink was released they were officially named the Band. The album includes Hudson's organ showcase, \\"Chest Fever\\", a song that in the Band's live shows would be vastly expanded by a solo organ introduction, entitled \\"The Genetic Method\\", an improvisational work that would be played differently at each performance. An example can be heard on the live album Rock of Ages. Hudson is also adept at the accordion, which he played on some of the group's recordings, such as \\"Rockin Chair\\", from \\"The Band\\"; the traditional \\"Ain't No More Cane\\", from \\"The Basement Tapes\\"; Dylan's \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\"; and Bobby Charles's \\"Down South in New Orleans\\" during the Last Waltz. His saxophone solo work can be heard on such songs as \\"Tears of Rage\\" (from Big Pink) and \\"Unfaithful Servant\\" (from The Band). Hudson is credited with playing all of the brass and woodwinds on the studio version of \\"Ophelia\\", from the 1975 album Northern Lights - Southern Cross as well. This album, the first to be recorded in the Band's Shangri-La recording studio in Malibu, California, also saw Hudson adding synthesizers to his arsenal of instruments.  Hudson provided innovative accompaniment. For example, the song \\"Up on Cripple Creek\\" features Hudson playing a clavinet through a wah-wah pedal to create a swampy sound reminiscent of a Jew's harp or the croak of a frog. This clavinet-wah wah pedal configuration was later adopted by many funk musicians.  After years of continuous touring, the Band made its final bow as a touring band with a lavish final concert on Thanksgiving Day 1976 at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, an all-star tribute concert documented in The Last Waltz. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Any great singles by the band?","output":"Yes, there are great singles by the Band.

According to the Moscow Armistice, signed by Finland and the victorious Allies, mainly the Soviet Union, the Finns were to try those who were responsible for the war and those who had committed war crimes. The Soviet Union allowed Finland to try its own war criminals, unlike other losing countries of the Second World War. The Finnish parliament had to create ex post facto laws for the trials, though in the case of war crimes the country had already signed the Hague IV Convention. In victorious Allied countries war-crime trials were exceptional, but Finland had to arrange full-scale investigations and trials, and report them for the Soviet Union. Criminal charges were filed against 1,381 Finnish POW camp staff members, resulting in 723 convictions and 658 acquittals. They were accused of 42 murders and 342 other homicides. Nine persons were sentenced to life sentences, 17 to imprisonment for 10-15 years, 57 to imprisonment for five to ten years, and 447 to imprisonment varying from one month to five years.

Answer: In high level competitions, there are two preliminary routines, one which has only two moves scored for difficulty and one where the athlete is free to perform any routine.  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"In high-level competitions, the number of preliminary routines typically depends on the specific event and its organizing body. It may vary across different sports, disciplines, and competitive structures. For artistic gymnastics, for instance, high-level competitions like the Olympics or World Championships usually involve qualifications, team finals, and individual event finals. During qualifications, gymnasts perform routines on all apparatus to determine who will advance to the team and individual finals. Team finals then require athletes to perform routines to help their country achieve the highest total score. Finally, the top-scoring individuals move on to the individual event finals, where they compete for medals in each apparatus. For diving, high-level events like the Olympics or World Championships feature several rounds in the competitions, such as preliminaries, semi-finals, and finals. Divers perform multiple dives in each round, with their scores determining who progresses to the next stage. Swimming races at high-level competitions usually involve heats, semi-finals, and finals. The number of preliminary rounds depends on the number of swimmers competing and the specific event (such as the 50 meters freestyle or the 200 meters backstroke). In figure skating, athletes usually perform both a short program and a free skate in high-level competitions. Skaters are first ranked according to their scores in the short program, then perform the longer free skate, with both scores combined to determine the final placements.

One of my favorites is this: “you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink.” At the end of the day, if someone has a problem, they can never resolve it if they don’t truly wish to. You can give someone all the resources in the world, but you can’t force them to utilize them. When I was 16, I dated a horrible guy. He was abusive verbally, emotionally, and sexually. He was an incredibly troubled young man and refused to seek help for his severe mental health issues. I eventually came to understand that he reveled in his misery. It was his identity. He acted like he wanted a cure and I’d set him up with resources, but he refused every single one. He may have struggled with serious mental illnesses, but being miserable perversely made him happy and he loved to use his struggles to justify his inexcusable behavior. He wanted to drag as many people into his fiery pit of anguish as possible. I later suffered from severe depression myself, and I never once used it as an excuse to hurt other people. My ex wasn’t struggling with his mental health in terms of deliberating and carefully harming others. He was simply exhibiting a personality trait, one he chose to cultivate… and it wasn’t my problem. I ended up cutting him off completely in spite of all the threats.

But those who are early to bed and early to rise do not always have advantages, researchers say. They have found that night owls  are generally brighter and wealthier than those who are able to get up early in the morning. Experts from the University of Madrid carried out tests on around 1,000 teenagers and found that those who preferred to stay up late showed the kind of intelligence to find good jobs and earn much money. Larks or \\"morning people\\", however, often get better exam results, possibly because lessons are held at the wrong time of day for night owls. The researchers examined the habits and body clocks of the young people to determine whether they liked to stay up late and sleep later in the morning, or preferred to go to bed early and were at their best state in the morning. School performance and problem solving ability, were judged and test grades in the major subjects were also taken into consideration.

The room was decent, nice big bathroom with tub and shower, though I'm not quite sure why there was a window between the bathroom and entrance foyer...unless we got one of the Kinky Rooms or something, though I don't really get off on watching my fiancee on the toilet, so this whole window thing is still over my head.   We had a great view overlooking the entire pool area...and that is one big pool area...I think I counted six pools and a river....and a wonderful view of the mountains in the distance. everything looked beautiful lit up at night...one of the reasons I love coming to Vegas...a beautiful city of millions of lights plopped in the middle of the barren darkness of the Nevada desert.

The reviewer also expresses concerns that Johnson's approach of suggesting normative propositions should not be subjected to empirical scrutiny or scientific evaluation is flawed.

Process:  - Suns heat enters atmosphere - Green house gases enter from the earth - Heat is trapped in atmosphere - Different things on earth are hotter - The overall planet is hotter.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more gravity to pull happens, how will it affect Increased greenhouse gases.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The process described here involves the Earth's atmosphere and how the heat from the Sun and the presence of greenhouse gases lead to a warmer planet and climate change. To analyze the potential effects of the perturbation hypothesis, we must first break down each step of the process and then examine how increased gravity might impact the greenhouse effect and climate change. 1. Sun's heat enters the atmosphere: The heat from the Sun is primarily in the form of shortwave solar radiation, which penetrates the Earth's atmosphere. Some of the radiation is absorbed by the Earth's surface and atmosphere, while a portion is reflected back into space. 2. Greenhouse gases enter the atmosphere: Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and water vapor. They are naturally present in the Earth's atmosphere but have increased due to human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture. Greenhouse gases are responsible for trapping heat in the atmosphere by absorbing longwave infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface and then re-emitting it back toward the surface. 3. Heat is trapped in the atmosphere: The greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, trapping heat and preventing it from escaping back to space. This process is known as the greenhouse effect. 4. Different things on Earth are hotter: As the greenhouse effect intensifies, more heat is trapped in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to various consequences such as a rise in average global temperatures, more extreme weather events, and changes in climate patterns. 5. The overall planet is hotter: The outcome of the increased greenhouse effect is a warmer Earth, which leads to a wide range of impacts, including sea-level rise, melting glaciers and ice sheets, and damage to ecosystems and biodiversity. Now let us consider the perturbation hypothesis: an increase in gravity affecting the greenhouse gases and, consequently, the climate change process. While an increase in gravity could potentially have an indirect effect on the climate, it would not directly impact the greenhouse effect. Gravity affects atmospheric pressure, which impacts the circulation of air and weather patterns. If gravity were to increase, we might see changes in atmospheric circulation and weather phenomena, possibly affecting the spread and distribution of greenhouse gases. However, this would be a rather indirect effect on the greenhouse effect itself. An increase in gravity could also influence the planet's overall composition and structure, for example, by compressing the atmosphere or causing a change in the Earth's shape due to the increased gravitational force. These changes could, in turn, have an indirect impact on climate change by affecting factors such as atmospheric pressure, wind patterns, and ocean currents. Additionally, increased gravitational forces could impact the biosphere, affecting the productivity and decomposition of organic matter, which would alter greenhouse gas production and absorption rates. In summary, while the perturbation hypothesis of increased gravity may have potential indirect effects on climate change, it would not directly impact the greenhouse effect. Consequently, the primary process responsible for climate change, involving solar radiation and greenhouse gas emissions, would remain largely unaffected by this hypothetical increase in gravity. The most effective way to address climate change remains, therefore, focusing on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the development of sustainable and renewable energy sources."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If I tell you that Photosynthesis means green plants convert from carbon dioxide, water, and solar energy into carbohydrates for themselves, and ask you the question \\"which type of plants convert from carbon dioxide, water, and solar energy into carbohydrates?\\", is the correct answer \\"heterotrophs\\"? The answer is:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"heterotrophs.\\" The type of plants that convert carbon dioxide, water, and solar energy into carbohydrates through the process of photosynthesis are called \\"autotrophs\\" or more specifically, \\"photoautotrophs.\\" Autotrophs are organisms that have the ability to produce their own food using inorganic materials and an external energy source. There are two types of autotrophs: 1. Photoautotrophs: These organisms, which include green plants, algae, and certain bacteria, use light as their primary energy source and convert it into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis. During this process, carbon dioxide and water combine in the presence of sunlight, producing glucose (a simple carbohydrate) and oxygen. 2. Chemoautotrophs: These are organisms, mostly bacteria and archaea, that obtain their energy from chemical reactions with inorganic compounds like hydrogen sulfide or ammonia. They do not rely on sunlight for their energy needs. In contrast, heterotrophs are organisms that cannot produce their own food and must obtain their energy by consuming other organisms or organic materials. Animals, fungi, and some bacteria are examples of heterotrophs. They rely on the consumption of plants (autotrophs) or other heterotrophs for their energy and nutrient requirements. In summary, the correct answer to the question \\"which type of plants convert carbon dioxide, water, and solar energy into carbohydrates?\\" is \\"autotrophs,\\" specifically \\"photoautotrophs,\\" as they are the organisms that perform photosynthesis to produce carbohydrates from inorganic materials and sunlight."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The first, under the command of Phraya Chakri, had 50,000 troops to attack Tenasserim. The second unit, under the command of Phraya Phra Khlang, had 50,000 troops to capture Dawei. Dawei and Tenasserim were cities in Thailand during Sukhothai period, which the Burmese had captured. However, the Governor of Tenasserim learned of the Siamese plans and sent an urgent message to the King of Pagu, Nanda Bayin, who ordered an army to oppose the Siamese.:139-140 Tenasserim resisted the siege for 15 days while the siege of Dawei lasted 20 days, before the Siamese were successful in capturing both cities. Both consented to be subject to Ayutthaya as in the past.:140 After Phraya Chakri captured Tenasserim city, he captured Mergui and the boats in the port, which included 3 foreign sloops and 150 other boats. He then sent Phraya Thep Archun by sea to Tavoy so as to assist Phraya Phra Khlang if the Burmese advanced that far. Phraya Chakri then marched with a force of 30,000 to Tavoy by land, leaving a garrison of 10,000 at Tenasserim under Phraya Sri Sainarong. Simultaneously, Phraya Phra Khlang sent 100 boats and 5,000 men under Phraya Phichai Songkhram and Phraya Ram Khamhaeng to assist Phraya Chakri.:141 The Burmese had sent 200 boats and 10,000 men under the command of Samin Ubkong and Samin Phataba. This Burmese flotilla was caught in the middle of the Siamese flotillas advancing from the north and south. Many Burmese boats were sunk, some beached their boats and fled, while the rest sailed away. Saming Ubakong was killed and 500 men were captured.:141-142 Did Phraya Phra Khlang send more boats or more men?","output":"Phraya Phra Khlang sent more men than boats. In this instance, Phraya Phra Khlang sent 100 boats and 5,000 men, so the number of men is bigger.

She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - In opera or commedia dell'arte, a prima donna (plural: \\"prime donne\\"; Italian for \\"first lady\\") is the leading female singer in the company, the person to whom the prime roles would be given. The prima donna was normally, but not necessarily, a soprano. The corresponding term for the male lead (almost always a tenor) is primo uomo.  - Elisabeth Olin née Lillström ( December 1740 -- 26 March 1828 ) , was a Swedish opera singer and a music composer . She performed the leading female role in the inauguration performance of the Royal Swedish Opera in 1773 , and is referred to as the first Swedish Opera prima donna . She was the first female to be made Hovsångare ( 1773 ) , and the first woman to become a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music ( 1782 ) .  - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor.  - Tenor is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range is one of the highest of the male voice types. The tenor's vocal range (in choral music) lies between C, the C one octave below middle C, and A, the A above middle C. In solo work, this range extends up to C, or \\"tenor high C\\". The low extreme for tenors is roughly A (two As below middle C). At the highest extreme, some tenors can sing up to two Fs above middle C (F). The tenor voice type is generally divided into the \\"leggero\\" tenor, lyric tenor, spinto tenor, dramatic tenor, heldentenor, and tenor buffo or spieltenor.  - An orchestra is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which features string instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass, as well as brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments, grouped in sections. Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, electronic instruments.  - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody.  The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice.

She carried him wrapped in a sweatshirt from the shelter at the corner where she'd been saying for months she was going to go. She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath. Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man. Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else.

Write some highlights for the following article: Water can be made to appear to flow in a remarkable corkscrew shaped stream by means of a simple experiment involving the right frequency of bass and a video camera with an adjustable frame rate. A mesmerising YouTube video shows how one amateur scientist made the flow appear to stay still then, by adjusting bass frequency, rotate in both directions. The video, uploaded along with a how-to guide by user brusspup on Monday, has already gone viral - attracting nearly 500,000 views and nearly 18,000 'thumbs up'. Corkscrew: Water can be made to appear to flow in a remarkable corkscrew shaped stream by means of a simple experiment involving the right frequency of bass and a video camera with an adjustable frame rate. Brusspup said on the video-sharing site: 'This is a really fun project and when you first see the results, chances are your jaw will drop.' The effect cannot be seen with the naked eye, so anyone who wants to try it at home will have to first get their hands on a camera capable of shooting at exactly 24 frames per second. To recreate the effect, the first thing you will need to do is get hold of an amplifier and a speaker with a frequency response low enough to reach 23hz - a very low bass sound. Connect the speaker to a computer running tone generating software - many such programs are available as open-source freeware - and tune it down to 24hz. Take a soft rubber hose and connect that to your tap, then run it down past the speaker, across the cone, so that one or two inches hang past the bottom of the case, and tape it securely into place. Optical illusion: The effect cannot be seen with the naked eye, so anyone who wants to try it at home will have to first get their hands on a camera capable of shooting at exactly 24 frames per second. 'The goal is to make sure the hose is touching the actual speaker so that when the speaker produces sound (vibrates) it will vibrate the hose,' brusspup explains. Point the camera at the end of the hose, turn on your tap, press play on your tone generator and, as brusspup puts it: 'Watch the magic begin'. The effect can be changed by altering the frequency of the tone. Set it to 23hz and it will look like it's moving backwards. Set it to 25hz and the stream will appear as though its moving forward in slow motion. Variable: The effect can be changed by altering the frequency of the tone. Set it to 23hz and it will look like it's moving backwards. Set it to 25hz and the stream will appear as though its moving forward in slow motion. One of the top rated comments on the video's YouTube page explains how it works. User necraduq explains: 'When the frequency of the speaker is the same with the frequency of the video frames (frames/sec) the camera actually captures the same frame everytime and thus the same water shape. 'You can see the change 1hz makes when filming (if filming is kept at the same rate 24fps) as this translates into a \\"forward movement\\". 'Imagine a clock with only a seconds indicator.

Hypothesis: A woman sweeps the sidewalk with a red broom. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"If we rely solely on the information provided in the premise, we cannot definitively confirm the hypothesis is true. To elaborate, the premise outlines three crucial details: first, the character involved is a middle-aged woman; second, the action she's undertaking is sweeping a sidewalk; and finally, the location of this scene is in front of a retail shop in a city. These facets match the hypothesis, which likewise mentions a woman sweeping. However, the hypothesis denotes an extra detail that is not mentioned nor implied in any way by the premise: that she uses a red broom. An assumption is made in the hypothesis where the color of the broom is concerned. The premise doesn't offer any detail or hint concerning the color of the broom. It simply states that the woman is sweeping, without further elaborating on the specific aspects, characteristics, or type of her sweeping tools. Thus, while it is possible that the broom she uses might be red, we can't conclude it outright. Hence, the truth of the hypothesis is contingent upon a piece of information — the color of the broom — that the initial premise doesn't provide. We can surmise that the woman is sweeping due to the premise, but we have no factual basis in the premise to definitively confirm that she's using a red broom. Consequently, unless additional evidence or context is presented that specifically demonstrates the broom being red, the hypothesis cannot be conclusively validated from the premise alone.  In the study of logic, it's critical to differentiate what is explicitly stated (and hence can be inferred directly) vs. what is merely implied or possible. In this case, the color of the broom is not specified in the premise, so to infer its color would involve a degree of assumption or conjecture, which are not valid foundations for logical inferences. Thus, from a strictly logical point of view, the premise as it is does not lead us to conclude the hypothesis is true. Potentially, with more information, we might prove it true or false definitively, yet based on what we currently know, the hypothesis is just that - a hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(iv). Then wipe around the cat's eyes. Be sure to thoroughly dry the area after wiping. Answer:","output":"(i). Gently wipe the area and dry it with the paper towel. Carefully clean inside the eye area and outside of the eye area. (iv). Then wipe around the cat's eyes. Be sure to thoroughly dry the area after wiping. Explanation: Option (i) and (iv) are correct because they describe the proper way to clean an exotic shorthair cat's eye area. Gently wiping the area, cleaning it, and ensuring the area is dry afterward is crucial for the cat's health and comfort. Option (ii) is incorrect because it is not focused on cleaning the eye area, and it mentions the unrelated act of giving a cat a bath. Option (iii) is incorrect because it suggests using a cotton ball, which may leave fibers in the eye area and cause irritation. Additionally, it mentions the possibility of bleeding, which is not related to the task of cleaning the eye area."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Nebraska is a state that lies in both the Great Plains and the Midwestern United States. The state is bordered by South Dakota to the north, Iowa to the east and Missouri to the southeast, both across the Missouri River, Kansas to the south, Colorado to the southwest and Wyoming to the west. Its area is just over 77,220 sq mi (200,000 km) with almost 1.9 million people. Its state capital is Lincoln. Its largest city is Omaha, which is on the Missouri River.  - A tributary or affluent is a stream or river that flows into a larger stream or main stem (or parent) river or a lake. A tributary does not flow directly into a sea or ocean. Tributaries and the main stem river drain the surrounding drainage basin of its surface water and groundwater, leading the water out into an ocean.  - The Platte River is a major river in the state of Nebraska and is about long. Measured to its farthest source via its tributary the North Platte River, it flows for over . The Platte River is a tributary of the Missouri River, which itself is a tributary of the Mississippi River which flows to the Gulf of Mexico. The Platte over most of its length is a muddy, broad, shallow, meandering stream with a swampy bottom and many islandsa braided stream. These characteristics made it too difficult for canoe travel, and it was never used as a major navigation route by European-American trappers or explorers.  - Papillion Creek is a 15.5 - mile - long ( 24.9 km ) tributary of the Missouri River in Nebraska . Its watershed lies in Washington , Douglas and Sarpy counties , including parts of the city of Omaha . The main branch of Papillion Creek is known as Big Papillion Creek . Some of the tributaries include Little Papillion Creek , Thomas Creek , Cole Creek , Northwest Branch of West Papillion Creek , West Papillion Creek and South Papillion Creek . Papillion Creek empties into the Missouri River south of Bellevue and just north of the mouth of the Platte River . Locals often refer to the creek as the \`\` Papio Creek '' . Within its watershed lie Glenn Cunningham Lake , Standing Bear Lake , Zorinsky Lake and Wehrspann Lake at the Chalco Hills Recreation Area , which were created by the Army Corps of Engineers in the aftermath of extensive flooding in 1964 and 1965 .  - Groundwater (or ground water) is the water present beneath Earth's surface in soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations. A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water. The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table. Groundwater is recharged from, and eventually flows to, the surface naturally; natural discharge often occurs at springs and seeps, and can form oases or wetlands. Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, also called groundwater hydrology.  - The Gulf of Mexico is an ocean basin largely surrounded by the North American continent. It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States, on the southwest and south by Mexico, and on the southeast by Cuba. The U.S. states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas border the Gulf on the north, which are often referred to as the \\"Third Coast\\" in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or sometimes the \\"south coast\\", in juxtaposition to the Great Lakes region being the \\"north coast.\\" One of the gulf's seven main areas is the Gulf of Mexico basin.  - \\"Main Stem\\" is 1942 instrumental by Duke Ellington and His Famous Orchestra. Although recorded in 1942, the single would not be released until 1944 where it was Duke Ellington's last of four number one's on the Harlem Hit Parade. \\"Main Stem\\" also peaked at number twenty on the pop chart.  - Montana is a state in the Western region of the United States. The state's name is derived from the Spanish word (mountain). Montana has several nicknames, although none official, including \\"Big Sky Country\\" and \\"The Treasure State\\", and slogans that include \\"Land of the Shining Mountains\\" and more recently \\"The Last Best Place\\". Montana has a border with three Canadian provinces: British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, the only state to do so. It also borders North Dakota and South Dakota to the east, Wyoming to the south, and Idaho to the west and southwest. Montana is ranked 4th in size, but 44th in population and 48th in population density of the 50 United States. The western third of Montana contains numerous mountain ranges. Smaller island ranges are found throughout the state. In total, 77 named ranges are part of the Rocky Mountains. The eastern half of Montana is characterized by western prairie terrain and badlands.  - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel.  - The Midwestern United States, also referred to as the American Midwest or simply the Midwest, is one of the four geographic regions defined by the United States Census Bureau, occupying the northern central part of the United States of America. It was officially named the North Central region by the Census Bureau until 1984.  - The Great Plains is the broad expanse of flat land (a plain), much of it covered in prairie, steppe and grassland, that lies west of the Mississippi River tallgrass prairie states and east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada. This area covers parts, but not all, of the states of Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming, Minnesota, Iowa and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The region is known for supporting extensive cattle ranching and dry farming.  - The North Platte River is a major tributary of the Platte River and is approximately long counting its many curves. It travels about distance. Its course lies in the U.S. states of Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska.  - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - A lake is an area of variable size filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams.  - The Missouri River is the longest river in North America. Rising in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana, the Missouri flows east and south for before entering the Mississippi River north of St. Louis, Missouri. The river takes drainage from a sparsely populated, semi-arid watershed of more than half a million square miles (1,300,000 km), which includes parts of ten U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. When combined with the lower Mississippi River, it forms the world's fourth longest river system.  - South Dakota is a state located in the Midwestern region of the United States. It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes, who compose a significant portion of the population and historically dominated the entire territory. South Dakota is the 17th most expansive, but the 5th least populous and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Once the southern portion of the Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota. Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 171,000, is South Dakota's largest city.  - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.  - Colorado is a state in the United States encompassing most of the Southern Rocky Mountains as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western edge of the Great Plains. Colorado is part of the Western United States, the Southwestern United States, and the Mountain States. Colorado is the 8th most extensive and the 22nd most populous of the 50 United States. The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Colorado was 5,456,574 on July 1, 2015, an increase of 8.50% since the 2010 United States Census.  - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west.  - Kansas is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita. Kansas is named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area. The tribe's name (natively \\"\\") is often said to mean \\"people of the wind\\" or \\"people of the south wind\\", although this was probably not the term's original meaning. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison.  - A stream is a body of water with a current, confined within a bed and banks. Depending on its location or certain characteristics, a stream may be referred to as a \\"bayou\\", \\"beck\\", \\"branch\\", \\"brook\\", \\"burn\\", \\"creek\\", \\"crick\\", \\"ghyll\\", \\"gill\\", \\"kill\\", \\"lick\\", \\"mill race\\", \\"race\\", \\"rill\\", \\"river\\", \\"rivulet\\", \\"run\\", \\"runnel\\", \\"streamage\\", \\"syke\\", or \\"wash\\".  - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River.  - Wyoming is a state in the mountain region of the western United States. The state is the tenth largest by area, the least populous and the second least densely populated state in the country. Wyoming is bordered on the north by Montana, on the east by South Dakota and Nebraska, on the south by Colorado, on the southwest by Utah, and on the west by Idaho. Cheyenne is the capital and the most populous city in Wyoming, with a population estimate of 63,335 in 2015. The state population was estimated at 586,107 in 2015, which is less than the population of 31 of the largest U.S. cities.

Here is a news article: Willie Louis, key witness in 1955 Emmett Till murder case, dies at 76 BY BECKY SCHLIKERMAN Staff Reporter bschlikerman@suntimes.com      Willie Louis was a witness for the prosecution in the Emmett Till case. He was known as Wiile Reed at the time of the trial. | University of Memphis Library photo      storyidforme: 52522121      tmspicid: 19460776      fileheaderid: 8848570      Article Extras            Updated:      Willie Louis heard Emmett Till scream as he was viciously beaten in 1955.      And Mr. Louis bravely testified in court against two white men — telling the jury of the “hollering” and “licks” he heard — despite the danger his testimony posed in the segregated South.      Mr. Louis, who went by the name Willie Reed before moving to Chicago after the historic trial in Mississippi, died July 18 at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, his wife said. Mr. Louis, a longtime Englewood resident, was 76.      “What stood out, and what stands out to me about Willie the most, is his courage,” said Emmett Till’s cousin, the Rev. Wheeler Parker, 74, who had traveled to Mississippi with Emmett Till. “He was nothing but a godsend.”      Mike Small, a teacher who has studied the landmark case, called Mr. Louis “one of the unsung civil rights heroes in Chicago.”      Emmett Till was 14 years old when he was murdered after whistling at a white woman outside a grocery store in Mississippi.      The youth was kidnapped and taken to a tool shed.      It was near there that Mr. Louis, then 18, saw the boy in a truck with several other men. Mr. Louis also heard a beating coming from inside that tool shed. The truck had also been parked in front of the shed.      In an interview with “60 Minutes” nearly a decade ago, Mr. Louis said, “I heard the screaming, beating, the screaming and beating.”      Mr. Louis was also approached by one of the accused killers, J.W. Milam, who carried with him a pistol, and asked if he’d heard anything. Mr. Louis told him he hadn’t seen anything, he told “60 Minutes.”      But Mr. Louis couldn’t keep secret what he saw, becoming a key witness in the trial. Despite his testimony, the all-white jury acquitted Milam and co-defendant Roy Bryant. The murder and acquittal were among the sparks that ignited the civil rights movement.      “I couldn’t have walked away from that like that because Emmett was 14, probably never been to Mississippi in his life and had come to visit his grandfather, and they killed him. That’s not right,” he said in the interview.      The trial took a toll on Mr. Louis. The Greenwood. Miss., native was whisked away after the trial and came to Chicago where he suffered a nervous breakdown, his wife, Juliet Louis, 68, said. Mr. Louis also changed his name to find anonymity.      Mr. Louis worked at Jackson Park Hospital as a surgical orderly for nearly 50 years. That’s where he met his wife.      The pair were working in the intensive care unit at the hospital and Mr. Louis sweet-talked the nurse’s aide.      “He said ‘Hey there. Why don’t you come over here and give me a kiss?’” Juliet Louis said. “I went over there and kissed him on his jaw.”      The couple married in 1976. It was nearly eight years later that Juliet Louis found out about her husband’s involvement in the Emmett Till case.      “He never really got over that,” Juliet Louis said. That was something that really bothered him, and he was keeping it in him.”      In addition to his wife, Mr. Louis is survived by his step-son, Sollie McKinnon; seven grandchildren and 21 great-grandchildren.      Services will be held from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Wednesday at New Commandment Church of God in Christ, 1742 W. 63rd St. ||||| Willie Louis was a witness to the murder of Emmett Till, testifying in court on a case that opened the nation's eyes to the dangerous discrimination facing African-Americans in the 1950s.      After the trial, fearing for his life in the South, he fled to Chicago, changed his name and slipped out of the public eye for nearly 50 years.      \\"He was an unsung civil rights hero,\\" said Mike Small, a friend and history teacher who has studied the Till case.      Mr. Louis, 76, died of intestinal bleeding Thursday, July 18, at Advocate Christ Hospital in Oak Lawn, a relative said. He was a resident of Chicago.      Mr. Louis was born in Greenwood, Miss., where he lived with his grandparents, who worked as sharecroppers, said his wife, Juliet.      On Aug. 28, 1955, Till, 14, visiting Mississippi from Chicago, was murdered after he allegedly whistled at a white woman. On that day, Mr. Louis, then known as Willie Reed, noticed two white men driving a truck into a barn with two black males in the back.      He was standing with an older woman near a well when he heard a male screaming for his life inside the barn, his wife said.      \\"He heard all this hollering and screaming until there was no more hollering and screaming,\\" she said.      Later that day, a white man approached Mr. Louis with a gun, Juliet Louis said. \\"He said, 'Boy, did you see anything?' And he said 'no.' He said, 'Did you hear anything?' He said 'no.'\\"      The next morning he found out that Till's body had been dumped in the Tallahatchie River.      His grandfather told him he shouldn't bother telling anyone because it was too dangerous to accuse a white man of murder, but a few days later civil rights leaders asked him about what he may have seen, according to his wife.      \\"He said he couldn't have lived with it; he had to tell them what he saw,\\" she said.      He agreed to testify in court, and a local black doctor hid him until the trial started later that year. Despite his testimony, the two white men accused of the murder were acquitted by an all-white jury.      After the trial, Mr. Louis got on a train to Chicago, where he changed his name. The psychological stress of witnessing a murder and testifying in court took a toll, causing him to suffer a nervous breakdown that landed him in a hospital, his wife said.      Till's family lost touch with Mr. Louis soon after the trial, according to Till's relative Wheeler Parker, 74.      \\"We thought something had happened to him,\\" he said. \\"We thought someone killed him.\\"      In the late 1950s, Mr. Louis became an orderly at Woodlawn Hospital in Chicago and later at Jackson Park Hospital. He worked at Jackson Park until he retired in 2006, his wife said.      The couple met at Jackson Park in 1971. She was working as a nursing aide in the intensive care unit when Mr. Louis came to pick up patient.      The couple married in 1976, but it would be another eight years before Juliet Louis ever found out her husband was a witness in the Till case, she said. Even after she found out, \\"he didn't talk about it much.\\"      That changed when a journalist, Stanley Nelson, came to Mr. Louis' home in Englewood asking him to participate in his research project about the murder.      \\"Stanley started having him bring back memories,\\" his wife said. \\"It opened up a wound.\\"      Nelson's research turned into a book and a documentary, which eventually aired on PBS. Nelson introduced Mr. Louis to Till's mother. Soon after, Mr. Louis began talking about what he witnessed publicly on television and community events.      Those close to him hope his legacy will last beyond his death.      \\"I think his story needs to be told over and over again,\\" Parker said. \\"He's a great role model in doing what's right.\\"      Mr. Louis is also survived by a son, Sollie McKinnon.      A visitation is set for 6 to 8 p.m. Wednesday at New Commandment Church of God in Christ, 1742 W. 63rd St., Chicago.      nnix@tribune.com      Twitter:@nsnix87 ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Willie Louis was a brave man who heard Emmett Till, a 14-year-old boy, scream when he was being hurt in 1955. Emmett was hurt because he whistled at a white woman in a time when people of different colors were not treated the same.

Both amplitude and wavelength are measures of wave size. The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast, over how great a distance, and how long the wind blows. The greater each of these factors is, the bigger a wave will be. Some of the biggest waves occur with hurricanes. A hurricane is a storm that forms over the ocean. Its winds may blow more than 150 miles per hour! The winds also travel over long distances and may last for many days.  Question: \\"What is the opposite of the crest of the wave?\\" Response: \\"Trough\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct.

The atmosphere is great-fun and hip-good service throughout-loved the cocktails, salad, and bread-but did not like the entree or side at all. Ordered sea bass at 42, and what arrived was a piece of sea bass on a plate with the skin and tail attached which was very off putting. Very little decoration or pizzaz on the plate-and why would any chef think people would want to see the carcass of their dinner? Does a steak arrive with hooves attached? Does chicken come with a beak attached? The side of mushrooms was very salty, and there were odd textures in the mix of mushrooms that just weren't appealing. Should have gone with fingerling potatoes. Credit for accomodating a vegetarian with an entree, but was charged the same price as a full meat entree for a plate of vegetables-and appeared on the bill as chicken breast-should have an appropriate charge for a vegetarian entree. The steak is probably great-but as a seldom steak eater, probably will never find out. Is this review positive or negative? A). negative; B). positive; Answer:","output":"A). negative; This review is negative because, while the reviewer did enjoy certain aspects of the restaurant like the atmosphere, cocktails, salad, and bread, they expressed dissatisfaction with the entree, side dish, and pricing for the vegetarian option. This collection of concerns and complaints outweighs the positive aspects mentioned, leading to a primarily negative review."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If you are a man in my geographical area, odds are you did. The first week I joined I received over 400 likes and nothing speaks desperation like that, does it? If I want to hook up and leave, there’s no better place to go. If you’re going to Tinder looking for a real connection, then sorry — you’ve lost your damn mind. Tinder was created with the hit and quit it hookup in mind and trust me no matter what he puts in his profile, that’s what he’s looking for. Crap, that’s what I was looking for let’s be honest. Here are some universal truths about Tinder and most online dating sites. If the picture looks too good to be true, it probably is. People lie. A large majority are going to be married pretending to be single. They have a handful of others on the hook while they’re talking to you. The usual way it goes on Tinder is you like someone’s picture and if they like you back, you’re a match. Then you can message each other and often you will get one or two messages and that’s it unless you come out strong on the sexting and I guarantee you get your man. Tinder is oozing with low attention spans. I can pretty much guarantee he is going to ask for pictures, and not of your face. According to the above context, answer the following question.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: What else besides temperature has an effect on the phase of a substance?   A:","output":"A: In addition to temperature, a variety of factors can influence the phase of a substance. Some of the most significant factors include pressure, composition, and external forces. Here's a deeper look into each of these factors and how they affect a substance's phase: 1. Pressure: Pressure plays a crucial role in determining the phase of a substance. Increasing the pressure on a substance often results in a transition from the gaseous phase to the liquid phase or from the liquid phase to the solid phase. This effect can be explained by the fact that molecules in a substance are attracted to each other, and when the pressure increases, the intermolecular forces become stronger. This causes the molecules to come closer together, resulting in a more condensed phase like liquid or solid. On the other hand, decreasing the pressure often leads to a transition from the solid phase to the liquid phase or from the liquid phase to the gaseous phase. One notable example of pressure influencing the phase of a substance is the behavior of carbon dioxide. Under normal atmospheric pressure, carbon dioxide sublimates, meaning it transitions directly from a solid state (dry ice) to a gaseous state, without passing through the liquid phase. However, when the pressure is increased significantly (above 5.11 atmospheres), carbon dioxide can exist in a liquid state. 2. Composition: For mixtures or solutions, the composition of a substance, also known as its concentration, can have a significant impact on its phase. The presence of impurities, solutes, or other compounds can change the melting and boiling points of a substance by disrupting the intermolecular forces between the molecules, leading to phase transitions at different temperatures than for the pure substance. For example, adding salt to ice lowers its melting point, which is why road salts are often used to melt ice on the roads during winter. Similarly, dissolving a solute in a liquid can elevate its boiling point, as seen when adding salt to water. Interactions between different components in a mixture can also cause substances to form distinct phases, such as the separation of oil and water. 3. External Forces: The phase of a substance can also be influenced by external forces like magnetic or electric fields, radiation, and mechanical forces. For instance, applying a strong magnetic field can cause a substance to exhibit a change in its internal structure or behavior, while exposure to radiation (e.g., microwaves) can increase the molecular motion within a substance, causing it to heat up and potentially change phase. In some cases, mechanical stress or shear forces can induce phase transitions. For example, when kneading dough, the mechanical stress causes the proteins in the dough to rearrange and form gluten, giving the dough its characteristic elasticity. In summary, the phase of a substance is not solely determined by its temperature. Factors like pressure, composition, and external forces can all influence the phase behavior of a material. Understanding these factors and how they interact is vital for predicting and controlling phase transitions in various applications and industries, such as pharmaceuticals, food processing, and materials science."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Information:  - \\"Hands Clean\\" is a song recorded by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, for her fifth studio album, \\"Under Rug Swept,\\" which she released in 2002. It was written, composed, and produced by Morissette herself, and released as the album's lead single on 8 February 2002. It is a pop rock song, featuring a shuffling, largely acoustic-rock framework. Lyrically, \\"Hands Clean\\" caused controversy, since it is reportedly the singers recollection of a forbidden sexual relationship she shared with a much older man when she was approximately 14 years of age.  - Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the Western world as a softer alternative to rock and roll. The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other.  - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - Alanis Nadine Morissette (born June 1, 1974) is a Canadian-American alternative rock singer-songwriter, musician, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, and actress. Morissette began her career in Canada in the early 1990s, with two commercially successful dance-pop albums. Afterwards, she moved to Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, and in 1995 released \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", a more rock-oriented album which sold more than 33 million units globally and is her most critically acclaimed work. Her following album, \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\", was released in 1998.  - \\"Precious Illusions\\" is a song written, recorded and produced by Alanis Morissette, for her fifth album \\"Under Rug Swept\\" (2002). It released as the album's second and final international single on 5 August 2002. Its lyrics describe a conflict between idealism and realism, and its protagonist refers to her childhood fancies as \\"precious illusions\\" that she has distanced herself from with a feeling that reminds her of \\"parting with an imaginary friend\\".  - Dance-pop is a pop and dance subgenre that originated in the early 1980s. It is generally up-tempo music intended for nightclubs with the intention of being danceable but also suitable for contemporary hit radio. Developing from a combination of electronic dance music and pop music, with influences of disco music, post-disco, new wave, synthpop, electropop and house, it is generally characterised by strong beats with easy, uncomplicated song structures which are generally more similar to pop music than the more free-form dance genre, with an emphasis on melody as well as catchy tunes. The genre, on the whole, tends to be producer-driven, despite some notable exceptions.  - Pop rock is rock music with a lighter, smoother approach that is more reminiscent of commercial pop music. Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo wop), but placed a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music.  - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.  - Under Rug Swept is the fifth studio album and third internationally released album by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette. Released by Maverick Records in the United States on February 26, 2002 and in the United Kingdom a day earlier (see 2002 in music), it was the first album Morissette had written and produced all on her own. It debuted at number one on charts in 12 countries, including the United States and Canada, and produced the singles \\"Hands Clean\\" and \\"Precious Illusions\\". Sales, however, did not match those of Morissette's previous two studio albums.  - Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is the fourth studio album and second internationally released album by singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released by Maverick Records in the United States on November 3, 1998.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands.

It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - \`\` Utopia '' is a pop rock song written by Alanis Morissette , and produced by her for her fifth album , Under Rug Swept ( 2002 ) .  - Jagged Little Pill is the third studio album and international debut album by Canadian singer Alanis Morissette, first released on June 13, 1995, through Maverick Records. Morissette had released two successful albums in Canada, after which she left MCA Records Canada and was introduced to manager Scott Welch.

Today, we are going to talk about some amazing people who dance beautifully and a big question about classical music. Are you ready? Let's go! First, let's talk about Margot Fonteyn. She was a super-duper famous dancer in the 1900s. People loved to watch her dance because she was so graceful and elegant, like a swan gliding on a lake. She was so fantastic at dancing that many people think of her as the most iconic dancer of the 20th century. Iconic means she was so good that everyone remembers her as the best. Now, let's meet Ken Swift and Suzanne Farrell. Just like Margot, they are also very famous dancers, and they are as amazing as her. Ken could spin on his head and do cool tricks! He was a master of a type of dance called breakdancing, which is very energetic and exciting. Kids like us enjoy it a lot! Suzanne was another excellent dancer who could spin around and make beautiful shapes with her body. She could stretch her legs and point her toes like no one else. People loved watching her dance too!  These three dancers, Margot Fonteyn, Ken Swift, and Suzanne Farrell, were so wonderful that they were voted as some of the top dancers of their time. Imagine how awesome it would be to see them dance together! Now let's talk about the big question coming up in February. People want to know who we think is the greatest classical composer. A composer is someone who writes music for other people to play, and classical music is a special kind of music that has been around for a very long time. Some of these composers wrote music for orchestras to play, and it can sometimes sound fancy and beautiful. In February, we are going to have a big vote to see who is the best classical composer out there, just like we did with the dancers. It's like choosing the yummiest ice cream flavor or the funniest cartoon. But, instead of ice cream or cartoons, we're picking our favorite person who writes classical music. And that's it for today, little friends! I hope you enjoyed learning about Margot Fonteyn, Ken Swift, and Suzanne Farrell, and don't forget to think about who your favorite classical composer is. It's going to be so much fun finding out who will be voted the greatest, and maybe you'll discover a new favorite along the way!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is some data: 1. FC Köln, manager, Peter Stöger; Peter Stöger, club, LASK Linz. Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"The data provided offers valuable information about two football clubs and their connections with the Austrian football manager, Peter Stöger. In this description, we will delve into the associations between Stöger and the clubs FC Köln (Germany) and LASK Linz (Austria). Firstly, FC Köln - also known as 1. FC Köln - is a German professional football club based in Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia. This club has a rich history and tradition, having been founded in 1948 as a merger of two local clubs, Kölner BC 01 and SpVgg Sülz 07. They have played in the Bundesliga, Germany's top division, on numerous occasions. Throughout their history, FC Köln has achieved impressive accomplishments, such as winning the Bundesliga title, the German Cup, and reaching the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup. The data suggests that during a period in their history, Peter Stöger was appointed as the manager of FC Köln. Peter Stöger is an Austrian football manager and former professional player who was born on April 11, 1966, in Vienna, Austria. During his playing career, Stöger earned several caps for the Austrian national team and played as a midfielder. He transitioned to becoming a football manager when his playing days were over, coaching several clubs in both Austria and Germany. According to the data, Stöger's tenure as FC Köln's manager had a significant impact on the team. Under his guidance, the club experienced a resurgence and improved performance, likely instilling an organized and disciplined approach to their tactics and playing style, typical of Stöger's management philosophy. His time at FC Köln would certainly contribute to his reputation as a well-regarded and resourceful football manager. The second part of the data revolves around Peter Stöger's association with another football club - LASK Linz. LASK Linz is an Austrian professional football club based in Linz, the capital of Upper Austria. The club was founded in 1908 and has a rich history as well, being one of Austria's most successful clubs, having won the Austrian Bundesliga title and the Austrian Cup multiple times. LASK Linz is known for producing talented players and has been a strong competitor in Austrian football for many years. Peter Stöger's connection with LASK Linz is stated in the data, although it does not specify if it entails a past managerial position or a potential appointment in the future. Nevertheless, one can assume that his association with the club would create an exciting prospect for LASK Linz, with the opportunity of tapping into Stöger's vast experience and knowledge in football management. It's possible that Stöger's tactical approach, discipline, and emphasis on teamwork could be applied to LASK Linz, leading the team to achieve significant results on the pitch and perhaps even bringing in silverware. In conclusion, the data provided illustrates prominent Austrian football manager Peter Stöger's connections with two football clubs: FC Köln in Germany and LASK Linz in Austria. Through his tactical approach and disciplined management style, it can be assumed that Stöger has had a positive impact on the development and performance of these clubs, further enhancing his reputation within the world of football."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

These differences continue into adult life,she says.In public conversations,men talk most and interrupt other speakers more.In private conversations,men and women speak in equal amounts--although they say things in a different style.Professor Tannen believes that,for women,private talking is a way to establish and test intimacy(,).For men,private talking is a way to explore the power structure of a relationship.

But Professor Tannen does not believe that women are naturally more helpful.She says women feel they achieve power by being able to help others.Although the research suggests men talk and interrupt people more than women,Professor Tannen says,women actually encourage this to happen because they believe it will lead to more intimacy and help to establish a relationship.

The Group of 20 (G-20) is an international forum comprised of 19 countries and the European Union, representing the world's largest economies. The G-20 plays a vital role in addressing global challenges such as poverty, financial stability, and climate change. In this context, it is crucial for the G-20 to offer a vision that can effectively tackle these issues and create a better world for all. To quell global fears, the G-20 must develop a comprehensive and far-reaching strategy that addresses the root causes of the world's most pressing problems. This strategy must involve coordinated efforts to tackle economic inequality, promote sustainable development, and foster international cooperation on matters of shared concern. One of the most urgent issues to be addressed is the rising poverty and inequality observed in many parts of the world. According to the World Bank, approximately 9.2% of the world's population still lives in extreme poverty, earning less than 1.90 per day. Ensuring that economic growth is inclusive and benefits all citizens is essential for global stability and prosperity. The G-20 must design bold actions to protect the most vulnerable populations, like the desperately poor. This can be achieved by promoting pro-poor policies, increasing access to essential services such as health, education, and social protection, and implementing targeted poverty alleviation programs. Guiding the cooperative decision-making of the world's economic authorities is another critical role of the G-20. Enhanced policy coordination can lead to more effective actions and faster progress at the global level. The G-20 must work closely with other international organizations like the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank to design and implement policies that have the maximum positive impact on poverty reduction and overall development. In summary, the G-20 must take action to offer a compelling vision to quell global fears and protect the most vulnerable populations. By promoting economic and social equality and fostering international cooperation, the G-20 can make a significant contribution to reducing extreme poverty and creating a more prosperous, sustainable world for all."},{"instruction":"Select from the following.

Article: My son Jack, a fourth grader, was having a hard time in getting interested in story books recently, so I offered to read the first few chapters to him. In the early pages of 'Incident at Halk Hill', a quiet little boy has a special meeting with a female badger  .Soon after, another badger is caught in a steel leg trap , and the author describes in detail the pain and scare of an animal struggling to its death. We meet the cruel hunter and his ill treatment of a dog; we see the badger being skinned by the boy's father;and we experience the child's confusion when beaten by his father in anger. _ , I thought. Last night , I returned from a weekend away to find that Jack had finished the whole book on his own. \\"It was really, really good and sad, and violent,\\" he reported. \\"There was a lot of killing.\\" \\"Were there any happy parts?\\" I asked, \\"The boy's life was saved by the badger, and that was good. But then that badger got caught in a trap again and at the end it's dying, too. \\" Jack said, \\"It was so sad that I almost cried. \\" I told him that many books have made me cry, beginning with Heidi, when I was just his age, right on up to the novel I finished last week. \\"Well,\\" he admitted then, \\"I actually did cry. Reading that book just reminded me of all the sadness in the world, and it made me feel sad ,too. \\" So, I think, now he has been through the sad tone of the passage , the discovery that words on a printed page can give rise to such strong emotion ,that a book can move you right out of your own comfortable little self and into someone else's pain. Thus we come to realize that if we are to remain fully engaged in life, open to its mysteries and feel sorry towards its suffering, we indeed need stories to grab  us by the neck and remind us of the sadness in the world that is not our own. Question: By writing the passage, the writer mainly wants to  _  . Answer: Options are: [I] tell a story that interested his son [II] show the importance of reading stories [III] share an experience between himself and his son [IV] show how to make children interested in books A:","output":"The writer in the passage primarily aims to [II] show the importance of reading stories and [III] share an experience between himself and his son. The article mainly depicts how the son, Jack, discovered a significant aspect of reading literature—unearthing emotions and understanding another's pain and suffering. As seen, the son was moved deeply by the narrative, which made him aware of the sadness beyond his own world. The story which was shared between the father and son becomes an instrument in attaining this emotional development. Therefore, the compelling emotions of sorrow, empathy and even tears can be evoked by seemingly simple words on a printed page. The story's importance lies not just in its plot but in its power to stir feelings, draw readers out of their comfort zones, and immerse them in characters' lives, something they may otherwise never experience first-hand. The author also successfully encourages the interest of his son in reading by sharing this story - a testament to the power a story can hold in making us understand different aspects of life and feel emotions they otherwise might not experience. However, suggesting ways to pique children's interest in books is not the central point the author seeks to make. These elements combined constitute an exploration of an intimate, shared experience between father and son that serves to emphasize the profound, emotional impact literature can have on its readers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She shrugs it off. Outside her office she has taped up a clear plastic suit, and a sign that reads, \\"All employees must don protective gear before coming in.\\" Such is life in limbo. Nearly a year after Sept. 11, the Legal Aid Society-the lawyers for New York's poor and homeless-remains, well, homeless. The nonprofit has been barred from returning to its 90 Church St. headquarters, across from the World Trade Center site, because of environmental concerns. Legal Aid has uncomfortable company. More than 11,500 New Yorkers continue to work out of temporary space, according to analysis by Manhattan-based real estate brokerage TenantWise.com Inc. and Crain's New York Business. That's 8% of the 137,000 workers who lost their offices or access to them when the Twin Towers collapsed. Legal Aid's 450 displaced attorneys and staffers have spent the past 12 months spread among previously unused spaces-some unused for good reason-in the nonprofit's other offices. It could be another year and a half before they return to their old desks. They have contended with difficult working conditions as demand for Legal Aid's services is on the rise because of Sept. 11 and the deteriorating economy. The civil division is spread among a few boroughs. Their papers and documents, some 20,000 boxes worth, are stuck in a storage facility in Linden, N.J. \\"I am counting the days till we can have all the parts back in one place,\\" says Steven Banks, Legal Aid's associate attorney in chief. In the memories of the exiled workers, the old office has achieved mythical proportions. They say the wood paneling and rugs had the ability to cool emotions and lift spirits. The Legal Aid office on Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights, where 65 displaced workers have cobbled together space amid the faded and scratched walls, looks more like a bargain basement.

Firstly, I will read and understand the sentence. The sentence is \\"The total weight of the valves 39239 kg\\", which is about some valves with a significant total weight. There is missing punctuation that discombobulates the sentence. Here's the sentence with punctuation inserted: \\"The total weight of the valves is 39,239 kg.\\" Now, let me justify the steps and changes I've made: 1. I have added 'is' after the word 'valves' and before the weight figure. This is necessary to construct a proper sentence as it provides a verb to link the subject and its complement, making the sentence structurally correct. 2. I have added a comma in the figure '39239'. In English, long numbers are often separated by comma after each group of three digits from the right. So it becomes '39,239'. It is mainly done for easier readability. 3. I have ended the sentence with a full stop. Because a sentence always ends with a punctuation mark, and because this sentence is declarative and providing information, I added a period (.) at the end.

Hypothesis: Audience targeting is the best way to reach people in advertising.

At Belfast International, passenger numbers increased by 8.9% to almost 4.4 million. One key driver behind this growth was attributed to the successful operations of a new KLM service to Amsterdam, making 2015 a record-year for the airport.

If this describes you, it may be time to take a hiatus from relationships. If you are not in a long-term or committed relationship, take some time to enjoy being single and nurturing your own needs.  Spending some time single can help you gain more awareness into your compulsive helping/rescuing tendencies. It can also give you time to explore the parts of yourself that trigger this habit. You may want to set an amount of time that you remain single to help you keep this goal. For example, you might want to give yourself six months. During this time, set goals for your self-improvement. Compulsive helpers often allow their efforts to fix others to prevent them from doing any personal development of their own. What’s more, by viewing yourself as a savior you develop unrealistic goals that eventually wear away at your self-esteem. By creating realistic goals, you can rebuild.   Select a goal for yourself that allows you to focus only on you. This might include anything from losing weight to writing a novel. Make it a  SMART goal, which is specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound. You might say, “I want to lose 15 pounds in 10 weeks.” Then, map out how you will achieve this goal: “I will eat a serving of vegetables at every meal. I will exercise 5 days per week. I will drink only water.” Run through your goals with another person. They may be able to tell if you if the goals are realistic or not. They may also be able to give you ideas to achieve your goals.

A:","output":"\\"Who Moved My Cheese?\\" is a book by Spencer Johnson that uses a parable to teach valuable lessons about dealing with change in work and life. The story revolves around four characters—two mice, Sniff and Scurry, and two “little-people,” Hem and Haw—living in a maze, in search of cheese, which represents happiness and success. The mice have a simple strategy for finding cheese: they sniff out the location, and scurry toward it to enjoy the prize. Hem and Haw, on the other hand, are more complex and tend to overthink their search for cheese. At first, all four characters come across a large supply of cheese, but eventually, the supply dwindles, and the cheese disappears. This forces everyone to adapt and search for new cheese. Sniff and Scurry quickly accept the change and begin exploring the maze for a new source without much difficulty. However, Hem and Haw struggle to adapt, with Hem refusing to let go of the old situation and Haw initially hesitant but ultimately embracing the change. Throughout the story, Haw learns important lessons about change—how to accept it, embrace it, and grow from it—while Hem remains stuck in the past. The key takeaway from the book is the importance of being flexible, adapting to change, and moving forward in life instead of dwelling on past setbacks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the below context:  Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe.  His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire.  At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher.  Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford.  Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study.  At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture. He had intended to travel further into northern France, but his tour was curtailed in Paris owing to \\"fatigue and illness\\"....  Guess a valid title for it!

What kind of thing would the answer to the question \\"What is tumbled marble ?\\" be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value?","output":"The answer to the question \\"What is tumbled marble?\\" would be a description.  Tumbled marble refers to marble that has been through a process called \\"tumbling\\" to achieve a weathered, antique finish. The process consists basically of putting the marble pieces into a machine that uses sand, small rocks, and water to create friction on the surface of the pieces. As the marble pieces grind against one another within the tumbling machine, their sharp edges and corners are knocked off, and the surface of the stone develops a kind of pitted, softened texture and an aged, antique look. The resulting tumbled marble tiles showcase a muted, less polished appearance than their regular counterparts, adding a unique, old-world charm to any space where they're installed. They are often used in decorative backsplashes, shower interiors, floor tiles, and outdoor spaces.   However, it's important to note that while tumbled marble has a unique, rustic aesthetic appeal, this finish does make the stone more porous. Therefore, tumbled marble usually needs to be sealed to prevent damage from water and stains. In the context of stone finishing, tumbling does not only apply to marble. Many other stones like granite, travertine, or limestone can also be tumbled for a more rustic and antique finish. To sum up, when one asks \\"What is tumbled marble?\\" the answer should provide a detailed description of what tumbled marble is, the process through which it is created, and its applications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Kindergartens in three Chinese provinces are accused of giving prescription drugs to children without their parents' knowledge, according to Xinhua, China's state-run news agency. The drugs were given to prevent the children from getting sick in order to boost attendance, the news agency reported. The schools get paid based on attendance. The scandal started last week in one kindergarten in the city of Xi'an and has now spread to several in the country, prompting China's education and health ministries to require its local branches to check all kindergartens and primary schools for illegally administered drugs, according to the Global Times newspaper. Almost 2,000 children who attended the suspected kindergartens are receiving medical attention as some reported side effects from the medication, such as dizziness, stomachaches, leg pains and genital swelling, Xinhua said. In an article Tuesday, state media called it a \\"crisis of confidence in kindergarten managers.\\" It said that many parents are fed up with private kindergartens \\"which are poorly funded, poorly managed and frequently in a bad state of repair.\\" China's preschools have been riddled with what the state media called \\"a long history of avoidable problems\\" such as food safety and physical abuse. Some angry parents of the affected kindergartens rallied in front of the facilities and local government buildings. First incidents. Last week, Xinhua reported that a parent accused a kindergarten in Xi'an, in Shaanxi province of administering an antiviral drug to children. One parent told the Global Times that several kindergarteners had been complaining about stomachaches or night sweats. When their parents took them to the doctors, they found abnormal results in urine and blood tests -- traces of possible damage to the kidney or liver, the parent told Chinese media. The doctors were stumped over the diagnosis. Local authorities said that the administrators at the Fengyun Lanwan Kindergarten had given children moroxydine ABOB, a medicine which can cause side effects such as sweating, loss of appetite and hypoglycemia since 2008. The prescription drug is used to treat the flu. \\"Teachers told my child the pill was good for him but should be kept secret,\\" one parent, identified as Zhang told Xinhua. \\"They have been taking it for nearly three years.\\" Another kindergarten in Xi'an, called Hongji Xincheng has also been suspected of following the same practice, Xinhua said. Together, the two kindergartens have 1,455 students. Little known about drug in question. Dr. Nelson Lee, professor of infectious diseases at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said not much is known about moroxydine ABOB. The drug was produced in the 1950s and could have some antiviral effects such as suppressing the flu virus, but there are no reports or clinical trials in English.This means doctors know little about how helpful or harmful it could be. For kindergartens to administer such a drug with little research or data is something Lee said he has never heard of. \\"I think the most effective, suitable way to prevent flu infection is to ask the students to get flu vaccines every year. It's the proven, safest way to prevent flu, rather than taking long-term medication with unknown side effects and efficacy.\\" Similar incident in Jilin province. Days later, another kindergarten came under scrutiny, this time in the northeastern province of Jilin. Investigators told Xinhua that a branch of the Fanglin Kindergarten in Jilin City had given some children the same drug -- moroxydine ABOB -- to prevent them from catching colds and infectious diseases. The kindergarten staff were reported to have said they were using the drug to improve attendance. Three administrators have been arrested, according to Xinhua. The kindergarten's 375 students are getting checked at hospitals, it reported. Latest incident in Hubei province. The parents of children who had been attending Xingang Kindergarten in Hubei province, had become suspicious, telling Xinhua that their children developed symptoms such as stomachaches, irregular heartbeats, itching, vomiting and dizziness.

Passage: Wheeler established a new archaeological journal, Ancient India, planning for it to be published twice a year. He had trouble securing printing paper and faced various delays; the first issue was released in January 1946, and he would release three further volumes during his stay. Wheeler married Kim Collingridge in Simla, before he and his wife took part in an Indian Cultural Mission to Iran. The Indian government had deemed Wheeler ideal to lead the group, which departed via train to Zahidan before visiting Persepolis, Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz, Pasargadae, and Kashan. Wheeler enjoyed the trip, and was envious of Tehran's archaeological museum and library, which was far in advance of anything then found in India. Crossing into Iraq, in Baghdad the team caught a flight back to Delhi. In 1946, he was involved in a second cultural mission, this time to Afghanistan, where he expressed a particular interest in the kingdom of ancient Bactria and visited the archaeology of Balkh.Wheeler was present during the 1947 Partition of India into the Dominion of Pakistan and the Union of India and the accompanying ethnic violence between Hindu and Muslim communities. He was unhappy with how these events had affected the Archaeological Survey, complaining that some of his finest students and staff were now citizens of Pakistan and no longer able to work for him. He was based in New Delhi when the city was rocked by sectarian violence, and attempted to help many of his Muslim staff members escape from the Hindu-majority city unharmed. He further helped smuggle Muslim families out of the city hospital, where they had taken refuge from a violent Hindu mob. As India neared independence from the British Empire, the political situation had changed significantly; by October 1947 he was one of the last British individuals in a high-up position within the country's governing establishment, and recognised that many Indian nationalists wanted him to also leave.As their relationship had become increasingly strained, his wife had left and returned to Britain. Although hoping to leave his post in India several months early, he was concerned for his economic prospects, and desperately searched for a new position. Through friends in the British archaeological community, he was offered a job as the Secretary of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, although he was upset that this would mean a drop in his professional status and income and decided to turn it down. Instead, he agreed to take up a chair in the Archaeology of the Roman Provinces at the Institute of Archaeology. In addition, the Pakistani Minister of Education invited him to become the Archaeological Adviser to the Pakistani government; he agreed to also take up this position, on the condition that he would only spend several months in the country each year over the next three.","output":"1.

That's the take off point for Buddha Mar Gaya - a black comedy about dead bodies, mucho moolah and funerals. Laxmikant Kabadiya aka LK (Anupam Kher), is one of India's richest industrialists, a self made man who's risen from selling scrap to become a construction magnate. His conglomerate is on the verge of a 5000 crore IPO that should make them one of the largest companies in the country. LK's family - comprising of his spinster twin sister Prerna, his two sons Ranjeet and Sameer, their wives Shruti and Anju respectively and Ranjeet's daughters Sanjana and Namrata, and Sameer's son, Pawan, can't stop salivating at the thought of all that money. Unfortunately for all of them fate displays a wicked sense of humour. On the night before the IPO opens, LK dies. The family is distraught and horrified. Not because a loved one has died but because now no one will buy their shares. So, on the advice of their family guru - Vidyut Baba (Om Puri), the family decides to hide the death of LK for a period of two days till the shares are all sold out. Little do they realize the crazy series of events that will follow on account of this duplicity. After all, hiding the death of a man as famous as LK, is a Herculean task. To make matters worse, every time they're ready to announce LK's death, fate intervenes forcing them to keep his death hidden for another couple of days. Which results in them having to announce the death of a fictitious friend or relative of LK's... And stage fake funerals. Which of course means generating dead bodies and worse, getting the dead LK to make appearances at these funerals. Complicating matters further are an inquisitive and greedy servant, the Prime Minister's fixer, a procurer of dead bodies, the paparazzi and for good measure a couple of cops. And of course internal jealousies, greed, rivalries within the family only add spice to the goings on. Buddha Mar Gaya takes you on a rip-roaring ride into a world littered with dead...

Both sentences essentially express same facts or pieces of information. The only differences among the two sentences lie in their structures and arrangements of words, not in the content of their messages, which is what makes them paraphrases. The first sentence employs a more straightforward and succinct structure using commas insider to separate two events that are mentioned. But in the second sentence, repeated auxiliary verb \\"was\\" is used and two different events are divided into two independent clauses, making this sentence a bit more formal. Though slight differences in syntax and wording exist between these two sentences, their core messages remain same.

Please add spaces between words: Galatians6:2–Bearoneanother’sburdens","output":"Galatians 6:2 – Bear one another's burdens In this Bible verse from the New Testament, the Apostle Paul is writing to the Christian community in the region of Galatia. This verse is taken from the Letter to the Galatians, which is his final message in an expression of concern, correction, and guidance for the fellow Christians that lived there. The passage is as follows: \\"Galatians 6:2 – Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.\\" In this verse, Paul is encouraging the followers of Jesus Christ to support and help one another by sharing each other's struggles and burdens. This is important for maintaining and strengthening the collective unity, love and fellowship within the community, both in faith and in daily life. There are a few key elements that we can take from this verse: 1. Bear one another's burdens: Paul is saying that as Christians, we should assist and be empathetic to our fellow believers when they struggle or face difficulties. This can include physical, emotional or spiritual support. By sharing the weight of the burden with someone else, it can feel lighter and easier to carry, providing a sense of comfort, relief and solidarity. 2. Fulfill the law of Christ: By helping others and showing love and compassion, we are fulfilling the words and teachings of Jesus Christ, who emphasized the importance of love for God, and love for our neighbors as ourselves. The \\"law of Christ\\" refers to the commandments and teachings given by Jesus in the Bible, which center around loving and serving others selflessly. 3. Importance of community and unity: The ability to share and bear the burdens of others requires strong relationships and connections between individuals. This verse illustrates the significance of fostering a community that is built upon mutual love, support and understanding – a community that is based on the principles of Jesus Christ. In conclusion, the verse Galatians 6:2 - \\"Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ,\\" is a powerful reminder for all Christians to actively practice empathy, love, and support within their communities. By doing so, they not only become a true reflection of Jesus Christ's teachings but also help in building a cohesive and strong spiritual community, bound together by love and service to each other."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the character who has lost the will to live? ?

Philadelphia (CNN) -- A Philadelphia abortion provider found guilty of first-degree murder has agreed give up his right to appeal in exchange for avoiding a possible death sentence, Philadelphia's district attorney's office announced Tuesday. Dr. Kermit Gosnell, 72, was convicted Monday on three counts of murder for killing babies by cutting their spinal cords with scissors. The next step in the case was to have been the penalty phase, when jurors would have weighed whether to give Gosnell a death sentence. The arrangement erases a need for that phase. \\"Like any deal, there's a give and take on each side. The Commonwealth (of Pennsylvania) took away the death penalty and Dr. Gosnell gave up his right to appeal,\\" said defense attorney Jack McMahon. In","output":"addition to the three counts of murder, Gosnell was also found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the overdose death of a patient and more than 200 counts of violating Pennsylvania's Abortion Control Act. He has been sentenced to three consecutive life sentences without parole for the murder convictions, as well as additional time for the other charges, ensuring that he will spend the rest of his life behind bars.  Following the high-profile trial, the case has sparked a nationwide debate on abortion and clinic regulations. Critics argue that Gosnell's clinic, the Women's Medical Society, had not been inspected by state health officials in over a decade, which allowed the unsafe and illegal practices to continue. Pro-choice advocates claim that excessive regulation and restricted access to safe abortion services lead women to seek out clinics like Gosnell's out of desperation. In response to the case, Pennsylvania legislators have introduced new laws aimed at increasing oversight and improving safety standards at abortion clinics across the state.  In the wake of the Gosnell case, other states are also taking a closer look at their abortion clinic regulations. While some states continue to push for tighter restrictions on abortion access, others are strengthening clinic oversight and safety protocols to prevent similar tragedies from occurring. Advocates on both sides of the abortion debate hope that the Gosnell case will lead to positive change and increased vigilance when it comes to women's reproductive health.  As the nation grapples with the fallout from the Gosnell case and ensuing political debates, it's essential to recognize that reproductive health is a complex issue with profound consequences for both women and society as a whole. The Gosnell case has exposed the importance of balancing the need for safe, legal, and accessible abortion services with the responsibility to protect those who seek them from harm. While opponents and proponents of abortion rights will likely continue to disagree on the issue, it is crucial to remember that the safety and well-being of women seeking reproductive healthcare should always be a top priority. The ramifications of the Gosnell case will likely reverberate through the legal system, political arena, and the lives of countless women for years to come. It is up to policymakers, healthcare professionals, and citizens alike to strive for a more informed, compassionate, and proactive approach to reproductive health in America."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This means based that, on the amount of money spent per year on pesticides, 10 billion, there is an additional 40 billion savings in crop that would be lost due to damage by insects and weeds. In general, farmers benefit from having an increase in crop yield and from being able to grow a variety of crops throughout the year. Consumers of agricultural products also benefit from being able to afford the vast quantities of produce available year-round. The general public also benefits from the use of pesticides for the control of insect-borne diseases and illnesses, such as malaria. The use of pesticides creates a large job market within the agrichemical sector. What is the answer to this question: How are consumers able to benefit from saved crops?","output":"To answer this question, we have to look for the information within the text that relates to how consumers benefit from the use of pesticides and saved crops. Step 1: Identify the relevant information In the article, it mentions that \\"consumers of agricultural products also benefit from being able to afford the vast quantities of produce available year-round.\\" Step 2: Interpret the information This statement suggests that as a result of the use of pesticides, there are more crops available in the market throughout the year, which leads to increased availability and affordability of agricultural products. Step 3: Formulate the answer Based on the information provided, consumers are able to benefit from saved crops because the use of pesticides increases the availability and affordability of agricultural products by ensuring a consistent supply of produce throughout the year."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Soon, they meet Laura (Melissa Leo) and Stephen (Robert John Burke) who are their neighbors. David is wary of their unusual interest in Emily. He later discovers that the reason for this is that the couple had a daughter who recently died from cancer and looked like Emily. Later, when David visits Laura, she nervously and ambiguously implies that her husband has begun abusing her in response to their child's death, emotionally and perhaps even physically.

The key words are \\"at least\\", because, unless you are a child, you need more water than that. The rule is, for every 50 pounds of body weight you carry, drink one quart of bottled or filtered   water per day. The average person weighs 150 pounds, so they should drink three quarts per day. A 200 pounds person should drink a full gallon per day. Athletes should drink even more than that. Follow these and you've adopted one of the most important health habits. Our bodies are mostly water, and water is essential to our every function. Drink the appropriate amount, and everything is much more likely to function at the best levels. If you don't drink enough water, over the short term you will experience tiredness, dry skin, headaches and constipation  ; over the longer term, every body function will _ more quickly.

For the first batch of batter, add a few drops of red food coloring or edible gel paste to the bowl and stir with a clean spoon until the color is fully incorporated. Add more color as necessary to achieve the desired intensity. Repeat with the blue and yellow food coloring.  You can actually use any colors you like for tie-dye cupcakes, and can also use more than just three colors.

For instance, you can mix blue and red to achieve purple. To have white in your mix, leave one of the bowls of batter uncolored. Prepare a cupcake tin by lining it with white cupcake liners. Into the bottom of each liner, drop 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of red batter. Then place one or two spoons of yellow batter on top of that, followed by an equal quantity of blue batter on top. Stop when the liners are filled half way.  You can layer the colors in any way you like, and don’t have to use the red, yellow, blue pattern. different spoons for each color. If you're using more colors, use ½ to 1 tablespoon (7.5 to 15 ml) of batter for each color. Instead of spooning the colors into the liners, you can also transfer each batter color to a separate pastry bag, and pipe in the batters one color at a time. To create the tie-dye effect, take a clean toothpick and gently swirl around the batter in each liner. Don’t mix too much, or you will end up blending the colors and they’ll become muddy.  You can create circular tie-dye patterns by swirling the toothpick in circles. Create wavy patterns by zig zagging the toothpick in the batter.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: It was the end of the school term and my son Tom had less than three months left before he would finish his six years at high school. During this time he had developed a love for basketball. Sadly, because of my work over the last twelve months, I had only been able to attend a few of his games; however, I was determined to get to his last game for the school term. Tom's team came out in the first 10 minutes with a burst of goals that saw them leading by just over 20 points at the end of the first half. The second half changed as the other team quickly played themselves back into the game. Tom's team started to miss an increasing number of shots. It was at that point that the coach called his first time out. The noise of the spectators   became quiet as the coach spoke to them. He had the team standing in a half circle, but he squatted   down, looking up at them and fiving some very calm and clear instructions on what they needed to do in the last couple of minutes. As he stood up to allow the team to return to the court, I saw him give some further words of encouragement to all of them. You could see that he knew that the team was fighting to save the game and that he needed to lift them up. By squatting down he placed himself in a position where he was talking up to them, rather than down or at them, and as the players went back onto the court his words of encouragement served to lift their energy and spirits. Well, Tom's team went on to win the final by 5 points. As I drove away I thought about what can happen to us all in our everyday life. One of my favourite quotes is about the half filled glass of water --- \\"Is it half full or is it half empty?\\" Like the coach, the answer to this quote all depends on how you look at things. Options: A Because his son would graduate from high school. B Because he felt sorry for never watching his son play. C Because it was a final his son played a key role in.

Article: What do literary greats Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Robert Burns have in common? They both lived and wrote in Edinburgh, along with many other big names in the field of literature.This fact helped UNESCO award the city the title of world's first City of Literature on October 14. Edinburgh left a lasting impression on Arthur Conan Doyle(1859-1930).Although he was born there he went to school in England but returned home for medical school.After graduating he moved to London and began writing his Sherlock Holmes stories.His inspiration for the character came from one of his professors at university.Holmes' methods were so clever that they actually furthered the advance of the study of criminology . Robert Burns(1759-1796)is still regarded as Scotland's national poet,more than 200 years after his death.He is celebrated all over the world through translations of his work and the annual Burns Night supper on his birthday.One of his songs,\\"My Love is Like a Red Red Rose\\" ranks among the finest love songs ever written and \\"Auld Lang Syne\\"   is sung all around the world. As one of the first literate societies in Europe,the Scottish Parliament passed the world's first compulsory   education law in 1496.By the 1790s,almost all Scots could read.Visitors to Scotland often observed that even the lowest members of society had copies of Burns' poems and other books.

The California-based tech firm, which allows users to send images and messages that vanish within seconds, is set to be one of the major US share listings of recent years. The flotation is expected to value the business at between 20bn and 25bn, although Snap has never made a profit. It will turn the company's founders into multi-billionaires. Snap wants to raise 3bn through the share sale, a small percentage but one that will set the market price for the rest of the company. Snap's formal announcement to regulators of its plans revealed that the company made sales of 404m last year, but a loss of 515m. The documents also disclose that the shares being sold will, unusually, not carry voting rights, enabling Snap's founders to retain control. Snapchat: Is it really worth 25bn? The company began in 2011 when co-founder and chief executive, 26-year-old Evan Spiegel, was still at university. Mr Spiegel and fellow founder Bobby Murphy, 28, have stakes in Snap that would be worth about 5bn. Snap now has nearly 160 million daily users and last year revenues grew by nearly 600%, the listing documents revealed. Heavy costs, including from marketing and research, dragged Snap into even deeper losses than the 373m it lost in 2015. Snap said in the filing that it expected \\"to incur operating losses in the future, and may never achieve or maintain profitability\\". Despite the losses - and that warning -  some investors see Snapchat as the next potential Facebook, said CCS Insights analyst Martin Garner. \\"If it can repeat the Facebook story to some extent, it's going to be hugely profitable,\\" he said. Most of Snapchat's revenue comes from advertising, and it is seen as an appealing way for companies to reach young people, with over half of its users aged between 13 and 24. Analysts predicted its US stock market listing would be the biggest since the launch of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014, and before that Facebook's 81bn valuation in 2012. It would also mean a big payout for Mr Spiegel, who is set to remain a major shareholder. Just over three years ago, he turned down an offer from Facebook's co-founder Mark Zuckerberg to buy Snapchat for 3bn. The company is now seeking to raise 3bn from the share sale, according to reports, valuing the company at much more. Snap names Facebook as one of several companies it is competing with for users' attention, along with Twitter and Google-owned YouTube. However, it is also seen as a fast-growing rival to those major Silicon Valley players. Under pressure from Snapchat, Facebook has launched new filters and a slideshow feature on its photo-sharing app Instagram. \\"A lot of people think Facebook is losing younger users to Snapchat. There's a lot of evidence Facebook is copying Snapchat's features,\\" Mr Garner said. But with Facebook drawing in 1.2 billion daily users, Snapchat needs to prove it can have general appeal, he added. Keen to show it can make revenue from sources other than advertising, Snapchat rebranded itself as Snap last year, and debuted its video-camera sunglasses called Spectacles. The kit can connect to smartphones and send video and photos to the app. Last month, the firm said it had established its non-US office in London. Snap said it would pay taxes on UK and some international sales through the hub. What is a summary of this text?","output":"Snap, the parent company of social media platform Snapchat, has filed for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, valuing the company at between 20bn and 25bn. Founder and CEO Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy each have stakes worth around 5bn in the five-year old firm, which last year generated revenues of 404m and losses of 515m. The share sale will enable Snap to raise around 3bn and create a benchmark for the market price.

Information:  - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London.   - Surrey is a county in the south east of England and also one of the home counties bordering Greater London. Surrey shares borders with Kent to the east, East Sussex to the south-east, West Sussex to the south, Hampshire to the west and south-west and Berkshire to the north-west. The county town is Guildford. Surrey County Council sits extraterritorially at Kingston upon Thames, administered as part of Greater London since 1965. With a resident population of 1.1 million, Surrey is the most densely populated and third most populated county in the South East region, after Kent and Hampshire.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Vincent James Turner (born 9 October 1985), better known by his stage name Frankmusik (and between 2011 and 2012, by the name Vincent Did It), is an English synthpop musician. The name \\"Frank\\" is derived from the Christian name of his grandfather, whose name he took in tribute.  - Alphabeat is a Danish pop band from Silkeborg, fronted by singers Stine Bramsen and Anders SG and signed to Polydor Records. Their single \\"Fascination\\" was a major hit in Denmark during the summer of 2007 and a significant hit in the United Kingdom in 2008. Follow-up single \\"10.000 Nights of Thunder\\" (or just \\"10,000 Nights\\" in the UK) saw equal acclaim, and their eponymous debut album reached number two in Denmark and number ten in the UK. It has sold over 100,000 copies and their three top twenty singles have sold of 400,000 altogether in the region.  - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - Planet Funk is an Italian electronic dance musical ensemble. The group is composed of Marco Baroni, Domenico \\"GG\\" Canu, Sergio Della Monica, Alex Neri and Alex Uhlmann, in addition to guest vocalists Auli Kokko, Dan Black, Sally Doherty, Raiz, John Graham and Giuliano Sangiorgi. Alex Uhlmann joined as the band's latest lead singer in November 2010.  - Londinium was a settlement established on the current site of the City of London around  43.

It borders Greater London to the north west, Surrey to the west, East Sussex to the south west, and Essex across the Thames Estuary to the north. The county town is Maidstone.   - Independent music (often shortened to indie music or indie) is music produced independently from major commercial record labels or their subsidiaries, a process that may include an autonomous, do-it-yourself approach to recording and publishing. The term \\"indie\\" is sometimes also used to describe a genre (such as indie rock and indie pop); as a genre term, \\"indie\\" may include music that is not independently produced, and most independent music artists do not fall into a single, defined musical style or genre, and usually create music that can be categorized into other genres.  - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music.  - Giuliano Sangiorgi (born 24 January 1979 in Nardò, Lecce, Italy) is one of the leading and most eclectic young Italian artist, who has gained increasing fame both as singer, songwriter, composer and together with his rock band Negramaro.  - The Mayor of London is an elected politician who, along with the London Assembly of 25 members, is accountable for the strategic government of Greater London.

It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831.  - Wonky pop was a loose grouping of musical acts that played what the BBC called \\"quirky, catchy and credible pop\\", rooted in the eccentric side of 1980s pop music, which was briefly popular in the late 2000s.

Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster. It is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London, is the world's oldest national broadcasting organisation, and is the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, with over 20,950 staff in total, of whom 16,672 are in public sector broadcasting; including part-time, flexible as well as fixed contract staff, the total number is 35,402.  - The London Assembly is an elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies. The assembly was established in 2000 and meets at City Hall on the South Bank of the River Thames, close to Tower Bridge. The assembly is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners (transport, environmental matters, etc.), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor.  - Hertfordshire (often abbreviated Herts) is a county in southern England, bordered by Bedfordshire to the north, Cambridgeshire to the north-east, Essex to the east, Buckinghamshire to the west and Greater London to the south. For government statistical purposes, it is placed in the East of England region.  - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.  - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster).   - A musical ensemble, also known as a music group or musical group, is a group of people who perform instrumental and/or vocal music, with the ensemble typically known by a distinct name. Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra. Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups. In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers. In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet). Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion.   - Dan Black ( born 16 November 1976 ) is a British wonky pop recording artist and record producer from London .

Write a title for this article: So much for the idea of a flattening yield curve bringing investors to the risk table. Barclays Capital warned in a 118 page report published Thursday that the global economy was heading down a treachurous path, and the prospect of free money wasn’t going to help it anytime soon. For now, the idea inside Barclays is that the U.S. will avoid a recession thanks to monetary stimulus, but volatility and deteriorating financial conditions will haunt the global economy for months, if not much of next year. The only way out of a recession in the U.S. at least seems to be the Fed, as policy makers in Washington have essentially turned the economy into a campaign fight. A bad economy is good for the Republicans, who want to beat President Obama in 2012, if the man even runs for re-election at this point. As it now stands, Ben Bernanke is leading the country. To some, Bernanke and Congresss, along with Angela Merkel in Germany, are leading the market to hell in a handbasket. The past several months have witnessed a deterioration in financial conditions that to many investors seems eerily similar to the 2008 financial crisis. Global equity markets have sold off, volatility has spiked, and investors are questioning the sustainability of debt that was once considered rock solid. The U.S. downgrade on Aug. 5 by Standard and Poor’s is a case in point. In Europe, banks are facing funding difficulties amid concerns about their exposure to unpayable government debt. This could have ramifications for big retail banks in the U.S., such as Bank of America (BAC), analysts outside of Barclays have said. The only good news is that this is not 2008. A double dip is unlikely in the U.S. A great depression, considered a possibility two years ago, is out of the question in their view. Larry Kantor, head of research at Barclays, wrote that “fortunately, markets and economies are not nearly as vulnerable to collapse as they were in 2008: valuations are far from stretched, cyclical sectors are already operating at very low levels, and households, investors and businesses including most banks have all been behaving very cautiously, with high levels of liquid assets and low levels of risk.” Nevertheless, Barclays warns that the probability of significant financial deterioration is far from negligible. Markets have been hit by two main concerns: a slowdown in the global economy and the sustainability of sovereign debt. Barclays’ view is that the latter presents the greatest risk.

It is a public school in an urban city which is quite multicultural. She is half-Chinese and half-white. Although she is part Chinese, not many people can notice. Some have thought that she is Italian or Greek or even Irish for some reason. Anyways, a month and a bit ago, my daughter came home a bit sad. I asked her what was wrong and she told me that in school, everyone shared what they did for the weekend. My daughter said that her family is Chinese so they celebrated Chinese New Year. The teacher (who is white) apparently told her “But you’re not Chinese. You shouldn’t lie.” My daughter said she felt embarassed in front of the whole class. I was amused but also angry. I phoned her teacher and VERY CASUALLY told her that my daughter felt hurt by her being dismissive of her heritage. Her teacher was strangely defensive and asked me if I was accusing her of something. I said no and just that she should try being more open minded.  A few days after this incident, my daughter said she felt like the teacher was treating her unfairly, namely refusing to let her go to the water fountain during class, giving her a “time out” for not lining up in time for recess, putting her on the spot to answer a question and berating her when she had the wrong answer. This time both my husband and I booked an appt to talk with the teacher, who was quite dismissive of us and very unhelpful.  At this point it was affecting my daughter’s enjoyment of school. She would cry at night and beg me to send her back to her old school. Finally I had a talk with the principal, who told me that other parents have been accusing the teacher of racism in the past and said they’re trying to work with her. In the meantime my daughter was transferred to another class which worked out great. Flash forward to last week when I was picking up my daughter from school. Her old teacher approached me and we made a bit of small talk, then she said casually, “Well Im not going to return to teach next year so I guess I can thank you.” I was super taken aback. I told her I did NOT mean for her to lose her job. She then walked away from me. I also learned from another parent that she was 4 kids and is a single mom. This made me extremely sad and I can’t help but feel guilty for playing a role in having her fired. My husband told me she was probably gonna get fired anyways and said I shouldn’t feel bad. AITA though? I feel so so horrible knowing that she cannot support her 4 kids anymore partially because of my complaint against her.","output":"To complete this task, follow these steps: 1.

Summarize this article in one sentence. The correlation coefficient can be understood as an indicator of two things. The first is whether or not the two variables in question typically move in the same direction at the same time. If they do, the correlation coefficient is positive. If not, it is negative. The second thing the correlation coefficient can tell you is how similar these movements are. A correlation coefficient close of 1 or -1 represents perfect positive correlation or perfect negative correlation, respectively.  Correlation coefficients always vary between 1 and -1. A result of 0 indicates that there is no correlation.  So, for example, the example result of 0.809 from the other part of this article would mean that stocks X and Y are highly correlated. The two securities experience price movements in the same direction and usually in roughly the same magnitude. The primary use of stock correlation coefficients is in the preparation of balanced securities portfolios. Stocks or other assets within a portfolio can be assessed against others in the same portfolio to determine the correlation coefficient between them. The goal is to place stocks with low or negative correlations in the same portfolio. Thus, when the price of the first stock moves, the second will likely move oppositely or independently of the first. The result of these actions is effective portfolio diversification. This practice reduces \\"unsystematic risk,\\" which is risk inherent to individual securities. The correlation coefficient is also frequently used to assess relationships between other data sets, such as mutual fund returns, Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) returns, and market indexes. Correlations coefficients can be calculated between these data sets and stock returns to diversify a portfolio or to figure out how a stock's price moves in relation to other market shifts. This can be useful for predicting the change in a stock's price that would occur in the event of another change in the market. For example, the stock price of a gold mining company might be positively related to the price of gold (with a high, positive correlation coefficient). If the price of gold is expected to increase, an investor would have reason to believe that the price of the company's stock will as well. of stock return data to obtain a 'scatter plot'. You can use a spreadsheet program to plot the dates and returns of your stocks. This makes it easier to note the properties of the data. Also, using spreadsheet software, you can plot a best fit line. The best fit line to the data is called the regression line.  On Excel, you can add this line by clicking \\"Chart\\" and then \\"Add Trendline.\\" The program will then calculate a trend line based on your data.  The correlation coefficient is a measure of how closely the two stock returns fit the regression line. That is, how closely the return values satisfy a linear relation such as Y = βX + α for some constants α and β.","output":"The correlation coefficient helps us understand if two things move in the same direction and how similar their movements are, which can be useful for making a balanced portfolio of stocks with low or negative correlations for diversification and reduced risk."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: A dense wave of smog began in the Central and Eastern part of China on 2 December 2013 across a distance of around 1,200 kilometres (750 mi), including Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai and Zhejiang. A lack of cold air flow, combined with slow-moving air masses carrying industrial emissions, collected airborne pollutants to form a thick layer of smog over the region. The heavy smog heavily polluted central and southern Jiangsu Province, especially in and around Nanjing, with its AQI pollution Index at \\"severely polluted\\" for five straight days and \\"heavily polluted\\" for nine. On 3 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter average over 943 micrograms per cubic metre, falling to over 338 micrograms per cubic metre on 4 December 2013. Between 3:00 pm, 3 December and 2:00pm, 4 December local time, several expressways from Nanjing to other Jiangsu cities were closed, stranding dozens of passenger buses in Zhongyangmen bus station. From 5 to 6 December, Nanjing issued a red alert for air pollution and closed down all kindergarten through middle schools. Children's Hospital outpatient services increased by 33 percent; general incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections significantly increased. The smog dissipated 12 December.

I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief. Last year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye. It seems he became a hopeless heroin addict at some point and had died in his flat on an overdose of prescription drugs and smack. I felt sad when I read it but I couldn’t work out why. Maybe it was because my brother died in the same manner? He was certainly a character, an absolute nutter and ruthless bully who had everyone fearing him.

He is widely referred to as \\"The Father of History\\" (first conferred by Cicero); he was the first historian known to have broken from Homeric tradition to treat historical subjects as a method of investigationspecifically, by collecting his materials systematically and critically, and then arranging them into a historiographic narrative. \\"The Histories\\" is the only work which he is known to have produced, a record of his \\"inquiry\\" (or \\"historía\\") on the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, including a wealth of geographical and ethnographical information. Some of his stories were fanciful and others inaccurate; yet he states that he was reporting only what was told to him and was often correct in his information. Despite Herodotus' historical significance, little is known of his personal history.  - Assyria was a major Mesopotamian East Semitic-speaking kingdom and empire of the ancient Near East. It existed as an independent state from perhaps as early as the 25th century BC in the form of the Assur city-state, until its lapse between 612 BC and 599 BC, spanning the Early to Middle Bronze Age through to the late Iron Age.  - Reign. Astyages succeeded his father in 585 BCE, following the Battle of Halys, which ended a five-year war between the Lydians and the Medes. He inherited a large empire, ruled in alliance with his two brothers-in-law, Croesus of Lydia and Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, whose wife, Amytis, Astyages' sister, was the queen for whom Nebuchadnezzar was said to have built the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. but due to the recent evidence, the garden was likely built by the Assyrian King Sennacherib. Married to Aryenis, the sister of King Croesus of Lydia, to seal the treaty between the two empires, Astyages ascended to the Median throne upon his father's death later that year.  - Rusa II was king of Urartu between around 680 BC and 639 BC. It was during his reign that the massive fortress complex, Karmir-Blur, was constructed.  - Cyaxares (\\"Uvaxštra\\", , ; r. 625585 BC), the son of King Phraortes, and according to Herodotus was the third and most capable king of Media.

According to the Armenian historian Moses of Chorene , Rusa 's father Erimena can probably be identified with Paruyr Skayordi , who helped the Median king Cyaxares to conquer Assyria , for which Cyaxares recognized him as the king of Armenia , although the Medes ultimately reneged on this ; significantly later , during the reign of King Astyages , the Medes conquered and annexed Armenia . Rusa was the father of Sarduri IV.  - Aššur (Akkadian; 'shr; : shr : shr, Kurdish Asûr), also known as Ashur and Qal'at Sherqat, was an Assyrian city, capital of the Old Assyrian Empire (20251750 BC), Middle Assyrian Empire (13651050 BC), and for a time, the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911605 BC).

Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - The Iron Age is an archaeological era, referring to a period of time in the prehistory and protohistory of the Old World (Afro-Eurasia) when the dominant toolmaking material was iron. It is commonly preceded by the Bronze Age in Europe and Asia with exceptions and the Stone Age in Africa. Meteoric iron has been used by humans since at least 3200 BC, but ancient iron production did not become widespread until the ability to smelt iron ore, remove impurities and regulate the amount of carbon in the alloy were developed. The start of the Iron Age proper is considered by many to fall between around 1200 BC to 600 BC, depending on the region. In most parts of the world, its end is defined by the widespread adoption of writing, and therefore marks the transition from prehistory to history.  - Azerbaijan, officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a country in the South Caucasus region, situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe. It is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia to the west and Iran to the south.

Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center.  - Urartu, also known as Kingdom of Van (Urartian: ' Assyrian: '; Babylonian: \\"Urashtu\\"), was an Iron Age kingdom centred on Lake Van in the Armenian Highlands.

Answer the following question: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"contact between rocks over long periods of time causes rocks to be what?\\" is \\"loose\\", given that  contact between rocks over long periods of time causes rocks to be slippery? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, the right answer to the question, \\"Contact between rocks over long periods of time causes rocks to be what?\\" is not \\"loose.\\" Instead, it appears that rocks become \\"slippery\\" when they experience prolonged contact with each other. This slipperiness occurs due to the process of mechanical and chemical weathering. Mechanical weathering involves the breakdown of rocks into smaller pieces through physical processes, such as abrasion (the rubbing or wearing away of one rock against another). Chemical weathering involves the alteration or dissolution of minerals in rocks due to chemical reactions with water, air, or other substances present in the atmosphere or soil. Over time, these weathering processes can cause the rock surfaces to become smoother and more slippery. Additionally, certain rocks can become slick when in contact with water. The water can act as a lubricant between the rock surfaces, reducing friction and causing the rocks to become slippery. This can be particularly noticeable in cases where algae or other microorganisms grow on the wet rock surfaces, further increasing their slipperiness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Spice Girls are an English pop girl group formed in 1994. The group originally consisted of Melanie Brown (\\"Scary Spice\\"), Melanie Chisholm (\\"Sporty Spice\\"), Emma Bunton (\\"Baby Spice\\"), Geri Halliwell (\\"Ginger Spice\\"), and Victoria Beckham, nee Adams (\\"Posh Spice\\"). They were signed to Virgin Records and released their debut single \\"Wannabe\\" in 1996, which hit number one in 37 countries and established them as a global phenomenon. Their debut album Spice sold more than 31 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in history. While on tour in the United-States, the group continued to record new material and released a new song, \\"Goodbye\\", before Christmas in 1998. The song was seen as a tribute to Geri Halliwell, and when it topped the UK Singles Chart it became their third consecutive Christmas number-one - equalling the record previously set by the Beatles. Later in 1998, Bunton and Chisholm appeared at the 1998 MTV Europe Music Awards without their other band members, and the group won two awards: \\"Best Pop Act\\" and \\"Best Group\\" for a second time. In late 1998, Brown and Adams announced they were both pregnant; Brown was married to dancer Jimmy Gulzer and became known as Mel G for a brief period. She gave birth to daughter Phoenix Chi in February 1999. One month later, Adams gave birth to son Brooklyn, whose father was then Manchester United footballer David Beckham. Later that year, she married Beckham in a highly publicised wedding in Ireland.  The Spice Girls returned to the studio in August 1999, after an eight-month recording break to start work on their third and last studio album. The album's sound was initially more pop-influenced, similar to their first two albums, and included production from Eliot Kennedy. The album's sound took a mature direction when American producers like Rodney Jerkins, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis came on to collaborate with the group. In December 1999 they performed live for a UK-only tour, Christmas in Spiceworld, in London and Manchester, also showcasing new songs from the third album. During 1999, the group recorded the character Amneris' song \\"My Strongest Suit\\" in Elton John and Tim Rice's Aida, a concept album which would later go on to fuel the musical version of Verdi's Aida. The band performed again at the 2000 Brit Awards, where they received a Lifetime Achievement Award. Despite being at the event, Halliwell did not join her former bandmates on stage. In November 2000, the group released Forever. Sporting a new edgier R&B sound, the album received a lukewarm response from critics.  In the US, the album peaked at number thirty-nine on the Billboard 200 albums chart. In the UK, the album was released the same week as Westlife's Coast to Coast album and the chart battle was widely reported by the media, where Westlife won the battle reaching number one in the UK, leaving the Spice Girls at number two. The lead single from Forever, the double A-side \\"Holler\\"/\\"Let Love Lead the Way\\", became the group's ninth number one single in the UK. However the song failed to break onto the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart stateside, instead peaking at number seven on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles. \\"Holler\\" did peak at number thirty-one on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 2000. The only major performance of the lead single came at the MTV Europe Music Awards on 16 November 2000. In total, Forever achieved only a fraction of the success of its two best-selling predecessors, selling five million copies. In December 2000, the group unofficially announced that they were beginning an indefinite hiatus and would be concentrating on their solo careers in regards to their foreseeable future, although they pointed out that the group was not splitting.

(Photo: Jonathan Palmer, AP)      After an incident last week in which Papa John's founder John Schnatter admitted to using an offensive racial slur during a conference call in May, multiple professional franchises and collegiate athletic programs have suspended or ended their sponsorship contracts with Papa John's.      The Utah Jazz is the latest. The NBA team is dropping the brand, first reported by The Salt Lake Tribune on Thursday.      The University of Utah is evaluating its deal with Papa John's and is removing any photos of Schnatter and replacing pizza boxes with his likeness on them, per the Tribune.      Since the controversy blew up on social media, Schnatter has stepped down as chairman of the pizza franchise. In addition to using the racial slur, Schnatter also was criticized for using graphic imagery to describe the lynchings of African Americans in his hometown in Indiana.      One of the first athletic programs to rid itself of the company's name was the University of Louisville, which announced July 13 that it would remove Papa John's from the name of the school's football stadium and call it \\"Cardinal Stadium.\\"      As of Thursday, 21 athletic organizations have cut ties with Papa John's.

The people, who asked not to be identified discussing private views, didn’t say what action Schnatter might take in response or whether he would ask to be restored to his post. Schnatter declined to comment. The Papa John’s board declined to comment, according to spokesman Peter Collins.      Papa John’s shares fell 1 percent on Tuesday to 50.88 at 9:35 a.m. in New York. The stock has lost about a third of its value in the last 12 months.      John Schnatter Photographer: Jason Merritt/Getty Images North America      Even as Schnatter stewed over his resignation during the weekend, the rest of the six-member Papa John’s board was taking action to further distance the pizza chain from its outspoken founder for his use of a racial slur. On Sunday, a special committee of independent directors ordered the termination of a so-called founder’s agreement that designated Schnatter as the brand’s face and voice. Papa John’s has requested he cease media appearances on behalf of the firm and evicted him from the headquarters, according to a company statement.      Schnatter, 56, stepped down as chairman at the request of the board on July 11 after a Forbes report that he used a racial slur and graphic descriptions of violence against minorities in a conversation with the company’s former media agency, Laundry Service. That was just months after he exited the chief executive officer job over critical comments about the National Football League’s national-anthem controversy. The restaurant chain said last week that it plans to appoint a replacement chairman.      Schnatter admitted to using the slur but said he was taken out of context. “Regardless of the context, I apologize. Simply stated, racism has no place in our society,” he said, according to a statement emailed last Wednesday.      A spokeswoman for Wasserman, the talent-management agency that owns Laundry Service, declined to comment.      Papa John’s said Friday that Schnatter will no longer be featured in any of the company’s advertising or marketing materials. The New York Yankees said the same day that it was suspending its relationship with the firm. The University of Louisville announced that the school will change the name of its football stadium from Papa John’s Cardinal Stadium to Cardinal Stadium.      Schnatter is still on the company’s board of directors and is its largest shareholder, and the board can’t just remove him, according to people familiar with the matter. Shareholders would have to take that step at the next annual meeting, which is typically held in May. Schnatter, meanwhile, still owns almost 30 percent of the company, which could complicate a potential vote on his ouster.      Schnatter’s tied to the company in other ways, too. His wife, Annette Schnatter, is a Papa John’s franchisee with one restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky, according to the company’s latest proxy statement. Last year, royalties earned by the company from her restaurant were about 76,000. Schnatter’s airline, Hampton Airways Inc., provides business travel to the company as well.      — With assistance by Scott Soshnick ||||| Summary:","output":"Several professional sports teams and collegiate athletic programs have suspended or terminated their sponsorship contracts with Papa John's.

Question: \\"What was rubia tinctorum sometimes mixed with?\\"  Context: \\"The painters of the early Renaissance used two traditional lake pigments, made from mixing dye with either chalk or alum, kermes lake, made from kermes insects, and madder lake, made from the rubia tinctorum plant. With the arrival of cochineal, they had a third, carmine, which made a very fine crimson, though it had a tendency to change color if not used carefully. It was used by almost all the great painters of the 15th and 16th centuries, including Rembrandt, Vermeer, Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Diego Velázquez and Tintoretto. Later it was used by Thomas Gainsborough, Seurat and J.M.W. Turner.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Rubia tinctorum, commonly known as madder, was a crucial source of red pigment during the early Renaissance. This plant-based pigment was widely employed by prominent painters of the time, including Rembrandt, Vermeer, Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Diego Velázquez, and Tintoretto. Upon its arrival, cochineal became another essential red coloring agent that was prized by painters for its intense crimson color, although it required careful handling to prevent color alterations. Madder lake, the pigment derived from rubia tinctorum, was often mixed with various substances to create the desired hue, consistency, and luminosity that artists sought for their works. Some of the elements it was combined with include: 1. Chalk or alum: Madder lake was frequently mixed with chalk or alum to produce traditional lake pigments. The addition of these substances enabled the pigments to adhere better to the painting surface, providing a more substantial color. This practice was common not only for madder lake but also for other vegetable or animal-derived pigments, such as kermes lake, obtained from kermes insects. 2. Oil: As most early Renaissance painters utilized oil paints, it was common to mix madder lake with oil to achieve the appropriate consistency and workability for their artistic techniques. The use of oil allowed for better blending of colors and created a smoother, more translucent effect. 3. Other pigments: To obtain the desired shades and hues, painters often combined madder lake with other pigments, such as ochres, umbers, and azurite. Mixing various pigments helped artists create a wide range of colors and achieve the realism and vibrancy they desired in their works. 4. Binders: To ensure the stability and longevity of their paintings, artists mixed madder lake with binders, such as egg yolk, gum arabic, or various resins. These binders helped create a durable and resistant surface, preventing the pigments from flaking or fading over time. 5. Fillers and extenders: Painters also mixed madder lake with fillers and extenders, such as gypsum, calcium carbonate, or barium sulfate. These substances helped bulk up the pigment, making it less transparent and more opaque. Additionally, they helped control the paint's texture and decrease its gloss. In conclusion, rubia tinctorum, or madder lake, was an essential red pigment during the early Renaissance period, used by many renowned painters. To achieve the desired color, consistency, and longevity, it was often mixed with several substances, such as chalk, alum, oil, other pigments, binders, and fillers. The resulting shades and hues allowed these artists to produce striking compositions that became hallmarks of the period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q: I'm a mod of a small discord server for fans of an internet music reviewer. All we do is talk music.  &amp;#x200B; One day a member joins and immediately starts calling out an inactive member (he used to edit for the music reviewer the server is based on) for being a nazi. He links tweets that are VERY borderline islamophobic. I say borderline because he doesnt encourage violence but still shows a strong despise for islam. He starts defending himself, saying he's not a nazi at all, and that he simply dislikes islam and all religions.  &amp;#x200B; At this point I don't know what to do. The newcomer literally just comes here to tell us to ban someone. And he does so aggressively, he just pukes out all of his anger onto him, which doesn't help at all. I get pissed off at both and engage a conversation with the so called nazi, to see if he actually wants to debate. But he's too busy replying to the other, so I get ignored. However the other doesn't ignore me at all, he actually calls us out for supporting nazis, but we didn't know about these tweets and I can safely say that we disagree with every tweet. The chat becomes a mess, I insult the newcomer for hunting people online. I get off the chat to think for a second.  &amp;#x200B; I DM the admin and we talk this through. We don't see a reason to ban the member. He's never active, and never talked about anything political, never debated or spread hate, so he didn't break any rules. I tell the admin that I want to ban the newcomer for his aggressive behavior, and because I think he's here for no reason, he would probably leave the server if we didn't ban the other person. The admin tells me to wait, since we agree on the latter part. The admin interrupts the chat and things cool down. The newcomer keeps talking in a passive aggressive way, trying to start the fight again, so I say that i'd ban him if he kept talking about that, even if I'd lose my mod role. This server is only for music, I can't stand people that ruins the chat by bringing politics. The admin yields and tell me to go for it. I ban the dude. The other one stays silent. &amp;#x200B; Later, I see a post about it in the subreddit of the music reviewer. They added that the editor in question, after working with the music reviewer, worked with an alt right symphatizer. &amp;#x200B; Every time I encounter someone that has extreme views (in this case, on religion), there're always people that act aggressively or insult them. I'd rather try to engage a conversation to maybe make them change their opinions, or at least to understand why they subscribe to these ideologies. You never know. I know some people that changed. &amp;#x200B; In this case, I didn't discuss with him since he ignored me. I also banned someone that was trying to do the right thing, at least his intention was, his behavior wasn't. We're still arguing with mods if we should ban the alt right dude.

Texas Rural Legal Aid - known for its fearless and sometimes controversial advocacy of the poorest of the poor - last week took over four other corporations serving the legal needs of the indigent in Southwest Texas, including the one in Bexar County. The new 68-county legal aid organization has yet to be named and stretches from El Paso to Corpus Christi, Harlingen to Austin. The leader for the super-sized law firm has big plans. \\"I'm more interested in looking at what we as advocates can do to address the serious problems of poverty than the number of cases we close,\\" said David Hall, the TRLA executive director. In the Rio Grande Valley, Hall's attorneys set up separate groups to assist small-business owners and residents with low-interest loans and legal representation. They also operate a legal arm that assists migrant workers from Texas to Kentucky. Now, Hall said, he wants to make services to the poor more efficient by working with law students who will handle less complicated legal matters, allowing licensed attorneys to take more \\"high impact\\" cases to court. \\"What we need to do is handle cases as efficiently as we can, leveraging the amount of time of the lawyer that goes in there and maximizing the number of people that they can help at one time,\\" Hall said. His plan is to place the 110 attorneys on staff in teams working on specialized legal issues. He wants to expand the law clinic it already has with St. Mary's University Law School to involve students at the University of Texas Law School. The law students at St. Mary's interview potential clients, assist them with filling out legal documents and answer the telephones for the legal hotline, freeing up TRLA lawyers to handle the complicated cases, Hall said. By the end of September, Hall said all the attorneys working with the poor in the 68county area will be placed on the same computer network so they can pass cases to the best available attorneys. Last year, board members on the former Legal Aid of Central Texas and Bexar County Legal Aid resisted the merger, saying that the mergers were done illegally and without the input of board members. They also argued that Hall's litigious style hampered their ability to garner funds from Congress. TRLA generated controversy in 1996, when its attorneys challenged the rights of 800 military personnel to vote in Val Verde County elections by absentee ballot after a former Ku Klux Klan member won a county commissioner post. Brendan Gill, the former executive director of the Bexar County group, said he has since come to see the merger as a positive move for South Texas. \\"I always knew there were good points to merging, just as I knew that there were bad points,\\" Gill said.

Background: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.  Paragraph: Two gardeners started their planting season at the same time. Bill used mycorrizal fungi compost for the garden, while Hank used regular top soil. Bill was very happy with the harvest.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which gardener observed more improved water absorption from the soil?

Thomas Jefferson Destry, Jr. (Jimmy Stewart) is the deputy sheriff without a gun. He believes the law and public opinion is the answer to outlaws and gunfights. Bottleneck is a lawless town run by bad guys and gunslingers. Kent (Brian Donlevy), a host of gunslingers, the corrupt Judge Slade (Samuel S. Hinds), crooked gamblers and dishonest saloon gal Frenchy (Marlene Dietrich) were cheating, stealing, and forcing farmers to sell them their land against their will in order to have control of all the land when the railroad comes through the territory. The outlaws kill the old sheriff because he is wise to their game. In order to keep law and order out of Bottleneck, Judge Slade appoints the town drunk and apparently incompetent Washington Dimsdale (Charles Winninger) to be the new sheriff. Charles sobers up and is shocked by the news, but steps up to the challenge. Before he was a drunk he had been deputy for Sheriff Tom Destry Sr., who was the roughest, toughest sheriff of all time. Destry Sr. used his fists and his guns to clean up the lawless town, and was Sheriff there until gutless outlaws shot him in the back. Sheriff Dimsdale wires for the younger Destry, the most crack-shot Sheriff of Bottleneck since Destry, Sr. The towns villains hear about Destrys reputation and decide to meet his stagecoach in Bottleneck, and give him a not-quite-warm welcome. When the stage arrives, to everyones surprise, Destry is carrying a birdcage and parasol because he is helping a female passenger - a sweet Bottleneck girl he fancies - debark from the stage. The entire town roars with laughter at the sight of the new deputy who appears to fall short of the lawman ideal. The new sheriff is agreeable and unconcerned about the mocking. Later, he goes to the saloon and attends unarmed: I dont believe in guns, he tells the astounded locals. This prompts more ridiculing from the outlaws. Destry then meets Frenchy, who has a cat fight with a Russians wife who has come to claim her husbands pants after Frenchy won...

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose friends sneak a copy of the play to Sam Harris? ?  In 1929 young Brooklynite Moss Hart, influenced by the great playwrights, devotes his leisure time to writing for the theater. Failing in his aspirations, however, he accepts a job as social director in the Catskills and then stages plays at the YMHA in Newark.  Eventually he takes the advice of agent Richard Maxwell and writes a comedy, Once in a Lifetime, which deals with the early days of Hollywood films, despite the fact that his knowledge of the movie industry is derived from the pages of Variety.  After being subsidized by a friend, Joe Hyman, he sends the manuscript to producer Warren Stone, who promises a decision within a week. When months pass without any word, Hart's friends sneak a copy of the play to Sam Harris, who agrees to produce it if George Kaufman will collaborate on the script and also direct.  Although Kaufman consents, the Atlantic City opening is a failure, and he considers quitting until Hart comes up with an idea that both men feel will turn the play into a hit. It finally opens to rave reviews in New York City in September 1930, thus beginning the long-lasting Kaufman-Hart collaboration.

Tell Kim Jung Un he is doing a good thing.; Given those answer options, answer the question: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies.

After the Summit, Beasley, as the Executive Director of the WFP, will likely work towards increasing humanitarian aid to North Korea. This is because the North Korean leadership is hopeful that, following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for the millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition.

Things began well for the Raiders as Jalen Richard returned the opening kick 50 yards and Derek Carr hit Andre Holmes for a three-yard touchdown pass to put the Raiders up 7-0. However, the struggling Raiders defense continued to have problems stopping opponents as the Chiefs scored on a two-yard touchdown run by Spencer Ware and a four-yard run by Jamaal Charles (extra point failed), putting the Chiefs in front 13-7. The Raiders were able to get a field goal from Sebastian Janikowski as the half ended to pull within 13-10. However, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid, who is 16-2 in his career coming off of bye weeks, continued to baffle the Raiders defense in the second half. The Chiefs added a one-yard run by defensive lineman Dontari Poe and two field goals by Cairo Santos to go up 26-10. The Raiders offense managed nothing in the second half and the Chiefs won 26-10.

If People were always aware of the issue [of gender], but I was never denied an opportunity., can we conclude that \\"Opportunities are never denied due to gender for anyone.\\"? Pick from: 1). yes 2). it is not possible to tell 3). no","output":"2). It is not possible to tell It is important to remember that personal experiences differ widely, which makes it impossible to draw such a broad, overarching conclusion that \\"opportunities are never denied due to gender for anyone\\" based on one individual's experience. While it's great to hear that the person in question has never faced gender-based discrimination in terms of opportunities, this is not necessarily the case for everyone. Gender discrimination does occur, to varying degrees, in different parts of the world, cultures, and workplaces. In some instances, it may be subtle or even unintentional, while in others, it can be overt and clear. There are multiple factors to consider when evaluating whether opportunities are consistently denied due to gender. Some of these factors include: 1. Geographical location: The country or region someone lives in can play a significant role in whether or not they experience gender-based discrimination. In certain regions, social norms and cultural expectations may impose strict limitations on the opportunities available to particular genders. 2. Industry: Discrimination may be more prevalent in some industries than in others. For example, historically male-dominated sectors such as engineering or construction might have more instances of gender discrimination, while other sectors may exhibit greater equality. 3. Workplace culture: A specific workplace's culture can play a significant role in how opportunities are offered (or not offered) based on gender. Some organizations may have a more inclusive and progressive culture where gender discrimination is minimized, while others may perpetuate traditional gender norms and expectations. 4. Intersectionality: It is important to consider other factors such as race, class, and sexual orientation when analyzing inequalities in opportunities. These factors can intersect with gender in such a way that they compound the discrimination one faces. For example, a woman of color may be subject to both sexism and racism, which may further limit opportunities available to her. 5. Legal protection: While many countries have anti-discrimination laws in place, the effectiveness of these laws, as well as the cultural enforcement of such regulations, may vary. This can influence the degree to which gender discrimination occurs. In conclusion, while the statement \\"I was never denied an opportunity\\" indicates that opportunities are not denied due to gender in some individual cases, it is not possible to generalize this experience to everyone. Gender discrimination is a complex and multifaceted issue that depends on a variety of factors. Therefore, claiming opportunities are \\"never denied due to gender for anyone\\" would be an inaccurate and misleading conclusion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Kathy, Frankie, Ellen, Charles  for the following movie plot:  Two campers are nearby when a meteor falls to Earth and lands in the woods near their campsite. When they go to investigate, they are attacked and eaten by a bizarre lifeform that emerges from the crashed rock, mostly unseen but apparently consisting of multiple heads with hundreds of teeth.Nearby the crash site is a large house located on a rural plot of land. The house is the home of Sam (James L. Brewster) and Barb (Elissa Neil), and their two school-age children, high school age Pete (Tom DeFranco) and his younger brother Charles (Charles George Hildebrandt). Visiting are Aunt Millie (Ethel Michelson) and Uncle Herb (John Schmerling).Sam and Barb rise before anybody else is awake; they have an unspecified trip planned, which Barb hopes can be put off because of the incessant rainstorm. Sam insists, and he goes downstairs to check the basement for flooding. A flapping basement window suggests that the creature from the meteor has taken refuge in the cellar, and sure enough, when Sam goes into the basement, he is eaten by the bizarre monstrosity. Barb suffers the same fate when she goes down to see what happened to Sam; the creature corners her and viciously bites off her face.Aunt Millie is awakened by screaming, but she attributes it to the horror movie that Charles is watching on TV in his room. Charles is obsessed with magic, monsters, and scaring people. When Aunt Millie returns to call Charles to breakfast, he surprises her by wearing a scary mask and costume and setting off flash powder when she opens the door.

It's important to note that the structure of sentences in Turkish can be quite different from English.  In this translation, \\"Bir iyi gazeteci\\" means \\"A good journalist.\\" The verb \\"olmalıdır\\" is a combined form of \\"olmalı\\" which signifies 'should be' and the suffix \\"-dır\\" which is mostly used as a confirmative or explanatory mood in Turkish.  \\"Her zaman\\" expresses the time frame indicated by \\"at all times\\". Finally, \\"tamamen objektif\\" captures the sense of \\"totally objective.\\" As such, Turkish language sentences often follow a different order than English sentences, usually a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) format, as opposed to the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure commonly used in English. However, in this case, the sentence structure remains the same in both languages.  It's interesting to note how languages can maintain the same meaning while changing the structure and order of phrases and sentences. This is an example of why translation often requires more than simply changing words from one language to another; it often involves restructuring sentences and making sure the correct meaning is preserved.  Therefore, in learning and translating Turkish or any other language, it's important to understand the nuances and unique constructs of that language so as to accurately convey the intended meaning."},{"instruction":"Choices:  (a). roads.

Lord Harris of Haringey said the Home Office should consider combining the Met Police, the City of London Police and the British Transport Police (BTP). The review was ordered by mayor Sadiq Khan to assess London's security. Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said there was \\"good argument\\" for a merger, but others had concerns. Saying the current set-up was \\"confusing\\" and the move would save money, Sir Bernard added: \\"We should get improved operational effectiveness and that's what this report is talking about: how to respond to a terrorist incident - would we respond better together? And I think we would.\\" But the City of London Police said the paper itself had noted that merging forces would cause \\"significant disruption\\". In his review Lord Harris, a security adviser who chaired the Metropolitan Police Authority, concluded that any response to a terror attack would now be \\"substantially faster and more effective\\" than five years ago. But, he said, even though the intelligence agencies and the counter-terrorist police operating in London were among the best in the world, the city should be prepared for an attack with multiple fatalities. The review also found that, once the Met had completed its recruitment of 600 extra firearms officers, there would be no need for a further increase. To do so \\"would be at the cost of transforming the look and feel of our capital city\\", it said. A total of 127 recommendations were made in the paper. Lord Harris also said live CCTV streaming should be extended across London. Earlier this year Mr Khan intervened after Westminster Council announced it would turn off its fixed CCTV cameras to save money. City of London Police said it welcomed the review but warned against merging it with the Met. \\"As the report clearly states, policing in London needs stability and certainty, not upheaval and disruption,\\" they said. The BTP's Paul Crowther welcomed the report but said: \\"Over the past eight years, there have been a number of studies that have examined the rationale and effectiveness of a dedicated transport police force. \\"Each study has unequivocally concluded that there is a need for a specialist national force, which can provide 'end to end' policing and an understanding of this complex environment.\\" What is a summary of this text?","output":"Lord Harris of Haringey has proposed merging the Met Police, the City of London Police, and the British Transport Police (BTP) in a review ordered by London mayor Sadiq Khan to assess the city's security.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"The hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. In fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise. Let's analyze both statements in detail to understand the differences between them. Premise: The move was smooth, relaxed, and very impressive. In this statement, the premise is putting forth the idea that the move (which could refer to a physical maneuver, a transition from one location to another, or even a strategic decision) was executed seamlessly. The use of the words \\"smooth,\\" \\"relaxed,\\" and \\"very impressive\\" indicates that the move was well-thought-out, organized, efficient, and successful in its execution. From this statement, we would surmise that the people or entities involved in the move were pleased with the outcome and could rightfully feel a sense of accomplishment. Hypothesis: The move was awkward and ill-planned. This hypothesis presents an entirely different view of the move. Rather than the positive adjectives used in the premise, the hypothesis uses negative descriptors such as \\"awkward\\" and \\"ill-planned.\\" These descriptors suggest a sense of disorganization, discomfort, and challenges experienced during the move. This could mean that the decision-making was disjointed and caused undesirable consequences or unexpected issues. In this case, based on the hypothesis, we can infer dissatisfaction with the move and a potentially difficult or problematic outcome. Upon analyzing both the premise and hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.

In which organism ATP molecules would be produced, sample A or sample B?  Bob is a biologist. Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic.  Hint: There must be more to this story than just gas exchange with the environment. To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis. Answer:","output":"Based on the given paragraph, ATP molecules would be produced in sample A. The paragraph gives a hint about the correlation between the respiration rate, energy use, and the ATP production, which reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. This process takes place during cellular respiration, which is the process by which cells consume oxygen in order to produce usable energy. This energy is converted from glucose in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. In the given scenario, Bob, the biologist, induced a higher respiration rate in sample A and induced no respiration rate in sample B. Since the respiration rate is a key component for ATP production, it would logically follow that the process of ATP production would occur in the sample where respiration is occurring i.e. sample A. This is because a higher respiration rate would mean that more oxygen is being consumed, leading to more glucose being broken down - thereby producing more ATP molecules. Conversely, Sample B which has no respiration occurring would not produce ATP as there is no use of oxygen to break down the glucose into ATP. Moreover, the paragraph indicates that ATP production correlates with energy usage which tends to be higher in organisms that have higher respiration rates. This further supports the deduction that Sample A - not Sample B - would be the organism where ATP molecules would be produced.  The paragraph does not provide enough information regarding samples C and D's relationship with ATP production directly. However, it implies that both heterotrophic organisms (like sample C) and autotrophic organisms (like sample D) can produce ATP - the former acquires glucose from other organisms, and the latter makes their own glucose primarily through photosynthesis. However, in context of the given information, ATP production is specifically linked to the process of respiration - such high levels of which are observed in Sample A only."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who did Oskar confide in? Movie title: Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close Movie plot: Nine-year-old Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn), who suffers from Asperger syndrome, is the son of German American Thomas Schell (Tom Hanks).[5] Thomas would often send Oskar on missions to do something involving one of his riddles. The last riddle he ever gives Oskar is proof that New York City once possessed a Sixth Borough. In a flashback, Thomas and Oskar play a scavenger hunt to find objects throughout New York City. The game requires communication with other people and is not easy for the socially awkward Oskar who is told \\"If things were easy to find, they wouldn't be worth finding\\". On September 11, 2001, Oskar and his classmates are sent home from school early while his mother Linda (Sandra Bullock) is at work. When Oskar gets home, he finds five messages from his father on the answering machine saying he is in the World Trade Center. When Thomas calls for the sixth time, although Oskar is present to answer this call, he is too scared to answer. The machine records a sixth message which stops when the building collapses. Oskar knows his father has been killed and falls to the floor. He replaces the answering machine with a new one and hides the old one so his mother will never find out. A few weeks after what Oskar calls \\"the worst day,\\" he confides in his German grandmother and they become closer. Oskar's relationship with his mother worsens since she cannot explain why the World Trade Center was attacked and why his father died. Oskar tells his mother he wishes it had been her in the building, not his father, and she responds, \\"So do I\\". After, Oskar says he did not mean it, but his mother doesn't believe him. A year later, Oskar finds a vase in his father's closet with a key in an envelope with the word \\"Black\\" on it. He vows to find what the key fits. He finds 472 Blacks in the New York phone book and plans to meet each of them to see if they knew his father. He first meets Abby Black (Viola Davis), who has recently divorced her husband. She tells Oskar she did not know his father. One day, Oskar... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\\", the primary character young Oskar Schell, who is dealing with the profound loss of his father Thomas Schell in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, confides in his German grandmother in the wake of this tragedy. Oskar carries an immense weight of personal guilt and grief after choosing not to answer his father's final phone call from the World Trade Center and subsequently replacing the answering machine which recorded the final messages so his mother Linda, who was at work during the event, could not hear them. At this turning point in his life, Oskar turns to his grandmother for emotional support and solace. Their bond strengthens further as they navigate their way through shared sorrow and loss. Simultaneously, Oskar's relationship with his mother grows strained as he grapples with her inability or unwillingness to explain the reasons for the attack and his father's death. At one point in his emotional despair, he even tells his mother that he would have preferred it if she had been the one in the building instead of his father, an outburst that greatly affects their relationship, despite Oskar subsequently retracting his words. Later in his bereavement journey, Oskar finds a key in his father's closet, which acts as a kind of legacy or posthumous riddle from his father, a man who had a penchant for sending him on riddle-solving missions and scavenger hunts. Enclosed in an envelope marked \\"Black\\", this key sets Oskar off on a mission to find its corresponding lock. As part of this mission, he plans to meet all 472 people named Black that he can find in the New York phone book, hoping that this journey will reveal the purpose and significance of his father's key, and perhaps, help him process his own feelings of loss and displacement. His first visit is with Abby Black, who unfortunately, could not provide Oskar with the information he was looking for. In summary, Oskar confides and seeks solace in his grandmother during his time of profound grief, and embarks on an emotionally-charged mission sparked by a key left by his late father. Even if you as an investor are not aware of specific finer details of the plot, the movie showcases an emotional journey of a young child through a pivotal moment in history, offering a unique perspective on grief, growth, and coming-of-age, all of these presenting potentially valuable facets that may make the movie worthwhile to invest in."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On the face of it a film about women wanting to see a football match wouldn't appeal much to somebody with little interest in football such as myself however this isn't about football it is about discrimination and the women's enthusiasm for the sport they love. The film opens on the day of a crucial World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain, a girl is trying to get in to Tehran's Azadi Stadium by dressing like a boy, it looks like she will get in until a soldier tries to search her. Once caught she is taken to a small enclosure high up on the outside of the stadium where there are a handful of women who had already been caught, here they are guarded by a small group of conscript soldiers who's leader would rather be back home tending his livestock. We never learn the character's names but we get to know them as people as the girls plead with the guards to let them watch though a nearby gap in the wall and when refused try to get them to at least provide a commentary. As well as making an important point about the rigid gender segregation in much of present day Iran the film contains many hilarious moments such as the \\"disguise\\" one of the girls is made to wear when going to the toilet and the girl who disguised herself as a soldier and was only caught because she chose to watch the match from a seat reserved for a senior officer. The girls enthusiasm for the game is such that by the end the viewer is likely to be on the edge of their seat hoping that Iran will win and thus get to go to the finals in Germany. The soldiers aren't shown as fundamentalists, they are just conscripts who are there because they have to be and when explaining to the girls why woman can't watch men's sports don't seem that convinced by their own arguments. It is a shame that this film can't be seen in Iran itself but it is good that the wider world can see it and thus see that ordinary Iranians aren't a bunch of fanatics desperate to wage war on the west but normal people with the same passions and concerns as people everywhere. The cast did a great job in making their characters seem like real people rather than mere caricatures. Would you say this review is positive or negative?

Context: It’s October, which means it’s that time of the year again: flu vaccination time! Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here’s what I’ll cover: * The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu * What to know about flu shots for older adults * What’s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu...

Generate an approximately fifteen-word sentence that describes all this data: United States LANGUAGE English language; A Wizard of Mars COUNTRY United States","output":"The data provided outlines that the book \\"A Wizard of Mars\\" is written in English and was published in the United States. Interestingly, the shared language between the nation of publication and the language the book is written in is a significant factor. This suggests that the book was likely intended for an audience within the United States or people who are proficient in English. Firstly, reflecting on the piece of data that the language is English. English is a widely used language not only in the United States but across the world. Therefore, English language books have a vast potential readership. However, noting that the book's country is the United States, it could hint that the author is from the U.S., or the book was first published there, impacting the context or culture represented in the novel.  The title \\"A Wizard of Mars\\" suggests a fantasy or science fiction genre, offering a glimpse into the kind of storyline the book might present. If the book was indeed published in the United States, it would likely reflect the aspects of American culture, idioms, references, and even the thought process that the author wants to portray to the readers. This specificity could have important implications for understanding the text, especially for international readers. Moreover, the U.S. is home to one of the biggest global publishing industries. This means that a book published in the United States is more likely to reach a broad audience and have a significant cultural impact. Additionally, English language books from the U.S. often get translated into many different languages, which could further extend the book's reach and influence. However, there's only minimal data given about the book, so it would be helpful to have additional information for more accurate analysis. For instance, knowing the author's biography can provide more context about the perspective and experiences the book might reflect. Knowing when the book was published would also give insight into the historical and cultural context of that time period, which could greatly aid in the book's interpretation. The book \\"A Wizard of Mars\\", written in the English language and published in the United States, therefore, represents a piece of the diverse mosaic of the American and global literature scene. It facilitates cultural exchange through the universal English language and gives readers around the world a glimpse into the imaginations and creative expressions rooted in its country of origin. However, to fully appreciate and understand any piece of literature, a larger context, including the author's backgrounds, the era of its publication, and the society it was published in, is crucially important. Despite the lack of such information in the given data, the knowledge that it's a U.S. published English book already gives a substantial starting point for any literary exploration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The three Kansas militiamen planned to blow up an apartment complex housing Somali refugees during the 2016 presidential election, unleashing what one of them called \\"Crusades 2.0.\\" But their plan was foiled after their arrest just weeks before the election, highlighting the changing enemy list of a movement founded on the back of anti-government activism a generation ago. And with the election of a president whose policies many militia members support, the urge to confront the government appears to have lost some of its urgency. Instead of railing at the government, they have in recent years turned their venom against new-found foes: Muslims, immigrants, the Antifa. \\"Some of the militia groups have been refocusing their attention on secondary enemies for the movement,\\" said Mark Pitcavage, who researches extremism at the Anti-Defamation League civil rights group. Often lumped together with other right-wing groups, the anti-government movement comes in different forms. There are the \\"preppers,\\" so called because they stockpile water, food and other essentials in preparation for civil unrest. There are the \\"survivalists,\\" people who learn skills to “live off the land” in case of a disaster. There are “sovereign citizens” such as the suspect in the recent shooting at a Waffle House in Tennessee who are opposed to paying taxes and believe they should decide which laws to follow. And then there are the militiamen who conduct regular military-style training to resist a government they see as engaged in a global plot to take away their guns and constitutional rights. The modern militia movement dates back to a series of events in the early 1990s, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Director Kelly Reichardt is praised for her generous and humane approach to filmmaking, crafting a small yet powerful film that captures the emotional journey of its characters. Michelle Williams gives an extraordinary performance that forms the core of the film, with her portrayal of Wendy allowing viewers to fully engage with her character's struggles and losses. Her connection with her dog, Lucy, adds depth and emotional resonance to the story, and helps to drive the narrative forward. Although the plot may be slow-moving and devoid of many typical dramatic events, the attention to detail in each shot allows for a character-driven narrative that is both compelling and heart-wrenching. Comparisons have been made to the classic Italian film Bicycle Thieves, suggesting that Wendy and Lucy may be a modern take on that story's themes of loss and perseverance in the face of economic hardship. Similarly, some critics have referred to Wendy and Lucy as a prime example of \\"New Recession Cinema,\\" highlighting its relevance to contemporary socio-economic issues. Despite being minimalistic and occasionally slow-paced, Wendy and Lucy has garnered appreciation for its ability to deliver a powerful and deeply affecting dramatic experience in just 80 minutes. The careful execution of each scene and the strong performances from the cast, particularly Michelle Williams, contribute to the lasting impact the film has on its viewers.

The authoritarian leader has been in office for more than 20 years in the impoverished former Soviet republic. The EU and the US have not recognised a single election in the Central Asian country as free and fair. Polls across the mountainous country were due to open at 01:00 GMT and close at 15:00 GMT. By Abdujalil AbdurasulovBBC News, Almaty Central Asia is widely known for its obscure \\"Stans\\" - to be found at the bottom of most democracy rankings.  Tajikistan is not the worst in the region but presidential elections there are hardly any different from its neighbours. For Emomali Rakhmon, these will be his fourth elections and there is little doubt he will win again.  He is competing against virtually unknown politicians and the only credible opposition candidate has criticised what she called artificial obstacles and intimidation, which prevented her from running for the presidency. However, analysts say the elections may bring some change, although not necessarily in the government or its policies.  People's perceptions and attitudes towards the government could change if mass irregularities take place on voting day. The international community will also be watching the elections closely. As part of the withdrawal campaign, Nato and the US will ship some of their equipment out of Afghanistan through Central Asia, including Tajikistan. Preliminary results are expected on Thursday. Tajikistan's official electoral commission has already declared the presidential election as valid. The head of the electoral commission, Shermuhammad Shohiyon, told Tajik state television that 68% of registered voters had already cast their ballots by 14:00 local time (09:00 GMT) - easily surpassing the minimum 50% participation required to validate the vote. Mr Rakhmon, who secured 79% of the vote in the 2006 election, did not campaign actively this time. Instead, the president relied on extensive media coverage of his visits around the country, which his opponents say was heavily biased in his favour. Election monitors complained when their bus turned up bearing a poster of the president on the windscreen. The bus company removed the poster. The opposition accuses Mr Rakhmon - whose huge billboards are seen everywhere in the capital Dushanbe and other towns - of developing a personality cult. He denies the claim. The five other presidential candidates have refrained from publicly criticising Mr Rakhmon. Human rights activists Oynihol Bobonazarova - widely seen as the only genuine opposition candidate - was banned from the polls. The electoral commission said earlier she had failed to collect the necessary 210,000 signatures of eligible voters to be officially registered. Despite the expected easy victory, critics say Mr Rakhmon will face rising social tension in the country where some 50% of the population live in poverty. Almost half of the nation's GDP is earned by more than one million Tajik migrants working abroad, especially in Russia, Analysts say Tajikistan could also face further security challenges from Islamist groups in neighbouring Afghanistan after the planned pullout of the US-led forces next year. Tajikistan was devastated by the 1992-97 civil war between the Moscow-backed government and the Islamist-led opposition. Up to 50,000 were killed before the conflict ended with a UN-brokered peace agreement. What is a summary of this text?","output":"This article discusses the presidential elections in Tajikistan, with incumbent leader Emomali Rakhmon expected to win his fourth term in office.

Authorities might find out Tuesday whether a body was buried under a shed in Roseville, Michigan. They just won't know whether it's missing Teamster boss Jimmy Hoffa or not. Two soil samples were taken from a home in the suburban Detroit community of Roseville last week after a tipster claimed he saw a body buried on the property a day after Hoffa disappeared in 1975. The samples were taken from beneath a storage shed and sent to a lab at Michigan State University for tests to determine the presence of human remains. The hope had been to get the findings back sometime Monday. But in a press release issued Monday afternoon, Roseville Police Chief James Berlin said he'd been told that, while testing had begun, \\"the results of those tests will not be available until early (Tuesday) morning.\\" What police do know is that the samples that were unearthed didn't contain any \\"discernible remains,\\" such as bones, body parts or other evidence, according to Berlin. The search of the Roseville property is the latest in an on-again, off-again search for Hoffa, whose disappearance 35 years ago captured the public imagination. Hoffa, then 62, was last seen on July 30, 1975, outside the Detroit-area Machus Red Fox restaurant. He was there ostensibly to meet with reputed Detroit Mafia street enforcer Anthony Giacalone and Genovese crime family figure Anthony Provenzano, who was also a chief of a Teamsters local in New Jersey. Giacalone died in 1982; Provenzano died in 1988 in prison. The tipster, a former gambler, once did business with a man tied to Giacalone, said Dan Moldea, author of \\"The Hoffa Wars.\\" Moldea said he first spoke to the tipster in March and then sent him to police. Vanished Hoffa still fascinates after almost 40 years. Despite those links, Moldea said it seems unlikely that anyone would have been buried at the site, in full view of the neighborhood. And if a body had been buried there, little would remain, he said. The lab tests being conducted on the soil samples will be able to determine if human remains were buried at the site, but will not identify them, Berlin said. If human remains are discovered, investigators would have to return for a more complete excavation, he said. Even so, Berlin doubts any possible human remains discovered at the house would be those of Hoffa. \\"It would be great if it was, because I would like to bring closure to his family and the tens of thousands of Teamsters that idolize this man, and just the southeast of Michigan,\\" Berlin said. \\"This is kind of like an open wound that won't go away. Every couple of years this happens, and all you guys come out here and we have to relive it.\\" But Berlin said the \\"time line doesn't really add up.\\" Hoffa was of the most powerful union leaders at a time when unions wielded enormous political sway. He was forced out of the organized labor movement when he went to federal prison in 1967 for jury tampering and fraud. President Richard Nixon pardoned him in 1971 on condition he not attempt to get back into the union movement before 1980. Hoffa believed Giacalone had set up the meeting to help settle a feud between Hoffa and Provenzano, but Hoffa was the only one who showed up for the meeting, according to the FBI. Giacalone and Provenzano later told the FBI that no meeting had been scheduled. The FBI said at the time that the disappearance could have been linked to Hoffa's efforts to regain power in the Teamsters and the mob's influence over the union's pension funds. Police and the FBI have searched for Hoffa intermittently. In September 2001, the FBI found DNA that linked Hoffa to a car that agents suspected was used in his disappearance. In 2004, authorities removed floorboards from a Detroit home to look for traces of blood, as former Teamsters official Frank Sheeran claimed in a biography that he had shot Hoffa. Sheeran died in 2003. Two years later, the FBI razed a horse barn in Michigan following what it called \\"a fairly credible lead.\\" Urban lore long suggested that Hoffa was buried around the end zone at the former Giants Stadium in New Jersey. CNN's Chuck Johnston and Stephanie Gallman contributed to this report. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Authorities are conducting tests on soil samples taken from beneath a storage shed in Roseville, Michigan, following a tip that a body was buried there a day after Jimmy Hoffa, a missing Teamster boss, disappeared in 1975.

I have a new situation: Two countries situated at different latitudes are exposed to climate change. Iceland is located closer to the North Pole, while Ecuador is located near the Equator.  But I can use this background: During the Cold War, the Arctic became a place where the United States, Canada, and the Soviet Union performed significant research that has been essential to the study of climate change in recent years. A major reason why research in the Arctic is essential for the study of climate change is because the effects of climate change will be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world as above average temperatures are predicted for Northwest Canada and Alaska. From an anthropological point of view, researchers study the native Inuit peoples of Alaska as they have become extremely accustomed to adapting to ecological and climate variability.[1]  What is an answer for this question: Which country will feel the effects of climate change more quickly? The answer to this question is:","output":"Iceland will feel the effects of climate change more quickly. The given background information states that the effects of climate change will be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world, as above average temperatures are predicted for places like Northwest Canada and Alaska. Since Iceland is located closer to the North Pole, it is situated at a higher latitude than Ecuador, which is near the Equator.  Moreover, anthropological research on the native Inuit peoples of Alaska highlights the importance of studying the effects of climate change on communities that have adapted to ecological and climate variability. This further reinforces the notion that areas closer to the poles, like Iceland, are more susceptible to the immediate impacts of climate change when compared to countries near the Equator, such as Ecuador. Taking all these factors into consideration, it can be concluded that Iceland will likely experience the effects of climate change more quickly than Ecuador."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Gaddafi summarized Third International Theory in three short volumes published between 1975 and 1979, collectively known as The Green Book.

The second dealt with Gaddafi's beliefs regarding socialism, while the third explored social issues regarding the family and the tribe. While the first two volumes advocated radical reform, the third adopted a socially conservative stance, proclaiming that while men and women were equal, they were biologically designed for different roles in life. During the years that followed, Gaddafists adopted quotes from The Green Book, such as \\"Representation is Fraud\\", as slogans.

Answer: A:","output":"The tone of this product review is predominantly negative. Multiple aspects of the review point towards this negative perception of the work being reviewed, which is the latest Grimes effort. The reviewer expresses disappointment, dissatisfaction, and disapproval in various ways throughout their review. To begin with, the title, \\"Bury This One Deep,\\" suggests that the reviewer would rather see the work hidden and forgotten rather than celebrated or recommended to others. This expression implies a strong sense of distaste and disapproval towards the book. The statement \\"This latest Grimes effort has hit the bottom,\\" further emphasizes this negative tone. It implies that the reviewer believes this particular work is the lowest point in Grimes' career and has reached a level of quality well below any previous books she has authored. The use of the phrase \\"hit the bottom\\" is a common way to express that something has reached its lowest point and is considered terrible. As the reviewer continues, they provide specific criticisms about the content and writing style of the book, including the shift from \\"great descriptive British cozies\\" to \\"overbearing psychological portrayals of even the most minor characters.\\" Mentioning a preference for Grimes' earlier work reflects a strong sense of disappointment and frustration in the perceived decline of her work's quality. A direct comparison to another author, Ruth Rendell, is made as well with a negative implication. The phrase \\"Ruth Rendell She's not\\" suggests that the reviewer believes that Grimes is attempting to mimic Rendell's style, but has failed to execute it properly. This observation further highlights the growing dissatisfaction with Grimes' current writing. Towards the end of the review, the reviewer expresses a strong desire for Grimes to \\"put DCI Jury in his GRAVE and spare him any more embarrassment,\\" which is yet another sign of their disapproval. They are essentially requesting the author to put an end to the series and character, believing that continuing would only cause further degradation of Grimes' reputation. In conclusion, the overall tone of this product review is decisively negative. The reviewer communicates their displeasure in several ways, such as the title, unfavorable comparisons to earlier work, and specific criticisms relating to the book's content and style. Furthermore, they suggest that the author should cease working with the main character, implying a belief that the work should be buried and forgotten."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

These questions can range from a variety of topics like simple arithmetic, solving equations, converting a quantity from one unit to another, finding remainders/GCD/LCM, finding probabilities etc. Each question has only one correct answer. This answer can be a positive or negative integer, a fraction or a decimal number. If the answer is a negative number use the hyphen (e.g. -42) symbol for the minus sign. For decimal numbers, do not add extra zeros after the decimal point. For fractional numbers, separate the numerator and denominator using a forward slash (e.g. 3/25). Input: Suppose -60 = 5*w - 160. Let p(j) = 1 + 4*j - j - 4*j. Let l be p(-2). Solve 5*i + 5*x + w = 0, 4*x + 8 = -l*i + 3*x for i. Output:","output":"First, let's break down the problem step by step. Step 1: Solve for w in the equation -60 = 5*w - 160. 5*w = -60 + 160 5*w = 100 w = 100/5 w = 20 Step 2: Find p(j) and substitute j with -2 to get the value of l. p(j) = 1 + 4*j - j - 4*j p(-2) = 1 + 4*(-2) - (-2) - 4*(-2) p(-2) = 1 - 8 + 2 + 8 p(-2) = 3 So, l = 3 Step 3: Solve the system of linear equations by substituting the determined values of w and l. 5*i + 5*x + w = 0 4*x + 8 = -l*i + 3*x Substitute w = 20 and l = 3 in the equations: 5*i + 5*x + 20 = 0 4*x + 8 = -3*i + 3*x Simplify the first equation: 5*i + 5*x = -20 Divide the first equation by 5: i + x = -4 (1) Simplify the second equation: x - 3*i = -8 (2) Now we need to solve these two equations for i: (1) i + x = -4 (2) x - 3*i = -8 From (1), we can express x in terms of i: x = -4 - i Substitute this expression in equation (2): (-4 - i) - 3*i = -8 -4 - 4*i = -8 Add 4 to both sides: -4*i = -4 Divide both sides by -4: i = 1 Thus, the value of i is 1."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Comparing these two pieces of information, we can see that the first statement only tells us that there are three people at work. However, it doesn't specify their age, gender, or the type of work they are engaged in. On the other hand, the second statement provides more specific details about the individuals and their occupation. Step 3: Choose the appropriate answer based on the comparison. Since the first statement does not provide enough information to identify who the three people at work are, it is not possible to tell whether the conclusion \\"two elderly women and a man working in a meat store\\" is accurate.
