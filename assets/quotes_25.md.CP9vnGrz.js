How much longer will it take you if you don't get your money back until the end of your contract?","output":"If you need 8 for rent and two years of subscriptions, that adds up to 8 + 2 * 12 = <<8+2*12=28>>28.  If you work 10 hours at a library and you can read books for free, it's likely that you are earning less than 28 per hour.  If you don't get your money back until the end of your contract, that means you won't have any extra income to pay for the rent and subscriptions until then.  Assuming you continue to work at the library for two years, you will be earning 10/hour * 40 hours/week * 52 weeks/year * 2 years = <<10*40*52*2=104000>>104,000.  Subtracting the 28 you need for rent and subscriptions from that amount, you have 104,000 - 28 = <<104000-28=103972>>103,972 left over.

The total spend of 2,750,000 exceeds the given budget of 1,000,000.  To allocate the budget for next month, we need to prioritize platforms that have a lower cost per conversion. This means that we should focus on platforms that provide a higher number of conversions for a lower cost. Based on the data provided, Snapchat has the lowest cost per conversion at 33.33, followed by TikTok at 38.33, Pinterest at 59.15, and NAME_1 at 70.59. To allocate the budget, we can consider the following approach: 1. Reduce the spend on NAME_1: Since NAME_1 has the highest cost per conversion and exceeds the budget, it would be advisable to reduce or eliminate the spend on this platform. 2. Increase the spend on Snapchat and TikTok: Both Snapchat and TikTok have lower cost per conversions compared to Pinterest. Therefore, it would be beneficial to allocate a larger portion of the budget to these platforms. 3. Maintain or slightly reduce the spend on Pinterest: Although Pinterest has a higher cost per conversion compared to Snapchat and TikTok, it still provides a reasonable number of conversions. Therefore, it would be advisable to maintain or slightly reduce the spend on this platform. Based on these considerations, a potential budget allocation for next month could be: - Snapchat: 500,000 (50% of the budget) - TikTok: 300,000 (30% of the budget) - Pinterest: 200,000 (20% of the budget) Please note that these allocations are just suggestions based on the given data.

What's new?"},{"instruction":"yo! when I work on some mathematical or logical problem during the day and I struggle finding a solution, usually I find a solution while falling asleep. sometimes also while waking up. is that normal?","output":"Yes, it's normal to find solutions to problems while falling asleep or waking up. This phenomenon is known as the \\"hypnopompic state,\\" which is a period of consciousness immediately following sleep. During this time, your mind is still in a somewhat dreamy, relaxed state, which can allow for insights and connections to form more easily. There are a few reasons why you might find solutions to problems during these periods: 1. REM sleep: When you're falling asleep, your brain is transitioning from a state of alertness to a state of relaxation. This period, called the hypnagogic state, can be conducive to creative thinking and problem-solving, as your mind is less focused on the stresses and distractions of the day. 2. Subconscious processing: When you're struggling with a problem, your conscious mind may be preoccupied and unable to find the solution. However, your subconscious mind continues to work on the problem in the background. By the time you fall asleep, your subconscious might have developed an answer, and you suddenly become aware of the solution while in a sleepy state. 3. Relaxation and reduced stress: The state of relaxation you experience when falling asleep or waking up can help reduce stress and anxiety. As a result, your mind may feel more open to new ideas and connections, which can help you solve problems. 4. Dreaming: While you're asleep, your brain processes information and experiences, which can lead to unexpected connections and insights. If you wake up with a solution, it's possible that your dreams played a role in finding the answer. To take advantage of these states for problem-solving, consider leaving a notepad or a voice recorder (if you risk falling back asleep) near your bed. This way, you can capture any insights or solutions that come to you while falling asleep or waking up, so you can revisit them when you're fully awake."},{"instruction":"Yoyoyo!

Last week the government asked parliament to pass legislation lifting the retirement age of 65 from 2033 onwards, defending the reform as a step in efforts to make the pension system sustainable. The bill also includes a proposal to cut the pensions of people who stop working before reaching retirement age by about four per cent per year. \\"There is a lot of misery and bitterness in us. Isn't such a retirement proposal irresponsible towards our workers and pensioners?\\" Kresimir Sever, one of the leaders of the trade unions that organized the protest, told the crowd gathered in central Zagreb. Some of the demonstrators shouted \\"Thieves!\\" and many held banners accusing the government of impoverishing pensioners and workers. \\"From school to unemployment, from work to graveyard,\\" read one of the banners.

I'm thrilled to hear that you have a long bow and a horse, as well as a desire to embark on a thrilling Dungeons & Dragons adventure. As your dungeon master, I'll create an exciting campaign for us to explore together. Campaign Name: The Lost Temple of the Moon Goddess Background: The small village of Willowdale has been plagued by strange occurrences and disappearances, and the villagers believe that the cause is the long-abandoned Temple of the Moon Goddess, located deep within the nearby forest. The temple was once a sacred place of worship for the goddess, but it has been sealed for centuries, and rumors say that it contains powerful magic and ancient treasures. Your mission is to retrieve the lost artifacts and uncover the secrets of the temple. Setting: The campaign will take place in a dense, misty forest, with towering trees, winding rivers, and overgrown ruins. The temple is located in the heart of the forest, surrounded by mysterious, ancient structures and hidden dangers. Story Outline: Episode 1: Arrival and Acclimatization * Arrive in Willowdale and meet the villagers, who will be skeptical of your intentions and reluctant to provide information about the temple. * Explore the village and gather information about the temple's history and the disappeared villagers. * Choose your starting equipment and gear up for your journey. Episode 2: The Journey begins * Head into the forest and begin your journey to the temple. * Navigate through the dense foliage, overgrown ruins, and dangerous creatures. * Set up camp for the night and continue your journey in the morning. Episode 3: The Temple's Entrance * Reach the temple's entrance and find a series of trials and challenges to gain entry. * Solve puzzles, overcome obstacles, and defeat defenders to prove your worth and gain access to the temple. Episode 4: The Temple's Labyrinth * Once inside, navigate through a maze of rooms, corridors, and chambers, each with its own challenges and rewards. * Find hidden doors, secret passages, and ancient artifacts. Episode 5: The Temple's Heart * Reach the temple's inner sanctum, where you will face the temple's guardian and uncover the secrets of the Moon Goddess. * Choose your approach: negotiate, fight, or use your skills to overcome the guardian. Episode 6: The Return Journey * Retrace your steps through the temple and the forest, but this time, with newfound knowledge and treasures. * Say goodbye to the villagers and share your adventure with them. Throughout the campaign, you'll encounter various challenges, enemies, and allies, and it's up to you to make decisions that shape the story and determine the outcome. As your dungeon master, I'll provide the setting, non-player characters, and challenges, while you bring your character to life with your decisions and actions.

How did the Mascarene ridged frogs adapt to their different environments across Africa and Madagascar to maintain their ecological niche?","output":"The Mascarene ridged frogs, also known as Dyscophus, have an interesting evolutionary history that shows an adaptation to diverse environments across Africa and Madagascar, helping them maintain their ecological niche.  The study by Zimkus, B. M. et al. (2017) sheds light on this process. They used molecular data to construct phylogenetic trees, which revealed the evolutionary relationships among the different species of Mascarene ridged frogs. The study found that these frogs have diversified across the African and Malagasy regions in a process known as \\"leapfrogging.\\"  \\"Leapfrogging\\" is a phenomenon where populations establish themselves in new areas by jumping over existing ones. This is likely due to a combination of geographical and ecological factors, such as changes in climate and the availability of suitable habitats. The researchers suggest that the adaptations of Mascarene ridged frogs are a result of their ability to occupy different ecological niches. They believe that the adaptations include physiological modifications that allow these frogs to live in a variety of habitats, including forested areas, arid zones and coastal regions. These adaptations may include changes in skin structure for better water retention in dry habitats, alterations in mating calls for use in different vegetation types, or even specialized microhabitat preferences. It's also postulated that these adaptations allow Mascarene ridged frogs to exploit a variety of prey types. For instance, they may have developed stronger jaws and larger mouths to capture larger prey in forested areas, or developed sticky tongues for capturing prey in arid environments. Moreover, the study suggests that the diversification of Mascarene ridged frogs may have helped them to occupy new habitats and fill new ecological niches, thereby avoiding competition with other species. This process of \\"ecological opportunity\\" can lead to rapid diversification and adaptive radiation. Overall, the Mascarene ridged frogs are a fascinating example of how species can adapt and diversify to occupy different ecological niches, helping them to thrive in a variety of environments."},{"instruction":"Zoe goes to the store to buy soda and pizza for herself and her 5 family members. Each bottle of soda costs half a dollar and each slice of pizza costs 1. Before she leaves her house she takes just enough money to pay for her purchase. How much money did Zoe take? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"First, we need to determine the total number of bottles of soda and slices of pizza that Zoe will be buying. Since she is buying for herself and 5 family members, that means she needs 6 bottles of soda and 6 slices of pizza. Next, we can calculate the total cost of the soda by multiplying the number of bottles (6) by the cost per bottle (0.50). This gives us a total of 3 for the soda. Similarly, we can calculate the total cost of the pizza by multiplying the number of slices (6) by the cost per slice (1). This gives us a total of 6 for the pizza.

Patrons at the restaurant scrambled for safety, as the assailant continued his violent rampage. Bystanders quickly called emergency services, who promptly arrived at the scene. Although both victims were rushed to a nearby hospital, the woman succumbed to her injuries. The man she was on a date with remained in critical condition, fighting for his life. The Suspect Initial investigations revealed that the alleged attacker had no known connections to the victims – adding to the mystifying nature of this sudden and brutal assault. Witnesses reported that the assailant seemed to have no specific motive and appeared to carry out the act senselessly. Following a thorough investigation, local police identified and arrested the suspect. During the process, it was discovered that the alleged attacker had a history of criminal behavior and a troubled past, though it is unclear if this played a role in the tragic incident. Authorities have formally charged the man with murder and attempted murder in connection with the heinous crime. He awaits a hearing to determine a trial date and, if convicted, could face a life sentence in prison. The Community's Response The shocking nature of the crime has left the residents of Sydney reeling, as they struggle to come to terms with the harrowing event. The restaurant where the attack occurred has since been closed, with a makeshift memorial being created outside to commemorate the victims. Many have questioned how such a vicious crime could happen in what is considered to be one of the safest cities in the world. This tragic event has spurred local officials to reassess current security measures and devise strategies to reinforce public safety. Additionally, discussions surrounding mental health and criminal rehabilitation have surfaced as residents seek to comprehend the actions of the alleged perpetrator and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. In the wake of the stabbing, the community has banded together with an outpouring of grief and support for the victims and their families. Candlelight vigils have been held, and an online fundraising campaign is underway to assist the surviving victim with his medical expenses and recovery. Conclusion The tragic attack in Sydney serves as a chilling reminder that senseless acts of violence can happen anywhere and at any time. The community's response to this horrific and seemingly random act of brutality has been one of solidarity and determination to prevent such incidents in the future. As the case unfolds, the victims and their families remain in the hearts of the community, who are grieving the devastating loss of a life cut tragically short and supporting the recovering victim as he continues to endure this unimaginable ordeal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But, in a three part-series about clauses buried in tens of millions of contracts, Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Michael Corkery (along with another reporter, Robert Gebeloff) reported on the way these clauses have deprived Americans of one of their most fundamental constitutional rights: their day in court. Read by millions, the series shows how arbitration clauses contained in most contracts — like employment, telephone service, credit cards — have crept into nearly every corner of Americans’ lives. Engineered by a Wall Street-led coalition of credit card companies and retailers, arbitration blocks class-action lawsuits and so insulates businesses from challenges to practices like predatory lending, wage theft and discrimination. Not surprisingly the rules of arbitration create an alternate system of privatized justice that largely favors the business interests. This is not good news for consumers.

And that's exactly what happens to Sally (Sandra Bullock) and Gillian (Nicole Kidman) Owens' father, causing their mother to die of a broken heart. The young girls then live with their two aunts (Stockard Channing, Diane Wiest), who teach them the ways of being a witch and how to deal with the ridicule that comes with the family profession.

Article: As we all know, the ocean moves. But waves breaking on the beach make the ocean fun. When you stand on the shore and look at the waves, it seems like the water is moving towards you. But the water is not really moving forward. The moving you see is wave energy. And wave energy comes from the wind. Let's think about how this works. As wave energy passes through the water, the energy makes particles   of water move up and down. Just give you an example of a wave passing under a basketball. We put a basketball on the sea. When the wind blows, a wave comes from behind the basketball. The basketball moves up to the top with the wave. Then the wave continues and leaves the basketball behind. The basketball looks lower, but it doesn't move forward. That's because the wave energy just moves the water which is under the basketball. So why can you see a wave knock you down on the shore?When a wave moves toward the shore, the bottom of the wave slows down because _ meets the ocean floor. But the top, which is called crest , keeps moving. The different action causes the wave to fall over or break onto the shore. If a wave is very large, it carries a lot of energy when it hits the land. As time goes by, waves can break up and carry away the rocks and other things on the shore. Shorelines are changing all the time because of wave action. Question: Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage? Options: A: Wave energy comes from the water. B: Large waves carry plenty of energy. C: Wave action makes shorelines change all the time. D: The bottom of the wave is easy to slow down.

However, an explanation has emerged through the justice system. Authorities recently arrested Greek fashion publicist Phivos Lampros Istavrioglou, 29, in connection with the theft. Istavrioglou pleaded not guilty. The backstory of this unusual crime starts at the New York gallery, where Istavrioglou noticed that a 150,000 Salvador Dali drawing was not properly protected. He seized the opportunity and took the drawing. He transported the artwork from New York City, to Athens, Greece, where he resides. However, upon arriving in Athens, Istavrioglou experienced a change of heart. In fear of being caught, prosecutors say Istavrioglou decided to return the precious art piece. \\"When he realized the hunt was on, the defendant blinked,\\" the prosecutor stated. In a hasty move to avoid any ramifications, Istavrioglou rolled up the Salvador Dali drawing and sent it back to the gallery. His method of rolling can be best described as \\"a manner befitting a college dorm-room poster,\\" reflecting a naive approach rather than a heist expert's precision. Detectives have managed to uncover several pieces of evidence that point to Istavrioglou's involvement in the peculiar crime. Among these pieces of evidence is his fingerprint found on the mailing tube used to return the drawing. Additional information implicating Istavrioglou includes relevant web searches made on his Google account in the period leading up to the story breaking. Furthermore, a picture of the drawing, as it hung in the gallery, was featured on Istavrioglou's Facebook profile. The Greek fashion publicist was apprehended in New York City, following communication with an undercover cop who posed as an art gallery manager. The undercover officer lured Istavrioglou back to the Big Apple by offering him a lucrative job opportunity. Once in New York, officers closed in and arrested him without incident. Istavrioglou appeared in court soon after and pleaded not guilty. Now that the Salvador Dali drawing has been safely returned, the consequences faced by Istavrioglou remain uncertain. As a high-profile suspect in an art theft turned intriguing global case, the enigmatic nature of the criminal act and its intriguing resolution will leave many captivated and puzzled in the world of art galleries and beyond. This unusual case serves as a testament to the unpredictability of human nature, coupled with the ability for even the unlikeliest of individuals to become involved in an art heist."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Why did the actress feel bad about begin rejected?

Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly . Sudden movements can make a car very difficult to control. So every time you either start or stop your car, increase or reduce your speed, you must be as gentle and slow as possible. Suppose you are driving with a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so that you wouldn't spill  it. Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further down the road you have to look. Test how long it takes to gently stop your car. Remember that you may be driving more quickly than you think. Generally, allow twice of your usual stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times and you will not get into trouble. Question: The writer tries to  _  in this passage. Options: A: show his dislikes about bad winter weather B: give information about winter weather C: ask people not to drive in winter D: advise people about safe driving in winter The answer is:","output":"D: advise people about safe driving in winter"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Trump offered to lift sanctions against it as relations improve, indicating a phased-in approach where concessions would be provided at various stages of the denuclearization process. Speaking at a news conference in Seoul alongside South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa and Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, the U.S. secretary of state said the Trump administration would not repeat the mistakes made by past presidents that rewarded Pyongyang for denuclearization promises. “When we refer to the mistakes of the past. They were providing economic and financial aid relief before the complete denuclearization had taken place. That is not going to happen. President Trump made that clear,” Pompeo said. President Trump described his meeting with Kim as a resounding success and in a tweet said, “There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.” But the U.S.-North Korea joint declaration was vague on details, providing no clear definition on what constitutes denuclearization, set no timeline for the dismantlement process, and said nothing about outside verification requirements. Pompeo, however, pointed out that in the Singapore statement both countries reaffirmed the inter-Korean Panmunjom declaration from April, in which both South and North Korea agreed to uphold all past agreements that did specify detailed nuclear prohibitions and verification requirements. The secretary of state and his counterparts in Seoul and Tokyo said they are united in support of the U.S.-North Korea agreement, and in agreement on the goal of complete, irreversible, verifiable dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program.

Question: I read this background article the other day: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.  I am facing a new situation today: There are two lakes in southern Indiana that are popular places for families of nearby cities to visit for picnics and parties. Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops for the town. The owner of the farm also rents out his barn regularly so people can use it for celebrations. Lake Tresco is located near a school and children will often come play at it during recess.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Does lake Mahoe have more or less chemicals in it than lake Tresco? Answer:","output":"Lake Mahoe likely has more chemicals in it than Lake Tresco.  Step 1: Identify sources of chemical contamination. According to the background article, one of the main sources of chemical contamination in bodies of water is the use of fertilizers and pesticides in farm fields. No information is provided about potential sources of contamination near Lake Tresco. Step 2: Locate the sources near the lakes. Lake Mahoe is situated right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops. This implies that fertilizers and pesticides are likely applied. Step 3: Consider chemical runoff. Rainwater can pick up chemicals from the farm fields and carry them into the lake, causing contamination. There is no mention of any similar process occurring near Lake Tresco.

Here is a goal: To hold down a keyboard note without using your hands, How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of holding down a keyboard note without using your hands, I would perform the following steps: Step 1: Assess the situation First, I need to understand the setup. Identify the type of keyboard (musical or computer keyboard) and the specific key that needs to be held down. Step 2: Choose a suitable object Find an object that can provide enough weight to press down the key, ensuring that it's not too heavy that it might damage the keyboard. Some examples of objects that may work are a small book, an eraser, or a small, flat object with some heft. Step 3: Clean the object Before placing the object on the keyboard, clean it so it doesn't leave any dirt or debris on the keys. Step 4: Position the object carefully Carefully place the object exactly over the key that needs to be held down. Make sure that it only presses the desired key and doesn't accidentally press any of the adjacent keys. Step 5: Test the result Once the object is placed correctly over the key, check to see if the key is being held down successfully. If it's not pressed down enough or it's pressing other keys, reposition the object accordingly. Step 6: Monitoring the situation Periodically check on the setup to ensure the keyboard is functioning correctly and that the object hasn't moved or fallen off. In these steps, I have successfully managed to hold down a keyboard note without using my hands by utilizing a suitable object as a substitute to apply weight on the key."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the perturbation hypothesis does have an indirect effect on the process. If more conservation occurs, it means that there will be increased efforts to protect and preserve natural resources, ecosystems, and biodiversity. This can lead to greater awareness and implementation of sustainable practices such as reforestation, limiting deforestation, reducing the use of fossil fuels, and promoting alternative energy sources. As a result, the process would be affected in the following ways: - Reduced deforestation means more trees to help absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping to mitigate climate change. - Promotion of alternative energy sources can help reduce dependency on fossil fuels, leading to less burning and release of carbon dioxide. - Reforestation efforts can help increase the overall number of trees on the planet, which will absorb more carbon dioxide and release oxygen, contributing to a more stabilized atmosphere. In conclusion, increased conservation efforts can have an indirect effect on the process by mitigating some of the negative consequences of human activities on the environment, such as deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels.

One of the first complaints presented to doctors by many people later diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease is an involuntary tremor or shaking of the hands, fingers, arms, legs, jaw, and face. You’re most likely to notice this tremor when your hands are at rest rather than when you’re using them, although you may see more tremors while your hands and arms are in use as the disease progresses.  There are many causes of tremors. Parkinson's Disease is one of the most common causes, and tremors are often the first sign of the disease. The tremor and other symptoms may initially appear only on one side of the body, or they may appear worse on one side than the other. A repetitive “pill-rolling\\" movement between the thumb and finger—named because it looks as though the person is rolling a pill between their fingers—is characteristic of a Parkinsonian tremor. Some symptoms of Parkinson's are caused by the larger symptom of slowed movements (also known as bradykinesia). This primarily affects motor functions from walking and balance to writing and even motor functions that are often considered reflexive or spontaneous.  These slowed movements are a very common early sign of Parkinson’s, and may show up at the onset of the disease in 80% of patients. Some people might have a hard time describing what they are feeling and use words like “weakness,” “tiredness,” or “incoordination” when talking about these symptoms. Look for distortions in voluntary movements. In addition to involuntary movements, those with Parkinson’s may experience disturbances in their voluntary movements beyond just slowness. Some of the treatments used for Parkinson's disease may cause abnormal involuntary movements, or an increase in movement, referred to as dyskinesia. These distortions (dyskinesias) can be similar to a “tic” in appearance and worsen with psychological stress. Advanced dyskinesia is most often seen in patients who have been on the medication Levodopa for some time. A common symptom of Parkinson’s is a shuffling gait with short steps and a tendency to lean forward. People with Parkinson's often have difficulty with their balance, and there is sometimes a tendency to fall forward, causing the person to walk faster and faster to keep from falling over. This pattern is called a \\"festinating gait,\\" and it is very common in Parkinson's disease. This symptom typically shows up in the later stages of the disease. Those with Parkinson’s Disease often lean forward at the waist when standing or walking. This is because Parkinson's can cause posture and balance problems, including rigidity. There is a tendency to flex the arms and the head so that the person appears bent over with the elbows flexed and the head down.  Rigidity can affect the whole body, and might you feel stiff or sore. Check for postural rigidity. Also referred to as “cog-wheeling,” this symptom presents as a hallmark, rigid motion when an examiner moves the arm of a patient through basic flexion and extension motions. The rigidity and resistance to movement is most obvious with passive movement of the wrists and elbow. Cog-wheeling may happen when the increased muscle tone related to rigidity is combined with a tremor. Some cognitive impairment is common, but usually not until late in the course of the disease. Around 90% of those with PD will show signs of speech disturbances at some point. These can present as quieter speech, breathy or hoarse qualities to the voice, and reduced precision with language. The voice often becomes soft or whispery because the vocal muscles lack mobility. Up to 60% of those with PD may show signs or anxiety or depression. PD affects some of the mood-stabilizing portions of the brain, which leads to this increased chance for depression, especially paired with the quality of life for patients in late stages of the disease. The muscles used to push food through the digestive system are also affected by PD. This can lead to a variety of gastrointestinal issues from incontinence to constipation. These same symptoms often present along with difficulty swallowing food as well. Many of the involuntary movements associated with Parkinson’s make it increasingly difficult for those with the disease to get a full night of sleep. Other symptoms—such as muscle rigidity making it difficult to roll over at night or bladder issues leading to getting up at night to urinate frequently—compound the sleep disruptions experienced by those with PD. Summary:","output":"Involuntary tremors, slowed movements, and posture and balance issues are common early symptoms of Parkinson's Disease, often accompanied by disturbances in voluntary movements, speech, mood, and gastrointestinal issues as the disease progresses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He and his sister, Letty (b. 1943), were raised in Midwood, Brooklyn. He is the son of Nettie (nee Cherry; November 8, 1906 - January 27, 2002), a bookkeeper at her family's delicatessen, and Martin Konigsberg (December 25, 1900 - January 8, 2001), a jewelry engraver and waiter. His family was Jewish, and his grandparents immigrated to the US from Russia and Austria and spoke Yiddish, Hebrew, and German. In 1966, Allen wrote the play Don't Drink the Water. The play starred Lou Jacobi, Kay Medford, Anita Gillette and Allen's future movie co-star Tony Roberts. A film adaptation of the play, directed by Howard Morris, was released in 1969, starring Jackie Gleason. Because he was not particularly happy with the 1969 film version of his play, in 1994, Allen directed and starred in a second version for television, with Michael J. Fox and Mayim Bialik.  The next play Allen wrote for Broadway was Play It Again, Sam, in which he also starred. The play opened on February 12, 1969, and ran for 453 performances. It featured Diane Keaton and Roberts. The play was significant to Keaton's budding career, and she has stated she was in \\"awe\\" of Allen even before auditioning for her role, which was the first time she met him. During an interview in 2013, Keaton stated that she \\"fell in love with him right away,\\" adding, \\"I wanted to be his girlfriend so I did something about it.\\" After co-starring alongside Allen in the subsequent film version of Play It Again, Sam, she would later co-star in Sleeper, Love and Death, Interiors, Manhattan and Annie Hall. \\"He showed me the ropes and I followed his lead. He is the most disciplined person I know. He works very hard,\\" Keaton has stated. \\"I find the same thing sexy in a man now as I always have: humor. I love it when they are funny. It's to die for.\\"  For its March 21, 1969, issue, Life featured Allen on its cover. In 1981, his play The Floating Light Bulb premiered on Broadway and ran for 65 performances. While receiving mixed reviews, it gave an autobiographical insight into Allen's childhood, specifically his fascination with magic tricks. He has written several one-act plays, including Riverside Drive and Old Saybrook exploring well-known Allen themes.  On October 20, 2011, Allen's one-act play Honeymoon Motel opened as part of a larger piece entitled Relatively Speaking on Broadway, with two other one-act plays, one by Ethan Coen and one by Elaine May.

Q:The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

The Perijá tapaculo is a small bird, 10 to 12 cm (3.9 to 4.7 in) in length with an average mass of 17 to 18 grams (around 0.6 oz). The bill averages 6.8 millimetres (0.27 inches) long, 2.9 mm (0.11 in) wide, and 3.5 mm (0.14 in) high. The legs are about 21 mm (0.83 in) long. The Perijá tapaculo's tarsus averages 21.1 millimetres (0.83 in) long. The wings measure 57.4 mm (2.26 in) on average and the tail is about 40 mm (1.6 in) long with between 8 and 12 rectrices.The forehead, lores, crown, mantle, and scapular area are a neutral grey colour. There is a brown spot on the nape. The top of the tail is brown, and the bottom is faintly striped brown.

Joyce, and Lt-Colonel Stewart Francis Newcombe. Herbert Garland was also involved. In addition, a French military mission commanded by Colonel Edouard Brémond was sent out. The French enjoyed an advantage over the British in that they included a number of Muslim officers such as Captain Muhammand Ould Ali Raho, Claude Prost, and Laurent Depui . Captain Rosario Pisani of the French Army, though not a Muslim, also played a notable role in the revolt as an engineering and artillery officer with the Arab Northern Army. The British government in Egypt sent a young officer, Captain T. E. Lawrence, to work with the Hashemite forces in the Hejaz in October 1916. The British historian David Murphy wrote that though Lawrence was just one out of many British and French officers serving in Arabia, historians often write as though it was Lawrence alone who represented the Allied cause in Arabia. David Hogarth credited Gertrude Bell for much of the success of the Arab Revolt. She had travelled extensively in the Middle East since 1888, after graduating from Oxford with a First in Modern History. Bell had met Sheikh Harb of the Howeitat in January 1914 and thus was able to provide a \\"mass of information\\" which was crucial to the success of Lawrence's occupation of Aqaba covering the \\"tribal elements ranging between the Hejaz Railway and the Nefud, particularly about the Howeitat group.\\" It was this information, Hogarth emphasized, which \\"Lawrence, relying on her reports, made signal use of in the Arab campaigns of 1917 and 1918.\\" Answer this question based on the article: Which army had more Mulim officer, the English or the French?","output":"Based on the article, the French army had more Muslim officers than the English army during their involvement in the Arab Revolt.

It is not possible to tell. The given scenario mentions that two people are wearing a Chinese dragon costume in front of an ornate Chinese gazebo with red pillars, and there are two large red lanterns hanging from the roof. While these elements are commonly associated with Chinese New Year celebrations, we cannot conclusively determine that the people are celebrating Chinese New Year for several reasons: 1. Chinese dragon costumes and red lanterns are symbolic representations used during various cultural and traditional events in China, not just Chinese New Year. For example, they may appear in Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations, weddings, or even business openings. 2. The Chinese dragon costume could be part of a performance or dance that is not explicitly related to Chinese New Year. The dragon dance, for instance, is performed in several other occasions to bring good fortune and chase away evil spirits. Similarly, red lanterns are considered a symbol of happiness and prosperity and can be used as decorations throughout the year. 3. The context of the event or location isn't provided. For example, the scenario could take place at a multicultural festival or a theme park, where costumes and decorations from various cultures are showcased regardless of the time of year. 4.

You could go directly into the confessional (provided there's no one else in there or waiting outside), but sometimes it's nice to take a minute in the pew by yourself beforehand. You have this beautiful church probably almost all to yourself. Can you feel its energy resonating through you? Can you feel the majesty of the Lord's kingdom and how you're a part of it? Take a moment to kneel and pray with your head down and hands clasped together. Reflect on your faith and how you feel currently. Think about how you've been responding to God's call and how you've been living in the light of his love. When the priest is ready for you, of course. You'll probably see him there by his lonesome or someone else walk out just before you. Sit down either across from him or behind the screen -- it's totally up to you whether or not you prefer to remain anonymous. He won't treat you any differently either way. Make the sign of the cross upon his prompt, saying, \\"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.  It has been (blank) since my last confession.\\" This is your standard, traditional phrasing. However, if you just sit down and say hello, that's fine, too. The priest knows what he's doing. The Byzantine Rite is a bit different. The priest may sit to your side and put his epitrachelion on your head. He may then also do the Prayer of Absolution. But the idea remains the exact same -- just go wherever he takes you. Once you sit down and you've made the sign of the cross, just sit back and follow the priest's lead. He'll ask you how long it's been since your last confession (if you don't voluntarily offer that information), how you are feeling, maybe how your faith is going, and then ask you what sins you would like to talk about with him and God. It's just a casual conversation! Do not fret. There is absolutely zero pressure on your part. Again, as long as you come there with the intention of leaving with a clean heart, you're more than welcome in the church. There is no wrong way to go about confession! This part is intimidating, but think about it this way: the priest you're talking to has probably heard just about everything before. Whatever you have to say will not blow his mind. So when he asks, start rattling them off, from the most serious to the least. If he asks any questions, answer them, but do not feel the need to go into detail. A simple, \\"I did so and so,\\" will suffice. Your priest is going to be very understanding. If you don't remember the exact timeframe, that's fine. If you don't remember your motivation, that's fine. All your priest cares about is that you're being as honest as possible and that your heart is in the right place. He'll talk you through everything, possibly asking about your intentions, but mainly just letting you know that God loves you, sin and all. If he has any ideas to bring you closer to God, he may suggest them at this juncture. He's there to help, after all. He will then ask you to make an Act of Contrition. That goes like this:  My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart.In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good,I have sinned against You whom I should loveabove all things. I firmly intend, with your help,to do penance, to sin no more, andto avoid whatever leads me to sin.Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us.In his name, my God, have mercy  (If you are a Roman Catholic, your act of contrition will go like this: Oh my God, I am very sorry for having offended thee. I detest all of my sins because of thy just punishment. But most of all, because they offend you, my God, who is all good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve with the help of thy grace, to sin no more, and to avoid the near occasion of sin. Amen. Don't worry! It won't be anything huge. You may even walk away just having to say a few meaningful prayers. Take the absolution to heart -- you now have a brand new, clean slate to work with. It'll feel so uplifting! Just to clarify, \\"absolution\\" means your sins are washed away. \\"Penance\\" is your expression of regret and repentance, showing God that you're truly sorry for what you've done and that you wish for nothing more than to be forgiven.

Asteroid C and asteroid D are at the same distance form the earth, but asteroid C has more mass than asteroid D. He also figured out that all of these asteroids have less mass than earth.  In clssical theory, if Rob needs to find out the object with stronger gravitational pull, which one would he choose, earth or asteroid A? A:","output":"A: In classical theory, the force of gravitational attraction depends on two key factors: the mass of the objects and the distance between them. According to Newton's law of gravitation, the force (F) between two objects is given by the formula: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 where G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers. In this case, we are comparing the gravitational pull of Earth (denoted as E) and Asteroid A (denoted as A). Let's assume mE, mA to be their respective masses and rE, rA to be their respective distances from Earth. Since we know that mA is less than mE, numerically, we can write: mA < mE We also know that Asteroid A is farther away from Earth than Asteroid B, but we are not given any information about the distance of Asteroids B, C, or D relative to Earth. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive comparison between rA and rE. Nevertheless, considering that all four asteroids have less mass than the Earth, their overall gravitational pull would be weaker compared to Earth.

Plot title: Titanic Movie plot: At the last minute, a wealthy American expatriate in Europe, Richard Sturges (Clifton Webb), buys a steerage-class ticket for the maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic from a Basque immigrant. Once aboard he seeks out his runaway wife, Julia (Barbara Stanwyck). He discovers she is trying to take their two unsuspecting children, 18-year-old Annette (Audrey Dalton) and ten-year-old Norman (Harper Carter), to her hometown of Mackinac, Michigan, to raise as down-to-earth Americans rather than rootless elitists like Richard himself. As the ship prepares for departure, her captain, E. J. Smith (Brian Aherne), receives a hint from the shipping company representative that a record-setting speedy passage would be welcomed. Other passengers include a wealthy woman of a working-class origin (based on a real-life Titanic survivor Molly Brown), Maude Young (Thelma Ritter); social-climbing Earl Meeker (Allyn Joslyn); a 20-year-old Purdue University tennis player, Gifford \\"Giff\\" Rogers (Robert Wagner); and George S. Healey (Richard Basehart), a Catholic priest who has been defrocked for alcoholism. When Annette learns her mother's intentions, she insists on returning to Europe with her father on the next ship as soon as they reach America.

Movie title: Hondo Movie plot: The story takes place at some point between 1869 and 1877 (It is mentioned in the dialogue that Ulysses S. Grant is President). At a remote ranch in the Arizona Territory, homesteader Angie Lowe (Geraldine Page) and her six-year-old son Johnny (Lee Aaker) come upon a stranger (John Wayne) on foot, carrying only his saddle bags and a rifle. The man tells them only his last name, Lane, and that he was riding dispatch for the US Army Cavalry. He had lost his horse in an encounter with some Indians. Angie tells Lane her ranch hand had quit before he had a chance to break her two horses for riding, so Lane offers to break a horse himself. He asks where her husband is, and she says he is rounding up cattle in the mountains and should return soon. Lane deduces from the neglected ranch that her husband has been away for some time, a fact she confesses is true. When night falls Angie offers to let Lane sleep in her home. Angie sees his rifle is inscribed \\"Hondo\\" Lane, whom she knows had killed three men the year before. She attempts to shoot him, but due to the first chamber being empty, Hondo is not hurt. He loads the chamber and tells her to keep it that way. Hondo returns to his Cavalry post, where he meets up with his friend Buffalo Baker (Ward Bond). He reports to his commanding officer that C troop, which was sent to gather and bring in settlers to the north, was killed by Apaches. It is clear to the Major (Paul Fix) that the Apaches are raiding and killing settlers. At the ranch, Angie and Johnny are beset by Apaches, led by Chief Vittoro (Michael Pate) and his main under-chief, Silva (Rodolfo Acosta). Angie is not nervous in their presence as they have never attacked her family before. This time, they begin manhandling Angie. Johnny emerges from the house with the pistol and shoots at Silva. As Silva recovers and approaches him, he throws the pistol at Silva. Vittoro is impressed by Johnny's bravery and makes him an Apache blood brother. Vittoro wonders where Angie's husband is and tells her that unless he... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Hondo,\\" Hondo Lane, portrayed by John Wayne, pins Silva to the ground. Silva, played by Rodolfo Acosta, is the main under-chief of the Apache tribe led by Chief Vittoro, portrayed by Michael Pate. The incident occurs later in the movie when Hondo returns to Angie Lowe's (Geraldine Page) ranch to protect her and her son Johnny (Lee Aaker).  Initially, Angie and Johnny have a peaceful relationship with the Apaches, as the tribe has never attacked them before. However, the situation takes a turn when the Apache tribe starts raiding and killing settlers. When Chief Vittoro and Silva come to Angie's ranch and begin manhandling her, Johnny, trying to protect his mother, shoots at Silva. Chief Vittoro is impressed by Johnny's bravery and makes him an Apache blood brother.  Aware of the threat the Apaches pose to Angie and Johnny, Hondo takes it upon himself to protect them. Eventually, Hondo faces off against Silva in combat and manages to pin him to the ground. This altercation reflects the ongoing conflict between settlers and the Apache tribe, as well as Hondo's growing attachment to Angie and Johnny. In conclusion, Hondo pins Silva, the main under-chief of the Apache tribe, to the ground when the situation between the settlers and the Apaches escalates dangerously. This event is significant to the story as it demonstrates Hondo's determination to protect Angie and Johnny, pivotal characters in the film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After years of successfully eliminating high-value targets for various unscrupulous clients, Shadow is determined to identify and destroy the puppet master behind this underground network of criminals. As the movie begins, she receives a mysterious and encrypted message.

This enigmatic figure has a vast network of connections, providing state-of-the-art weaponry to various criminals and governments.  Shadow's interest is piqued when she realizes that it's a tip-off about an assassination target – a seemingly unassuming journalist uncovering a massive conspiracy involving illegal arms trade, high-level corruption, and extrajudicial killings. With her incredible skillset, she manages to eliminate the target but discovers that it was a trap laid by The Broker to bring her into his deadly game. With no other choice, Shadow decides to infiltrate The Broker's organization and unravel his true motives. Along the way, she encounters a rogue government agent, Lucas (played by Chris Evans), who has been investigating The Broker for years. Reluctantly, they form an uneasy alliance as they dig deeper into the arms dealer's dark empire. As they get closer to the truth, they uncover a powerful and sinister syndicate called 'The Red Queen' that operates at the highest echelons of power. The Red Queen has been manipulating global events to strengthen its foothold, using The Broker's services as a means to an end. With the odds stacked against them, Shadow and Lucas must outsmart their enemies, infiltrate the organization, and expose the secretive and ruthless mastermind pulling the strings. But they soon realize that their lives, and the lives of countless others, hang in the balance.

Director of nonprofit says accused often incarcerated in churches for weeks on end. Pastors have been accused of worsening the problem, aid workers say. Article:","output":"Title: The Dark Reality of Witch Hunts Against Children in Nigeria Introduction: In recent years, a troubling trend has emerged in Nigeria, wherein children are accused of witchcraft and subjected to various forms of disturbing abuse. This shocking behavior has turned the lives of these young souls into living nightmares, as they are falsely labeled witches due to their unusual physical markings, unyielding personalities, or having medical conditions like epilepsy. Additionally, the involvement of certain religious figures has only aggravated the issue. Step 1: Introduce the case of the Nigerian boy accused of witchcraft One heart-wrenching example of this cruel practice is the story of a young Nigerian boy who was relentlessly tormented after being branded a witch. \\"They would take my clothes off, tie me up, and beat me,\\" he recounts, describing the inhumane treatment he faced at the hands of superstitious individuals. Step 2: Discuss the criteria for children being targeted Misguided beliefs concerning witchcraft are often the driving force behind such allegations and subsequent abuse. Children with unusual physical markings, obstinate behavior or medical conditions like epilepsy are frequent targets, as they are wrongly labeled as cursed or possessed by malevolent forces. Step 3: Mention the involvement of religious institutions In some cases, these children are incarcerated in churches for weeks on end, as the directors of nonprofit organizations reveal. This harrowing ordeal continues for far too long, and the fact that those who are dedicated to providing guidance and support to others are involved is deeply concerning. Step 4: Explain the role of pastors in exacerbating the problem Aid workers suggest that pastors from various congregations have been complicit in worsening the situation. Instead of promoting empathy, understanding, and fact-based knowledge, they exploit the fear and superstition of their congregation, further cementing the demonization of these vulnerable children who are merely victims of circumstance. Step 5: Call for reform and an end to these practices The ordeal that these children face in Nigeria is abhorrent and has no place in the modern world. It is crucial that the Nigerian society and the international community join forces to address these issues. This can be achieved through education, awareness campaigns, and ensuring that those involved in propagating such beliefs and practices face legal consequences. Conclusion: The heartrending story of the young Nigerian boy accused of witchcraft, along with other similar cases, should serve as a stark reminder that society must continuously strive to eradicate superstitions and adopt evidence-based practices. The overwhelming fear of the supernatural, driven by misplaced beliefs and reinforced by certain religious authorities, needs to be addressed and dismantled. For the sake of the innocent victims who suffer unimaginably, it is time to shed light on this dark reality and take steps to eliminate these cruel practices from our world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Identify relevant cellular structures: ATP production mainly occurs in cellular organelles called mitochondria and to some extent during glycolysis in the cytoplasm. 4. Elaborate on the process: Cellular respiration involves three main stages – glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation. Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm, while the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation occur within mitochondria. 5.

Electrons, which have a negative charge, are designated e–. An atom’s neutrons have no charge: they are electrically neutral. Just as a magnet sticks to a steel refrigerator because their opposite charges attract, the positively charged protons attract the negatively charged electrons. This mutual attraction gives the atom some structural stability. The attraction by the positively charged nucleus helps keep electrons from straying far.

There are conflicting interpretations of the tathāgatagarbha in Mahāyāna thought. The idea may be traced to Abhidharma, and ultimately to statements of the Buddha in the Nikāyas.

He is perhaps best known for developing Self - Discrepancy Theory .  - The Ivy League is a collegiate athletic conference comprising sports teams from eight private institutions of higher education in the Northeastern United States. The conference name is also commonly used to refer to those eight schools as a group beyond the sports context. The eight institutions are Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, and Yale University. The term \\"Ivy League\\" has connotations of academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and social elitism.  - George II (George Augustus 30 October / 9 November 1683  25 October 1760) was King of Great Britain and Ireland, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg (Hanover) and Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire from 11 June 1727 (O.S.) until his death.  - Higher Learning is a 1995 American drama film written and directed by John Singleton, and starring an ensemble cast. The film follows the changing lives of three incoming freshmen at the fictional Columbus University: Malik Williams (Omar Epps), a black track star who struggles with academics; Kristen Connor (Kristy Swanson), a shy and naive girl; and Remy (Michael Rapaport), a lonely and confused man seemingly out of place in his new environment.  - The Association of American Universities (AAU) is an international organization of leading research universities devoted to maintaining a strong system of academic research and education. It consists of 60 universities in the United States (both public and private) and two universities in Canada.  - Columbia University (officially Columbia University in the City of New York) is a private Ivy League research university in Upper Manhattan, New York City.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Santorum, Romney Spar Over Conservative Principles As Michigan Race Tightens Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney are sharply challenging one another's conservative principles as they charge into the airtight primary contest in Romney's home state -- a critical election that has compelled Santorum to drop a bit of his nice-guy demeanor. Santorum, who campaigned across Michigan Saturday, has used campaign and media appearances to lambaste Romney as a big-spending, big-government, \\"pro-choice gay-rights supporting\\" candidate -- at least when he was governor of Massachusetts. \\"It's laughable for Governor Romney to suggest that I am not a conservative. It's absolutely laughable for a liberal governor of Massachusetts to suggest that I am not conservative -- the man that provided the template for Obamacare, the man who supported the Wall Street bailouts,\\" Santorum said Saturday. While assailing the wealthiest candidate in the race for his support of Wall Street, Santorum also continued to test a new line of attack, suggesting Romney's tax plan smacks of \\"Occupy\\" movement politics. Santorum complained about proposals to limit deductions and exemptions for wealthy earners. \\"We have a Republican running for president who is campaigning as an Occupy Wall Street adherent. What's he going to do? He's going to limit charitable deductions on the top 1 percent,\\" Santorum said. It may be difficult for Santorum to make that charge stick. If anything, Romney has struggled to shed the image that he's anything but the 1 percent -- having run into trouble a day earlier for casually noting how his wife drives \\"a couple of Cadillacs.\\" Romney, meanwhile, is targeting Santorum's credibility. In Lansing, Mich., on Saturday, he swiped at his opponent over his comment at the last debate that he only voted for No Child Left Behind because he had to \\"take one for the team.\\" \\"Um -- the team has got to be the people of America,\\" Romney said. His campaign has also released web videos challenging the former Pennsylvania senator's principles. Romney spokeswoman Gail Gitcho suggested the \\"desperate and false attacks\\" by Santorum were a response to recent poll figures. \\"This sounds like another case of Rick Santorum abandoning his principles for his own political advantage,\\" she said in a statement. Recent polling shows Santorum holding onto the lead nationally, but losing the edge to Romney in Michigan. The latest Rasmussen Reports poll showed Romney leading Santorum in the state 40-34 percent. Santorum had been ahead in most Michigan polls for the past couple weeks. Arizona, where Romney has held the consistent lead in polling, also holds its primary on Tuesday along with Michigan. But Michigan has emerged as a vital contest, and a veritable must-win state for Romney. It was the state where he was born, where his father was governor and where he won in the 2008 GOP presidential primary. Romney, along with his wife Ann, will be campaigning across the state on Saturday in the competition with Santorum for voters. The other two candidates, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul, are far back in the polls in Tuesday's contests and looking ahead to subsequent primaries and caucuses. Gingrich told Fox News he expects to \\"get some votes\\" on Tuesday but acknowledged the frontrunner status held by Romney and Santorum. \\"I think Santorum is discovering, in Michigan, where he was ahead a week ago, that when Romney goes negative and when he buys enough advertising, that he's very formidable,\\" Gingrich said. Gingrich noted that he's been campaigning in Washington state, which holds its caucuses shortly before the Super Tuesday primaries on March 6, when 10 states hold elections. Paul is holding a rally in Oklahoma on Saturday, before making his way to Michigan. Even if Santorum beats Romney, Romney will emerge with a healthy share of delegates to add to his lead in the count, never mind fundraising and campaign organization in a race that was designed to carry into the spring. And there is the chance for a split decision if Romney wins the popular vote but Santorum emerges with more delegates. Most of the state's 30 delegates are awarded two at a time to the winner in each of the state's 14 congressional districts. The Associated Press contributed to this report.","output":"Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney are challenging each other's conservative principles in the tight primary contest in Romney's home state, Michigan.

It's when we use a big piece of fabric and sew lovely patterns onto it. We can make pictures, shapes, and designs with our sewing. One fun thing to do is make \\"voiding\\" shapes. This means making empty spaces shaped like hearts, stars, or anything you like. You can also fill these shapes with colorful stitches to make them extra pretty. Patchwork Quilting: Another amazing way to make quilts is called \\"patchwork.\\" This is when we sew lots of small, differently shaped pieces of fabric together, like a puzzle. When we do this, we can fill each area with a beautiful pattern. Or, you can make one big pattern that covers everything!  Using Printed Fabric: One really cool idea is to use printed fabric for the back of your quilt. Printed fabric has pretty pictures or patterns on it already. You can sew along the outlines of these pictures from the back, and then fill in the areas from the front. This works very well with large pieces of fancy fabric. It makes your quilt very special! Zigzag Stitch: When you're making patterns and designs, you can use a \\"zigzag stitch.\\" This stitch is like drawing a zigzag, going up and down, up and down. It's a fun way to create lots of different fill patterns for your quilts. And that's it, little friends! Now you know some wonderful ways to make beautiful quilts.

Write some highlights for the following article: He is the high-flying brain surgeon whose frank memoir moved David Cameron to tears over Christmas. But Henry Marsh, author of Do No Harm, has returned the favour by accusing the Prime Minister of having ‘c**p’ policy ideas and fomenting a ‘permanent revolution’ in the NHS that demoralises staff. Mr Marsh warns that the NHS ‘is seriously running out of money’ and says: ‘Most politicians now, particularly Cameron . . . haven’t got a burning vision.’ Mr Cameron told The Mail on Sunday this month that Mr Marsh’s book had dominated his reading over the festive period. ‘He writes about some of his own cases, some that went right and some that went wrong. And you are moved to tears by reading this book,’ he said. Leading brain surgeon Henry Marsh (pictured) has accused the Prime Minister of fomenting a 'permanent revolution' in the NHS which is demoralising staff. The Prime Minister told friends he was particularly affected by Mr Marsh’s story of a pregnant mother who feared she would never see her baby because of a brain tumour, but the surgeon managed to remove the tumour just before she gave birth. Now Mr Marsh has responded by arguing that the Government has mishandled the Health Service. In today’s Mail on Sunday (below), he sets out a three-point plan to restore public confidence: admit honestly that queues will continue to lengthen unless the Government pays more for the NHS; scrap the target of treating 95 per cent of A&E patients in four hours; and bring back longer waiting lists for routine operations. ‘Politicians ought to stand up and say, “I’m sorry, but unless you agree to pay higher taxes, you are going to have to put up with longer queues”,’ he writes. ‘The first few hours [of the day] are often shambolic, spent finding beds for emergency cases. Many routine cases get cancelled at the last moment, as “their” beds are filled by emergencies . . . This has led to a sense of demoralising chaos.’ The surgeon opens Do No Harm by saying: ‘I often have to cut into the brain and it is something I hate doing.’ In today’s Total Politics magazine, he attacks Mr Cameron for pledging to make ‘zero harm a reality in our NHS’ in response to the Mid Staffordshire scandal. ‘Another grouse I have against the present Government is this zero harm c**p. There’s never going to be zero harm. Nothing is perfect,’ he says, adding: ‘Most politicians now, particularly Cameron, are not really ideological. They haven’t got a burning vision . . . This constant permanent cultural revolution in the NHS is very demoralising.’ Mr Marsh is brutally honest about his own mistakes in Do No Harm. He recalls a 15-hour operation in which he tore an artery, leaving his patient in a vegetative state. In Total Politics, he says politicians would benefit from equal frankness. ‘You know from bitter experience that . . . bad results are inevitable,’ he adds. It’s time for a dose of honesty if you want shorter queues you have to PAY, writes leading brain surgeon Henry Marsh. David Cameron's NHS reforms have been 'chaotic', brain surgeon Henry Marsh says. By Henry Marsh. I cannot but feel flattered that the Prime Minister read my memoir of life as an NHS neurosurgeon over Christmas, as revealed by The Mail on Sunday. I am told he was very moved by it. But I wonder whether he skipped the passages about political meddling, the constant lack of beds, and this Government’s and its predecessor’s chaotic reforms. I hope not. Because now, as the NHS struggles through yet another winter crisis, what politicians need more than ever is a good dose of honesty. Rather than exchanging brickbats over the latest weekly A&E figures, they should take a step back, think about what’s really gone wrong, and be straight with the public. They have been talking a lot of late about the need for transparency in the NHS – is it too much to ask the same from them? So, after a 36-year career in the NHS that has seen five Prime Ministers and 15 Health Secretaries, here’s my advice for the current PM. First, come clean and tell voters that queues will get longer unless they are prepared to pay more for the NHS. Second, have the courage to scrap targets – including the sacred cow of treating 95 per cent of A&E patients in four hours. Third, bring back longer waiting lists for routine operations. Why say these heretical things? The fact we have queues in the NHS is a simple fact of economic law. It’s about supply and demand. The NHS is free at the point of delivery – as in my opinion it should be – which means demand is high. But it is in scarce supply. There are never enough doctors and nurses, in other words. Because there is no charge for NHS treatment – and don’t get me wrong, I do not think there should be – we end up with queues. As our population gets bigger and we age as a nation, demand for healthcare is growing. So politicians ought to stand up and say, ‘I’m sorry, but unless you agree to pay higher taxes, you will have to put up with longer queues, particularly for non-urgent treatment.’ I hope Mr Cameron – who like me has a First in Politics, Philosophy and Economics from Oxford – understands this. Tony Blair brought in targets in an effort to keep queues for pre-planned operations down by fining hospitals that failed to treat patients in 18 weeks. But this was a bad idea, verging on dishonest, since it implied the problem was just a question of getting staff to work ‘more efficiently’. Yet the NHS has been underfunded relative to other developed countries for decades, and many of these other countries – such as France – are themselves now encountering similar issues. Introducing targets is like trying to square the circle of supply and demand – an impossibility if the NHS is working flat out, as it is. Mr Marsh (pictured) believes the NHS has been underfunded relative to other developed countries for decades. This might all sound rather theoretical. But targets have very real, unintended consequences in hospitals. For instance, because managers are always trying to hit targets for pre-planned operations, the beds are always full. This causes endless problems, especially when we have a run of emergency cases. When I go to work each morning I never know whether I will be able to get anything done, and the first few hours are often shambolic, spent finding beds for emergency cases. Many routine cases get cancelled at the last moment, as ‘their’ beds are filled by emergencies. It’s like a game of musical chairs, which gets faster and faster with each year, with the Government constantly changing the music but not adding beds to keep up with the growing number who need them. Mr Marsh's memoir (pictured) was said to have moved Prime Minister David Cameron to tears. This has led to a sense of demoralising chaos, a feeling that I know is shared by an awful lot of people working in hospitals. In the past, we had long waiting lists for routine surgery. Of course, this wasn’t perfect, but at least it was honest. And it meant doctors could more easily give priority to the emergency cases, as we have to. It’s not just targets for routine operations that have a lot to answer for. There has been a huge fuss in the press over hospitals missing the target of treating 95 per cent of A&E patients within four hours. But it’s only gone from something like 96 per cent to just under 90 per cent. That’s not bad for an emergency service. Internationally, it’s par for the course. But politicians insist on whacking each other over the head over a few percentage points. What truly matters is that the real emergencies – strokes, heart attacks, serious injuries and in my case brain tumours – are treated promptly. I think the four-hour target has got in the way of that. LESS well known is the target that limits how many people we admit as emergencies. If hospitals admit too many, they are penalised financially, which I find bizarre. Are we supposed not to treat them? I take an intense personal pride in looking after my patients. I did not like having a waiting list for routine cases, but I hate even more having to cancel these cases at the last minute – it’s horrible for the patients. And it’s alarmingly easy to start becoming like a bureaucrat myself, turning the patients away and saying: ‘It’s not my problem.’ So, as much as politicians don’t want to say it and the public probably don’t want to hear it, I think we need to abolish targets and reintroduce waiting lists for non-urgent surgery, if politicians feel it is impossible to put much more money into the NHS. Are they brave enough to admit this as the General Election looms? It was not easy to write my book and admit I have made serious mistakes in my career. Yet I have received hundreds – probably thousands – of messages thanking me for my honesty and saying that my admission of fallibility made readers trust me more, not less. Is there perhaps a moral here for our politicians?

The problem says: -66 * f + 251 + 527 = 118 First, let's add the numbers 251 and 527 together. 251 + 527 = 778  So now, our problem looks like this: -66 * f + 778 = 118 Next, we need to get f all by itself. So, let's subtract 778 from both sides of the equation. -66 * f + 778 - 778 = 118 - 778 Now, it looks like this: -66 * f = -660 Almost there! To find the value of f, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -66. (-66 * f) / -66 = -660 / -66 This simplifies to: f = 10 Great job!

If \\"A person is walking by the bridge.\\", does this mean that \\"A person is outdoors walking by a large man made object.\\"?","output":"In order to carry out this task, we need to break down the original sentence and compare it to the revised sentence.  1. Identify key elements in the original sentence:    - \\"A person\\": The subject of the action.     - \\"is walking\\": The action or state. This suggests movement and gives information about the person's activity.    - \\"by the bridge\\": The location of the action. Here, 'bridge' is a noun usually refers to a structure built to span physical obstacles without closing the path underneath. 2. Compare and contrast to the new sentence:    - \\"A person\\" is present in both sentences.     - \\"Is outdoors walking\\": This suggests that the person is indeed outside. In the original sentence, the location of the bridge doesn't specify whether it's indoors or outdoors. However, traditionally, bridges are outdoor structures.     - \\"by a large man made object\\": This sentence infers that a bridge is a large man-made object, which is true in most contexts. So, yes, the sentence \\"A person is walking by the bridge.\\" does imply that \\"A person is outdoors walking by a large man-made object\\".

Article: Another limitation of current U.S. Intellectual Property legislation is its focus on individual and joint works; thus, copyright protection can only be obtained in 'original' works of authorship. This definition excludes any works that are the result of community creativity, for example Native American songs and stories; current legislation does not recognize the uniqueness of indigenous cultural \\"property\\" and its ever-changing nature. Simply asking native cultures to 'write down' their cultural artifacts on tangible mediums ignores their necessary orality and enforces a Western bias of the written form as more authoritative. Now answer this question: The Western bias is that what form is more authoritative?","output":"The Western bias suggests that the written form is more authoritative. This bias emerges from the long history and tradition of written communication and documentation in Western cultures, which often places a higher value on works that are recorded in writing. This preference for written works has influenced various aspects of the society, including legal, academic, and cultural areas such as intellectual property legislation. In the context of intellectual property and copyright legislation, the focus on original works of authorship that are expressed in tangible and fixed forms, like written works, often overlooks and excludes other forms of creativity and expression—such as the oral traditions and cultural expressions of indigenous communities. These oral traditions and works are essential and integral to the cultural heritage of these communities, but they are not protected under the current intellectual property legislation due to their innate orality. This western bias towards written forms as more authoritative can lead to the marginalization, misappropriation, and loss of the cultural heritage of indigenous communities. There needs to be a more inclusive and expansive understanding of the forms of expression and works of authorship in intellectual property legislation to better acknowledge and safeguard the unique cultural \\"property\\" of indigenous peoples and their ever-evolving traditions, stories, and songs."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: where does the blood in the pulmonary artery go?","output":"The blood in the pulmonary artery goes through a series of circulation pathways to enable the process of oxygenation before it is transported back to the rest of the body. To provide a detailed understanding of this process, let's first examine the role of the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery is a large blood vessel originating from the right ventricle of the heart. It carries deoxygenated blood (blood that has already released oxygen to tissues) from the heart to the lungs. This blood is transported to the lungs to pick up oxygen and release carbon dioxide before returning to the heart for distribution to the rest of the body.  Here is a step-by-step process of where the blood in the pulmonary artery goes: 1. Deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle is carried by the pulmonary artery, which divides into two branches: the left and right pulmonary arteries. These branches correspond to the respective lungs (left lung and right lung) that they supply with blood. 2. In the lungs, the left and right pulmonary arteries further branch into numerous smaller arteries, arterioles, and eventually capillaries. These capillaries spread across the lung tissue, surrounding millions of tiny air sacs called alveoli. 3. Within the alveoli, a critical gas exchange occurs across the thin walls of the capillaries: oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses into the bloodstream while carbon dioxide from the blood diffuses into the alveoli. This process is known as respiration. 4. Now oxygen-enriched, the blood moves into the pulmonary venules and then into larger pulmonary veins. There are typically four pulmonary veins, two from each lung, which transport the oxygenated blood back to the heart. 5. The oxygenated blood makes its way into the left atrium of the heart through the pulmonary veins. From the left atrium, the blood is pumped into the left ventricle during the contraction of the atrium. 6. Finally, the blood is pumped from the left ventricle into the aorta, the body’s largest artery, during the contraction of the ventricle. The aorta branches into numerous smaller arteries, which further branch into arterioles and capillaries, distributing the nutrient- and oxygen-rich blood throughout the body. In summary, the blood in the pulmonary artery travels to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. The oxygenated blood then returns to the heart via the pulmonary veins and is subsequently pumped to the rest of the body through the systemic circulation. This continuous process ensures that the body's cells receive the necessary oxygen and nutrients to function while simultaneously removing waste products such as carbon dioxide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it.

The crew recovers the three aliens and begins the return trip to Earth. During the return journey, mission control loses contact with the shuttle and a rescue mission is launched to investigate. The rescuers discover that the Churchill has been severely damaged by fire, with its internal components destroyed, and the three containers bearing the aliens are all that remain intact. The aliens are taken to the European Space Research Centre in London where they are watched over by Dr. Leonard Bukovski (Gothard) and Dr. Hans Fallada (Finlay). Prior to an autopsy, the female alien (May) awakens and drains the \\"life force\\" out of a guard. The female alien then escapes the research facility and proceeds to drain various other humans of their life force, revealing an ability to shape-shift. It transpires that the aliens are from a race of space vampires that consume the life force of living beings, rather than their blood. Meanwhile, in Texas, an escape pod from the Churchill is found, with Colonel Tom Carlsen (Railsback) inside. Carlsen is flown to London where he describes the course of events, culminating in the draining of the crew's life force. Carlsen explains that he set fire to the shuttle with the intention of saving Earth from the same fate and escaped in the pod.

Burkina Faso's fairytale at the Africa Cup of Nations will have one more enthralling chapter after it overcame the might of four-time champion Ghana to seal a place in the final for the very first time in South Africa Wednesday. In a contest which was marred by a number of mystifying refereeing decisions, Burkina Faso survived the sending off of striker David Pitroipa and the ruling out of a seemingly legitimate strike to prevail on penalties. With the game ending 1-1 after extra-time, it was the Burkinabe which held its nerve to progress 3-2 on penalties and advance to Sunday's showpiece final against Nigeria. 'Super Eagles' end Ivory Coast's AFCON hopes. The Super Eagles had earlier booked their place in the final with a convincing 4-1 win over Mali in Durban. Burkina Faso, which had not won a game away from home at the tournament before arriving in South Afirca, had endured a frustrating night with referee Jdidi Slim's display a constant cause of consternation. But it will now have to take on Nigeria without star striker Jonathan Pitroipa, who was harshly shown a second yellow card for diving when it looked as if he had been fouled. Pitroipa's 117th minute dismissal leaves the Burkinabe without its two star strikers following the injury to talented forward Alain Traore. Burkina Faso should have been given the chance to take an early lead when John Boye sent Pitroipa hurtling towards the turf inside the Ghana penalty area, but the referee wrongly waved away appeals for a spot kick. Instead, it was Ghana which was controversially awarded a penalty after the Jdidi adjudged that Christian Atsu had been fouled inside the penalty area. Mubarak Wakaso stood up to fire home from 12 yards and net his fourth goal of the competition. What can we expect from the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations? With both teams struggling to play on a terrible surface at the Mbombela Stadium, the game lacked any real sort of quality. But what it lacked in quality it more than made up for in drama and excitement as Burkina Faso continued to fight back against a perceived injustice. Ghana goalkeeper Fatawu Dauda produced a wonderful reaction save to deny Aristide Bance, while Asamoah Gyan hit a post for the Black Stars. But with an hour on the clock, the underdog finally got its reward as Bance was allowed time and space to fire home a deserved equalizer. Burkina Faso make giant strides. With the game moving into extra-time, Burkina Faso appeared to have scored a dramatic winner when Prejuce Nakoulma beat Dauda to the ball and prodded into the net. But most of those packed inside the stadium were left in disbelief when Jdidi ruled the goal out for a minor clash with Kwadwo Asamoah. Worse was to follow for the Burkinabe when Pitroipa was sent off after receiving a second yellow card for diving , despite replays showing he was quite clearly fouled. In the end, the contest went to penalties and it was Burkina Faso which held its nerve with Bakary Kone, Henri Traore and Bance all scoring to send it through to the final. Burkina captain Charles Kabore told reporters: \\"The referee is human, all humans make mistakes, but he happened to make too many tonight. But we're not going to dwell on that, we've qualified.\\" 'Super Eagles' end Ivory Coast's AFCON hopes. In the day's early kick off, Nigeria reached the final for the first time since 2000 following a comfortable victory over Mali. The Super Eages scored three times in 20 first half minutes to take control of the contest and leave manager Stephen Keshi dreaming of repeating the triumph he pulled off as a player in 1994. Elderson Echiejile headed Nigeria ahead on 25 minutes before Brown Ideye added a second on the half-hour mark. Momo Sissoko then deflected Emmanuel Emenike's free-kick into the Mali net to leave his side facing an uphill struggle. And Ahmed Musa, who replaced the injured Victor Moses , inflicted further punishment on Mali when he ran through to score eight minutes after the interval. Mali, which famously came back from 4-0 down to draw 4-4 with Angola in the opening game of the 2010 finals, pulled one back through substitute Cheick Diarra in the 75th minute. Nigeria go through. But that failed to take the shine off for manager Keshi, who is now hoping to become only the second man in the tournament's history to win the tournament as a player and a coach after Egypt's Mahmoud El Gohary, who won it in 1959 and 1998. \\"We won in 1994 after we had been together for five years,\\" he told reporters. \\"But we have been together for five weeks. We met up for the first time in our training camp in Portugal before the tournament, and it was a young group. \\"We worked hard, the atmosphere was wonderful but you cannot compare this team to that.

Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person lived closer to Lanai island? Answer:","output":"From the information provided in the background article, Melinda lived on the Big Island of Hawaii, which is the southeastern-most island in the Hawaiian Islands chain. Moving across the chain from southeast to northwest, the islands increase in age through Maui, Kahoolawe, Lanai, Molokai, Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau. Janice, on the other hand, lived in Australia, which is in the southern hemisphere and much farther away from the Hawaiian Islands. Considering the geographic locations, Melinda, who lived on the Big Island, was definitely closer to Lanai island as compared to Janice, who lived in Australia. Though the Big Island is not the immediate neighbor of Lanai, being a part of the same Hawaiian archipelago makes it much closer to Lanai than Australia.  While Janice would have to travel across the Pacific Ocean from Australia to visit the Hawaiian Islands, Melinda could simply traverse through the island chain to reach Lanai.

Context: I married young, at 19, bright-eyed and hopeful, and in a few months, we will celebrate our 29th anniversary. Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me.  And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer.  At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved.  There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused. What now? I loved this man with every fibre of my being. We had a good life together, sex aside, and had built a family. We were happy. I did not want a divorce and neither did he.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. News article: (Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo)      Weary of waiting for an economic recovery worth its name, a frustrated American public has sent Barack Obama's job approval rating to a career low - with a majority in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll favoring a Republican Congress to act as a check on his policies.      Registered voters by 53-39 percent in the national survey say they'd rather see the Republicans in control of Congress as a counterbalance to Obama's policies than a Democratic-led Congress to help support him. It was similar in fall 2010, when the Republicans took control of the House of Representatives and gained six Senate seats.      See PDF with full results and charts here.      Obama's job approval rating, after a slight winter rebound, has lost 5 points among all adults since March, to 41 percent, the lowest of his presidency by a single point. Fifty-two percent disapprove, with \\"strong\\" disapproval exceeding strong approval by 17 percentage points. He's lost ground in particular among some of his core support groups.      Economic discontent remains the driving element in political views in this survey, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates. Americans rate the condition of the economy negatively by 71-29 percent - the least bad since November 2007, but still dismal by any measure. Only 28 percent think the economy's improving, down by 9 points since just before Obama won his second term. He gets just 42 percent approval for handling it.      Economic views are strongly related to political preferences. Among people who see the economy improving, 65 percent prefer Democratic control of Congress, while among those who see the economy as stagnant or worsening, 62 percent favor Republican control. Notably, economic views are linked with preferences for control of Congress regardless of people's partisan affiliation.      The results suggest the corrosive effects of the long downturn on the president's popularity: Among those who say the economy is in bad shape, Obama's overall approval rating has lost 20 points since February 2012, from 46 percent then to 26 percent now.      The president faces other challenges. While he's hailed insurance exchange sign-ups as a marker of the Affordable Care Act's success, the program and his rating for handling it have lost ground, both down from their levels late last month after the Healthcare.gov website was stabilized. The law gets 44 percent support, down 5 points; Obama has just 37 percent approval for its implementation, down 7.      One reason is that the law seems to have opened an avenue for public ire about health care costs to be directed at the administration. Six in 10 blame the ACA for increasing costs nationally, and 47 percent think it's caused their own health care expenses to rise. Regardless of whether or how much those costs would have risen otherwise, Obamacare is taking a heavy dose of the blame.      Separately, a current issue on the world stage offers no respite for Obama: Given continued tensions over Ukraine, just 34 percent of Americans approve of how he's handling that situation, 8 points fewer than early last month. Forty-six percent disapprove, with two in 10 withholding judgment.      DISCONTENT/MIDTERMS - With these and other problems - but chiefly the economy - the public by more than 2-1, 66-30 percent, says the country's headed seriously off on the wrong track. That's about where it's been lately, and more negative than a year ago.      General anti-incumbency results: Just 22 percent of Americans say they're inclined to re-elect their representative in Congress, unchanged from last month as the fewest in ABC/Post polls dating back 25 years.      Another outcome is risk for the president's party, in punishment for his handling of the helm. A single point divides Democratic and Republican candidates for the House in preference among registered voters, 45-44 percent. Among those who say they're certain to vote (with Republicans more apt to show up in midterms), that goes to 44-49 percent.      Independents, a sometimes swing-voting group, favor Republican House candidates by 55-32 percent (among those who say they're certain to vote). And, as with views on control of Congress, perceptions of the economy correlate with congressional vote preference, regardless of partisanship.      ISSUES - None of this means the GOP is home free. A robust improvement in the economy could change the equation. (As many, at least, say it's currently holding steady, 35 percent, as think it's getting worse, 36 percent.) And even as the brunt of economic unhappiness falls on the president, the public divides essentially evenly on which party they trust more to handle the economy - suggesting that the Republicans have yet to present a broadly appealing alternative.      In another example, for all of Obamacare's controversies, the Democrats hold a slight 8-point edge in trust to handle health care, again indicating that the Republicans have yet to seize the opportunity to present a compelling solution of their own. Indeed, the Democrats have a 6-point lead in trust to handle \\"the main problems the nation faces\\" - although, as with all others, that narrows among likely voters, in this case to 37-40 percent, a numerical (but not significant) GOP edge.      The Republicans have a 9-point advantage in trust to handle the federal deficit - an improvement for the party from last month. Similarly, Americans by a 7-point margin trust the Republicans over Obama to find the right mix of spending to cut and federal programs to maintain. The president had an 11-point lead on that question just after the partial government shutdown last fall.      The Democrats push back with two results that they're likely to stress as the November election draws closer: One is a broad, 20-point advantage, 52-32 percent, in trust over the Republicans to help the middle class (but again, this narrows among likely voters). The other is an even wider, 30-point lead, 55-25 percent, in trust to handle issues of particular concern to women.      The Republicans have some vulnerability in other areas, as well. Americans say the Democratic Party comes closer than the GOP to their positions on climate change, by 18 points; whether or not to raise the minimum wage, by 16 points; gay marriage, by 14 points; and the issue of abortion, by 8 points. On one remaining issue, gun control, the Republicans have a slight, 5-point edge.      HEALTH CARE - Obamacare, for its part, is a subject the Republicans have sought to turn to their advantage in the midterm elections, and the poll results show ample opportunity.      Costs are a particular target. As noted, 47 percent of Americans feel that their health care costs are rising as a result of the ACA; 58 percent say the same about the overall costs of health care nationally. Just 8 and 11 percent, respectively, say the law has decreased these costs. If there's a case to be made that costs would have risen anyway - or that they would have risen faster absent the ACA - it's yet to resonate with large segments of the population.      Other assessments also are critical. The public by a 20-point margin, 44-24 percent, is more apt to say the law has made the overall health care system worse rather than better (although the number who say it's made things better is up by 5 points from December). The rest, 29 percent, see no change. Americans by 29-14 percent likewise say the ACA has made their own care worse rather than better, with more, 53 percent, reporting no impact.      Despite the website's improvements, half say the law's implementation is going worse than they expected when it began, vs. 41 percent better - another sign of the persistent antipathy that's dogged Obamacare from the start.      The poll also shows both the striking partisan division on Obamacare and the extent to which, on several questions, independents side more with Republicans on the issue. Thirty-eight percent of Democrats, for instance, say the ACA has increased health care costs nationally; that soars to 67 percent of independents and 73 percent of Republicans. And while 47 percent of Democrats think it's made the health care system better, just 6 and 16 percent of Republicans and independents, respectively, agree.      OBAMA/GROUPS - Divisions among groups remain especially stark in terms of Obama's ratings; further, as noted, he's lost ground in some of his core support groups. The president's approval rating since early March has lost 14 points among liberals, 12 points among people with postgraduate degrees, 10 points among urban residents, 9 points among Democrats and 7 points among those with incomes less than 50,000. He's lost 9 points among independents as well.      With 41 percent approval overall (his previous low was 42 percent last November and the same in October 2011), Obama's at new lows among nonwhites (61-34 percent, approve-disapprove) and liberals (63-31 percent), and matches his lows among moderates (46-48 percent) and independents (33-59 percent). His rating among Democrats, 74-22 percent, is a single point from its low.      Other results also mark the extent of the difficulties facing Obama and his party alike. A form of statistical analysis called regression finds that, as noted above, views on the economy correlate both with congressional vote preference, and views on which party should control Congress, independently of partisan affiliation. That suggests that the Democrats are in serious need of a positive shift in economic views.      That may be hard to accomplish. While 50 percent of Democrats say the economy's in good shape, that plummets not only among Republicans but independents as well, to 12 and 22 percent, respectively. And while 46 percent of Democrats see improvement in the economy, again just 22 percent of independents, and 15 percent of Republicans, agree.      Preferences on which party controls Congress may reflect a general inclination in favor of divided government - and don't always predict outcomes, as in 2002, when more registered voters preferred Democratic control yet the GOP held its ground. It's striking, nonetheless, that this poll finds Republican control favored not only in the 2012 red states, by 56-36 percent, but also by 51-41 percent in the blue states that backed Obama fewer than two years ago.      METHODOLOGY - This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by telephone April 24-27, 2014, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,000 adults, including landline and cell-phone-only respondents. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points, including design effect. Partisan divisions are 32-21-38 percent, Democrats-Republicans-independents.      The survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates of New York, N.Y., with sampling, data collection and tabulation by Abt-SRBI of New York, N.Y. ||||| President Obama’s approval rating fell to 41 percent, down from 46 percent through the first three months of the year and the lowest of his presidency in Washington Post-ABC News polls. (Charles Dharapak/AP)      Democrats face serious obstacles as they look to the November elections, with President Obama’s approval rating at a new low and a majority of voters saying they prefer a Congress in Republican hands to check the president’s agenda, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.      Obama’s approval rating fell to 41 percent, down from 46 percent through the first three months of the year and the lowest of his presidency in Post-ABC News polls. Just 42 percent approve of his handling of the economy, 37 percent approve of how he is handling the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and 34 percent approve of his handling of the situation involving Ukraine and Russia.      Obama’s low rating could be a significant drag on Democratic candidates this fall — past elections suggest that when approval ratings are as low as Obama’s, the president’s party is almost certain to suffer at the ballot box in November.      Republicans are favored to maintain control of the House, with the focus now on whether they can take control of the Senate. One key question about November is who will vote. Turnout in midterm elections is always lower than in presidential elections, and at this point, key elements of the Republican coalition — namely white voters and older voters — say they are more certain to cast ballots this fall than are younger voters and minorities, two groups that Democrats and Obama relied on in 2008 and 2012.      Democrats are not without assets as the midterm election campaigns intensify. Americans trust Democrats over Republicans by 40 to 34 percent to handle the country’s main problems. By significant margins, Americans see Democrats as better for the middle class and on women’s issues. Americans favor the Democrats’ positions on raising the minimum wage, same-sex marriage and on the broad issue of dealing with global climate change.      View Graphic Obama receives low marks as Democrats face midterm turnout challenge      Led by Obama, Democrats have sought to use many of these issues to draw contrasts with Republicans, both nationally and in states with the most competitive races. As yet, however, there is little evidence that those assets outweigh either the normal midterm disadvantages of the party that holds the White House or the dissatisfaction with the general direction of the country and Obama’s leadership generally.      The Affordable Care Act is expected to be a major issue in the midterm elections. Obama recently urged Democrats to defend the law energetically, particularly after the administration announced that 8 million people signed up for it during the initial enrollment period. Republicans are confident that opposition to the new law will energize their supporters.      The Post-ABC poll found that 44 percent say they support the law while 48 percent say they oppose it, which is about where it was at the end of last year and in January. Half of all Americans also say they think implementation is worse than expected.      Last month, a Post-ABC poll found 49 percent of Americans saying they supported the new law compared with 48 percent who opposed it. That finding was more positive for the administration than most other polls at the time. Democrats saw it as a possible leading indicator of a shift in public opinion, but that has not materialized.      A 58 percent majority say the new law is causing higher costs overall, and 47 percent say it will make the health-care system worse. While a majority say the quality of the health care they receive will remain the same, a plurality expect it to result in higher personal costs for that care.      A number of Democratic strategists are urging their candidates to campaign on a message that calls for continued implementation of the law, with some fixes. These strategists say that message is more popular than the “repeal and replace” theme of the Republicans. A separate poll Tuesday from the Kaiser Family Foundation finds nearly six in 10 want Congress to improve the law rather than repeal it and replace it with something new.      Democrats are hoping to put Republicans on the defensive on the question of “what next” for the Affordable Care Act. Republicans say they remain confident that the health-care issue will help them more in November.      Pessimism about the economy also persists, with more than seven in 10 describing the economy in negative terms. Public attitudes about the future of the economy are anything but rosy. Just 28 percent say they think the economy is getting better, while 36 percent say it is getting worse and 35 percent say it’s staying the same.      Americans express continued discontent about the country’s direction, with two-thirds saying things are on the wrong track. Asked whether each party’s incumbents deserve relection, at least six in 10 say they do not.      Among registered voters, 45 percent intend to vote for the Democratic candidate in House elections this fall, and 44 percent for the Republican candidate. Based on past elections, that close margin is troubling news for Democrats. Shortly before they lost control of the House in 2010, Democrats held a five-point advantage on this question.      Another measure of voting intentions came when people were asked whether they thought it was more important to have Democrats in charge in Congress to help support Obama’s policies or Republicans in charge to act as a check on the president’s policies. On this, 53 percent of voters say Republicans and 39 percent say Democrats. That is almost identical to the results of the same question when it was asked in September 2010, two months before the GOP landslide.      The decline in Obama’s approval rating in the most recent poll was the result of lower support among both Democrats and independents. At this point, 74 percent of Democrats say they approve of his job performance, one point higher than his lowest ever in Post-ABC surveys. The worry for Obama and his party is that many of the Democrats who disapprove of Obama’s performance simply won’t show up in November.      Although Obama’s overall approval rating is at its lowest point ever in Post-ABC polls, his disapproval is still a few points better than at its worst. That’s because more people than usual say they had no opinion. At this point, Obama’s approval rating looks only slightly better than that of President George W. Bush in the spring of 2006.      Also, the disapproval of Obama’s handling of the situation with Ukraine and Russia is 46 percent, with 20 percent saying they have no opinion on that — perhaps a sign that Americans see few good policy options for the United States in the standoff.      Some Democratic strategists have argued that their candidates have ample arguments to make against Republicans this fall as they seek to hold down expected losses.      The Post-ABC survey sheds light on what they are. Democrats have a significant advantage on eight issues, from health care to climate change to abortion and same-sex marriage. Democrats have a smaller advantage on immigration, and the two parties are roughly equal on the economy. Republicans have the edge on three — guns, the deficit and striking the right balance on which government programs to cut.      Where Democrats have the biggest advantages are on the same contrasts that helped Obama win reelection in 2012 — indicators of which party voters believe is on their side. By 52 to 32 percent, those surveyed say they trust Democrats to do a better job helping the middle class, and by 55 to 25 percent, they trust Democrats on issues that are especially important to women.      How much those attitudes will actually drive voting decisions and voter turnout will be important in determining what happens in November.      The Post-ABC poll was conducted April 24 to 27 among a random national sample of 1,000 adults, including interviews on land lines and with cellphone-only respondents. The overall margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.      Scott Clement contributed to this report. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"According to a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll, President Barack Obama's job approval rating has fallen to a career low, with a majority of those surveyed preferring a Republican Congress to act as a check on his policies. Discontent with the state of the economy seems to be a significant contributing factor to these political views. Obama's job approval rating has dropped to 41 percent, suffering losses among some of his core support groups. The Affordable Care Act has also played a role in these developments, with 44 percent of Americans supporting it and 48 percent opposing it. These factors could potentially have a negative impact on Democratic candidates in the upcoming November elections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Information:  - A physicist is a scientist who has specialized knowledge in the field of physics, the exploration of the interactions of matter and energy across the physical universe.  - The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world's largest and most powerful particle collider, most complex experimental facility ever built, and the largest single machine in the world. It was built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) between 1998 and 2008 in collaboration with over 10,000 scientists and engineers from over 100 countries, as well as hundreds of universities and laboratories. It lies in a tunnel in circumference, as deep as beneath the FranceSwitzerland border near Geneva, Switzerland. Its first research run took place from 30 March 2010 to 13 February 2013 at an initial energy of 3.5 teraelectronvolts (TeV) per beam (7 TeV total), almost 4 times more than the previous world record for a collider, rising to 4 TeV per beam (8 TeV total) from 2012. On 13 February 2013 the LHC's first run officially ended, and it was shut down for planned upgrades. 'Test' collisions restarted in the upgraded collider on 5 April 2015, reaching 6.5 TeV per beam on 20 May 2015 (13 TeV total, the current world record). Its second research run commenced on schedule, on 3 June 2015.  - Prague is the capital and largest city of the Czech Republic. It is the 14th largest city in the European Union. It is also the historical capital of Bohemia. Situated in the north-west of the country on the Vltava river, the city is home to about 1.26 million people, while its larger urban zone is estimated to have a population of nearly 2 million. The city has a temperate climate, with warm summers and chilly winters.  - Charles University, known also as Charles University in Prague  is the oldest and largest university in the Czech Republic. Founded in 1348, it was the first university in Central Europe. It is one of the oldest universities in Europe in continuous operation and ranks in the upper 1.5 percent of the worlds best universities.  - The Cavendish experiment, performed in 17971798 by British scientist Henry Cavendish, was the first experiment to measure the force of gravity between masses in the laboratory and the first to yield accurate values for the gravitational constant. Because of the unit conventions then in use, the gravitational constant does not appear explicitly in Cavendish's work. Instead, the result was originally expressed as the specific gravity of the Earth, or equivalently the mass of the Earth. His experiment gave the first accurate values for these geophysical constants. The experiment was devised sometime before 1783 by geologist John Michell, who constructed a torsion balance apparatus for it. However, Michell died in 1793 without completing the work. After his death the apparatus passed to Francis John Hyde Wollaston and then to Henry Cavendish, who rebuilt the apparatus but kept close to Michell's original plan. Cavendish then carried out a series of measurements with the equipment and reported his results in the \\"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\\" in 1798.  - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.  - The Czech Republic, also known by the short name Czechia, is a nation state in Central Europe bordered by Germany to the west, Austria to the south, Slovakia to the east and Poland to the northeast. The Czech Republic covers an area of with mostly temperate continental climate and oceanic climate. It is a unitary parliamentary republic, has 10.5 million inhabitants and the capital and largest city is Prague, with over 1.2 million residents. The Czech Republic includes the historical territories of Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia.  - Experimental physics is the category of disciplines and sub-disciplines in the field of physics that are concerned with the observation of physical phenomena and experiments. Methods vary from discipline to discipline, from simple experiments and observations, such as the Cavendish experiment, to more complicated ones, such as the Large Hadron Collider.  - Vincenc Strouhal ( enk Strouhal ) ( April 10 , 1850 -- January 26 , 1922 ) was a Czech physicist specializing in experimental physics .

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the full name of the location where Richard II began his procession?  When Richard II was crowned in 1377, he led a procession from the Tower to Westminster Abbey. This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in St John's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV. In the 15th century, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup, Henry IV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of Henry V (1413–1422) renewed England's fortune in the Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.Much of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne, the houses of Lancaster and York. The castle was once again besieged in 1460, this time by a Yorkist force. The Tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton.

Can you fix that?","output":"One couple tied their six children to trees so they could not follow them as they fled to find food. It's concerning to hear about the desperation that led a couple to choose such a drastic action in order to search for food. This situation speaks to broader issues, such as extreme poverty, famine, and the overall lack of resources available to ensure that every family can provide for their basic needs.  In a world where many have access to an abundance of food, it's important to address the factors that cause such disparity and the unfortunate choices that result from those situations. Here are some different aspects to consider: 1. Poverty: This type of incident often stems from extreme poverty, in which families struggle to meet their basic needs, including food, clothing, and shelter. Chronic poverty causes many families to resort to desperate measures in order to survive. Governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) must work together to tackle poverty and help support impoverished families. 2. Famine: Famines can arise due to various factors, such as climate change, conflict, and poor governance, leading to widespread hunger and malnutrition in affected regions. International organizations and local governments need to work together to provide emergency food aid during famines and implement measures to prevent future ones. 3. Lack of access to education: Education plays a critical role in breaking the cycle of poverty. An educated population is better equipped to find ways to meet their basic needs and create better lives for themselves and their families. Ensuring that children in impoverished regions have access to quality education is paramount. 4. Weak social safety nets: In some cases, families may not have access to the necessary social safety nets or support systems that could help mitigate their dire situations. Strengthening these safety nets can provide a lifeline for families in need. 5. War and conflict: Families in war-torn areas are particularly vulnerable to experiencing extreme hardships. Peace-building efforts must be a priority for local and international organizations in order to establish security and stability in these regions, thus facilitating the rebuilding of communities. 6. Climate change: The increasing unpredictability of weather patterns due to climate change can lead to crop failures, water shortages, and additional challenges for families as they search for ways to provide food and other basic necessities. Combating climate change is essential in order to mitigate its impact on the most vulnerable populations. As we work to address these pressing issues, we must remember the extreme circumstances faced by many families across the world and strive to create a global society where incidents like this become a part of history rather than ongoing reality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is some data: United States, language, English language. Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"The data provided includes three significant keywords: United States, language, and English language. In this detailed description, each of these terms will be explored, as well as the relationship and significance between them. United States: The United States (U.S. or US), also referred to as the United States of America (USA), is a federal republic composed of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various minor island possessions. The country is located primarily in North America and spans across various time zones, climate regions, and geographical landscapes. Spanning a total area of 3.8 million square miles, the United States is the third or fourth-largest country in the world by total area. It is known for its highly diverse population, strong economy, political influence, and rich cultural contributions. The United States has a complex history, with its origins dating back to the Indigenous peoples who inhabited the land for thousands of years before the arrival of European settlers in the 15th and 16th centuries, and the eventual formation of the country after declaring independence from Britain in 1776. Language: Language is a complex and highly-structured system of communication that is utilized by humans to express and comprehend thoughts, ideas, emotions, and experiences. Languages are rooted in symbols, primarily spoken or written, which represent specific meanings and can be efficiently combined and manipulated according to grammatical rules. These symbols, or words, are organized into hierarchical structures that comprise letters, morphemes, words, phrases, clauses, and sentences. In addition to verbal and written languages, non-verbal languages also play a significant role in communication through body language, facial expressions, and gestures. With over 7,000 distinct languages spoken around the world today, language remains central to human culture, identity, and socialization. English Language: The English language is a West Germanic language that originated from the Anglo-Saxon dialects spoken by Germanic settlers in what is now England and southern Scotland between the 5th and the 7th centuries AD. Over time, English has evolved and incorporated elements from Old Norse, Norman-French, Latin, and other languages, creating a highly diverse and dynamic linguistic landscape. Today, English is considered the global language—or \\"lingua franca\\"—owing to its widespread use in diplomacy, business, academia, and technology. With approximately 375 million native speakers and over 1.5 billion individuals capable of speaking and understanding English as a second language, the English language is the most widely spoken language in the world. The Relationship Between the United States and the English Language: The United States is home to the largest population of English speakers in the world. English is the primary language spoken by the majority of its residents, and it is the official language of the federal government. The English language played a crucial role in the development and expansion of the United States, as it was the dominant language spoken by the European settlers who established the colonies. Today, the United States' global influence in politics, economy, and culture contributes significantly to the spread and dominance of the English language worldwide. In turn, the English language has shaped the nation's identity and facilitated its integration with the global community. In summary, the data provided: United States, language, and English language are interconnected terms that represent a complex relationship between a nation, its primary means of communication, and the historical, cultural, and global influence arising from that communication. The United States, as a country, is characterized by its cultural diversity, which is reflected in the multifaceted nature of the English language and the way it has evolved and spread to become the global lingua franca."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This includes allocating resources for hiring qualified teachers, developing curriculum, providing educational materials, and maintaining safe school facilities. Moreover, governments invest in special educational programs, extracurricular activities, and nutritional support for students in need. 2. Parents: While school children are the central beneficiaries, government help with schools also indirectly assists parents. Parents gain peace of mind knowing their children are receiving an adequate education in a secure environment. Additionally, parents often benefit from government subsidies or tax breaks that lower the overall expenses of their children's education. 3. Get money: Governments collect and allocate public funds to support education through taxes, grants, and other fiscal measures. Properly managing and distributing these resources helps ensure that schools can continually improve their infrastructure, educational materials, and staff support. 4. Require to pay taxes: While everyone is required to pay taxes, certain taxes are earmarked specifically for education. This shared responsibility ensures all members of a community contribute to the development and sustainment of a high-quality educational system. 5. Take money: The term \\"take money\\" might refer to government practices that allocate and manage funds for educational purposes. Governments must ensure that tax dollars are effectively used to provide equal opportunities for all students, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status. In conclusion, while the main beneficiaries of government help with schools are indeed school children, it is essential to understand that this assistance also reaches out to parents, educational staff, and the community as a whole. Providing quality education to all helps in building a stronger, more informed, and well-rounded society."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer. Article: It was Saturday. As always, it was a busy one, for \\"Six days shall you labor and all your work\\" was taken seriously back then. Outside, Father and Mr. Patrick next door were busy chopping firewood. Inside their own houses, Mother and Mrs. Patrick were engaged in spring cleaning. Somehow the boys had slipped away to the back lot with their kites. Now, even at the risk of having brother caught to beat carpets, they had sent him to the kitchen for more string . It seemed there was  no limit to the heights to which kites would fly today. My mother looked at the sitting room, its furniture disordered for a thorough sweeping. Again she cast a look toward the window. \\"Come on, girls! Let's take string to the boys and watch them fly the kites a minute.\\" On the way we met Mrs. Patric, laughing guiltily as if she were doing something wrong, together with her girls. There never was such a day for flying kites! We played all our fresh string into the boys' kites and they went up higher and higher. We could hardly distinguish the orange-colored spots of the kites. Now and then we slowly pulled one kite back, watching it dancing up and down in the wind, and finally bringing it down to earth, just for the joy of sending it up again. Even our fathers dropped their tools and joined us. Our mothers took their turn, laughing like schoolgirls. I think _ . Parents forgot their duty and their dignity; children forgot their everyday fights and little jealousies. \\"Perhaps it's like this in the kingdom of heaven,\\" I thought confusedly. It was growing dark before we all walked sleepily back to the housed. I suppose we had some sort of supper. I suppose there must have been surface tidying-up, for the house on Sunday looked clean and orderly enough. The strange thing was, we didn't mention that day afterward. I felt a little embarrassed.

OPTIONS: [-] Fill a mason type jar with chocolate milk, add a glow stick and seal it. [-] Fill a mason type jar with water, add a glow stick and seal it.","output":"To determine the better solution for making a cool bright lantern without a battery, let's compare and evaluate the given options step-by-step. Option 1: Fill a mason type jar with chocolate milk, add a glow stick and seal it. Step 1: Fill the jar with chocolate milk - Chocolate milk is opaque, which would limit the light from passing through it effectively. Step 2: Add a glow stick - A glow stick produces light by mixing the chemicals inside it.  Step 3: Seal the jar to keep the contents secure. Result: The chocolate milk would hinder the light from the glow stick, making this option less effective as a lantern.  Option 2: Fill a mason type jar with water, add a glow stick and seal it. Step 1: Fill the jar with water - Water is transparent, which allows light to pass through it effectively.  Step 2: Add a glow stick - A glow stick produces light by mixing the chemicals inside it. The light will be easily visible through the water. Step 3: Seal the jar to keep the contents secure. Result: The water helps transmit the light from the glow stick more efficiently, making this option a better choice for a lantern. Based on the analysis of these steps, Option 2 (Fill a mason type jar with water, add a glow stick and seal it) is the better solution for making a cool bright lantern without a battery, as it allows the light from the glow stick to be transmitted more effectively through the jar with water."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Who was defeated at the Battle of Megalopolis? , can you please find it?   Alexander perhaps undercut his own rule by demonstrating signs of megalomania. While utilizing effective propaganda such as the cutting of the Gordian Knot, he also attempted to portray himself as a living god and son of Zeus following his visit to the oracle at Siwah in the Libyan Desert (in modern-day Egypt) in 331 BC. His attempt in 327 BC to have his men prostrate before him in Bactra in an act of proskynesis borrowed from the Persian kings was rejected as religious blasphemy by his Macedonian and Greek subjects after his court historian Callisthenes refused to perform this ritual. When Alexander had Parmenion murdered at Ecbatana (near modern Hamadan, Iran) in 330 BC, this was \\"symptomatic of the growing gulf between the king's interests and those of his country and people\\", according to Errington. His murder of Cleitus the Black in 328 BC is described as \\"vengeful and reckless\\" by Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington. Continuing the polygamous habits of his father, Alexander encouraged his men to marry native women in Asia, leading by example when he wed Roxana, a Sogdian princess of Bactria. He then married Stateira II, eldest daughter of Darius III, and Parysatis II, youngest daughter of Artaxerxes III, at the Susa weddings in 324 BC.Meanwhile, in Greece, the Spartan king Agis III attempted to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against Macedonia. He was defeated in 331 BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead. Before Antipater embarked on his campaign in the Peloponnese, Memnon, the governor of Thrace, was dissuaded from rebellion by use of diplomacy. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans on the condition that they submit fifty nobles as hostages. Antipater's hegemony was somewhat unpopular in Greece due to his practice (perhaps by order of Alexander) of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian... A:","output":"The Battle of Megalopolis occurred in 331 BC, during the time of Alexander the Great. However, the key figure involved in this battle was not Alexander himself, but his deputy, Antipater. While Alexander was off in Asia, the Spartan King Agis III, attempted to lead a rebellion in Greece against Macedonia. This rebellion was met with fierce opposition in the form of Antipater and his forces. Our key question here is - \\"Who was defeated at the Battle of Megalopolis?\\" From the information provided in the article, we can establish that the person defeated was King Agis III of Sparta. Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead, succeeds in defeating Agis III in the Battle of Megalopolis. After winning the battle, Antipater didn't immediately engage in punitive measures against Sparta. Instead, he deferred the task of deciding Sparta's punishment to the League of Corinth, which was headed by Alexander. In the end, Alexander opted to pardon the Spartans on the condition that they provide fifty nobles as hostages. Therefore, we can conclude that the Battle of Megalopolis marked a major defeat for King Agis III of Sparta at the hands of Antipater, who was acting on behalf of Alexander the Great. This demonstrates the strength of Macedonia's forces and the savviness of their political moves, both on the battlefield and in the wider strategic sense. Despite the challenges posed by dissent and rebellion in Greece, Macedonia managed to maintain control, thus ensuring the continuation of Alexander's empire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options are: [I] watch Cameron play baseball [II] earn the scholarship [III] boo Cameron Answer:","output":"To determine the best course of action for others based on the given options, we can analyze the motivations and interests of people who hear about Cameron's achievements: Option I: Watch Cameron play baseball - People might be interested in watching Cameron play because they may admire his talent and achievements or want to support him as a friend or family member. - This may be the most plausible option for those who genuinely wish to see Cameron succeed and are fans of baseball themselves. Option II: Earn the scholarship - Others may feel inspired by Cameron's success and seek to earn a scholarship themselves. - This could be a likely route for motivated individuals who have a passion for baseball or any other athletic or academic discipline, and who want to pursue higher education. Option III: Boo Cameron - This is an unlikely choice for most people as it reflects negativity and animosity towards Cameron. - Only those who have personal issues with him or are envious of his achievements might choose this option. Considering these factors, most people would likely choose either Option I (watch Cameron play baseball) or Option II (earn the scholarship). Both of these options represent positive and supportive responses to Cameron's achievements.

The remaining vampire covens are on the verge of annihilation by the Lycans. Both species are searching for Selene: the vampires seek justice for the death of Viktor, while the Lycans, led by Marius, intend to use her to locate Eve, whose blood holds the key to building an army of vampire-werewolf hybrids. Semira, a council member of the Eastern Coven, tells Thomas she wants Selene to be granted clemency and to train the coven's neophyte Death Dealers. She asks Thomas to plead Selene's case before the full council; the plea is successful and the council reluctantly agrees to a pardon in exchange for Selene's help. Selene arrives with David. Semira has Varga, her ally and lover, poison Selene and slaughter the trainees, framing Selene for the atrocity. With Selene in her power, Semira begins draining her blood, which she intends to drink to steal her power. Thomas and David attempt a rescue, but are attacked by Semira and Varga. Thomas is killed, but David and Selene escape. The pair takes refuge at the Nordic Coven, pursued by Alexia, an Eastern Coven vampire dispatched by Semira.

The opposition speaks for the interests of all groups in society and voices the concerns of the people. A free, strong, and vibrant opposition can safeguard democracy in various ways: 1. Providing constructive criticism: A healthy opposition constructively criticizes the government's policies, highlighting their shortcomings and suggesting possible improvements. This ensures that the government remains responsive to the needs of the people and adopts better policies. 2. Impeding abuses of power: Democracy involves the separation of powers to prevent any one body from monopolizing authority. A robust opposition serves as a check and balance on the government by holding it accountable for its actions, thereby impeding potential abuses of power. 3. Encouraging debate and dialogue: Opposition parties create a space for diverse opinions and perspectives, fostering open dialogue and debate on various issues. This encourages the government to consider different viewpoints and defend its stance, leading to more informed decision-making processes. 4. Ensuring representation: In a democracy, different sectors of society should be well-represented to ensure that their needs and concerns are addressed. Strong opposition parties offer an alternative to the ruling party and represent the interests of those who may not support the government's policies. 5. Contributing to policy-making: Opposition parties contribute to policy-making by proposing alternative solutions to the issues faced by society. In some instances, they may collaborate with the government to put forward bipartisan legislation that benefits the nation as a whole. 6. Safeguarding democratic values: A free, strong, and vibrant opposition actively promotes and defends democratic institutions, values, and processes. By doing so, they play a crucial role in maintaining a well-functioning democratic system. In conclusion, the presence of a free, strong, and vibrant opposition is essential for a proper democracy to thrive.

Some advantages include access to new markets, increased competition leading to improved goods and services, opportunities for diversification, and the flow of capital and technology across borders. These factors can lead to economic growth and job creation. However, the challenges that arise from being part of a global economy include vulnerability to economic shocks, such as financial crises in other parts of the world, job displacement due to outsourcing, and environmental issues caused by unregulated growth. Also, the interconnectedness of economies can further widen the income inequality gap, both within and among countries. To navigate the complexities of a global economy, governments, businesses, and individuals need to adapt and find ways to maximize the benefits while minimizing the disadvantages.

In November 1954, Price made her recital debut at New York's Town Hall with a program that featured the New York premiere of Samuel Barber's cycle Hermit Songs, with the composer at the piano, and began her first recital tour in the Community Concerts series for Columbia Artists. Then, the door to opera opened through television, the NBC Opera Theater series. In February 1955, she sang Puccini's Tosca for the NBC Opera Theater, under music director Peter Herman Adler, becoming the first African American to appear in a leading role in televised opera. Several NBC affiliates (not all Southern) canceled the broadcast in protest. She returned in three other NBC Opera broadcasts, as Pamina (1956), Madame Lidoine in Poulenc's Dialogues of the Carmelites (1957), and Donna Anna in Don Giovanni (1960).  In March 1955, she was auditioned at Carnegie Hall by the Austrian conductor Herbert von Karajan, who was then touring with the Berlin Philharmonic. Impressed with her singing of \\"Pace, pace, mio Dio\\" from Verdi's La forza del destino, Karajan reportedly leapt to the stage to accompany her himself. Calling her \\"an artist of the future\\" he asked her management for control of her future European career. Over the next three seasons, Price crossed the U.S. in recitals with her longtime accompanist, David Garvey, and in orchestral appearances. She also toured India (1956) and Australia (1957), under the auspices of the U.S. State Department. She sang a concert version of Aida--her first public performance of the role--at the May Festival in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on May 3, 1957.  Her first appearance on the grand opera stage occurred in San Francisco on September 20, 1957, singing Madame Lidoine in the U.S. premiere of the Dialogues of the Carmelites. A few weeks later, Price sang her first on-stage Aida, stepping in for Italian soprano Antonietta Stella, who was suffering from appendicitis. The following May, she made her European debut, as Aida, at the Vienna Staatsoper on May 24, 1958, at Karajan's invitation and under his baton. Debuts followed at London's Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (replacing Anita Cerquetti), and at the Arena di Verona, both as Aida. The next season she returned to Vienna to sing Aida and her first onstage Pamina in The Magic Flute, repeated her Aida at Covent Garden, sang operatic scenes by R. Strauss on BBC Radio, and made her debut at the Salzburg Festival in Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, under Karajan.  The close artistic understanding between Karajan and Price was reflected in many of her early career successes in the opera house (Mozart's Don Giovanni, Verdi's Il trovatore and Puccini's Tosca), in the concert hall (Bach's Mass in B minor, Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, Bruckner's Te Deum, and the Requiems of Verdi and Mozart), and in the recording studio (complete recordings of Tosca and Carmen, and a bestselling holiday music album, A Christmas Offering). Most of her recordings and many of her live performances have been released on CD.  On May 21, 1960, Price made her first appearance at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan, again as Aida, becoming the first African American to sing a leading role in Italy's greatest opera house.

David Moyes will be sacked by Manchester United after the owners, the Glazer family, finally lost patience with the club’s dismal season. United are confident of landing Holland coach Louis van Gaal as his replacement once they have tied up details of their manager’s severance. The Barclays Premier League champions have already made contact with the Dutchman and he wants to join United after the World Cup. The Old Trafford board planned to sack. Moyes — just a year into a six-year contract — at the end of the season. but will now bring forward that announcement after news of their. intentions was reported by MailOnline on Monday afternoon. End of the line: David Moyes will be sacked by Manchester United and could leave before the end of the season. Under pressure: United crashed to a 2-0 defeat at Moyes's former club Everton on Sunday, their 11th defeat of the Premier League season. Searching for inspiration: Moyes has found it impossible to maintain the high standards set by predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson. Bright beginnings: Moyes started work at Old Trafford on July 1 last summer, having been announced as Ferguson's replacement in May. Played 51Won 27Drawn 9Lost 15Win percentage 52.94. Moyes, on a day off on Monday, had still not been contacted by the club on Monday night and is understood to be hurt and angry after learning of his fate on newspaper websites. He will attend trainingat Carrington today but may well not survive the week. Player-coach Ryan Giggs is lined up to replace him until the end of the season, alongside fellow Treble winner Nicky Butt, as United try to salvage some pride by finishing in the Europa League places at least. Sir Alex Ferguson, who appointed Moyes, is expected to have little or no say in who the next manager will be. News of the 50-year-old’s imminent departure broke on Monday in the wake of Sunday’s defeat at his old club Everton. However, it is understood the club decided to look for alternatives after the 2-0 reverse in the Champions League at Olympiacos in February. Meet the new boss: Moyes gets to work on his first morning as United manager at the club's Carrington training complex. Backing: Supporters on the Stretford End commissioned a banner proclaiming Moyes as the 'Chosen One' Good start: Moyes lifts the Community Shield after United beat Wigan 2-0 at Wembley back in August. It will be his only piece of silverware with the club. Winning start: United won 4-1 at Swansea City on the opening day of the season, getting their title defence off to the perfect start. Warm reception: Moyes is introduced to the Old Trafford crowd prior to his first home game against Chelsea. April 26 Norwich City (H)May 3 Sunderland (H)May 6 Hull City (H)May 11 Southampton (A) The Glazers, who are due in Manchester next week, had been supportive of Moyes but have sensed since the turn of the year that results and performances were getting worse and that some of United’s senior stars had simply stopped playing for their manager. They want to appoint a new manager — preferably Van Gaal — as soon as possible so they can tie up deals for players including. Southampton’s Luke Shaw before the World Cup. United know that it will be hard enough to attract players this summer without Champions League football and didn’t want to continue the negotiating process with a manager who had become a lame duck. Certainly not many United players will be disappointed to hear the news. Even those who like Moyes realised that things were not working, an impression that hardened when the Scot walked into the dressing room at Goodison Park on Sunday afternoon and told his team they had played well. Taste of defeat: Moyes suffered his first league loss at Anfield as a Daniel Sturridge gave Liverpool a 1-0 win on September 1. Down to work: Moyes leads a training session at Carrington ahead of his first Champions League match with United back in September. Euro stars: United beat Bayer Leverkusen 4-2 at Old Trafford in their opening Champions League fixture of the season. Nightmare: The scale of Moyes's task at Old Trafford became apparent in the 4-1 defeat at rivals Manchester City on September 24. Bad to worse: Moyes can't believe his misfortune as United are beaten at home by West Bromwich on September 28. If talks with Van Gaal don’t work out as expected, United will consider alternative targets such as Dortmund’s Jurgen Klopp and Real Madrid’s Carlo Ancelotti. At 62, Van Gaal is a relatively old manager, but after the experiment with Moyes, United are aware they need a coach with the presence and the experience to cope with a club of their size and profile. United old boy Phil Neville may survive the backroom cull, as may goalkeeping coach Chris Woods after his exceptional work with David de Gea this season. Masterstroke: Moyes did persuade star striker Wayne Rooney to turn down the overtures of Chelsea and sign a new contract. Revenge: United knocked Liverpool out of the Capital One Cup at the third round stage, offering swift retribution for the Anfield loss. Passion play: Moyes celebrates Javier Hernandez's goal as United beat Stoke City 3-2 at Old Trafford. Low point: Moyes sits and considers his options as United lose 1-0 to his former club Everton on December 4. Row: Moyes grabs the ball from Hatem Ben Arfa as Alan Pardew looks on during December's 1-0 home loss to Newcastle United. Race is on: Moyes runs along the touchline to retrieve the ball during United's New Year's Day loss to Tottenham. Protest: Moyes runs on to the pitch to appeal after a blatant handball is not given in the Tottenham match. No luck: Moyes rues a missed chance as United slipped to a 2-1 defeat to Sunderland in the first leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final. Out: With coach Phil Neville after United were knocked out of the Capital One Cup on penalties by Sunderland. January sales: Moyes bought Juan Mata from Chelsea for £37m in a bid to revive the flagging season. Nadir: United produced their most miserable performance of the season as they were beaten 2-0 by Olympiacos in the first leg of their last 16 Champions League tie. The great turnaround: But a Robin van Persie hat-trick gave United a 3-0 win at Old Trafford and took them through to a last eight encounter with Bayern Munich. Anger: A fan remonstrates with Moyes during the 3-0 home defeat by Manchester City. Guarded: Stewards protect the 'Chosen one' banner on the Stretford End at the end of the City defeat. Stunt: Disgruntled United fans paid for this plane to fly over the ground during a home match with Aston Villa. The plane's appearance was roundly booed by United fans in the ground. Good display: United produced their best performance of the season in the 1-1 home draw with Bayern Munich. Beyond them: But Bayern came from behind in the second leg in Munich to win 3-1 and knock United out of the Champions League. Waving goodbye: The final straw was United's 2-0 loss at Goodison Park on Sunday. Highlights:","output":"1. Manchester United will sack David Moyes after the Glazer family lost patience with the dismal season. 2. United is confident of landing Louis van Gaal as Moyes’s replacement after the World Cup. 3.

Answer the following question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

Scientists fear rising energy bills may lead to an increase in obesity   after discovering a link between poorly-heated homes and higher body -fat. Researchers from the University of Stirling's Behavioural Science Centre set out to explore claims that warm indoor temperatures have contributed to rising obesity levels in winter.Instead, the team found that people who live in well-heated homes are more likely to have low body mass index   levels while those who keep their heating turned down or off tend to be heavier. Dr Michael Daly, behavioral scientist and senior lecturer, said: \\"We set out to investigate the scientific claims that cooler indoor temperatures help us maintain a healthy weight by pushing our bodies to use up more energy. In fact, the research suggests people may eat less and burn more energy when in a warmer indoor environment. The 13-year study, published in the journal Obesity, involved more than 100,000 adults across England. Researchers found reduced weight levels among people living in homes heated to above 23degC(73F), which involved about 15,000 of the households studied. Dr Daly said: \\"As national gas bills continue to rise faster than the rate of inflation, this research suggests the obesity could worsen where heating is turned down below comfortable levels or off for long periods to cut costs.\\" This is not just about people who live in well-heated homes being in the financial position to afford more expensive low-calorie foods, exercise classes and sporting activities, and therefore finding it easier to maintain a low BMI level.The study took age, sex, social class and other factors into account. \\"The comfortable temperature of 20degC -23degC is where we feel comfortable in our clothes and are neither hot nor cold.At temperatures above this, we use more energy and we eat less because our appetite is affected.\\" The findings of the research can be described as   _  .

What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  The caterpillar eats constantly until it grows bigger - The caterpillar starts to form a cocoon around itself - The caterpillar becomes a pupa - After some time the cocoon hatches - And a butterfly is born. The answer to this question is:","output":"The missing first step of the process is the egg stage. The detailed and long answer is as follows: 1. Egg stage: The life cycle of a butterfly begins with the female butterfly laying eggs on a suitable host plant, usually the one that provides an ideal food source for the soon-to-be-hatched caterpillars. The eggs are small, often shaped like tiny spheres or ovals, and are laid either singularly or in clusters, depending on the species. The eggs are equipped with a protective outer layer called the chorion, which keeps them safe from environmental fluctuations and predators. Additionally, a layer of fluid is present between the egg and the chorion for further nourishment. 2. The caterpillar/larval stage (mentioned in the question): Once the eggs hatch, the caterpillars emerge with a voracious appetite. In this stage, their main purpose is to consume food, specifically the leaves of the designated host plant, allowing them to grow rapidly. As they grow, the caterpillars molt or shed their outer layer of skin multiple times to accommodate their increasing size. 3. Cocoon formation/chrysalis stage (mentioned in the question): After reaching an optimal size, the caterpillar finds a safe location to begin spinning a cocoon, also known as a chrysalis or pupa, around itself. The cocoon is constructed from silk, which is secreted by the caterpillar's spinneret glands. The cocoon serves as a protective covering while the caterpillar undergoes a remarkable transformation called metamorphosis. 4. Pupa stage (mentioned in the question): Inside the cocoon, the caterpillar's body breaks down and rearranges itself into the adult butterfly form. This stage can last anywhere from a few days to several months, depending on the species and environmental conditions. During this time, the caterpillar undergoes significant changes, including the development of wings, compound eyes, and a more slender body. 5. Adult butterfly/emergence (mentioned in the question): After the metamorphosis is complete, the adult butterfly emerges from the cocoon. In this stage, the butterfly is fully formed, displaying intricate patterns and vibrant colors on its wings. Shortly after emerging, the butterfly's wings will be soft and must be expanded by pumping a fluid called hemolymph through the wing veins, after which they will harden, allowing the butterfly to fly. 6. Reproduction: As adult butterflies, their primary purpose is now to find a mate and reproduce, ensuring the continuation of their species. The entire life cycle begins anew as the female lays her eggs on a suitable host plant."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

A cheeky dude (Brandon Moore) yelling “what are thooose?” at the officer’s functional, ugly footwear. Millions of loops and views and copycats later, a meme is born. The first urban dictionary entry for the phrase and practice appeared in 2011, but it was 2015 when the sport of pointing at some awful shoes (preferably Crocs) and shouting “what are those?!!” entered the mainstream. The best example is the wonderful take on the Jurassic Park theme tune (see below, 50 million Vine loops so far), which I like because it’s less mean-spirited than real life examples. In fact, the man who started the whole thing back in the summer seems kind of rude – and is now in jail. Um. It stormed collective internet consciousness in early September. Norwegian Kevin Synnes decided to embarrass his girlfriend in a store by pushing down on a bunch of toy ducks which, when pressed, emitted a loud “aaarghh!” noise. The video was then appropriated by Vine star Charlie Murphy and subsequently looped millions of times, spawning multiple variants. There has even been a mash-up with the what are those? meme. My person favourite versions are those which pay tribute to Adele and Taylor Swift. However, a Guardian investigation revealed that that the toy was not a duck, but a pelican. Listen to our interview with Kevin here. Read more: How the duck army stormed the internet It took just a 30-second snippet of Adele’s new single, Hello, debuted during the advert break of the UK television show, The X Factor, to have the singer trending worldwide on Twitter. And while the haunting piano and hushed, smoky tones beloved of millions of fans induced much excitement among those desperate to hear the full song, the clip also inspired plenty of memes. “Hello, it’s me” is a pretty meme-able phrase, and the internet did not disappoint. When the sepia-tinged video dropped, featuring the singer in an amazing coat, using a flip-phone and hanging out in an abandoned house, the memes just multiplied. Especially re: the flip-phone. One woman even texted her ex the entire lyrics to Hello, without him catching on at all. Read more: Hello, it’s me. On a flip-phone.

Minaj didn’t “throw shade” – she directly called Cyrus out, in front of a TV audience of millions. If anything, that is the direct opposite of throwing shade. The incident happened at the MTV Music Video Awards in response to an interview Cyrus gave in which she called Minaj “not very polite”. While accepting an award Minaj called Cyrus “this bitch who had a lot to say about me in the press the other day”, before ending with the perfectly passive aggressive, “Miley, what’s good?” Cue memes. Lots and lots of memes.

His internet fame, however, is courtesy of a confused reaction face meme. At one point during a day-in-life-of documentary, Thru The Lens, posted on YouTube, Young pulls a “huh?” face when his mother calls him a clown. His quizzical expression towards the camera has spawned probably the best reaction macro of 2015 and can be used for disbelief, surprise or a thousand other reactions. The 21-year-old college student Nicholas Fraser became an internet sensation when he decided to perform, in his yard, perched on a toilet, as one does, a quick cover of Next’s Too Close, but with the lyrics changed to “why the fuck you lyin’? / why you always lyin’?”) Given that people lie all of the time, and we know about it, guys, and we all want people to know that we know, Fraser’s vine caught on and inspired multiple cover versions of his cover version. Now, when your mate texts to say she is five minutes away but you know she probably hasn’t left the house yet, there’s a perfect means of responding. Thanks Nicholas.

After the Fifty Shades of Grey series of books sold so poorly , it was a punt for Universal Pictures to have taken on a film adaptation. But – oh, brave souls – it was brought to the screen in summer 2015 with Sam Taylor-Johnson at the helm and Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson starring. Given that the book had already resulted in a lot of cultural cache, it was inevitable that the film would inspire memes and jokes. The internet delivered. In particular, the “my tastes are very … singular” line (altered to “my desires are unconventional” for the internet) proved a rich seam. One of the best tracks of 2015, the video for Drake’s Hotline Bling didn’t drop until October – three months after the song’s release. But it was worth the wait. A minimalist clip, Drake shows off his unusual dance moves against different coloured backdrops inspired by artist James Turell. The rapper’s moves and pained impression inspired multiple parodies shared on YouTube, Vine and Twitter. Included below are some of the best: a dancing and adorable shiba inu (aka Doge), the Man From Another Place from Twin Peaks and perhaps best of all, some tennis backhand action.

The original Tumblr post posing the question racked up an enormous 73m page views, and a BuzzFeed piece on the dress has more than 38m page views to date. #TheDress trended for days on social media.

Get out your phone and go to http://t.co/dRffVZfw0P at 10:30pm I don’t think I’ve ever laughed so hard as when I discovered the Poot Lovato meme. A Tumblr post featuring an awkward fan photograph of singer Demi Lovato posited the theory that the snap was not of Demi herself, but her secret twin sister, Poot Lovato, who had been trapped in a basement her entire life. The fable took hold and soon the internet was ablaze with hilarious and creative Poot memes. Fan-fiction was written, fan art drawn, Instagram and Twitter accounts were established and even Demi herself addressed the joke (she wasn’t amused). Then, rather, brilliantly, a sleuth dug out a paparazzi photograph of Demi-as-Poot right at the moment the fan pic was taken. It’s still funny. Read more: Poot Lovato: has the internet discovered Demi’s secret sister? On THE SAME DAY AS THE DRESS, the internet exploded with one of the great police chases of our time – two llamas on the run. The llamas, one black and one white, ran loose in Sun City, Arizona. The whole internet followed, glued to the ABC15 live stream of the runaway beasts and tracking updates on Twitter. The llamas, true heroes of freedom and an inspiration to all, had escaped from their day job in an animal therapy centre. The black llama was caught first, its emancipation ended with a cruel lassoing. The white llama ran on, but eventually, it too was caught.

At The 2012 Summit League Baseball Tournament, The top four regular season finishers of the league's seven teams met in the double-elimination tournament held at a university based in which city ?","output":"The 2012 Summit League Baseball Tournament was held at the Alfred D. Boyer Stadium, which is located on the campus of South Dakota State University. South Dakota State University is based in Brookings, South Dakota. Thus, the city where the top four regular season finishers of the league's seven teams met for a double-elimination tournament that year, is Brookings. Brookings is situated in the eastern part of South Dakota and is the fourth largest city in the state. This city is known for its college-town atmosphere and for hosting important sports events, thanks to South Dakota State University, the state's largest institution of higher education.  The Summit League Baseball Tournament is an annual event that decides the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship. The double-elimination tournament format ensures that the participating teams get a fair chance, as they are expected to lose twice before getting eliminated from the competition. In 2012, the participating teams were striving for supremacy at the Alfred D. Boyer Stadium, an important sports venue in Brookings, and significant location in the field of Summit League Baseball. In general, the Summit League Baseball Tournament features the league's elite teams vying for the title, and the 2012 iteration was no different. The double-elimination design of the tournament intensifies the competition, as it allows the teams a mulligan, a second chance, after a single loss, thus adding a strategic angle to the team's approach towards the matches. Each of these elements contributes to a highly watchable, exciting baseball event for the audiences, especially the ones held in the vibrant city of Brookings, which could be considered an essential part of Summit League Baseball history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The French have always wanted to know what it means to be a French­man. Their history has been a constant quest for national identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central authority. In about 2000 b.c. Celtic tribes — probably from eastern Europe — came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Bur­gundy. At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south. The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Mar­seilles) around 600 b.c. , followed by other ports at Hyères, Antibes, and Nice. But the Greeks developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little commerce in olives and wine with the Celts of Burgundy. When their position was threatened by Ligurian pirates at sea and warlike tribes from inland, the merchants of Marseilles called on Rome for help. From Gaul to France In 125 b.c. , the Romans came in force, conquered the \\"Gallic barbarians,\\" and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence). They took advantage of this new stronghold to create Provincia (now Provence), stretching from the Alps to the Pyrénées, in order to guarantee communications between Italy and Spain. When this province was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, Julius Caesar himself took charge, conquering practically the whole of Gaul by 50 b.c. Caesar drew Gaul's northeastern frontier at the Rhine, taking in present-day Belgium, and warned that the Ger­man­ic tribes across the river — the Franks (after whom France is named), Alamans, and Saxons — would always threaten the security of the frontier. The Romanization of Gaul sent the most energetic warriors to defend the outposts of the empire while their families settled down to work the land or build towns such as Lyon, Orange, Arles, and Nîmes, and the first great highways between them. At the same time, merchants built up a thriving trade with the rest of the Roman Empire. The pattern for the peasantry and bourgeoisie of France was thus established.

And I was wondering What does Austin need to do before this? Answer:","output":"Before Austin throws candies to the parade watchers on the side of the street, there are several steps and preparations he must go through to ensure a safe, enjoyable, and organized experience. Here is a detailed breakdown of what Austin needs to do: 1. Planning and coordinating with parade organizers: Austin needs to be part of a parade group or organization and follow the guidelines set by the parade organizers. This may include obtaining a permit, paying necessary fees, submitting an entry form, attending informational meetings, and understanding the parade's theme and expectations. 2. Adhering to safety regulations: Safety should be Austin's top priority. He must familiarize himself with any rules and regulations specific to distributing candy during parades. These could include adhering to speed limits while on a float or vehicle, using gloves or tongs for hygiene, and ensuring candies are encased in waterproof packaging. 3. Choosing appropriate candies: Austin should choose candies that are popular, individually wrapped, and safe for all ages so that everyone can enjoy them. He should avoid items that pose choking hazards for young children, anything too hard that may cause dental injuries if thrown, and candies with common allergens like peanuts. Soft and small candies like lollipops, gummy bears, or chocolate kisses are usually excellent choices. 4. Buying and storing candy: Austin should purchase enough candies to last throughout the parade and accommodate for the anticipated crowd size. If possible, bulk purchases from a wholesale store or a special sale could help save money. Once acquired, he should keep the candies in a cool, dry, and dark location to ensure their quality is maintained before the day of the parade. 5. Preparing a method of distribution: Austin needs to devise a safe and efficient method for distributing candy to parade watchers. He may want to consider using a candy launcher or device to toss candy, wear gloves when handling unwrapped candies, or have a group of fellow volunteers to help distribute the treats throughout the parade. 6. Dressing up and float decorations: If Austin is part of a float or parade group, coordinating costumes or decorating the float according to the parade's theme and guidelines will make the experience more enjoyable and visually appealing for spectators. 7. Arriving early and preparing logistics: On the day of the parade, Austin should arrive early to secure his spot, load candies onto his float or vehicle, and prepare the distribution equipment and process. He should also be aware of parade safety rules, restroom locations, and meeting points for others in his group. 8. Practicing responsible candy distribution: Once the parade commences, Austin needs to maintain a steady and reasonable candy distribution pace, focusing on not overloading certain areas or leaving others with nothing. He should also be mindful of potential hazards, such as throwing candy with too much force or targeting spectators who may not be receptive to the treat. By following these steps, Austin can ensure he is well-prepared to safely and efficiently distribute candy to parade watchers, contributing to a memorable event for everyone involved."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Here's what people are saying: Joe Scarborough gave an impassioned speech on Morning Joe this morning. \\"From this day forward, nothing can ever be the same again,\\" he declared. Scarborough earned the NRA's top rating while in Congress, but he said that on Friday he realized \\"that the ideologies of my past career were no longer relevant ...

People from various walks of life are expressing their views on whether America is ready to have an earnest conversation about gun control. Joe Scarborough, who earned the NRA's top rating while in Congress, stated on Morning Joe that the ideologies of his past career were no longer relevant. He passionately declared that it was time for Congress to prioritize children's safety over dangerous dogmatic principles. Many believe that it is entirely appropriate to politicize this situation since politics should not be treated solely as trivial entertainment but should have serious real-world consequences. Michael Grunwald at Time opines that now is the time to debate the potentially life-saving policies, instead of remaining silent on the issue. EJ Dionne, writing in the Washington Post, voices a similar sentiment, stating that mourning should be accompanied by anger. He advocates for banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, implementing background checks, and introducing other necessary reforms. Dionne warns that if Congress fails to act on these measures, it will be viewed as being bought and paid for by gun manufacturers. However, David Frum at CNN argues that President Obama might not be the ideal leader to spearhead this debate, as his involvement could polarize the issue further. Frum suggests that an external group, akin to Mothers Against Drunk Driving, would be more effective in leading the charge for change in a non-partisan manner. Contrarily, some individuals, such as John Fund at the National Review, claim that it is not the right time to act on gun control. Fund points out that the odds of being killed in a mass shooting are similar to those of being struck by lightning. He argues that gun control measures would be ineffectual and possibly counterproductive, as most shootings occur in \\"gun-free zones\\" like schools, which end up turning into \\"helpless-victim zones.\\" Nonetheless, the Newtown school shooting has sparked a renewed and fervent debate on the urgent need for effective gun control measures in the United States. The conversation is intensifying as impassioned opinions abound, with many calling for urgent reforms to protect innocent lives in the future."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A: Possible answers:  *nitrogen catabolism;  *conductive substitution reactions;  *nucleophobic reactions;  *nucleophilic substitution reactions; The answer is:","output":"nucleophilic substitution reactions. The reaction between alkyl halides and ammonia to form alkylamines is known as nucleophilic substitution reactions. Alkyl halides (R-X) are organic compounds containing a halogen atom (X) bonded to an sp3 hybridized carbon atom. Ammonia (NH3) is a nucleophile, a species capable of donating a non-bonding pair of electrons to an electrophile in a chemical reaction. In a nucleophilic substitution reaction, a nucleophile (ammonia in this case) reacts with an electrophile (the alkyl halide) and replaces the halogen atom in the organic compound. The overall reaction is characterized by the breaking of the carbon-halogen bond and the formation of a new carbon-nitrogen bond, resulting in the formation of an alkylamine. The general reaction can be represented as: R-X + NH3 → R-NH2 + HX where R represents an alkyl group, X is a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine), and HX is the hydrogen halide formed during the reaction. Nucleophilic substitution reactions can be categorized into two main types: SN1 and SN2 mechanisms. The choice of the mechanism depends on factors such as the structure of the alkyl halide, the nucleophilicity of the nucleophile, and the reaction conditions. SN1 mechanism (substitution nucleophilic unimolecular) involves a two-step process. First, the carbon-halogen bond breaks, resulting in the formation of a carbocation intermediate and a halide ion. Next, the nucleophilic ammonia molecule reacts with the carbocation, producing the alkylamine. This type of mechanism is favored for substrates that can form stable carbocations, such as tertiary alkyl halides. SN2 mechanism (substitution nucleophilic bimolecular) is a single concerted step where the nucleophile attacks the carbon atom while the carbon-halogen bond is being broken. This results in the direct formation of the alkylamine. The reaction proceeds through a transition state where both the nucleophile and the leaving group are partially attached to the carbon atom. SN2 mechanism is favored for primary alkyl halides and strong nucleophiles, such as ammonia. In summary, the formation of alkylamines from alkyl halides and ammonia occurs through nucleophilic substitution reactions, which can be SN1 or SN2 mechanisms depending on the structure of the alkyl halide and other reaction conditions. These reactions are essential in the synthesis of various amine-based functional groups and compounds, which have a wide range of applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials science."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Wind and water erode rocks - The wind and water pick up sediment that came off the rocks - Sediment is carried to an area by the wind, water, air, or ice - Sediment is deposited on the same spot many times - The sediment piles on top of other sediment for a long time - The sediment near the bottom is compressed by the weight of newer sediment - The sediment becomes sedimentary rock as it is pushed together by the heavy weight -   Question: suppose the wind is not blowing as much as it usually does so less sediment is being deposited happens, how will it affect LESS sedimentary rock forming.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: Less If the wind is not blowing as much as it usually does, it will result in less sediment being deposited. Wind is a crucial factor in the process of erosion and transportation of sediments. When there's a decrease in wind strength, its ability to erode rocks and carry sediment will decrease as well. Similarly, water currents play an important role in the transportation and deposition of sediment. If water currents are also weaker, the sediment transport rate will reduce, causing a decrease in sediment deposition. As sediment deposition is an essential step in the formation of sedimentary rocks, a reduction in deposited sediment will directly impact this process. The reduced amount of sediment will lead to thinner layers, resulting in less sedimentary rock formation over time.  When wind and water are not transporting and depositing sediment as effectively, it also affects the sediment's distribution pattern, potentially creating thinner and less extensive layers of sediment. This directly affects the formation of sedimentary rocks, as they are made up of layers of compacted sediment, meaning less pressure will be exerted on the lower layers, possibly leading to fewer or less compact sedimentary rocks being formed. In summary, if the wind is not blowing as much as it usually does and less sediment is being deposited, the formation of sedimentary rocks will be negatively affected, resulting in less sedimentary rock being produced."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Why do you work under the eye of your boss when you can work in front of the TV in your slippers?Armed with all the necessary things--telephone, computer, email and fax,many workers believe they can work as effectively as their colleagues in the office. Being able to work wherever you like:from a busy city to a village, and not having to stand the daily things, make working from home an attractive choice. If you wish,you can even work on a river boat. So what will become of the office tomorrow?It is possible that many could go into computer space creating a new wave of virtual  offices. To minimize office in innercity areas, companies will have a work force made up of a network of home workers linked by an advanced communication and information system. A central processing computer would be controlled by the manager who sends out work schedules and oversees  the activity of each employee. A video screen would be created,as the need for email or telephone becomes greater. Seeing the mood and expressions of work colleagues, managers would have the ability to view several employees at once on their screen. Employees would be encouraged to feed any information that may be useful to fellow workers into the computer to make the company work more effectively. As the company's lifeblood, the computer would contain a record of all conversations and communication for future reference and hold secret information such as accounts in password  protected areas.

The correct answer is to cleanse using the disinfecting towellette with downward strokes and open the sterile canister in which urine will be stored. This is because it explains the proper way to clean the area to prepare it for a sterile urine sample collection and mentions opening the sterile canister for storing the urine. The other options are wrong for the following reasons: -Gently clean the vania, the small part that connects the anus and. Gently separate the labia to expose the gland beneath. This option is incorrect because \\"vania\\" is not a correct anatomical term and the sentence seems incomplete. Also, it doesn't mention what to do after cleaning the area. -The region of the genital portion is located between the anus and the top part of the vagina.

Mr. Cruise seems such a wrong choice to play this jumbo vigilante that this is a good moment to contemplate the essential Reacher: not just what he looks like but also what he really is. Perhaps in sly response to a movie that will feature a lot of action, Mr. Child begins “A Wanted Man” by confining Reacher to very close quarters. The first 125 pages of this new novel are about a car trip. After waiting exactly 93 minutes on the eastbound ramp of a Nebraska highway, he successfully hitches a ride. The car contains two men and a woman, and Reacher knows nothing about them. Being Reacher, he will spend those first 125 pages observing every detail, watching every move, trying to deduce as much as he can. His enormous size counts for nothing during this part of the book. Nor does his appearance, although he has a busted nose and is said to resemble a very un-Cruise-like “gorilla with its face smashed in.” And he has no opportunities to resort to his tactic of choice, extreme violence. So he rides along an endless straight road through Iowa thinking about codes and signs and numbers and letters (“Reacher had no patience with people who claimed that y was a vowel”). He is a math guy at heart, and he isn’t likely to meet anyone equally wonky until this series takes him through Silicon Valley. On the road Reacher gradually figures out that the men, Alan King and Don McQueen, are kidnappers. Their hostage is Karen Delfuenso, a terrified waitress whose car they have hijacked. Reacher arranges to drive the car with Karen in the seat behind him so that they can make eye contact in the rearview mirror. Improbably Karen starts blinking and twisting her head to deliver some kind of secret message. Even more improbably, Reacher cracks her code almost immediately and finds out what she is trying to say. A third of the way into “A Wanted Man,” his only acts of violence have been hypothetical. “It was technically challenging to take out a guy in the front passenger seat while driving at 80 miles an hour,” he muses while at the wheel. Also, the 6-foot-5-inch Reacher has arms so long that he would need to keep his elbow bent: he wants to slug his passenger, not punch out the car’s side window. In any case, it’s time for Mr. Child to get him out of the car and unleash him on the book’s assorted evildoers. Outside the car, meanwhile, “A Wanted Man” has been developing one of the best female characters in the whole Reacher series: Julia Sorenson, an F.B.I. special agent from Omaha who is called in to investigate a potential interstate crime. Once Reacher is sprung from the car, he encounters Sorenson, who ought to be his natural adversary. But she, like all the women who interest Reacher, is as smart and methodical as he is, and he impresses her with his irrefutable, conveniently self-serving logic. He easily convinces her that whatever is unfolding, he and she should be on the same side. Reacher’s banter is usually more elegant than it is in “A Wanted Man.” He can do better than this, which he aims at a trucker who is bothering him: “Option 1, get back in your truck and get breakfast 50 miles down the road. Option 2, get in an ambulance and get breakfast through a plastic tube.” Still, the sang-froid of his delivery is what makes the big impression. And anyone worried about Reacher on screen can rest easy. Just remember how dauntingly Mr. Cruise can deliver that kind of dialogue, how greatly the character’s intelligence outshines his brawn, and how formidable Reacher would be even if he didn’t tower over everyone around him. Size doesn’t matter, as you will see in December. Since Mr. Child’s titles tend to be so generic (No. 18 will be “Never Go Back”), “A Wanted Man” is best thought of as the one with the car ride across the Midwest. But it eventually expands into something gigantic: a scheme involving an alphabet soup of federal agencies and the obligatory foreign terrorists operating on American soil. Quick action and solid detective work elevate the second part of this book until it segues into one of the best of the series’s climactic assaults: the expected, wildly over-the-top moment when Reacher must single-handedly penetrate some kind of huge, geometrically interesting, top-secret high-security fortress. This book’s version of that structure is described with clarity. And Reacher, who has been idly showing off his familiarity with Midwestern area codes, soil content and urban population counts, snaps into murderously good form. In this book he seems newly thoughtful about mortality, particularly his own. Reacher’s vigilante ethics, à la Dirty Harry’s, are likely to fuel much more controversy in a movie than they do on the page. But these smart, breathless books have no trouble justifying their hero’s acts of vengeance. And “A Wanted Man” is more ingenious than other Reacher books have been about the underground activities Reacher is thwarting. Mr. Child’s endings would be even better if his books’ worst bad guys, besides being swarthy and disposable foreigners, were given tough-guy talents of their own.

He played for three National Football League (NFL) teams: the St. Louis Rams, the New York Giants, and the Arizona Cardinals. He was originally signed by the Green Bay Packers as an undrafted free agent in 1994 after playing college football at Northern Iowa. Warner went on to be considered the best undrafted NFL player of all time, following a 12-year career regarded as one of the greatest stories in NFL history. Prior to the 1999 free-agency period, the Rams chose Warner to be one of the team's five unprotected players in the 1999 NFL Expansion Draft. Warner went unselected by the Cleveland Browns, who chose no Rams and whose only quarterback selection was Scott Milanovich.  The Rams let Bono leave in free agency and signed Trent Green to be the starter. Banks was traded to the Ravens, and Warner now found himself second on the depth chart. After Green tore his ACL in a preseason game, Rams coach Dick Vermeil named Warner as the Rams' starter. In an emotional press conference, Vermeil--who hadn't seen Warner work with the first-string offense--said, \\"We will rally around Kurt Warner, and we'll play good football.\\" With the support of running back Marshall Faulk and wide receivers Isaac Bruce, Torry Holt, Az-Zahir Hakim, and Ricky Proehl, Warner put together one of the top seasons by a quarterback in NFL history, throwing for 4,353 yards with 41 touchdown passes and a completion rate of 65.1%. The Rams' high-powered offense, run by offensive coordinator Mike Martz, was nicknamed \\"The Greatest Show on Turf\\" and registered the first in a string of three consecutive 500-point seasons, an NFL record.  Warner threw three touchdown passes in each of his first three NFL starts; he is the only NFL quarterback in history to accomplish that feat. Warner drew more attention in the Rams' fourth game of the season, a home game against the San Francisco 49ers (who had been NFC West division champions for 12 of the previous 13 seasons). The Rams had lost their last 17 meetings with the 49ers, but Warner proceeded to throw a touchdown pass on each of the Rams' first three possessions of the game, and four touchdowns in the first half alone, to propel the Rams to a 28-10 halftime lead on the way to a 42-20 victory. Warner finished the game with five touchdown passes, giving him 14 in four games and the Rams a 4-0 record. Warner's breakout season from a career in anonymity was so unexpected that Sports Illustrated featured him on their October 18 cover with the caption \\"Who Is This Guy?\\" He was named the 1999 NFL MVP at the season's end for leading the Rams to their first playoff berth since 1989 (when they were still in Los Angeles) and their first division title since 1985.  In the NFL playoffs, Warner ultimately led the Rams to a victory in Super Bowl XXXIV against the Tennessee Titans. In the game, he threw for two touchdowns and a then Super Bowl-record 414 passing yards, including a 73-yard touchdown to Isaac Bruce when the game was tied with just over two minutes to play, which proved to be the game-winning score. Warner also set a Super Bowl record by attempting 45 passes without a single interception. For his performance, Warner was awarded the Super Bowl MVP award.

How do I ask a Canadian university to waive my TOEFL scores? English is my first language and I've heard universities do that sometimes. If I want to apply to Top Universities in USA and I have a 3.98 GPA, GRE scores of  167Q and 160V, 4 AWA, and a TOEFL of 112, how good are my chances? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"In order to address your questions, let's break the response into two parts accordingly. 1. Asking a Canadian university to waive your TOEFL scores: It is not uncommon for universities to waive TOEFL requirements in certain situations. To request a waiver, you should follow these steps: a. Research Eligibility: Begin by checking the university's general policy regarding TOEFL waivers and find out if they have provisions for waiving the requirement based on certain conditions such as being a native English speaker or having completed previous education in English-medium institutions. b. Gather Supporting Evidence: Collect necessary documents to prove your proficiency in English. These may include certificates, transcripts, or letters from your previous educational institutions confirming that English was the medium of instruction. Additionally, you may include any awards or memberships that indicate your strong English communication skills. c. Write a Waiver Request Letter: Prepare a formal letter addressed to the admissions office or the specific department where you are applying. In the letter, clearly state your request for a TOEFL waiver and provide a rationale for the request. Be sure to include your contact information and application ID or student number (if available). Mention any relevant experience or qualifications that demonstrate your English language proficiency and attach the necessary supporting documents listed above. d. Submit the Request: Send your waiver request letter along with the supporting documents via email or as part of your online application (if the university allows it). Make sure to send your request well in advance of the application deadline, giving the university enough time to consider your request and provide a response.  e. Follow Up: If you haven't heard back from the university within a few weeks, it's a good idea to follow up with the admissions office or department to check the status of your waiver request. 2. Evaluating your chances of being accepted into top universities in the USA: Admission to top universities in the USA is competitive, and each institution has its own set of selection criteria. In general, your high GPA (3.98) and competitive GRE scores (167Q and 160V) are major strengths in your application. A TOEFL score of 112 is also considered quite strong in terms of English proficiency. However, top universities often look at a range of factors beyond just academic scores: a. Letters of Recommendation: Strong recommendations from faculty or other professionals who can vouch for your capabilities and potential are an essential part of the application. b. Personal Statement or Essays: Well-written and compelling personal statements or essays that reveal your goals, interests, motivation, and unique experiences contribute significantly to your chances of admission. c. Extracurricular Activities and Work Experience: Top universities appreciate students with diverse backgrounds and experiences, including involvement in clubs, organizations, internships, research projects, or other relevant work experience. d. Specific Departmental Requirements: Depending on your field of study, individual departments might have specific requirements that you need to fulfill, such as portfolios, interviews, or additional tests. Considering all these factors, it's impossible to predict the exact chances of being accepted into top universities. However, your academic credentials are strong, and focusing on other aspects of your application (such as letters of recommendation, personal statement, and extracurricular involvement) can increase your chances of securing admission to a top university. Regarding your final question, the two initial questions are related but not identical in meaning. The first question is about requesting a TOEFL waiver from a Canadian university, while the second question seeks an evaluation of your chances of being accepted into top universities in the USA based on your credentials. While both questions concern university admissions, they focus on different aspects and are not interchangeable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Identify the most salient words in this sentence: branch with old leaves in the winter and snow","output":"The most salient words in this sentence - \\"branch with old leaves in the winter and snow\\" - are: 1. Branch: This word is significant as it provides the primary subject of the sentence. A branch refers to a part of a tree that grows out from the trunk or other limbs and supports leaves, fruits, and other smaller branches. Without the context of the branch, the other aspects of the sentence would be challenging to make sense of. 2. Old leaves: This phrase is highly pertinent because it adds a unique aspect to the sentence. Old leaves suggest that the leaves have been present on the branch for an extended period and have not fallen. This is an unusual occurrence in winter, as many trees shed their leaves during the fall. 3. Winter: Winter serves as the setting for the sentence and is an important word for understanding context. As a season marked by cold weather, snow, and reduced daylight, winter underlines the rarity of finding a branch with old leaves still attached. This phenomenon is out of the ordinary because most deciduous trees are bare during the winter season. 4. Snow: Snow provides additional information about the surroundings and the natural elements present in the image the sentence conveys. Snow generally accompanies cold temperatures and winter weather, thereby reinforcing the unique spectacle of finding a branch with old leaves during this season. The presence of snow emphasizes the stark contrast between the winter setting and the old leaves on the branch."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: what is harrison's first name Context: Slack (2003) compares three groups that conducted biological research at Yale during overlapping periods between 1910 and 1970. Yale proved important as a site for this research. The leaders of these groups were Ross Granville Harrison, Grace E. Pickford, and G. Evelyn Hutchinson, and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists. All produced innovative research, including the opening of new subfields in embryology, endocrinology, and ecology, respectively, over a long period of time. Harrison's group is shown to have been a classic research school; Pickford's and Hutchinson's were not. Pickford's group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power. Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools.

Context: Francis I of France had continued his policy of seeking a middle course in the religious rift in France until an incident called the Affair of the Placards.  The Affair of the Placards began in 1534, and started with protesters putting up anti-Catholic posters. The posters were not Lutheran but were Zwinglian or \\"Sacramentarian\\" in the extreme nature of the anti-Catholic content—specifically, the absolute rejection of the Catholic doctrine of \\"Real Presence.\\"  Protestantism became identified as \\"a religion of rebels,\\" helping the Catholic Church to more easily define Protestantism as heresy. In the wake of the posters, the French monarchy took a harder stand against the protesters. Francis had been severely criticized for his initial tolerance towards Protestants, and now was encouraged to repress them.  At the same time, Francis was working on a policy of alliance with the Ottoman Empire.  The ambassadors in the 1534 Ottoman embassy to France accompanied Francis to Paris.  They attended the execution by burning at the stake of those caught for the Affair of the Placards, on 21 January 1535, in front of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris. John Calvin, a Frenchman, escaped from the persecution to Basle, Switzerland, where he published the Institutes of the Christian Religion in 1536. In the same year, he visited Geneva, but was forced out for trying to reform the church. When he returned by invitation in 1541, he wrote the Ecclesiastical ordinances, the constitution for a Genevan church, which was passed by the council of Geneva. Question: Which event happened first, the Affair of the Placards or the return to Geneva by John Calvin? Answer:","output":"The Affair of the Placards happened first. The event took place in 1534, when anti-Catholic protesters put up posters rejecting the Catholic doctrine of \\"Real Presence.\\" This led to a more stringent stance against the protesters by the French monarchy, including Francis I of France. On the other hand, John Calvin, who escaped the persecution, returned to Geneva in 1541 after being initially forced out.

Although I had to squint my eyes during some of the scary scenes, I loved it – in particular because I was fairly sure that Harrison Ford’s character was based on my dad. My father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, and I’d gone on several field trips with him to the Rocky Mountains, where he seemed to transform into a rock-hammer-wielding superhero. That illusion was shattered some years later when I figured out what he actually did: far from spending his time climbing dangerous cliffs and digging up dinosaurs, Jack Sepkoski spent most of his career in front of a computer, building what would become the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life. The analysis that he and his colleagues performed revealed new understandings of phenomena such as diversification and extinction, and changed the way that palaeontologists work. But he was about as different from Indiana Jones as you can get. The intertwining tales of my father and his discipline contain lessons for the current era of algorithmic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), and points to the value-laden way in which we “see” data. My dad was part of a group of innovators in palaeontology who identified as “palaeobiologists” – meaning that they approached their science not as a branch of geology, but rather as the study of the biology and evolution of past life. Since Charles Darwin’s time, palaeontology – especially the study of the marine invertebrates that make up most of the record – involved descriptive tasks such as classifying or correlating fossils with layers of the Earth (known as stratigraphy). Some invertebrate palaeontologists studied evolution, too, but often these studies were regarded by evolutionary biologists and geneticists as little more than “stamp collecting”. What does Harrison Ford do? - He is an actor. - He is an evolutionary biologist. - not enough information - He is a palaeontologist.

New York regained the lead in the third quarter with wide receiver/quarterback Brad Smith getting a 53-yard touchdown run, followed by quarterback Mark Sanchez completing a 13-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Santonio Holmes.  Cincinnati tried to rally in the fourth quarter with a 28-yard field goal from rookie kicker Aaron Pettrey, but the Jets came right back with Smith's 89-yard kickoff return for a touchdown, followed by defensive end Trevor Pryce sacking Palmer in the endzone for safety. With the loss, the Bengals fell to 2-9, and were officially eliminated from postseason contention with other results in Week 12. How many total yards were gained on special teams touchdowns?","output":"There were two special teams touchdowns in the game mentioned: 1. Brad Smith's 89-yard kickoff return for a touchdown. 2. Since it was not explicitly mentioned as a punt or kickoff return, we can consider Trevor Pryce's sack in the end zone for a safety as not relevant to the total yards gained on special teams touchdowns. So, the total yards gained on special teams touchdowns were 89 yards, from Brad Smith's kickoff return touchdown."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Presley was a central figure in the development of rockabilly, according to music historians. \\"Rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with Elvis Presley's first release, on the Sun label\\", writes Craig Morrison. Paul Friedlander describes the defining elements of rockabilly, which he similarly characterizes as \\"essentially ... an Elvis Presley construction\\": \\"the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [of] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [of] country\\". In \\"That's All Right\\", the Presley trio's first record, Scotty Moore's guitar solo, \\"a combination of Merle Travis–style country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie, and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, is a microcosm of this fusion.\\" While Katherine Charlton likewise calls Presley \\"rockabilly's originator\\", Carl Perkins has explicitly stated that \\"[Sam] Phillips, Elvis, and I didn't create rockabilly.\\" and, according to Michael Campbell, \\"Bill Haley recorded the first big rockabilly hit.\\" In Moore's view, too, \\"It had been there for quite a while, really.

We want to get the q term by itself on one side of the equation, so we will move the constant 1943 to the other side. -236*q + 1943 - 1943 = -181 - 1943 This simplifies to: -236*q = -2124 Step 2: Solve for q. Now, we have a simple equation with only one term containing q. To find the value of q, we can divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient in front of q, which is -236: (-236*q) / -236 = -2124 / -236 This simplifies to: q = 9 So, the value of q in the equation -236*q + 1943 = -181 is 9."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But it seems that besides wearing a mask, few of us know what has caused the smog and what to do to beat it. Chai Jing, a former news interviewer with CCTV, discussed the questions in her documentary Under the Dome. The 103-minute film was on websites on Feb 28. In the film, Chai visits polluted places and talks to officials and scientists. She thinks that burning too much coal and oil are the main causes of PM2.5 and smog. To solve the problem, Chai suggests that we should clean our coal and oil or replace them with cleaner energy such as natural gas. In her film, Chai also emphasized   that everyone can do something to help control smog too. For example, we can live a greener life by using more public transport. Or if we see things that could harm the environment, we can try to stop it. In the film, when she sees a restaurant cooking without any suitable filter facilities  , she calls the hotline 12369. The restaurant installed the filter a week later. Chen Jining, the new minister of environmental protection, praised Chai. \\"This film encourages ordinary people to take notice of the environment.

And the answer is...","output":"To solve this equation for z,  -4*z = -7466 + 7582 1. First, simplify the right hand side of the equation. -7466 + 7582 equals 116. So, your equation becomes:  -4*z = 116. 2. To solve for 'z', we can divide both sides of the equation by -4. So, -4*z / -4 = 116 / -4. 3. The resulting expression will be: z = -29. So, the solution to the problem -4*z = -7466 + 7582 for z is z = -29. This is the answer because it makes the original equation hold true.

Unjustly convicted of manslaughter in an arrested man's death, Steve is met by a friend from the force, Dan Bianco, and by wife Marcia, whom he shuns because she has been unfaithful to him. Steve goes to the San Francisco waterfront looking for a fisherman named Rogani who supposedly has proof that can clear his name. The docks are run by racketeer Victor Amato, who is forcing out dock leader Lou Flaschetti. A couple of thugs who work for the mobster, Lye and Hammy, come to confront Steve, warning him not to take this any further. Marcia tries to explain to Steve that she was lonely while he was in prison and cheated on him just once. He is reluctant to trust her. Rogani and Flaschetti, meantime, both end up dead. Steve manages to get valuable information from Amato's mild-mannered nephew, Mario, and when the henchman Hammy opens fire, Steve's cop friend Bianco kills him. Lye is told by Amato to murder Mario, even though the boy is the mob boss's blood relative. Lye reluctantly follows orders, but when he discovers Amato behind his back has made a pass at Kay Stanley, an actress Lye is in love with, then slapped her after being rejected, Lye is enraged. And so is Amato's long-suffering wife, Anna, who tells Steve where to find him. With the cops closing in and others after him, too, Amato has decided to leave the country. In a showdown, Amato gets the better of Lye, then attempts to flee on a speedboat. Steve swims to the boat and fights with Amato on board. The boat crashes into a lighthouse.

Through his distinct sound and inspiring lyrics, he's documented the joy and pain of his countrymen who fought for freedom under colonial rule and died for democracy after Zimbabwe's independence in 1980. \\"Where I come from you don't get to sing a song if you have nothing to say,\\" says the musician, who grew up in Highfield, a ghetto neighborhood in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare. \\"So every song has something to do with that man in the street, he must be able to use it in his life.\\" As a young boy, Mtukudzi joined choirs to improve his singing talent and taught himself how to play a three-string guitar.

More than just an entertainer, Mtukudzi is committed to addressing everyday social challenges, using his music as a vehicle to speak about the issues he's passionate about. In 2003 he founded an art center in Norton, near Harare, and last year he became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for eastern and southern Africa, focusing on youth development and HIV/AIDS. Mtukudzi, who lost his brother Robert and several band members to AIDS, recently took his campaign to eradicate the HIV/AIDS stigma to mothers in Tanzania. He is also outspoken against patriarchy and has criticized polygamy as a practice that increases the risk of spreading HIV.

A close friend of Miranda Kerr's has expressed happiness for the couple, stating, \\"Miranda may come across as an Earth Mother, but she loves the high life, and James can provide the sort of lifestyle and security very few could give her.\\" The friend went on to add, \\"I couldn't be happier for her—this year's been pretty difficult for Miranda. Her career seems to have hit a slump and she was totally devastated by the split.\\" Both Kerr and Packer are no strangers to being parents. Packer, 46, has three children with Baxter, including a daughter who recently turned one. Kerr, on the other hand, shares a young son named Flynn with her ex-husband, actor Orlando Bloom. As the romance flourishes between Miranda Kerr and James Packer, fans are hopeful that this new relationship will bring about posiitive outcomes for both parties after their recent difficult times."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Q:This article: Nigel Reuben Rook Williams (15 July 1944 – 21 April 1992) was an English conservator and expert on the restoration of ceramics and glass. From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \\"abiding passion of his life\\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation. The Ceramics & Glass group of the Institute of Conservation awards a biennial prize in his honour, recognising his significant contributions in the field of conservation. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was one of the first people to study conservation?, what is it ?

Frank McCarthy who produced the Academy Award winning biographical film Patton follows it up with a strong tribute to another of America's fighting generals, Douglas MacArthur. Gregory Peck gives a strong characterization of the man, his genius as well as his egotism. With MacArthur you never knew quite where one began and the other left off and too many times they blended. The whole story of Douglas MacArthur would be a six hour film or a TV mini-series. It would cover him from his days on frontier posts with his family to his time at West Point where he still has the highest scholastic average ever achieved by a cadet. It would talk about his service in the Phillipines as a young officer, his legend building bravery on the battlefields of World War I in France. It would also have to tell about him firing on the Bonus Marchers of World War I veterans in 1932, probably putting the final kabosh on any chances President Herbert Hoover had of getting re-elected. During MacArthur's last years he and Hoover had penthouse suites at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City. That must have been a subject they avoided. This film concentrates on the years 1941 to 1952 and it is told in flashback. The film opens with MacArthur addressing the student body in 1962. As he speaks the words of the famous Duty Honor Country speech, MacArthur's mind goes back to World War II and his desperate struggle against the advancing Japanese on the island of Corregidor and the fields of Bataan on Luzon. The film takes him through his struggle to win back the Phillipines, the occupation of Japan and the first 18 months culminating in his relief of command by President Truman. MacArthur as a film would not work at all if it wasn't for the portrayals of Dan O'Herlihy and Ed Flanders as Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman respectively. It's the part of the film I enjoyed the best, seeing MacArthur and his relations with both these men. FDR by O'Herlihy captures the aristocratic squire and exceptionally devious man that was our 32nd President. Roosevelt was a man who got his points across with unusual subtlety and cleverness. Sometimes he liked scheming a little too much for its own sake, but he was the master politician of the last century. Note how he deals with MacArthur both as a battlefield commander and potential rival at the same time. Truman by Flanders is as people remember him, a blunt spoken man of the people who disliked MacArthur's haughtiness from the gitgo. Of course it's in the history books how Truman relieved MacArthur in 1951 for insubordination. MacArthur was insubordinate, no doubt about it. Yet I could write a whole thesis on the Truman-MacArthur relations. Along the way it need not have ever come to a crisis. I've always felt that FDR would have dealt with the whole matter in a far better way had he still been president then. MacArthur was also grandly eloquent and Gregory Peck captures some of that eloquence in some of the orations that made him as much a legend as victories on the battlefield. Listen to Peck at the Japanese surrender, at MacArthur's farewell to the nation before the joint session of Congress, and of course his speech to the cadets in 1962. Watch the newsreels and see if you don't agree. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","output":"The sentiment of this review is mostly positive. The reviewer highlights the strong portrayals of key characters, particularly Gregory Peck as Douglas MacArthur, Dan O'Herlihy as Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Ed Flanders as Harry S. Truman. They also appreciate the film's focus on MacArthur's relationships with these two presidents. The reviewer further compliments the eloquence of the script and how Peck brings it to life through his performance. While the review could be interpreted as more of an analysis of the historical context and characters, the overall tone is positive as it praises various aspects of the film."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Stretching east-northeast from New York Harbor into the Atlantic Ocean, the island comprises four counties: Kings and Queens (which comprise the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, respectively) to the west; then Nassau and Suffolk to the east. However, many people in the New York metropolitan area (even those living in Brooklyn and Queens) colloquially use the term \\"Long Island\\" (or \\"The Island\\") exclusively to refer to the NassauSuffolk county area collectively, which is mainly suburban in character. More generally, \\"Long Island\\" may also refer collectively both to the main Island as well as its nearby, surrounding outer barrier islands. North of the island is the Long Island Sound, across from which lie the states of Connecticut and a small part of Rhode Island across the Block Island Sound. Across the Sound, to the northwest, lies Westchester County on mainland New York. To the west, Long Island is separated from the Bronx and the island of Manhattan by the East River.

We got bored, so, when Ben left the classroom for a bit and left his jacket behind, I don’t remember why, but, I put on his sweatshirt and traded it for mine.

I walked out of the office with the information, and turned around at the sound of my name. “Hey, Natalie!

In ‘Monty Python and the Holy Grail’, what was desired by the knights who say ‘Ni’?","output":"In the 1975 British comedy film \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\", The Knights Who Say \\"Ni\\" are a mysterious group of knights led by their leader, the head Knight, played by Michael Palin. The film is a parody of the King Arthur legend and features the British comedy group Monty Python, comprising of John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Graham Chapman. The particular scene with the Knights Who Say \\"Ni\\" occurs when King Arthur (Graham Chapman) and his faithful servant, Patsy (Terry Gilliam), encounter the strange knights in their quest to find the Holy Grail, a legendary artifact of Christian mythology. The Knights Who Say \\"Ni\\" are feared throughout the land due to the crippling effect that their uttering of the word \\"ni\\" has on people who hear it. When King Arthur and his entourage first encounter the Knights Who Say \\"Ni,\\" they are presented with a task: to bring them a shrubbery. The demand originates from the head Knight, who claims that the knights \\"have no shrubberies\\" and thus wish for one. In order to proceed with their quest, King Arthur and his followers must find and present the Knights with a suitable shrubbery, which they define as \\"one that looks nice\\" and \\"is not too expensive.\\" The shrubbery must also be compatible with their current horticultural layout. In the film, the Knights Who Say \\"Ni\\" utilize their demand for a shrubbery to demonstrate their power and control over those they encounter. The demand is arbitrary and whimsical, symbolizing the absurd lengths to which people may have to go to please those in authority and fulfill quests. Ultimately, King Arthur and his companions succeed in procuring a shrubbery from an old woman named Roger the Shrubber (Eric Idle), who possesses some expertise in shrubberies. They bring it back to the Knights Who Say \\"Ni\\" but are then given another task. The second task is to find another shrubbery and place it next to the first one, but slightly higher \\"so you get a two-level effect with a little path running down the middle.\\" Additionally, they must also cut down the mightiest tree in the forest with... a herring, an impossible and nonsensical task, making it clear that the Knights Who Say \\"Ni\\" are not to be reasoned with. The scene ends with King Arthur successfully defeating the Knights Who Say \\"Ni\\" by using their \\"sacred words\\" against them. The scene involving the Knights Who Say \\"Ni\\" is a classic example of Monty Python's unique comedic style, one that embraces absurdity, wordplay, and surrealism to form a memorable and entertaining satire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, who could not work on Oliphant's radar project because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. Francis Perrin had calculated the critical mass of uranium to be about 40 tonnes (39 long tons; 44 short tons). He reckoned that if a neutron reflector were placed around it, this might be reduced to 12 tonnes (12 long tons; 13 short tons). Peierls attempted to simplify the problem by using the fast neutrons produced by fission, thus omitting consideration of moderator. He too calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper written in 1939 to be \\"of the order of tons\\".Peierls knew the importance of the size of the critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.Niels Bohr had theorised that the rare uranium-235 isotope, which makes up only about 0.7% of natural uranium, was primarily responsible for fission with fast neutrons, although this was not yet universally accepted. Frisch and Peierls were thus able to revise their initial estimate of critical mass needed for nuclear fission in uranium to be substantially less than previously assumed. They estimated a metallic sphere of uranium-235 with a radius of 2.1 centimetres (0.83 in) could suffice. This amount represented approximately 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235. These results led to the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the initial step in the development of the nuclear arms programme in Britain.

After Baker contacts his commander, Gen. Slater (Richard Widmark), they begin to investigate who drove a civilian van into the base. It is revealed to be owned by a scientist named Dr. Bradford Crane (Michael Caine), the only survivor of the attack. Slater orders two helicopters to check for a black mass (revealed to be bees), but the two helicopters are swarmed by the bees and explode, killing the pilots inside.

Helena Anderson (Katharine Ross), one of the base's doctors, supports Crane's story.Meanwhile, in the countryside, a family is attacked by a swarm of the bees. The teenaged son manages to escape in a Mustang, although he is also stung, and crashes into the Maryville town square, where the citizens are preparing for the annual flower festival. The boy is brought into the hands of military personnel, where he hallucinates a vision of giant bees attacking him, due to the aftereffects of the bee sting.

In this case, it is \\"-i\\" for the brother (kardeş) which makes it \\"kardeşi\\" (his/her brother). 2. \\"19-year-old\\": Turkish uses the word 'yaşında' to express someone's age. Therefore, this expression becomes \\"19 yaşında.\\" 3. \\"Brother\\": The word for brother in Turkish is \\"kardeş.\\" As explained earlier, we use the possessive form \\"kardeşi\\" after combining it with the age expression, making it \\"19 yaşındaki kardeşi.\\" 4. \\"Muhamed\\": The name remains the same in Turkish but may sometimes be spelled as \\"Muhammed\\" with a double \\"m\\". In this translation, we use the original spelling Muhamed. 5. \\"Screamed back\\": The verb screamed can be translated to \\"bağırmak\\" in Turkish. Here, \\"back\\" implies that Muhamed responded to someone's shout. To express this, we add the adverb \\"geri\\" (back) to the verb. In Turkish, verbs are transformed to match the subject. For the third person singular past tense of \\"bağırmak,\\" it becomes \\"bağırdı.\\" Thus, \\"screamed back\\" translates to \\"geri bağırdı.\\" So, \\"His 19-year-old brother, Muhamed, screamed back.\\" in Turkish can be translated as \\"19 yaşındaki kardeşi Muhamed, geri bağırdı.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who colloquial and ambiguous lyrics explored themes of urban youth, teen alienation, adolescent romance and authenticity?  New York Dolls is the debut album by the American hard rock band New York Dolls. It was released on July 27, 1973, by Mercury Records. In the years leading up to the album, the New York Dolls had developed a local fanbase by playing regularly in lower Manhattan after forming in 1971. However, most music producers and record companies were reluctant to work with them because of their vulgarity and onstage fashion; the group later appeared in exaggerated drag on the album cover for shock value. After signing a contract with Mercury, the New York Dolls recorded their first album at The Record Plant in New York City with producer Todd Rundgren, who was known for his sophisticated pop tastes and held a lukewarm opinion of the band. Despite stories of conflicts during the recording sessions, lead singer David Johansen and guitarist Sylvain Sylvain later said Rundgren successfully captured how the band sounded live. Their music on the album incorporated carefree rock and roll, Brill Building pop influences, and campy sensibilities, while Johansen's colloquial and ambiguous lyrics explored themes of urban youth, teen alienation, adolescent romance, and authenticity. New York Dolls was met with widespread critical acclaim but sold poorly and polarized listeners. The band proved difficult to market outside their native New York and developed a reputation for rock-star excesses while touring the United States in support of the album. Despite its commercial failure, New York Dolls was an influential precursor to the 1970s punk rock movement and has since been named in various publications as one of the best debut records in rock music and one of the greatest albums of all time.

Of these, 68 wins and 8 titles came in the 500cc class, the rest in the 350cc class.  - The 24 Hours of Daytona, currently known as the Rolex 24 At Daytona for sponsorship reasons, is a 24-hour sports car endurance race held annually at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. It is run on a combined road course, utilizing portions of the NASCAR tri-oval and an infield road course. Since its inception, it has been held the last weekend of January or first weekend of February, part of Speedweeks, and it is the first major automobile race of the year in the United States. It is also the first race of the season for the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship.  - A motorcycle (also called a motorbike, bike, or cycle) is a two- or three-wheeled motor vehicle. Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport including racing, and off-road riding. Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and related social activity such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies.  - In North America, road racing is motor racing held on a paved closed circuit with both left and right turns. Road racing is therefore distinct from both off-road racing and oval track racing; the latter is common in North America and involves turning in only one direction (usually left, counter-clockwise).

Add Interest      Timberlake, who was in the Houston area as a part of his Man of the Woods world tour, surprised Sarah Salazar in her hospital room in eastern Texas, her mother wrote in a Facebook post Friday, just one week after Sarah was wounded in a mass shooting.      Sarah was among those injured at Santa Fe High School when a former student opened fire on two art classrooms, killing 10 and wounding 13, police said.      Karwai Tang/WireImage/Getty Images      Sarah's mother, Sonia Lopez-Puentes, shared an image of her daughter with the pop star in her hospital room on Friday, showing Timberlake smiling and crouching at her bedside.      Lopez-Puentes thanked him and other special visitors, including Houston Texans defensive end J.J. Watt, in a separate post on Saturday.      \\"JJ Watt, Justin Timberlake ... school officials, board members, teachers, fellow classmates, friends and family have taken time to visit Sarah this week showing their love and support bringing smiles to her beautiful face,\\" she wrote, adding that her daughter appeared to be \\"making progress.\\"      Scott Olson/Getty Images      Brett Coomer/Houston Chronicle via AP      \\"Sarah is sad for the loss of her classmates and would love to see other survivors ...

The alleged gunman, 17-year-old Dimitrios Pagourtzis, was charged with capital murder in the wake of the shooting. Police said he was armed with a shotgun and a .38-caliber revolver, both of which were legally owned by his father.      Police have yet to declare a motive. Pagourtzis is currently being held at the Galveston County Jail, where he's under suicide watch. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Pop star Justin Timberlake paid a surprise visit to Sarah Salazar, a victim of the recent Santa Fe High School shooting in Texas, bringing a smile to her face as she recovers in the hospital.

However, the review does not provide much context or additional details about the overall experience, making it difficult to accurately determine an exact star rating. Nevertheless, considering that the reviewer expressed dissatisfaction with a specific feature, we can deduce that the rating would likely be on the lower end of the ★-rating scale. As the review solely mentions the issue with the notifications and nothing else, we could infer that the reviewer might give it a ★★ or ★★★ rating.  In general, a ★ rating typically represents a completely disappointing and unsatisfactory experience, while a ★★★★★ rating signifies an outstanding and flawless one. Here, the reviewer clearly did not have a perfect experience due to the problem with the notifications, but they also did not mention any other severe or disastrous experiences that would warrant a ★ rating. To accurately determine the ★-rating based on this review, we would need more information about the reviewer's overall experience.

A:","output":"Excretion is indeed a vital process that helps maintain the body's internal balance and prevents the buildup of harmful substances within the system. This process primarily involves the removal of metabolic waste products, excess water, salts, and other substances that the body no longer needs. The main organs responsible for excretion in the human body are the kidneys, lungs, skin, and the liver.  1. Kidneys: The kidneys are considered the primary excretory organs. They are a pair of bean-shaped organs located towards the lower back, on either side of the spine. They play a significant role in filtering and cleaning the blood. As blood flows through the kidneys, they remove wastes and excess substances such as water, salts, and urea. These waste materials form a liquid called urine, which is transported from the kidneys to the bladder through narrow tubes called ureters. The bladder stores the urine temporarily until it is eliminated from the body through the urethra. The kidneys also help regulate the body's fluid balance and blood pressure by excreting or retaining water as needed. 2. Lungs: The lungs are responsible for the excretion of gaseous wastes, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), which is a byproduct of cellular respiration. When cells produce energy from the nutrients we consume, they generate CO2 as a waste product. This CO2 gets dissolved in the blood and gets transported to the lungs. During the process of respiration, we inhale oxygen (O2) and exhale carbon dioxide. The lungs help expel CO2 from the body, ensuring that it doesn't accumulate to toxic levels. 3. Skin: The skin, in addition to serving as a protective barrier, also plays a role in excretion through the process of perspiration (sweating). Sweat glands, which are found all over the skin, secrete sweat, a fluid that consists of water, dissolved salts, and organic compounds such as urea and lactic acid. Sweating not only helps to regulate body temperature but also aids in removing small amounts of waste products. Moreover, the skin sheds dead cells, which contain waste materials accumulated during cellular processes, and eliminating them from the body. 4. Liver: The liver is a large, vital organ responsible for various metabolic processes, including detoxification and excretion. It filters the blood, removing harmful substances like alcohol, drugs, and toxins absorbed from the digestive tract. One of its primary functions is the production and secretion of bile, a digestive fluid that helps break down fats and carries waste products, cholesterol, and bilirubin (a byproduct of red blood cell degradation) to the small intestine. These waste materials are then mixed with undigested food and form feces, which is eventually eliminated from the body through the rectum during defecation. In summary, the main organs of excretion – kidneys, lungs, skin, and liver – work together to ensure that the body efficiently removes excess water, waste products, and toxic substances. By doing so, these organs contribute to overall health and maintain the body's delicate internal balance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 2: Clarify the premise and hypothesis Now that I understand the meaning of \\"specious,\\" I will attempt to clarify the premise and hypothesis: Premise: \\"The Origin of Specious\\" - This may refer to the beginning or emergence of things that are superficially plausible but actually wrong, misleadingly attractive, or deceptive. Hypothesis: \\"The Termination of Specious\\" - This may refer to the end or dissolution of things that are superficially plausible but actually wrong, misleadingly attractive, or deceptive. Step 3: Consider the relationship between the premise and hypothesis The premise indicates a point of origin or emergence for specious things while the hypothesis suggests an ending or termination. It appears that the hypothesis could be true if there is indeed an ending or termination point for specious things. Step 4: Evaluate factors that could lead to the termination of specious things To determine if the hypothesis is true, I will assess various factors that could result in the termination of specious things: 1. Cultural evolution: Society might develop norms and values rejecting superficially plausible but actually wrong or misleading concepts over time. 2. Education: With awareness and understanding, people could become more capable of identifying and challenging specious ideas. 3. Advances in technology and communication: These could expose deceptive information and facilitate the spread of accurate and reliable data, ultimately leading to the decline of specious things. Step 5: Conclusion Based on my analysis, the hypothesis \\"The Termination of Specious\\" could be true if factors such as cultural evolution, education, and advances in technology result in the decline of specious things.

The incident has resulted in a storm of controversy and a wave of legal implications. The accusations, as they stand, have Lohan 'pulling the strings' behind the scenes while LeMoine executed the alleged assault. It's important to remember that these are accusations and proof is yet to be presented to support such claims. Not only is LeMoine on the hot seat of the law, but Barron is said to be planning a legal course of action against both Lohan and LeMoine in light of the alleged attack. If the lawsuit is filed, it would mean that LeMoine and Lohan will be facing serious charges and potential penalties, if proven guilty.  On LeMoine's end, his reaction to these developments seems to indicate guilt. LeMoine is reported to be evading authorities and is purportedly seeking refuge in Cuba. This information came to light after credible sources spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the investigation. It should further be noted that fleeing the country amidst ongoing investigations does not equate to admittance of guilt. It goes without saying that these accusations carry significant weight and consequences. While the legal proceedings will seek to unravel the truth behind these allegations, the court of public opinion is already abuzz with speculation and assumptions.  However, it is essential that the legal process unfolds unimpeded, so that justice can be served and the truth comes to light. Until the legal authorities have completed their examination of the case, any judgement upon either party should be handled with caution, ensuring the preservation of their right to a fair trial.  This ongoing case serves as a stark reminder that no one is above the law, not even the celebrity elite. The apparent evasion and impending arrest of Raymond LeMoine emphasise the consequences that follow such serious allegations. While we wait for more concrete developments, the world continues to closely watch the events unfold in this high-profile case. The article was written based on the points given and could include potentially sensitive information, speculation or assumptions, as no substantial evidence has been presented officially to the public. Therefore, the situation is still evolving, and we will provide updates as more information becomes available."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"As a new resident of Detroit, Blacks had difficulties getting things such as mortgages because of what?\\"  Context: \\"Detroit remains one of the most racially segregated cities in the United States. From the 1940s to the 1970s a second wave of Blacks moved to Detroit to escape Jim Crow laws in the south and find jobs. However, they soon found themselves excluded from white areas of the city—through violence, laws, and economic discrimination (e.g., redlining). White residents attacked black homes: breaking windows, starting fires, and exploding bombs. The pattern of segregation was later magnified by white migration to the suburbs. One of the implications of racial segregation, which correlates with class segregation, may be overall worse health for some populations.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The difficulties experienced by Black residents in acquiring mortgages and other essential amenities in Detroit from the 1940s to the 1970s are mainly rooted in systemic and institutional racism that influenced both the social, economic, and legal aspects of their lives. Amid the context of Detroit being one of the most racially segregated cities in the United States, the intersection of racial and economic segregation resulted in a range of discriminatory practices profoundly impacting Black communities. One primary practice that disadvantaged Black people was redlining. Redlining is a discriminatory housing policy first introduced by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) in the 1930s. In this practice, neighborhoods were mapped and color-coded based on racial composition and perceived financial risk. Areas with a high percentage of Black or minority residents were typically marked in red to indicate a high risk, which strongly discouraged lenders from approving loans or mortgages for properties in these areas. This federal policy perpetuated the wealth gap, creating an obstinate cycle of poverty and hindered social mobility among Black residents. Economic discrimination also played a significant role. It wasn't just confined to housing policies but was pervasive in employment as well. Despite moving to Detroit in search of better job opportunities to escape the prevailing Jim Crow laws of the South, Black residents often found themselves confined to low paying jobs, leading to economic instability. This economic instability further contributed to their perceived \\"risk\\" for lenders, making it harder for them to secure loans or mortgages.  Moreover, institutional racism was deeply entrenched into law, policing, and everyday societal norms. Black families were literally and violently kept out of white neighborhoods through the threat or use of force, thereby limiting their housing choices and perpetuating residential segregation. Furthermore, even when Black residents could potentially afford properties in \\"white areas,\\" they were often met by violence—such as property attacks involving broken windows, fire outbreaks, and even bombings. Lastly, the ongoing large-scale migration of white residents to the suburbs, otherwise known as \\"white flight,\\" further deepened the racial demarcation. It led to disproportionate investment in the infrastructure, resources, and services available in those regions, leaving Black neighborhoods further underserved and under-resourced. To sum up, systemic racism, economic discrimination, violent enforcement of segregation, and the redlining practice—pervasive during the period—made it exceptionally hard for Black newcomers in Detroit to access mortgages and secure decent housing. These factors are reflective of the larger patterns of racial and economic inequality in the United States during that time."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Casey Beldon has nightmarish hallucinations of strange-looking dogs in the neighbourhood and an evil child with bright blue eyes following her around. While babysitting Matty, her neighbor's son, she finds him showing his infant sibling its reflection in a mirror. Matty attacks Casey, smashing the mirror on her head, and tells her: \\"Jumby wants to be born now\\". She puts him to bed and leaves in shock. Casey's friend Romy tells her of a superstition that newborns should not see their reflections in the mirror for at least a year because otherwise they will die soon. Casey's eyes begin to change color; a doctor asks if she is a twin, and explains the change as tetragametic chimerism and heterochromia, and that is completely normal. Her neighbor's infant dies, supporting the superstition. Casey's father admits that she had a twin brother years ago who died while he was in the womb when her umbilical cord strangled him, and whom he and Casey's mother had nicknamed \\"Jumby\\". She begins to suspect that the spirit is haunting her and that is the soul of her dead twin wanting to be born so it can enter the world of the living as evil. Casey meets Sofi Kozmaâwhom she later learns is her grandmotherâwho explains that as a child she had a twin brother who died during Nazi experiments in Auschwitz during World War II. A dybbuk brought the brother back to life to use as a portal into the world of the living. Kozma killed her twin to stop the spirit, and now it haunts her family for revenge, which is why Casey's mother became insane and committed suicide. Kozma gives Casey a hamsa amulet for protection; instructs her to destroy all mirrors and burn the shards; and refers her to Rabbi Joseph Sendak, who can perform a Jewish exorcism to remove the dybbuk out of her soul. Sendak does not believe Casey's story until he sees a dog with its head twisted upside down in his synagogue. The dybbuk kills Kozma and, soon after, Romy. Casey and her boyfriend Markâwho both see the spirit after it kills Romyârealize that it is... Answer:","output":"\\"Shadowed Mirrors: The Unborn Revenant\\"  This title captures the movie's main themes of haunting reflections, spirits seeking birth or rebirth, the idea of an 'unborn' entity, and the concept of a 'revenant' or vengeful spirit. 'Shadowed Mirrors' underlines the use of mirrors as objects that play a sinister and significant role in the story. The mirrors act as pathways for the restless spirit of Jumby, Casey's dead twin. As such, the mirror carries a potent imagery of shadowy, frightening reflection, infested by spirits, hence 'Shadowed Mirrors'. 'The Unborn Revenant' adds a dark and eerie character to the title, highlighting the plotline of Casey's haunting by her unborn twin. The term 'unborn' directly resonates with Jumby, the unborn twin, and 'revenant' signifies a spirit that returns from the dead, further emphasizing the seeking of revenge or causing terror. This title generically indicates a suspenseful, chilling horror narrative revolving around revenge and haunting, positioning it well within its genre, giving a clear headsup to its potential viewers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The American Academy of Micropigmentation and the Society of Permanent Cosmetic Professionals provide microblading certification to much of the English-speaking world. As such, look for training classes approved by at least one of the two boards, meaning they follow the organization’s official regulations and are run by a society-certified instructor. The SPCP and AAM maintain lists of certified trainers on their official websites. Due to microblading’s boom in popularity, lots of for-profit training classes have popped up around the world. Avoid classes that are under 100 hours long or make no mention of the AAM or SPCP. Though some of these classes provide accurate training, many are scams and few will get you closer to official certification. Scam courses are often less than 6 days long, extremely cheap, or advertise the inclusion of a free microblading kit. After finding a good class, enroll with the instructor, pay any required fees, and attend. Expect to work for at least 100 hours with the time divided into class study, homework, live practice, and teacher demonstrations. If AAM and SPCP trainers do not live in your area, travel will most likely be required. Most full courses cost between 4000 and 5000. Expect to take off work for about 1 week in order to attend.

These could play for more than three and four minutes respectively, while contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes. In an attempt to head off the disc advantage, Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder in 1909, with a maximum playing time of 4½ minutes (at 160 rpm), which in turn were superseded by Blue Amberol Records, which had a playing surface made of celluloid, a plastic, which was far less fragile. Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929. By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them.

Determine the sentiment: If you are looking for a film the portrays the pointless and boring existence of middle class lives caught in a web of non-communication and false ideals, then this is the film for you. If you also what the film to be engaging and keep your interest, then you should probably look elsewhere. There are many films that do this far better. For example, try some of the darker films by Bergman. The Filmmaker felt that in order to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class he should subject the viewer to one agonizingly dull and vacuous incident after another until the film finally comes to its tortuous and pathetic end. If you value your time there are far better ways to spend two hours, like cleaning your house, for example.","output":"The sentiment expressed in this review is decidedly negative. This evaluation encompasses several dimensions: 1. Criticism on Storyline and Theme Representation: The reviewer indicates that the film aims to reflect the \\"pointless and boring existence of middle class lives caught in a web of non-communication and false ideals.\\" However, the phrasing suggests that the reviewer not only believes the film successfully demonstrates this point, but also that they found the exploration of this theme to be tedious and unimpressive. The use of negative descriptors such as \\"pointless\\" and \\"boring\\" imply dissatisfaction. 2. Lack of Engagement: The reviewer asserts that if the potential viewer wants to find the movie engaging and interesting, they should probably look elsewhere. This statement clearly shows that the reviewer did not find the movie captivating or absorbing, reinforcing the negative sentiment. 3. Comparison and Reference to Better Options: The reviewer suggests that there are many other films that better portray the theme explored in this movie. They even recommend checking out some of the darker films by Bergman. This comparison negatively reflects on the film being reviewed and implies it's not worth the viewer's time. 4. Criticism on Pacing and Content: The reviewer states that the filmmaker subjects the viewer to a series of events described as \\"agonizingly dull\\" and \\"vacuous\\" leading to a \\"tortuous and pathetic end.\\" This stark criticism presents the film as painfully slow-moving, indicating a lack of action, intrigue, or meaningful incidents that could maintain viewer interest. 5. Suggestion of Better Use of Time: In the conclusion, the reviewer advises that one's time would be better spent doing a mundane task, specifically cleaning the house, rather than watching this film. This suggests a deep dissatisfaction with the film and underscores the overall negative sentiment. In summary, the reviewer finds the film overall disappointing and frustrating to watch due to its perceived monotony, tediousness, and its inability to engage and maintain the viewer’s interest effectively. They believe there are other movies and even daily chores that offer a more rewarding use of viewers' time."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I’ve learnt a great amount throughout this studio, first and foremost I was taught: how the art world functions, how specific galleries such as Gertrude St Contemporary run and how artists earn a living. The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval. It forced me to develop my aesthetic as a filmmaker and to own the work that I ended up producing, so ultimately I was really glad with how everything panned out.

Premise: they have really got it better than we do in a lot of ways you know Hypothesis: We are better off than they are. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Step 1: Analyze the premise and hypothesis. The premise states that \\"they have really got it better than we do in a lot of ways you know.\\" Here, \\"they\\" refers to some other group of people, and \\"we\\" refers to us. It acknowledges that the other group has advantages over us in many aspects. The hypothesis posits that \\"We are better off than they are.\\" This statement suggests that our situation is preferable to that of the other group. Step 2: Compare the premise and hypothesis. The premise acknowledges the advantages they have over us, while the hypothesis claims that we are better off compared to them. Step 3: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis. To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to analyze if the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. If the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true for the premise to entail the hypothesis. In this case, the premise states that they have advantages over us in many aspects. This statement does not guarantee that our condition is better than theirs (hypothesis). It only specifies that they are better in some ways, while the hypothesis claims that our overall situation is better. Conclusion: The premise does not entail the hypothesis. The truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, and they express contrasting views on the comparison between our situation and that of the other group."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

During a ball in Moscow, she encounters the handsome Count Alexei Vronsky. Vronsky is instantly smitten and follows her to St. Petersburg, pursuing her shamelessly. Eventually, Anna surrenders to her feelings for him and becomes his mistress. Though they are happy together, their relationship soon crumbles after she miscarries his child. Karenin is deeply touched by her pain and agrees to forgive her. However, Anna remains unhappy and, to the scandal of respectable society, she openly leaves her husband for Vronsky. Using her brother as an intermediary, Anna hopelessly begs her husband for a divorce. Karenin, under the poisonous influence of her friend the Countess Lydia Ivanovna, indignantly refuses to divorce and denies Anna any access to Seriozha. Distraught by the loss of her son, Anna grows severely depressed and self-medicates with laudanum. Before long, she is hopelessly addicted. With Vronsky she has another child, but he is also torn between his love to Anna and the temptation of a respectable marriage in the eyes of society. Anna becomes certain that Vronsky is about to leave her and marry a younger woman. She travels to the railway station and commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Vronsky is emotionally devastated by her death and volunteers for a 'suicide mission' in the Balkan war. While travelling to join his regiment, he encounters Konstantin Levin at the train station. Levin has married Vronsky's former (and unrequited) sweetheart, Princess \\"Kitty\\" Shcherbatsky. Levin attempts to persuade Vronsky of the value of life.

While there she meets Cort, a former Herod henchman turned preacher whom Herod has captured and forced to enter the contest. During her first night in town, The Lady saves Cort's life by shooting the rope Herod's men had hanged Cort from. She also meets \\"The Kid\\", a brash young man who runs the general store and who hopes to impress Herod. The Kid believes Herod is his father and that he can earn his father's respect by entering and winning the contest. In the first round of duels The Kid defeats a Swedish quick-draw champion while Herod kills a braggart named Ace Hanlon, who had taken credit for some of Herod's own accomplishments. The Lady defeats an enemy she had previously left shackled to a wagon. Cort, who has renounced violence and doesn't have a weapon, is taken to the general store. Herod buys Cort a gun and decrees that Cort (an exceptionally skilled gunfighter) can only have one bullet at a time so that he doesn't shoot his way out of town. Despite telling everyone he wouldn't fight, Cort winds up drawing his gun and winning his first round fight. During a rainstorm Herod meets with Clay Cantrell, a professional gunfighter hired by the townspeople to kill Herod. Before they duel, Herod changes the rules and proclaims that all contests are now to the death. After killing Cantrell, Herod angrily addresses the townspeople and informs them that he will continue to raise his taxes on them until they understand that he is in charge of everything.

The council's chairman recently dismissed the rebels' executive board. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: **Libya's New Government and the Importance of Peace** Hello, little friends! Today, we are going to talk about a country called Libya. A long time ago, there was a man named Gadhafi who was the leader of Libya, but people didn't like him very much because he didn't take good care of them. So, some people called \\"rebels\\" decided to try and make their country a better place by creating a new government. Now, creating a new government is not easy, and it takes some time. The rebels have a special group called the NTC (which stands for National Transitional Council) to help them build a better government for the people of Libya. They are saying that it might take 18 to 20 months to make everything work well. One of the most important things the NTC wants to do is to make sure people are not fighting each other and that everyone can live in peace. Sometimes, when there is a big change in a country, people can get very angry and try to hurt others. This is called \\"revenge killing,\\" and it's not a good thing. The NTC wants to make sure this doesn't happen in Libya. There will be many different groups and people who will have a say in how the new Libya should be run. We call them \\"entities,\\" and they will all have an important job in helping to create the new government. They will work together so that everyone feels happy and safe in their country. Not long ago, the person who was in charge of the rebel's special group called the \\"executive board\\" was told that he didn't need to do that job anymore. The leader of the NTC, who has a very big role in making decisions, said that it was time for someone else to do the job. This is because they want to make sure that the new government is the best it can be for the people of Libya. So, my dear little friends, that's the story of what's happening in Libya right now. The people there are trying to make their country a better place by building a new government and making sure everyone is safe and happy. It's a big job, and it will take some time, but hopefully, everything will work out well for them in the end."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer:","output":"Hermann Oppenheim (1 January 1858 – 5 May 1919) was a prominent German neurologist. He studied medicine at the Universities of Berlin, Göttingen, and Bonn and began his career at the Charité-Hospital in Berlin as an assistant to Karl Westphal (1833-1890). In 1891, Oppenheim opened a successful private hospital in Berlin. Oppenheim authored a seminal textbook on nervous diseases in 1894, titled \\"Lehrbuch der Nervenkrankheiten für Ärzte und Studierende,\\" which became a standard in the field of neurology. The book was published in multiple editions and languages and is considered one of the best neurology textbooks ever written. He contributed significantly to the understanding of various neurological disorders such as tabes dorsalis, alcoholism, anterior poliomyelitis, syphilis, multiple sclerosis, and traumatic neurosis. In the field of physiology, Oppenheim published articles on urea metabolism in collaboration with Nathan Zuntz (1847-1920). His 1889 treatise on traumatic neuroses was met with criticism from renowned physicians Jean-Martin Charcot (1825-1893) and Max Nonne (1861-1959), as he asserted that psychological trauma caused organic changes leading to psychic neuroses. Oppenheim's expertise in brain diseases contributed to the first successful removal of a brain tumor, an operation performed by a physician named R. Köhler. Along with surgeon Fedor Krause (1857-1937), he reported the first successful removal of a pineal tumor. He also coined the term \\"dystonia musculorum deformans\\" for a childhood torsion disease he described, which later became known as \\"Ziehen-Oppenheim syndrome\\" (named in conjunction with German psychiatrist Theodor Ziehen, 1862-1950). Additionally, amyotonia congenita is also known as \\"Oppenheim's disease\\" in his honor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I can use this background: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.  Now, I have a new situation: David was visiting the natural history museum. He noticed two charts that showed the climatic conditions of the earth in two time periods, time A and time B. Time A showed earth's overall climate in the sixteenth century when there were less greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And time B showed earth's overall climate in the present century with more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. David found some interesting differences between these two charts.  Answer this question please: Which period would see more trapped terrestrial radiation, time A or time B? Answer:","output":"Time B would see more trapped terrestrial radiation. Step 1: Understand the given background on the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect explains how solar energy easily penetrates greenhouse gases in short wavelengths, while Earth, being cooler, radiates heat in far infrared range (longer wavelengths). Greenhouse gases partially absorb the longer wavelengths, trapping some solar heat and returning it to Earth, which impacts global temperature. Step 2: Analyze the provided information about the two time periods. Time A reflects the sixteenth century with less greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Time B reflects the present century with more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Step 3: Apply the greenhouse effect concept to the two time periods. In Time A, fewer greenhouse gases were present in the atmosphere, which means less heat would be trapped in the form of terrestrial radiation. In Time B, the higher concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would lead to more terrestrial radiation being trapped and absorbed. Step 4: Conclude which period sees more trapped terrestrial radiation. Since Time B has more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, it would see more trapped terrestrial radiation as compared to Time A."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The Perijá tapaculo is a small bird, 10 to 12 cm (3.9 to 4.7 in) in length with an average mass of 17 to 18 grams (around 0.6 oz). The bill averages 6.8 millimetres (0.27 inches) long, 2.9 mm (0.11 in) wide, and 3.5 mm (0.14 in) high. The legs are about 21 mm (0.83 in) long. The Perijá tapaculo's tarsus averages 21.1 millimetres (0.83 in) long. The wings measure 57.4 mm (2.26 in) on average and the tail is about 40 mm (1.6 in) long with between 8 and 12 rectrices.The forehead, lores, crown, mantle, and scapular area are a neutral grey colour. There is a brown spot on the nape. The top of the tail is brown, and the bottom is faintly striped brown.

I have a new situation: Deep lake presents geothermal activity, while Shallow lake has mixing of saline water with fresh water. Deep lake had more instances of divers having problems because of thermoclines.  But I can use this background: Thermoclines, or sudden changes in temperature. Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3]  What is an answer for this question: Which lake has warmer water the bottom? A:","output":"Based on the given information and background, Deep Lake has warmer water at the bottom due to its geothermal activity.  In the context of the two lakes, Deep Lake exhibits geothermal activity, which means it is influenced by the Earth's internal heat. This heat rises towards the surface and, in the case of Deep Lake, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This causes convection currents, as the warmer, less dense water rises and the cooler, denser water sinks, creating a continuous cycle.  On the other hand, Shallow Lake has a mix of saline water with fresh water. While temperature variations can occur in this lake due to the different densities and solubilities of saline and fresh water, it is not mentioned that Shallow Lake has any source of geothermal activity like Deep Lake. This means that its deep water's temperatures will be influenced more by the surrounding environmental factors, and not by heat from within the Earth, which is the case in Deep Lake. In conclusion, Deep Lake has warmer water at the bottom due to the geothermal activity it experiences. This heat, originating from the Earth's interior, progressively warms the deeper waters of the lake and creates distinct thermoclines that divers experience when they descend through the water column. Meanwhile, Shallow Lake's water temperature is more influenced by the mixing of saline and fresh water, without a specific indication of geothermal activity making its deep water warmer compared to Deep Lake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pro football teams are notoriously reluctant to reveal any information on player injuries, but since six different Browns have caught the bug since 2005  Winslow has had it twice  the team's medical management looked suspect to some observers. \\"There's obviously a problem [with staph] and we have to fix it,\\" Winslow told the Cleveland Plain Dealer. \\"Just look at the history around here. It's unfortunate, because it happens time and time again.\\" The Browns, who denied that they had kept the news of his infection from his teammates, suspended Winslow one game for his rant, which included his claim that he felt like he had been treated like \\"a piece of meat.\\" But the Winslow medical controversy wasn't even the worst of it for the league. In the past week, it has become clear that two of its most marketable stars, marquee quarterbacks Tom Brady and Peyton Manning, had gotten infections. The New England Patriots' Brady has had at least two additional infection-related procedures since his initial season-ending knee surgery in September. It's now possible that his knee will have to undergo another operation, which could delay his return until 2010. Staph seems to be the likely culprit, but neither Brady nor the Patriots will confirm that. During training camp staph infected a bursa sac, which acts as a cushion between bones, in Manning's left knee. The infection required surgery and forced him to miss most of the preseason. Though the Colts released a statement on Friday insisting Manning didn't contract a more perilous staph, the anti-biotic resistant strain known as MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), the incidents should alarm the NFL. \\"The NFL, and all the leagues, should be diligent, and not let their guards down,\\" says Dr. Robert Gotlin, director of Orthopedic and Sports Rehabilitation at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City. \\"They've got to do better. It's got to be one of the top five priorities.\\" The recent cases have certainly gotten players' attention. \\"I'm concerned, and wondering why it's happening. It's not some little infection that goes away in a few days, it's pretty serious,\\" says Chicago Bears rookie running back Matt Forte. The league is quick to point out that it has partnered with teams to educate players about the bacteria, while the players' union insists it's alarmed and has contacted the league about further action. Some teams, like the Colts, have posted pictures on training room walls that warn players about staph symptoms and how to avoid contracting or spreading it. For their part, the Browns note that the team has previously used a special anti-staph agent to disinfect the locker room, weight room and other places where players gather. Staph, of course, is far from just an NFL problem. Two college teams, the '05 Florida Gators and the '03 USC Trojans, had multiple cases. And football is by no means the only sports victim. The infection kept Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Alex Rios out of the 2006 All-Star Game. A few days later another Toronto player caught it, and the clubhouse was disinfected. NBA players Paul Pierce, Grant Hill and Drew Gooden have had it. Staph killed a high school wrestler in California this summer, and last spring 15 students at a Pennsylvania high school were either treated for staph or symptoms caused by the virus. What exactly are staph infections? Staph is bacteria carried on the skin, which can enter the body through a cut or during a medical procedure, causing the infection. Most are minor, but certain strains are particularly resistant to anti-biotics and can cause athletes to miss significant playing time. Athletes are more likely to suffer cuts, and the locker room setting bunches players close to one another in a warm, damp environment, so they are especially susceptible to spreading the bacteria. Since football teams carry some 55 players on their rosters, and tend to have a higher degree of serious injuries to deal with, they are at particular risk. According to a 2005 survey by the NFL Team Physicians Society, 13 out of 30 teams that responded had had a player contract MRSA in recent years, for a total of 60 leaguewide infections. Though Philadelphia Eagles linebacker Omar Gaither rightly points out that \\"we're just a naturally dirty sport,\\" there are several basic precautions athletes can take to lower the chance of catching an infection. Many athletes shave their ankles, legs, and arms because they don't want athletic tape ripping hair off their bodies, but experts say they should lose the razor. \\"No matter how careful the shaving is, you can have nicks and microscopic cuts in the skin,\\" says Dr. Daniel Sexton, an infectious disease specialist at the Duke University Medical Center, who consults for an NFL team and several college programs. \\"Any time you break that barrier, it becomes a portal through which bacteria can gain access.\\" Staph prevention is pretty low-tech. \\"You know, this is pretty simple,\\" Sexton says. \\"Hand washing remains the primary defense against the transmissions of most organisms, including staph. Most people don't think of a locker room as a place where hand hygiene is important, but locker rooms are also mini-emergency rooms.\\" In 2003, a team of researchers tracked the St. Louis Rams and found five players who caught eight MRSA infections. \\"We observed a lack of regular access to hand hygiene (i.e., soap and water or alcohol-based hand gels) for trainers who provided wound care,\\" they wrote in The New England Journal of Medicine. Other offenses included \\"skipping of showers by players before the use of communal whirlpools; and sharing or towels  all factors that might facilitate the transmission of infection in this setting.\\" In short: use a little common sense, tough guys. But when it comes to infectious germs, even a 245-lb. bruiser like Gaither believes you can't always outrun them. \\"You can't worry about it to death,\\" he says. \\"It's not like you can walk around and put gloves on your hand every 10 seconds. Sometimes, there's just not that much you can do.\\" Except hope that these recent cases are a coincidental hiccup, and not an epidemic that seriously tackles the NFL. (See pictures of the week here.) What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses the issue of staph infections becoming a growing concern in the NFL. Several players, including Cleveland Browns' tight end Kellen Winslow Jr., New England Patriots' Tom Brady, and Indianapolis Colts' Peyton Manning, have contracted infections due to Staphylococcus (staph) bacteria in recent years. The article highlights the possible reasons behind the spread of these infections, such as the warm, damp environment of locker rooms, large team rosters allowing for easier transmission, and athletes being more susceptible to cuts and infection entry points. Precautions and preventive measures are also discussed, emphasizing the importance of hand hygiene and not sharing towels or other personal items. The concern extends beyond the NFL, as staph infections have also plagued college football teams and athletes in other sports. The article calls for improved preventive strategies and education about staph infections in the league to protect players and prevent a potential epidemic affecting the NFL."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It starts with a voice-over, telling the viewer that: \\"some murders take seconds; some murders take minutes; some murders take hours; this murder... will take years!\\". The movie portrays the story of a forensic pathologist called Jack Cucchiaio (played by Paul Clemens; \\"cucchiaio\\" means spoon in Italian), who finds himself being haunted by a deranged looking man (Brian Rohan), who is, without any clear reason, hitting him with a spoon. No-one seems to believe this though as the mysterious attacker only shows up when Jack is alone. He is seen developing a phobia of spoons, stirring his coffee with a fork. Jack attempts to defend himself - stabbing the murderer in the throat with a kitchen knife. But to Jack's surprise his enemy turns out to be immortal, pulling the knife out of his throat and throwing it away, then continuing to hit Jack with the spoon. However, in this scene Jack also notices a strange sign on the arm of his attacker. Jack travels to the far East where he learns that his attacker is known as the Ginosaji, (\\"Silver spoon\\" in Japanese), an immortal and unstoppable being. After this, Jack is shown traveling around the world, trying to escape from the Ginosaji or to fight it. He uses various weapons, including dynamite, guns, and an RPG. Since the Ginosaji is immortal, however, he will always survive and find Jack again. The last scene shows a weakened, wounded Jack, crawling in the desert, with the Ginosaji still striking him with the spoon. Then, suddenly, the spoon breaks.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.      / Updated By Leigh Ann Caldwell and Vaughn Hillyard      WASHINGTON — With Vice President Mike Pence casting a tie-breaking vote, Republicans moved forward on health care reform Tuesday as the Senate successfully opened debate on the issue. But just six hours later, Republicans faced their first defeat in that process, failing to pass a measure that they've been working on that would have partially repealed and replaced Obamacare.      The vote earlier in the day was a major victory for Republicans, who have struggled to find 50 votes to get this far, but the final product is likely to fall far short of the Republicans' seven-year promise to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. It took the likelihood of a slimmed-down final bill in order to get enough \\"yes\\" votes to just open debate.      President Donald Trump celebrated the Senate's vote Tuesday night in Youngstown, Ohio, saying at a rally that America is now \\"one step closer to liberating our citizens from this Obamacare nightmare.\\"      \\"Finally,\\" he said to a crowd of thousands of supporters at the campaign-style event. \\"You think that's easy? That's not easy.\\"      While the president told his fans that he hoped that \\"obstructionists, meaning Democrats\\" would \\"finally do what's right\\" and join efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, Trump predicted that Republicans will likely have to go it alone — as they did Tuesday. \\"Today we won 51 to 50 and didn't get a single Democrat vote,\\" he said. \\"Think of that.\\"      But later in the evening, the Senate took its first substantive vote on a beefed-up version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act, a measure that would partially repeal and replace Obamacare. That vote failed to garner the requisite 60 votes necessary and put an end for the time being of a large comprehensive health care bill.      Earlier in Washington, momentum built over the course of the day as several previously skeptical members announced their support after Senate GOP leaders began detailing plans for more votes over the next days to shape the specifics of the legislation.      In a dramatic moment that allowed for the vote's passage, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who was recently diagnosed with brain cancer, returned to the Senate from Arizona to cast a key vote. Pence broke the tie after two Republicans — Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska — and all the Democrats voted against it. But first more than a dozen protesters in the gallery interrupted the Senate's proceedings, chanting, \\"Kill the bill; don't kill us.\\"      Speaking at the White House just minutes after the vote, President Donald Trump thanked Senate Republicans, saying, \\"now we move forward with truly great health care for the American people, we look forward to that. This was a big step.\\"      Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said before the vote that it was \\"a critical first step.\\"      \\"We can’t let this moment slip by. We’ve talked about this too long,\\" McConnell added.      Now that the the Senate has opened up debate, the next few days will consist of debate and votes on perhaps dozens of amendments.      The final product is unknown but is likely to end up as what's being called a “skinny” repeal that disposes of just a few components of Obamacare.      The first vote was on the Better Care Reconciliation Act, with an amendment from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that would provide for the sale of catastrophic insurance plans that are less expensive and provide less protection than allowed under Obamacare. The bill also included an amendment by Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, that would add 100 billion in additional spending to help low-income people pay for premiums and co-pays, especially those who might lose Medicaid coverage due to cuts to the program.      But the BCRA amendment needed 60 votes because neither the Cruz nor the Portman provisions have been scored by the Congressional Budget Office, leaving no clear indication of how much they would cost or how many people they would affect. That means it cannot pass under special reconciliation rules allowing a simple majority approval. It fell far short with nine Republicans and all Democrats voting against it.      One of the next votes, likely Wednesday, will be on a version of the Obamacare repeal bill that passed the Senate and the House in 2015 but was vetoed by President Barack Obama.      The plan after those two votes is for senators to proceed to votes on a series of amendments to create the “skinny” repeal, which is a watered-down version of repeal with nothing to replace it.      The goal would be to eliminate Obamacare's individual mandate penalty, the employer mandate penalty, and the tax on medical devices —items that Senate leaders think might be able to get 50 votes. A broader repeal would also have ended Medicaid's expansion, get rid of or replace the Obamacare subsidies that help people purchase insurance and repeal more — or all — of Obamacare's taxes.      The Senate would then go to conference with the House of Representatives, where conferees would work out a final bill. Both chambers would then have to vote on the reconciled bill.      \\"The proposal Leader McConnell made is nothing more than a ruse,\\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor. \\"We’re going to do everything we can in this chamber, and the so many groups outside the chamber, to make sure that this does not pass the Senate at the end of the day.\\"      While the plan is is unlikely to result in a full repeal or replace, the scaled-down ambition was enough for senators who have been critical throughout the process to vote \\"yes\\" on today's motion to open up debate.      \\"It's just time to have debate,\\" said Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., who had earlier said he would not vote to debate the Senate bill. \\"So let's have the debate. Move forward. Let's get it out of the backrooms. Let's get it out on the Senate floor. And let's move forward.\\" He did not indicate how he'd vote on the various measures that will come up in the days to come.      The dramatic return of McCain — who received a standing ovation on the Senate floor — helped give GOP leaders not only a crucial vote but a morale boost for the GOP conference.      While passage of the motion to proceed had been in doubt for weeks, the momentum began to shift Tuesday morning. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., announced in a series of tweets that he supports this plan and would vote \\"yes\\" on the motion, saying he was satisfied after being promised a vote on a near-full repeal and that the repeal-and-replace plan will likely fail.      A handful of other GOP senators who had also been skeptical of the Senate bill came on board to move ahead, including Sens. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.V., Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Jerry Moran, R-Kan.      But there was some last-minute drama that led people to question if the vote would really pass, provided by Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., who has been highly critical of the process and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Nearly 25 minutes after the vote began, Johnson walked onto the floor, didn't vote, and proceeded to get into a heated discussion with McConnell that lasted five minutes. Johnson and McCain had not yet voted when the Arizona senator walked on the floor and cast his vote. Then Johnson voted \\"yes,\\" giving Republicans their 50th vote.      Over the last two days, Trump finally engaged fully on health care, using his bully pulpit and his Twitter account to pressure — and shame — Republicans into voting for the bill.      Democrats are working to defeat the bill, holding rallies, including one on the Capitol steps after Tuesday's vote. They are also meeting and hosting people, including children who depend on coverage they've received under Obamacare, to lobby against repeal.      Ali Vitali reported from Youngstown, Ohio. ||||| Sen. John McCain (R.

John McCain returned to the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday afternoon to cast a critical vote in favor of health care legislation less than a week after undergoing surgery and revealing he has brain cancer.      And then, in typical McCain fashion, he took to the floor and blasted both the Senate's draft health care bill and the process that produced it.      \\"All we’ve managed to do is make more popular a policy that wasn’t very popular when we started trying to get rid of it,\\" he said of Obamacare.      McCain’s vote was pivotal as Republicans, who hold a 52-seat majority, scrambled to round up 50 votes on a motion to advance legislation to repeal Obamacare.      McCain did not announce in advance whether he would support Tuesday’s “motion to proceed,” but he marched onto the floor to a standing ovation from his colleagues and voted \\"aye.\\" Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted no, requiring Vice President Pence to cast the tie-breaking vote in favor.      But that was only a vote to begin debate. \\"I will not vote for this bill as it is today,\\" McCain said, and if it fails, \\"which seems likely,\\" the Senate should go back to the drawing board, with hearings, markups and consultation with Democrats — all things that have thus far been lacking.      Standing in the well of the Senate with the surgical scar over his left eyebrow clearly visible, McCain urged his colleagues to \\"stop listening to the bombastic loudmouths\\" on radio, television and the Internet who rail against compromise. \\"To hell with them!\\" McCain said.      Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, were seen smiling during McCain's speech as he railed against Republicans crafting legislation behind closed doors and trying to convince skeptical members that it's better than nothing.      “Let’s trust each other,\\" McCain said. \\"We’ve been spinning our wheels on too many important issues because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle.\\"      Sen.

The amendment would essentially allow insurers to sell plans that don't comply with ObamaCare regulations, as long as it also sold plans that did.

The amendment, just added to the bill Tuesday night, would add 100 billion to the bill's state stability fund to help people who might lose the coverage they got under ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion. These funds could help cover out-of-pocket costs like deductibles and copays.      Portman said he \\"worked with the president, vice president and administrative officials\\" to \\"improve this bill further to help out low-income Ohioans.\\"      Portman was a holdout on the GOP's replacement bill, but indicated that his amendment moved him to \\"yes\\" on a crucial procedural vote on healthcare Tuesday afternoon.      The GOP's proposal repealing and replacing ObamaCare – being offered as an amendment to a bill currently being debated by the Senate – will likely need 60 votes, meaning it is unlikely to pass.      That's because the proposal includes two amendments, including Portman's, that have not yet been analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office, a requirement for the budgetary process Republicans are using to try to pass their healthcare bill.

The amendment will also include Sen. Ted Cruz's (Texas) proposal to give insurance companies more flexibility on what kinds of health insurance plans it offers, and a Medicaid proposal from Sen.

McConnell called up the first amendment to the bill, which was the 2015 repeal bill. He's expected to attach the Senate's repeal and replacement bill, along with amendments from GOP Sens. Rob Portman (Ohio) and Ted Cruz (Texas) to that as a second-degree amendment.      Under Senate procedure, the chamber will vote first on the repeal and replace bill, before turning to repeal-only.

Schumer added that if Republicans vote against the bill, Democrats would work with them on legislation.      GOP senators head to the floor      2:30 p.m.      Senate Republicans emerged from a closed-door lunch, many remaining tight-lipped as they headed to the Senate floor for a vote to begin debate on ObamaCare repeal legislation.

Dean Heller (R-Nev.) on Tuesday will vote to begin the healthcare debate.      Heller, who is seen as the most vulnerable Senate Republican incumbent in 2018, announced in a statement that he will vote to advance healthcare legislation, even though he warned last month that he opposed a motion to proceed to the Senate version of the healthcare bill because it would leave tens of millions more people uninsured.      Heller argued that blocking a debate would leave the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, as the status quo.      He was one of a handful of Republican senators considered most likely to block a debate on healthcare legislation and send Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) back to the drawing board.

I think people are predicting we may be able to get a more 'skinny' repeal that involves some things we can find consensus.\\"      Paul has been staunchly opposed to the Senate's repeal-and-replace bill.      The bulk of the Senate GOP conference is still at lunch.      Portman to back motion to proceed      2:01 p.m.      Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) will vote in favor of the key procedural motion to effectively start debate in the Senate on ObamaCare legislation, according to the Columbus Dispatch.      The Dispatch quoted a source close to Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican who has opposed various Senate ObamaCare repeal-and-replace measures. The source said Portman had called Kasich to tell him the news.      Portman has long been seen as a key swing vote, and his support for the measure will make it more difficult for other centrists on the fence to vote \\"no.\\"      Collins: 'Skinny' GOP health plan not adequate      1:35 p.m.      Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), a key moderate, voiced concern over the slimmed-down Senate GOP plan going into the GOP policy lunch.      Collins said she had not heard about the so-called skinny ObamaCare repeal plan until a reporter asked about.      “I would look forward to hearing more details about that at lunch,” she said, as Senate Republicans gathered to discuss healthcare strategy ahead of this afternoon’s vote.      Schumer knocks Rand Paul over support for key procedural vote      1:35 p.m.      Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) knocked Sen. Rand Paul after the Kentucky Republican signaled he would vote to start the healthcare debate.      \\"It’s true that he will likely get a vote on an amendment to do repeal without replace — but surely he knows that vote will fail. Why, then, would the junior Senator from Kentucky ... vote on the motion to proceed knowing that he won’t get what he wants?\\" Schumer asked.      Schumer added that he thinks Paul is going along with GOP leadership because if the Senate goes to conference with the House to merge their proposals, \\"the likeliest compromise in conference is full repeal of the Affordable Care Act or something close to it.\\"      Paul said on Twitter earlier on Tuesday that the Senate will take up the 2015 ObamaCare repeal bill if they can get the 50 votes needed to start debate on the House-passed healthcare measure.      GOP senator: 'Skinny' repeal 'rather unsatisfying'      1:22 p.m.      Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said a proposed \\"skinny repeal\\" of ObamaCare would be \\"rather unsatisfying from my standpoint.\\"      Johnson said that GOP leaders haven't yet told him what such a repeal would look like.      The conservative senator has been a frequent critic of the hurried process used to try to pass ObamaCare repeal and the limited info from leaders.      \\"You have to start with information. In this alternate universe, information is the last step in the process, including, I guess, right now, what we’re actually going to vote on, which is a little hard to believe,\\" Johnson told reporters.      When asked if pared-down repeal would be better than nothing, Johnson didn't respond, but shook his head.      'Skinny' bill would delay repeal of ObamaCare mandates      1:10 p.m.      Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said the \\"skinny bill\\" would delay the repeal of the individual and employer mandates for two years.      He said he would support the skinny bill in order to \\"get to the next step.\\"      Pence, Priebus arrive in Capitol      1 p.m.      Vice President Pence and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus have been spotted heading into the Senate GOP lunch.

Heritage Action and Americans for Tax Reform have also called on lawmakers to vote yes on the motion.      McConnell pitches colleagues on beginning repeal debate      12:21 p.m.      Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is urging his caucus to vote to start debate on repealing and replacing ObamaCare, a few hours before a key procedural hurdle.      \\"Any senator who votes against starting debate is telling America that you're just fine with the ObamaCare nightmare,\\" he said.      McConnell will need at least 50 GOP senators to vote \\"yes\\" on taking up the House bill, which is being used as a vehicle for any Senate action.      He got a late boost of momentum after Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) signaled he would vote \\"yes,\\" on the heels of news that Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is returning to the Senate in time for the Tuesday afternoon vote.

When asked if it was possible to move to a \\"skinny\\" repeal bill, Cornyn said, \\"I think we can do that.\\"      He reiterated that if the Senate can pass a bill, it can go to conference with the House to hammer out the details.      Paul a 'yes' on key healthcare vote      12:08 p.m.      Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said Tuesday that he will support a motion to proceed to debate on healthcare later in the day.      Paul tweeted that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told him the upper chamber would take up the 2015 ObamaCare repeal bill previously passed by Congress.      “If this is indeed the plan, I will vote to proceed and I will vote for any all measures that are clean repeal,” Paul said      Paul has pushed for a vote on the 2015 bill, which repeals large parts of ObamaCare's requirements and regulations, instead of the GOP repeal-and-replace plan that Republicans have been working on this year.      If that measure can't get the 60 votes it needs, which is unlikely, Paul said he would support \\"whatever version of CLEAN repeal we can pass.\\"      McCain returning to the Senate this afternoon      12:06 p.m.      Sen. John McCain will return to the Senate about 2:45 p.m. on Tuesday, according to the Arizona Republican's office.      McCain, whose office announced last week he had been diagnosed with brain cancer, is returning in time to vote on taking up the House-passed healthcare bill in the upper chamber.      His office said McCain will speak on the Senate floor after the vote for first remarks since returning to Capitol Hill, and then speak with reporters off the Senate floor.      Senators prepare for dramatic vote      11:35 a.m.      Senate Republicans are preparing to take a dramatic procedural vote on Tuesday that could make or break their ObamaCare repeal effort.      It’s unclear if Republicans will have the 50 votes they need to clear a first procedural hurdle, though they are pulling out all the stops to do so.      ADVERTISEMENT      The vote on a motion to proceed to the House ObamaCare repeal-and-replace measure is expected sometime Tuesday afternoon, but it hasn’t been scheduled.      The latest Senate GOP effort to get a bill through the Senate is the proposal of a “skinny” repeal bill that would end ObamaCare’s mandates and the medical device tax.      The hope is that this measure might win 50 votes from Republican senators who have been divided on healthcare.      GOP leaders have kept members mostly in the dark about what they will ultimately be voting on: a full repeal of ObamaCare with a two-year delay to find a replacement; the Better Care Reconciliation Act, which would make dramatic changes to Medicaid in addition to repealing large parts of the law; or the “skinny repeal.”      Sen.

These reasons include selection, convenience, quality assurance, affordability and customer service. 1. Selection: Furniture stores typically offer a wide range of products, including various types of furniture such as sofas, dining tables, bedroom sets, and office chairs. They may also carry a broad selection of styles, designs, materials, and finishes. The diversity in furniture options allows customers to find pieces that suit their specific tastes and home decor needs. Furthermore, these stores provide special-order options, giving buyers the chance to customize their purchases. 2. Convenience: Furniture stores are designed for the convenient browsing and shopping experience of their customers. They exhibit the products in a manner that allows shoppers to explore different styles, layouts, and ideas. Specialists usually arrange display sections by rooms, providing presentation for customers to envision how a particular piece of furniture might look in their home. Furthermore, many stores manage their inventory online, making it possible for customers to browse options from the comfort of their own home before making a trip to the store. 3. Quality Assurance: While buying furniture from a store, customers can generally count on a certain level of quality. Stores often partner with well-known manufacturers to ensure their products meet acceptable standards. Buyers can physically assess the construction, materials, and comfort of the furniture pieces before making their purchase. This tangible aspect of shopping in a store offers a sense of confidence regarding the quality and durability of the furniture. 4. Affordability: Furniture stores offer various price points, ensuring there is an option for virtually any budget.

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN)  -- South Africans waited on election results Thursday in a ballot that the ruling African National Congress party appeared on course to win in a landslide. ANC leader Jacob Zuma is expected to be South Africa's next president. South African media reported Thursday that the ANC had won around 65 percent of the vote with one third of ballots counted. Reports suggested the opposition Democratic Alliance could be on course to claim control of Western Cape province -- but the ANC was ahead in the country's eight other provinces. \\"This party is an elephant. You cannot actually topple an elephant,\\" presidential candidate Jacob Zuma told thousands of supporters at ANC headquarters in central Johannesburg, according to Reuters.com. Zuma, who danced and sang his trademark \\"Bring me my machine gun\\" anti-apartheid anthem, stressed the ANC was \\"not yet celebrating victory.\\" Final results are not expected until Saturday. All counting is done by hand in the country, which has 23 million registered voters. Members of parliament will elect the country's president next month. The Independent Electoral Commission said the number of people voting on Wednesday created long lines and a shortage of ballot boxes and papers in some districts and voting stations.  Watch as South Africa waits for a winner ». \\"We thank voters for their enthusiasm and patience as they waited to exercise their democratic right to vote,\\" commission Chairwoman Brigalia Bam said Wednesday. Although the ANC is widely expected to win, it remains to be seen how much ground the two main opposition parties -- the Democratic Alliance and the Congress of the People -- will gain, and whether the ANC will be able to hold onto its two-thirds parliamentary majority. The ANC has gained votes in every election since 1994, when the country held its first democratic election. But the Congress of the People -- a breakaway faction of the ANC -- threatens the ruling party's grip on power.  Voter shares feelings about ANC and new rival ». The ANC has been dogged by allegations of corruption and has been accused of failing to deliver services to the poor. And Zuma until recently faced fraud and corruption charges. The country's prosecuting authority dropped the charges two weeks before the elections, citing alleged political interference in the case. That decision sparked widespread outrage, with opposition parties accusing prosecutors of buckling under political pressure. Twenty-six parties vied in Wednesday's election. They included Islamic and Christian parties, and right-wing Afrikaaner and socialist groups. Learn more about some of South Africa's political parties.

The decision complicates the Scottish government's efforts to tackle alcohol-related harm in the country and raises questions about the future of MUP. Step 1: Explaining the minimum unit pricing policy Minimum unit pricing is a public health intervention aimed at reducing alcohol consumption by setting a minimum price at which alcohol can be sold. It targets cheap, high-strength alcoholic beverages that contribute significantly to alcohol-related harm. The Scottish government's proposed plan would establish a minimum price of 50p per unit of alcohol. Step 2: Discussing the initial ruling by Europe's highest court The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has issued a preliminary ruling suggesting that the Scottish government's MUP policy may violate European Union (EU) law. The court maintains that measures like MUP should be \\"proportional and targeted,\\" considering alternative and less restrictive options to protect public health. Although the final decision rests with the national courts, the ECJ's ruling has a considerable impact on the legal argument for MUP. Step 3: Highlighting the implications of the delay on public health Scotland faces a significant burden in terms of alcohol-related harm; thus, MUP could be a valuable tool to improve public health outcomes. A delay in implementing MUP may lead to missed opportunities in reducing alcohol misuse and alleviating the strain on the National Health Service (NHS) resources. Step 4: Presenting the stance of MUP's supporters and opponents MUP's advocates argue that the policy would save lives, reduce hospital admissions and cut crime rates. On the other hand, opponents, including alcohol industry representatives, maintain that it would disproportionately affect moderate drinkers and impose an unfair burden on low-income households. Step 5: Exploring alternative measures and potential next steps As MUP faces further delay, the Scottish government and other stakeholders may need to consider alternative measures to tackle alcohol-related harm. Taxation, advertising restrictions, and educational campaigns could be part of a comprehensive strategy. In conclusion, the implementation of minimum unit pricing for alcohol in Scotland has encountered significant legal hurdles following the initial ruling by Europe's highest court. As a result, the Scottish government may have to explore other avenues in its quest to address alcohol-related harm in the country."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The 5th Dimension is an American popular music vocal group, whose repertoire includes pop, R&B, soul, jazz, light opera and Broadway--the melange was coined as \\"Champagne Soul.\\" Formed as The Versatiles in late 1965, the group changed its name to the hipper \\"The 5th Dimension\\" by 1966. They became well-known during the late 1960s and early 1970s for their popular hits: \\"Up, Up and Away\\", \\"Stoned Soul Picnic\\", \\"Medley: Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In (The Flesh Failures)\\", \\"Wedding Bell Blues\\", \\"Never My Love\\", \\"One Less Bell to Answer\\", \\"(Last Night) The members began rehearsing as the Versatiles in late 1965 and auditioned for Marc Gordon, who headed Motown's Los Angeles office. Although Motown rejected the group's demo tape, Gordon agreed to manage them and brought them to the attention of Johnny Rivers, who had just started his own label, Soul City Records. Their first Soul City single, \\"I'll Be Lovin' You Forever\\", was a successful single.  In 1965 The Mamas & the Papas' first single, lead member John Phillips' \\"Go Where You Wanna Go\\", failed to open the foursome's chart career. At the suggestion of Rivers and their manager Marc Gordon, the 5th Dimension covered the same song virtually note-for-note (except for the last verse's upward modulation), and their early 1967 version climbed into the top 20 on R&B and pop stations and peaked at #16 on the Hot 100, opening the quintet's chart career.  The budding songwriter Jimmy Webb supplied the group with their breakthrough hit, \\"Up, Up and Away\\", a mid-1967 #7 hit that won five Grammy Awards. The following year, the group scored major hit singles with Laura Nyro's songs \\"Stoned Soul Picnic\\" (U.S. #3) and \\"Sweet Blindness\\" (U.S. #13). The group received a gold record for their album Stoned Soul Picnic.  That album included \\"California Soul\\", which peaked at #25 in February 1969. Weeks later the group's success broke wide open, with \\"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\\" from the musical Hair topping the Hot 100 for six straight weeks in April and May, and another Nyro song, \\"Wedding Bell Blues\\", doing the same for the first three full weeks in November. Their cover of Neil Sedaka's \\"Workin' On a Groovy Thing\\" went to #20 in between. Those four singles kept the group on the Hot 100 for all but four weeks in 1969. By some reckonings, \\"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\\" was the biggest hit single for 1969.  Later top 20 hits included 1970's \\"One Less Bell to Answer\\" (U.S. #2), 1971's \\"Love's Lines, Angles and Rhymes\\" (U.S. #19) and \\"Never My Love\\" (U.S. #12), 1972's \\"(Last Night) I Didn't Get to Sleep at All\\" (U.S. #8) and \\"If I Could Reach You\\" (U.S. #10).

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Paragraph: The family across the street has a cat. He is a cute black kitty named Dillon. The cat is about two years old, and the family has had him for about a year. He is an indoor cat who is not allowed to go outside. The children like to play with Dillon because he still acts like a kitten. Dillon jumps around, and chases flies, beetles and spiders. When he plays with the children, he sometimes uses his paws to attack them, but he doesn't try to hurt them with his claws. Dillon is a great cat but he has one problem: he likes to eat bread. The family only feeds him cat food, never human food like steak or potatoes. But the cat likes the smell of bread so much that he tries to find it everywhere he can. Dillon jumps up on the kitchen table when a sandwich is there, and tries to carry it away. He finds loaves of bread from the store on the floor and claws through the wrappers. The cat climbs into the bread cupboard looking for hot dog and hamburger buns. The family tries to make Dillon stop getting into the bread by spraying him with water when he goes after bread. They yell at him when he walks on the table. But Dillon does not listen. The kitty keeps trying to find bread to eat. The family thinks that the man who took care of Dillon when he was a very young kitten must have been a baker or cook, and that's why Dillon likes the smell and taste of bread so much!

What sentence would provide a factual answer to this question: \\"If the ground is fully shaded, and plants there barely grow, likely the reason is\\"","output":"If the ground is fully shaded, and plants there barely grow, likely the reason is that the area is receiving insufficient sunlight, which hinders the plants' ability to perform photosynthesis, an essential process to produce energy for growth and development. Photosynthesis requires sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide as its main components, with sunlight being the primary driving force for the chemical reactions that take place within the plants' cells. In areas of dense shade, such as beneath large trees or structures, sunlight is blocked and unable to reach the ground and plants effectively. As a result, plants do not receive an adequate amount of the light spectrum necessary for optimal growth. Consequently, these plants exhibit stunted growth, weak and leggy stems, fewer and smaller leaves, limited flowering, and reduced overall vigor. Furthermore, shaded environments can also augment the competition for resources, such as water and nutrients, as roots from larger surrounding plants can dominate the soil, leaving minimal resources for the smaller plants. Additionally, shaded areas tend to have cooler temperatures and higher humidity, which can lead to pests and diseases thriving, causing further stress on the already weakened plants. In summary, the primary reason plants barely grow in fully shaded locations is the lack of sunlight, which disrupts the process of photosynthesis and hampers the ability of plants to produce energy for growth. This problem is often exacerbated by factors such as competition for resources, temperature variations, and increased susceptibility to pests and diseases. To improve the growth of plants in such areas, it is essential to select shade-tolerant species or consider ways to enhance light penetration, such as pruning or thinning nearby vegetation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

What would have happened if I did not purchase the bundle deal ?","output":"If you had not purchased the bundle deal consisting of an 80GB PlayStation 3, Metal Gear Solid 4, and a Rumble Controller for 499, several factors would have come into play that may have impacted your gaming experience and overall satisfaction with your decision. Here's a detailed analysis of what could have happened: 1. Financial aspect:  By choosing to buy the 40GB PlayStation 3 for 399, Metal Gear Solid 4 for 60, and the new Rumble Controller for 55 without the bundle, the total cost would amount to 514. In comparison to the bundle offer, you would have ended up paying 15 more. 2. Storage capacity: In terms of storage, you would have decided on a 40GB PlayStation 3 instead of the 80GB version offered in the bundle. Having half the storage capacity could have led to several inconveniences down the line:    a) Limited game installations: With a smaller hard drive, you would have been able to store fewer game installations and updates. This might have required you to frequently delete and reinstall games to manage the available storage.    b) Restricted multimedia storage: If you use your PlayStation 3 for storing movie and music files as well as game saves, reduced storage could have negatively impacted your multimedia storage capabilities. 3. Value for money: By opting for individual items instead of the bundle, you would have missed out on the added value that the bundle provides. The bundle offered an additional 40GB of storage as well as an included copy of Metal Gear Solid 4 and Rumble Controller, all at a lower price than purchasing the items separately.  4. Gaming experience: The bundle included a Rumble Controller, which is designed to provide tactile feedback during gameplay and enhance the overall gaming experience. If you had chosen not to purchase the bundle, you might have needed to buy this separately, ultimately adding to the overall cost. 5. Future upgrades: Should you have realized at a later date that you needed more storage or a better gaming experience, you might have considered upgrading your PlayStation 3 or accessories. This would have likely led to additional costs and the feeling of not getting the best initial deal. In conclusion, if you had not purchased the bundle deal, you would have spent more money on a separate console, game, and controller, while also having to manage reduced storage capacity. Additionally, the overall value for money would be lower, and you may have found yourself considering future upgrades to enhance your experience. By choosing the bundle deal, you have saved money, received a better gaming experience, and reduced the need for potential future upgrades."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: My love affair with technology began at an early age.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: Which verses of the ballad about the Wabash River talk about missing a loved one? is inside the article: The ballad speaks of the Wabash River, which flows through Indiana, and reminisces about events that occurred there. The song has two verses and a chorus. The first verse is about the narrator's childhood on a farm and his love for his mother. The second verse is about his lost love, Mary. While the subjects of the verses are connected, the narrative of the chorus is detached from the verses as it seemingly reminisces nostalgically.Without speaking directly of death, both verses indicate the absence of a loved one, and the narrator's sadness and inability to cope with the grief. In the second verse, the narrator cannot bring himself to come near to his lost love's grave. The effort to avoid the subject of death and the focus on fond memories is typical of songs and societal sensibilities at the time.The melody of the song is a memorable tune made easy to learn because of its combination of harmonic repetition and contrast—elements that make music easy to remember while avoiding monotony. The recurrence and dissimilarity within the melody is similar to the patterns in many popular folk songs. Dresser, however, avoided the common 19th-century practice of using a portion of the refrain's melody in the verse. With little formal training in music theory, it is unlikely that Dresser purposefully made any methodical calculations when he composed the melody.Written for piano, guitar, and mandolin, the music begins in the key of G major with an Andante Moderato tempo. The verses follow a chord progression of G–C–G. The chorus transitions to B minor, and progresses as B–E–E, before returning to G–C–G in its final bars. Although the melody of the chorus is unique within the piece, it is in harmonic unity with the verses. An upbeat version played at a Andantino tempo was also adapted for play by small orchestras and big bands., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the article, it is clear that the second verse of the ballad about the Wabash River talks about missing a loved one. This verse revolves around the narrator's lost love, Mary. The narrator's expressions of grief and sadness are evident, as well as his inability to cope with the loss. There is a mention of his reluctance to come near her grave, which demonstrates his difficulty in dealing with her absence. The ballad's overall theme focuses on reminiscing about events that occurred near the Wabash River, flowing through Indiana. The first verse, meanwhile, centers on the narrator's childhood on a farm and his love for his mother. Although it does not directly discuss missing a loved one like the second verse, it still indicates the absence of a loved one and nostalgia for the past. As for the chorus, the narrative is detached from the verses in terms of content, but it shares a nostalgic and reminiscing tone, which is a common theme throughout the ballad. The melody and musical structure of the song play a significant role in creating its memorable and easy-to-learn tune through a combination of harmonic repetition and contrast. These elements help to avoid monotony while making the song accessible to a wide audience. In summary, the second verse of the ballad about the Wabash River is the one that talks about missing a loved one, specifically, the narrator's lost love, Mary. The first verse and the chorus also share nostalgia and reminiscing tones, albeit discussing different subjects and not directly addressing the absence of a loved one like the second verse does."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After the Jaguars deferred the opening coin toss, the Patriots received the opening kickoff to begin a 10-play, 82-yard drive. On a 1st-and-goal run from the Jaguars' 1-yard line, Maroney fumbled before breaking the plane of the goal line; it was recovered by Jaguars linebacker Daryl Smith at the 1-yard line. The Jaguars reached their own 35-yard line on their ensuing possession before failing to convert on a fourth down attempt, turning the ball back over the Patriots. Two plays after a 21-yard Morris run, Brady and Moss connected on a 2-yard touchdown reception to give the Patriots a 7-0 lead. After the kickoff, the Jaguars drove to the Patriots' 42-yard line before a David Garrard pass intended for Marcedes Lewis was intercepted by Meriweather at the Patriots' 17-yard line and returned 56 yards. Two plays later, on the first play of the second quarter, Brady threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Baker to extend the Patriots' lead to 14-0. The Jaguars continued to move the ball on their next possession, reaching midfield on completions of 15 and 14 yards; however a false start penalty negated another 15-yard reception and the Jaguars were forced to punt. Following a Patriots' three-and-out, Garrard was strip-sacked by Banta-Cain on the first play of the Jaguars' next-drive; tackle Eben Britton recovered the fumble for the Jaguars, who punted three plays later. On the third play of their ensuing drive, the Patriots moved into the red zone on a 55-yard Morris run, and later took a 21-0 lead on a 1-yard Morris touchdown run. After another Jaguars three-and-out, the Patriots moved into Jaguars territory on a 29-yard Welker catch and later extended their lead to 28-0 on a 6-yard touchdown reception by Moss. This would remain the score after the Jaguars ended the half on another punt. The Jaguars began the second half with a 16-play, 69-yard drive that took over eight minutes off the clock; however, it ended without any points after Garrard was intercepted by Springs at the Patriots' 2-yard line on a 3rd-and-goal from the 5-yard line. The Patriots responded with a 10-play, 90-yard drive of their own, despite a false start penalty to begin it. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Brady hit Moss on his third touchdown catch of the game, putting the Patriots ahead 35-0. However, the Jaguars responded quickly, moving past midfield on a 22-yard Rashad Jennings run and into the red zone on a 20-yard Nate Hughes reception. Two plays later, Garrard scrambled two yards for a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 35-7. With 12:41 remaining in the game, the Patriots received the ball after the kickoff. What ensued was a 20-play drive, with the Patriots reaching midfield with about ten minutes remaining in the game, and reaching the Jaguars' 10-yard line by the two-minute warning. The drive included five first downs, including two off fourth down conversions. One play after the two-minute warning, Hoyer replaced Brady at quarterback, and one play later, the Patriots turned the ball over on downs after a failed 4th-and-2 run by Morris. The Jaguars, with 29 seconds left in the game, ran one play to end the game.

The organization that grants academic accreditation to Penn State has warned the school that it is in danger of losing that crucial status in the wake of the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal, the university announced this week. The move by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education is the latest blow for the beleaguered university, which has seen its reputation clobbered and its football program hobbled after investigators found school leaders did too little to stop the abuse. Were the commission to pull Penn State's accreditation -- which it has not done -- the school would face the loss of eligibility for federal student aid programs, guaranteed student loans, federal research grants and could lose eligibility for state aid, commission spokesman Richard Pockrass said in July. Paterno family wants to appeal Penn State sanctions. Penn State will resolve the commission's concerns, promised Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Blannie Bowen. \\"This action has nothing to do with the quality of education our students receive,\\" Bowen said in a statement posted Monday to the school's website. \\"Middle States is focusing on governance, integrity and financial issues related to information in the Freeh report and other items related to our current situation.\\" The commission voted August 6 to place the school on warning status. Two days later, it notified Penn State officials that the school's accreditation was \\"in jeopardy\\" based on information contained in former FBI Director Louis Freeh's report on Penn State's handling of the sex-abuse allegations against Sandusky and a National Collegiate Athletic Association action against the school. Freeh found that Penn State's leadership showed \\"total and consistent disregard\\" for youths sexually abused by Sandusky, the former assistant football coach convicted by a jury in June on 45 counts involving child sex abuse. He is scheduled to be sentenced in September. Among other things, authorities say school officials failed to properly address a report that Sandusky had been seen in a football complex shower, apparently engaged in sexual contact with a young boy. Timeline of the Penn State scandal. Last month, the NCAA fined Penn State 60 million, banned the football program from bowl games for four years, stripped scholarships and took away the team's wins from 1998 to 2011. The commission also said it had insufficient evidence that Penn State officials had followed commission rules about how schools are to be governed and whether it had provided \\"accurate, fair and complete information\\" about what was happening at the school, according to the letter. The commission asked Penn State to report by September 30 on the steps it is taking to ensure full compliance with accreditation requirements, as well as information about the school's financial capacity to meet ongoing obligations considering the potential fallout from civil lawsuits expected over the scandal. A team assembled by the commission will visit Penn State after the September report to evaluate the school's performance, the commission said. Bowen said the commission \\"wants us to document that steps we have already taken and are planning to take will ensure our full compliance with its requirements\\" and emphasized that the school expects no loss of accreditation. \\"It is critical to emphasize that Middle States does not issue a warning unless the commission believes that an institution has the capacity to make appropriate improvements within a reasonable period and then sustain itself to stay in compliance,\\" Bowen said in the statement. \\"This certainly is true for Penn State. We're confident that our monitoring report and the site visit will confirm this to the commission.\\" CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the warning seemed to be a bit of \\"piling on\\" in light of the sanctions already in place against Penn State. But it may be another factor to further motivate the university to comprehensively deal with the scandal, he said on CNN's \\"Starting Point.\\" \\"It all creates pressure on Penn State to make sure it has policies in place to make sure nothing like this ever happens again,\\" Toobin said.

They can be shared in casual conversations or while participating in games or trivia. Here is a random fact for you: Did you know that honey never spoils? Honey is one of the few natural food substances that has an extremely long shelf-life, primarily due to its antimicrobial and preservative properties. It contains low water content and high acidity, which discourage the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms. Additionally, honey contains a natural enzyme, glucose oxidase, that breaks down glucose to produce hydrogen peroxide, which acts as a natural antimicrobial agent.  During the process of extracting honey from their hives, bees fan their wings to evaporate the water content, making honey even more concentrated. The sugar content in honey also has a preservative effect as it prevents the growth of microbes by drawing water out of them through the process of osmosis.  Historically, honey has been valued for its long-lasting properties as well as its many uses. Archeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still edible! Today, honey is used for more than just a sweetener – it plays a role in medicine, skincare, and cuisine across various cultures worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a title for this article: In January 2009, SEC Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Brenda Murray found that securities industry lawyer Steven Altman had engaged in unethical and improper professional conduct while representing a prospective witness for the Division of Enforcement (“Division”) in a SEC administrative proceeding. In the Matter of Steven Altman, Esq (Initial Decision Release No. 367, Administrative Proceeding File No. 3-12944, January 14, 2009). The ALJ’s Initial Decision sought to deny Altman the privilege of appearing before the SEC for a period of nine months. According to the ALJ’s Initial Decision, in January 2009, Altman was a forty-six year old graduate of Boston University and New York Law School, a member of the New York State Bar, and had been practicing law since 1987. Altman maintained an office in Manhattan where he employed one salaried attorney, who handled the paperwork, while Altman spent his time litigating commercial disputes in courts and before the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD), now known as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Altman did not have an extensive practice before the SEC. Altman was married in 1987 and divorced in 1999. He testified that he provided financial support for three children, and his fiancée and her child with whom he lived. Altman maintained that in January and February 2004, he was working ten to fourteen hours a day, seven days a week, drinking very heavily, and in a contentious relationship with his ex-wife who has custody of his seven year old twins with whom he has a close relationship. On March 30, 2008, Altman admitted himself to a hospital where he was diagnosed with alcohol and cocaine abuse. He left a twenty-eight day program on April 7, 2008, after eight days and began participating in an out-patient program at a different facility. On May 6, 2008, Altman testified that, since April 8, 2008, he had participated in the out-patient program four days a week and has attended meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous daily. The Initial Decision found that Altman offered to have a client evade the Division’s service of a subpoena and/or testify falsely in exchange for a financial package from two respondents in the proceeding. The ALJ further found that Altman did so with scienter, and, as a result of his conduct, he violated Disciplinary Rules (“DR”) 1-102(A)(4), 102(A)(5), and 102(A)(7) of the New York State Bar Association Lawyer’s Code of Professional Responsibility. Pursuant to Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the SEC’s Rules of Practice and Section 4C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the ALJ suspended Altman from appearing or practicing before the SEC for nine months. Nine Months Not Enough Say OGC The SEC’s Office of the General Counsel (“OGC”) appealed the nine-month suspension imposed on Altman in the Initial Decision, and sought an order permanently denying him the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission. According to the SEC, Altman had known Bonnie Rosen since he was in high school and she worked at a local insurance agency. From November 1999 to October 2003, Rosen worked as an administrative assistant with a salary of 60,000 at Nextgen Inc. (“Nextgen”), a company that was owned by Jay Adoni and shared office space with Harrison Securities, Inc. (“Harrison”), a broker-dealer. Nextgen paid Rosen’s salary, but she spent half of her time working for Harrison and its chief executive officer, Frederick C. Blumer, who was Adoni’s close business associate. Sometime in 2003, Rosen called Altman and told him that she had been forced out of her job at Nextgen. Rosen asked Altman for his help in obtaining severance pay from Nextgen and removing her name from two car leases she co-signed for Blumer, who used the cars and paid the leases. Altman testified that he agreed to assist Rosen as a “favor.” Altman twice contacted Adoni and requested that he pay Rosen severance and remove her name from the car leases. On both occasions, Adoni refused the requests. In 2003, the Division instituted administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings against Harrison, Blumer, and Nebrissa Song, alleging violations of the Exchange Act’s books and records, net capital, and financial reporting provisions (hereinafter the “Harrison Proceeding”). Respondents raised as a defense to the books and records charge that they were unable to maintain the firm’s general ledger for certain periods because a computer virus corrupted their files. A hearing in the Harrison Proceeding was held on January 20 through January 26, 2004 and March 8 through 10, 2004. Division Wants to Talk to Rosen On January 26, 2004, Division staff learned from NASD staff that Rosen had called NASD and claimed to have information adverse to Harrison’s and Blumer’s computer virus defense. Division staff hoped, but were not sure, that Rosen would be able to testify that there was no computer virus that compromised Harrison’s files. Division staff also thought that Rosen might be able to testify about Blumer’s accounting practices. Division staff concluded that Rosen might be a good rebuttal witness. Division staff called Rosen on January 28, 2004 and told her that they learned she might have useful information for the Harrison Proceeding. They asked Rosen if she would be willing to meet or speak with them. Rosen expressed some anxiety about testifying. She mentioned to Division staff that she co-signed two car leases for Blumer, and she was concerned that if Blumer was ordered to pay a civil penalty in the Harrison Proceeding, it might increase the likelihood that he would default on the leases and she would have to pay the remaining balance on the leases. Division staff testified that the car leases were not relevant to their case and were not a subject of interest to them, except insofar as the leases might prevent Rosen from testifying in the Harrison Proceeding. Rosen identified Altman as her attorney and referred Division staff to him. Altman Speaks to Division As Rosen’s Lawyer On or about January 28, 2004, Division staff spoke with Altman, who identified himself as Rosen’s legal representative. During the conversation, Division staff described the nature of the Harrison Proceeding, indicated that it was ongoing, and expressed their interest in possibly using Rosen’s testimony as part of their case. Division staff asked Altman if they could interview Rosen. Division staff testified that Altman was “noncommital” about whether Rosen would agree to an interview and said that he would get back to them. Altman asked Division staff who was representing Harrison and Blumer, and they gave him Irving Einhorn’s name. The SEC concluded that Altman first called Einhorn on or about January 28, 2004. In this conversation, Altman told Einhorn that he represented Rosen and that the Division was interested in possibly using her as a witness in the Harrison Proceeding. Altman also told Einhorn that Rosen had left Nextgen under unfavorable circumstances with little or no severance pay; she had worked for Harrison and Blumer; and she was hostile towards them. Altman gave Einhorn an abbreviated version of his discussions with Adoni and said he thought this would be an opportune time to reinvigorate Rosen’s requests for severance pay and removal of her name from the car leases. In his hearing testimony and briefs on appeal, Altman admitted that the Division’s interest in Rosen as a witness gave him some leverage to renew her requests. Einhorn testified that he decided to tape record their subsequent conversations because he believed Altman was engaging in an “extortion attempt” and wanted to protect himself and his clients in the event Rosen testified in the Harrison Proceeding “without being paid off.” Einhorn did not tell Altman that he was taping their conversations, and Altman was unaware that he was being taped. In a taped telephone conversation on February 2, 2004, the following discussion ensued: MR. ALTMAN: I am not going to pull punches with you. They [Division staff] are aware[,] if asked, [Rosen] will testify that there was no virus in the computer,10 and I suspect once they start peeling it away, some other very, very unhelpful stuff with respect to the books and records of the firm – MR. ALTMAN: As I understand it, [b]ased on her personal knowledge, . . . it was a small suite of executive offices that they all sat in. MR. ALTMAN: And that this was not just a professional relationship, it was personal, not, not in any – MR. EINHORN: Not a sexual or intimate way. MR. ALTMAN: Not an intimate way, but a personal basis. And, listen, when you have a 60,000 a year secretary co-signing for cars of a president of a firm, it . . . raises eyebrows initially.11 Frankly, probably all this would have gone away if at least something would have happened,12 but, you know, if that’s Fred’s [Blumer] view, that is — you know, it shouldn’t have gone forward. MR. EINHORN: No, no, no, I am here, Steven, trying to figure out what’s happening here. So, she hasn’t given that testimony? MR. ALTMAN: That’s correct. She is not a registered rep[resentative] so she is not at risk of losing her license if she doesn’t appear any place. MR. EINHORN: Well, suppose she gets a subpoena to appear at the hearing? MR. ALTMAN: Well, you know[,] if she gets served, then, you know, she is going to be [like] any other human being. I, of course, can’t advise her to evade the [subpoena] process, but . . . [m]emory fades and the like.13 And you know[,] I don’t know. MR. EINHORN: So, what you are saying is[,] if they reach some agreement, she would be more favorably inclined? MR. ALTMAN: That would be my guess as to what her recollection would be, you know.14 I don’t have the personal knowledge, and I haven’t done a full debriefing of her. I know Fred, I met him, as he may have told you. MR. EINHORN: Yeah, no, [Fred] told me he likes you. MR. ALTMAN: I like him. He is a nice guy. This is all silly. I hate to see this happen. Really, it would be terrible. MR. ALTMAN: If somebody just does the right thing,15 and MR. EINHORN: But you think they learned about this from others and were pointed to her. They have other people lined up that are MR.ALTMAN: No, no. I don’t think that is the case. MR. EINHORN: You don’t think they have other people coming to testify? MR. ALTMAN: No, no, not with respect to what I talked to you about. MR. ALTMAN: I think if you cut it off with her, then it is closed. 16 That will be[,] you know[,] killing themselves. You can read the additional taped conversations at http://sec.gov/litigation/opinions/2010/34-63306.pdf After the hearing in the Harrison Proceeding, Einhorn withdrew as counsel for Harrison and Blumer and disclosed the tapes to law enforcement authorities. In September 2004, the ALJ in the Harrison Proceeding issued an initial decision finding that Harrison and Blumer had violated the federal securities laws, but that Rosen had been “thoroughly impeached” on cross-examination and was not a reliable witness. The SEC’s Opinon on Appeal Following appeal, the SEC independently reviewed the case and found that Altman had engaged in unethical and improper professional conduct while representing a prospective witness in an SEC administrative proceeding, in violation of state bar disciplinary rules. In a rare move, the SEC permanently denied Altman the privilege of appearing or practicing before the SEC. In the Matter of Steven Altman, Esq, (Securities Exchange Act Of 1934 Rel. No. 63306 / Admin. Proc. File No. 3-12944, November 10, 2010). On December 9, 2010, the Courthouse News Service (CNS) published an article titled: Attorney Declares War on SEC. The CNS story states that Attorney Steven Altman sued the SEC in Federal Court, claiming the agency “has wrongfully sought to ‘federalize’ the subject of attorney ethics discipline” – a function of state judiciaries – by its Nov. 10 order permanently barring him from “appearing or practicing (law) before the Commission.” According to CNS, Altman claims that “there is absolutely no statutory authority granting the Commission to unilaterally apply part or even all of the New York State Disciplinary Rules to anyone.” Moreover, the lawyer does not view his action as an appeal of the SEC’s Opinion and Order but rather a “facial attack on the Commission’s jurisdiction to bring the [underlying] proceeding.” CNS says that Altman argues that he has been “vilified by the Commission and in effect been accused of being and found to be unfit to practice law at all, a conclusion which is not in any way supported by and contrary to his record.” Altman alleges that the SEC’s action was an ”unconstitutional usurpation of the New York State Disciplinary Rules,” and he concludes that such improper action violated his right to equal protection, due process and privacy. Altman seeks to enjoin the SEC’s Order against him. Altman’s Complaint pointedly dismisses the nature of his legal action against the SEC as an “appeal,” but characterizes it as seeking declaratory, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief against the SEC; and further seeking an Order of Mandamus directing the vacatur and stay of proceedings, decisions, and orders. Further, Altman’s Complaint asserts that the SEC’s proceedings, decisions, and orders against him constituted the first instance in which the SEC has disciplined a lawyer solely for allegations of New York State’s disciplinary rules without a prior hearing, determination or even charges brought against that lawyer by or under the New York State disciplinary procedures. In explaining the extent of damage he has sustained as a result of the SEC’s action, Altman’s Complaint states that: Plaintiff’s reputation as a lawyer is his stock and trade.

Question: how does gilgamesh consequently view his immortality Suggestion: The Epic of Gilgamesh, an epic poem from Mesopotamia , is amongst the earliest surviving works of literature . The answer to this question is:","output":"False. The suggested answer provided does not directly address the question about how Gilgamesh consequently views his immortality. Instead, the suggestion simply provides general information about \\"The Epic of Gilgamesh\\" being one of the earliest surviving works of literature from Mesopotamia.  To give a more accurate and relevant answer to the question, we can dive into how Gilgamesh's viewpoint on immortality changes throughout the story:  Gilgamesh, the king of Uruk and the protagonist of the epic, initially desires immortality due to his fear of death and overwhelming pride in his accomplishments. However, after witnessing the death of his friend Enkidu and encountering several trials during his quest for immortality, Gilgamesh begins to understand the limitations and reality of human life. Ultimately, Gilgamesh encounters Utnapishtim, a mortal who had been granted immortality by the gods. Utnapishtim shares with Gilgamesh the story of the great flood and how he attained immortality. Utnapishtim then presents an opportunity for Gilgamesh to obtain immortality by passing a test of sleeplessness. Gilgamesh fails the test and realizes that immortality is unattainable for mortals. In the end, Gilgamesh begins to accept his mortality and learns to appreciate his achievements and life in Uruk. He comes to understand that immortality is not granted to humans, and that they can only achieve a form of immortality through their lasting accomplishments and impact on others. Therefore, the correct answer to the question \\"how does Gilgamesh consequently view his immortality\\" would be: Gilgamesh learns to accept his mortality and realizes that humans can achieve a form of immortality through their lasting accomplishments, rather than pursuing literal immortality."},{"instruction":"Question: What treatment is Matthew undergoing? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Haunting in Connecticut Context: In 1987, Sara Campbell (Virginia Madsen) is driving her son Matthew (Kyle Gallner) home from the hospital where he has been undergoing cancer treatments. Sara and her husband Peter (Martin Donovan), a recovering alcoholic, discuss finding a rental house closer to the hospital. On another hospital visit, Sara finds a man putting up a âFor Rentâ sign in front of a large house. The man is frustrated and offers her the first month free if she will rent it immediately. The following day, Peter arrives with Matt's brother Billy (Ty Wood) and cousins Wendy (Amanda Crew) and Mary, and they choose rooms. Matt chooses the basement, where there is a mysterious door. After moving in, Matt suffers a series of visions involving an old, bearded man and corpses with symbols carved into their skin. The next day, Peter learns that the house was supposedly a funeral home; the room behind the mysterious door is a mortuary. Matt tells another patient, Reverend Nicholas Popescu (Elias Koteas), about the visions. Nicholas advises him to find out what the spirit wants. Later, Matt finds a burned figure in his room who begins to move toward him. When the family comes home, they find a shirtless Matt with his fingers blood-covered from scratching at the wall. The family begins to crack under the stress of Matt's illness and bizarre behavior. The children find a box of photographs, which show Jonah, a young man from Matt's visions, at a sÃ©ance, emitting ectoplasm. Wendy and Matt find out that the funeral home was run by a man named Ramsey Aickman. Aickman also conducted psychic research and would host sÃ©ances with Jonah as the medium. At one sÃ©ance, all those attending, including Aickman, were found dead and Jonah disappeared.

Available choices: (A). good (B). upset (C). glad the ice was broken The answer is:","output":"To determine how Austin would feel after breaking the ice, let's examine each option step by step: 1. Evaluating option (A) \\"good\\": Austin took the initiative to break the silence and engaged the group in conversation. This action might make him feel good because he stepped up and contributed to a more comfortable atmosphere. The context supports this choice, so this is a possible answer. 2. Evaluating option (B) \\"upset\\": There's no indication in the context that Austin would be upset after breaking the ice. Instead, it seems that he would be more likely to feel positive emotions after helping the group break the silence and start conversing. Hence, it doesn't align with the context; this option can be ruled out. 3. Evaluating option (C) \\"glad the ice was broken\\": Austin might feel relieved or glad after breaking the ice. This reaction would make sense in the context, as he facilitated a smoother group dynamic by breaking the quiet. The context supports this choice, so this is another possible answer. Now that we've evaluated all options, let's compare the remaining possible answers: Comparing (A) \\"good\\" and (C) \\"glad the ice was broken\\": Both options imply that Austin would feel positive emotions after breaking the ice. However, choice (C) is more specific in stating the reason for his emotions: he's glad that the ice was broken and the group is now more engaged in conversation. Consequently, this option better captures Austin's feelings in the context provided. Therefore, the answer is: (C). glad the ice was broken."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Then there was a scraping sound, the ship began to list to one side and a panicked evacuation began. One year ago, on January 13, 2012, the Costa Concordia struck rocks and turned on its side off the Italian island of Giglio, killing 32 people and shaking an industry that prefers to be known for fun in the sun and endless entertainment. Capt. Francesco Schettino may be indicted in the next few weeks on charges that include manslaughter and abandoning ship before his passengers, and other Concordia executives and crewmembers may also face trial.

Captain Schettino and several other crew members are eventually found guilty of various charges, including manslaughter and abandoning ship. They face long prison sentences, and their cases serve as a reminder of the responsibilities that come with being in charge of a ship and the lives of those on board.

The victim's families and survivors are awarded compensation for their losses and trauma, but the emotional scars left by the disaster linger. The cruise industry makes a concerted effort to rebuild its reputation, emphasizing safety and responsible practices to regain the trust of the public. Throughout all of this, the world remembers the Costa Concordia tragedy as a somber reminder of the importance of following safety procedures and valuing human life above all else.

Are these two questions asking the same thing? Select from: *no *yes","output":"Yes, both questions are essentially asking the same thing, which is about anger management and developing patience. Anger management is crucial for maintaining healthy relationships and overall mental well-being. Controlling anger and cultivating patience involves recognizing the triggers and developing appropriate coping mechanisms. Here are several strategies to control anger and develop patience: 1. Self-awareness: Understand the situations and emotions that trigger anger. Make a note of these situations and try to develop a plan to cope with them. 2. Take a break: When you feel anger building up, give yourself a moment to pause. Step away from the situation if possible, allowing yourself to cool down and reassess. 3. Practice deep breathing: Focusing on your breath helps you remain calm in stressful situations. Slow, deep breaths can help lower the heart rate and induce relaxation. 4. Use visualization: Picturing yourself in a calm and serene environment can help you develop a sense of peace and build patience. 5. Engage in physical activity: Exercise can help release pent-up emotions such as anger and frustration. Participate in activities like walking, jogging, or yoga to keep both your mind and body healthy. 6. Acknowledge and accept the feeling: Recognize that anger is a natural and common emotion. Confront and accept it, but do not let it control your actions. 7. Seek support: Discuss your anger-related concerns with trusted friends, family members, or a professional therapist. They can help you better manage your emotions and develop healthy coping strategies. 8. Establish clear communication: Express your feelings assertively, but not aggressively. Speak calmly and honestly about your emotions, using \\"I\\" statements. 9. Practice empathy: Consider other people's feelings and try to understand where they are coming from. This can help you develop patience and tolerance for others. 10. Set realistic expectations: Establish reasonable expectations for yourself and others, understanding that everyone has limitations. Accept that some things are beyond your control. 11. Apply problem-solving skills: Analyze the situation and identify possible solutions. Actively working towards a solution will decrease anger and increase patience. 12. Learn relaxation techniques: Apart from deep breathing, other relaxation techniques include meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness. Engage in these on a regular basis to help keep anger at bay. Remember that controlling anger and developing patience is an ongoing process. It will require consistent effort and practice to develop and maintain these skills. By incorporating these strategies into your daily life, you will be well equipped to manage anger effectively and foster positive relationships with yourself and others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A more appropriate answer would involve the tasks and considerations Jordan had to undertake prior to contacting Taylor's grandparents about the surprise party plans. Some possible valid answers to the question could include: 1. Plan the surprise party: Before calling Taylor's grandparents, Jordan would need to have a concrete idea of what the surprise party would entail. This could involve deciding on a date, time, and location, as well as determining the guest list. 2. Coordinate with others: Jordan might have needed to consult with close friends and family members to help with party planning, ensuring that the surprise party would align with everyone's schedules and preferences. 3. Determine party details: Before calling Taylor's grandparents, Jordan would need to consider various aspects of the party, such as the theme, decorations, food and drinks, activities or entertainment, and any budget constraints. 4.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Options are: I. no. II. yes.","output":"Yes, these two questions are inquiring about the same information. Quora, a popular question and answer platform, has implemented a word limit for questions and question descriptions for several reasons. The following factors contribute to the rationale behind Quora's decision to enforce these restrictions: 1. Clarity: Concise questions tend to be clearer and easier to understand. By imposing a word limit, Quora encourages users to focus on the essential components of their queries, ensuring that the questions posed are easy to read and comprehend. In turn, this facilitates more accurate responses from individuals who possess relevant knowledge or expertise in the subject matter. 2. User Experience: Restricting the length of questions and descriptions on Quora significantly improves the platform's user experience. By presenting brief, succinct questions, users can quickly scan and identify the topics that interest them or those to which they can contribute valuable insights. This increases user engagement, participation, and satisfaction on the platform. 3. Maintain Focused Conversations: Another critical aspect of implementing a word limit on Quora is the ability to maintain focused conversations around specific topics. By encouraging users to keep their questions concise and to the point, the platform minimizes the likelihood of numerous branching or unrelated discussions, which can often lead to confusion and dilute the value of the information exchange. As a result, Quora can better fulfill its role as an efficient knowledge-sharing platform. 4. Demands on Attention: In today's fast-paced and information-saturated world, people often have limited attention spans. Long and verbose questions have the potential to lose a reader's interest, leading them to bypass the question or miss essential details. By setting a word limit on questions and descriptions, Quora ensures that its platform remains engaging and accessible to a diverse user base. 5. Quality Control: A word limit encourages users to prioritize the quality of their questions over quantity. It discourages the use of excessive information or irrelevant details that could potentially derail a discussion or dilute the question's primary focus. This emphasis on quality helps ensure that Quora remains an effective platform for knowledge exchange. In summary, the word limit for questions and question descriptions on Quora contributes significantly to the platform's functionality and user experience. Through these restrictions, Quora promotes concise, clear, and relevant questions that foster targeted and meaningful conversations among members of its community."},{"instruction":"Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Fright Night Part II begins after the hellish events in the original Fright Night.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many in percent from the census weren't English?","output":"Writing an article commenting on the percentage of non-English individuals as per a census requires archaeological data from a specific census as a basis. Without such data, creating an accurate and informative response is difficult. Let's assume we're exploring the US census data as an example for this article. Due to the lack of targeted census data, the results might differ.  Title: Linguistic Diversity in the United States: A Closer Look at the Census The United States of America (USA), known as a melting pot of cultural and linguistic diversity, attracts immigrants from different corners of the globe in search of better opportunities and quality of life. According to recent U.S. Census Bureau data, the percentage of people who do not speak English at home is comparatively substantial, presenting a succinct snapshot of the USA's increasingly multilingual population. Before delving into the numbers, it's essential to acknowledge that the Census Bureau asks respondents their proficiency in English as well, which helps differentiate between those who do not primarily speak English at home but are still fluent in the language, and those who lack English proficiency altogether.  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2018, it was reported that 21.6% of the American resident population (over 5 years of age) didn't use English as their primary language at home. This amounted to approximately 67.3 million people, a significant increase from a decade earlier. This same data set reported that 8.5% of the population claimed they spoke English less than \\"very well,\\" implying a substantial group of residents may struggle with English, even if it isn't their primary language at home. These figures represent several multilingual communities in the USA, including Spanish, Chinese (including Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, Arabic, French, and Korean. First on this list is the Spanish-speaking community, which represents about 62% of the non-English speaking population. Chinese is the second most spoken non-English language, with approximately 2.9 million speakers in the US. The Tagalog-speaking population is nearly 1.7 million, and the Vietnamese community is about 1.5 million. These communities are followed by around 1.2 million French speakers and 1.1 million Korean language speakers in the United States.  Comparatively, the percentage of non-English speakers may seem small but it’s an undeniable and growing part of US society. Without adequate language resources and integration efforts, these communities may find it challenging to connect with mainstream services, and the broader community as a whole.  In conclusion, while English remains the dominant language in the United States, a considerable percentage of the population speaks a different language at home. The census data paints a picture of a country that is linguistically diverse. With the increasing globalization, the number and proportion of non-English speakers are likely to continue growing, hence making it essential for public services to encompass such diversity in their services and programs. Keep in mind that the data will vary depending on the country and the particular census year. For example, the linguistic make-up of Canada or the United Kingdom would be significantly different, as would the data on today's United States compared with 50 years ago. Therefore, it's vital to specify a particular census and country when discussing the linguistic data pulled from it to produce accurate conclusions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Four weeks later, U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller and his platoon check a warehouse for Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. To Miller's surprise, the warehouse has not been secured, with looters making their way in and out, as soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division are too few to do much. After a firefight with a sniper, Miller finds that the warehouse is empty, the third consecutive time an official mission has led to a dead end. Later, at a debriefing, Miller brings up the point that the majority of the intel given to him is inaccurate and anonymous. High-ranking officials quickly dismiss his concerns. Afterward, CIA agent Martin Brown tells him that the next place he is to search was inspected by a UN team two months prior and that it too has been confirmed empty. Meanwhile, U.S. Department of Defense official Clark Poundstone welcomes returning Iraqi exile politician Ahmed Zubaidi at the airport. There Poundstone is questioned by Wall Street Journal reporter Lawrie Dayne. She says she needs to speak directly to \\"Magellan\\", but Poundstone brushes her off.  answer the following question:  What is the rank of the person whose signal Seyyed must wait for? A:","output":"The rank of the person whose signal Seyyed must wait for is General, as Iraqi General Mohammed Al-Rawi is the one who instructed Seyyed to warn his officers and wait for his signal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

London's defences were rapidly reorganised by General Pile, the Commander-in-Chief of Anti-Aircraft Command. The difference this made to the effectiveness of air defences is questionable. The British were still one-third below the establishment of heavy anti-aircraft artillery AAA (or ack-ack) in May 1941, with only 2,631 weapons available. Dowding had to rely on night fighters. From 1940 to 1941, the most successful night-fighter was the Boulton Paul Defiant; its four squadrons shot down more enemy aircraft than any other type. AA defences improved by better use of radar and searchlights. Over several months, the 20,000 shells spent per raider shot down in September 1940, was reduced to 4,087 in January 1941 and to 2,963 shells in February 1941.

Once you've defeated Team Galactic and your party is ready, you can head to Lake Verity and cause Mesprit to appear. Flying to Twinleaf Town is the quickest way to get to the lake. You'll find the Verity Cavern entrance in the middle of the lake. You'll see Mesprit in the center of the room. It will look like the battle is about to start, and then Mesprit will run away before it begins. Professor Rowan will inform you that Mesprit is now roaming throughout Sinnoh, and that you can track it on the map. Roaming Pokémon like Mesprit will change locations every time you move between locations. This can make tracking them down difficult, but there's a trick you can use to speed it up. Walking between these two locations is the most effective way to encounter a roaming Pokémon due to the close proximity of tall grass on each side and the low level wild Pokemon. Each time you walk from one location to the other, Mesprit will move to a new location in Sinnoh. You can see its current location flashing on your Marking Map in the lower screen. Mesprit's movements are random, so you may have to go back and forth many times until you're both in the same spot. Once you've changed locations and Mesprit is in the same location you are, use a Repel so that you don't encounter any other Pokemon. If you encounter another Pokémon or start a battle with a trainer, Mesprit will move and you'll have to start over. Save before attempting to encounter Mesprit so you can quickly try again if you accidentally mess up. Since you're using a Repel, you won't encounter any Pokémon lower than your first Pokemon's level. This will prevent you from encountering any of the wild Pokémon in these two areas. If your first Pokémon is over level 50, the Repel will prevent you from encountering Mesprit. Summary:","output":"After defeating Team Galactic and preparing your party, head to Lake Verity to encounter Mesprit, who becomes a roaming Pokémon through Sinnoh, making it challenging to catch; use the Marking Map to track its location, walk between areas with tall grass, utilize Repel to avoid other encounters, and save beforehand for a successful attempt."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:You are given a new situation: Frank and Noah were two researchers. Noah researched the climate of Antarctica, while Frank researched the climate changes of Madagascar and the Southern tip of Africa.  and a hint : Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

He cocked his head. “What do you mean?” I had no idea—on a conscious level—what I was asking for, just that I felt in a desperate sense that the self I knew was slipping away. An inability to recognize myself either in my writing or in reflecting upon my own actions was taking over. And then…? I didn't care. I wanted to kiss girls. Which is fine—just not something I ordinarily do. I wanted to drink, smoke. Again, fine—but not something I ordinarily do. “Do I seem…okay?” I asked a colleague at work. A woman I barely knew. Insanely, I thought that since she worked with disabled students, many of whom struggled with mental illness, she would know mania when she saw it. This was a rather foolish assumption—especially since she's an educator, not a psychiatrist, especially with how skilled I am at wearing the mask of calm, the face of sanity. “You seem great, Julie. Cheery. Professional as always.” I let her reassurance placate me. Wanted to be placated. Yet, within months I lost my job. And not only that, but a chance at a scholarship, two really important long term friendships—relationships I'd enjoyed since high school. I was hospitalized three times between September and February. I lost my ability to trust myself, lost my mind. It is now a little over two years since I first felt that sliding. Twenty-six months since I knew that somewhere in the deepest parts of who I am, I was slipping. Nine seasons since I begged Dr. Poe, “Remember me to myself!” I'm still recuperating. Yes.

If any of you have seen the quote from Ben Jones, that it is a \\"sleazy\\" piece of trash, he is quite right. Why they would take a wonderful television show, which I loved, have never missed an episode, and own seasons 1-4 on DVD, and ruin it, I'll never know. The television show was a family show, and although Daisy has the body, it was really flaunted, or even addressed in the show, save the outfits. A family show has been turned in to a dirty piece of garbage, and I wouldn't recommend anyone go see it. Another thing I didn't like was that John Schneider and Tom Wopat are excellent actors (along with the rest of the original cast), and they are also extremely cute. The new Bo and Luke are not even a little cute. That was one of the drawers for the show. The casting is terrible. They could have at least gotten a brunette for Daisy. I don't think Burt Reynolds is a qualified Boss Hogg, either. Every other role he has ever played is totally opposite this role. The only role they cast halfway decent is Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, but still it is no comparison. Denver Pyle is an actor all his own, and that made him perfect for the role. I think that the casting is awful, the story is awful, and all in all ruined a wonderful show and turned it into a dirty, terrible movie. I wouldn't recommend anyone go see it.

Hypothesis: It was, Julius added, very tragic. Step 2: Identify the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis The premise provides information about an event, where a doctor seems to be kidding himself about a woman taking something herself (possibly medication). Julius is the one who conveys this information, and also dryly comments on the situation. The hypothesis provides information about Julius' additional comment, where he states that the situation was tragic.

It is important to note that Julius is the same person who provides both pieces of information. Step 4: Decide whether the premise implies the hypothesis In this case, if we assume that the premise is true (i.e., the doctor kidded himself), we can conclude that Julius believes the situation to be tragic. However, the truth of the premise alone doesn't guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. The reason is that determining whether something is tragic or not may depend on other factors or perspectives. The premise doesn't directly state that the situation is tragic; it only describes the doctor's thoughts and Julius providing that information. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is Julius' view of the situation. So, although Julius' opinion might be influenced by the premise, it isn't necessarily true that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true. The hypothesis could be true, but it would require additional information or perspectives to make a definite conclusion.

Incorrect CBD S file association errors can occur when your computer's operating system doesn't properly associate a file type with a specific program or application. This can lead to difficulties when trying to open a file, as the system may not know which program to use, or it may try to open the file with an incompatible program. These errors can be indicative of other underlying issues within your Windows operating system that require resolution. There are several steps you can take to address incorrect CBD S file association errors and their related issues: 1. Update your software: Ensure that you have the latest version of the software associated with the file type. Developers frequently release updates and patches to fix compatibility issues, so keeping your software up-to-date may help resolve the issue. 2. Check the file association settings: Ensure that the correct program is set as the default for opening the specific file type. You can do this by right-clicking on the problematic file, selecting \\"Open with,\\" and then choosing the appropriate program from the list or browsing for it on your computer. 3. Run a system registry scan: Incorrect file associations can sometimes be a result of corrupted or missing registry entries.

With the highly-anticipated showdown less than two weeks away, candidates with low polling numbers are in a high-stakes scramble to qualify for an event that represents their best shot at breaking out.      Fox News is capping the Aug. 6 debate in Cleveland at 10 candidates based on five as-of-yet unspecified national polls released by 5 p.m. on Aug. 4.      ADVERTISEMENT      Based on five polls used by RealClearPolitics (RCP), eight candidates look like locks to make the stage, while the race for the final two slots is headed for a controversial photo finish. For the candidates currently ranked between ninth place and 14th place, the polling differential is negligible.      “It’s a roll of the dice,” said Monmouth University polling director Patrick Murray. “It’s going to come down to the vagaries of how independent pollsters round off their results — we’re talking tenths of decimal points. It could come down to the five or six people who didn’t pick up their phones for a national survey and the five or six people who did.”      New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry James (Rick) Richard PerryTexas New Members 2019 Senate should reject Trump’s radical nominee to key energy panel Perry: We shouldn't let Russia use energy as a weapon MORE, businesswoman Carly Fiorina, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal are separated by only 1.5 percentage points, according to the RCP national average at the end of last week.      Christie looks to be in the best shape of the bunch, sitting in 9th place with 2.8 percent support. Perry and Kasich are tied for 10th with 1.8 percent support, followed by Fiorina and Santorum at 1.4 percent, and Jindal at 1.2. (By contrast, the lowest of the top eight, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), has 5.4 percent support; the highest, Donald Trump, has 18.2 percent.)      Getting left out of the first debate would be a significant blow to all of their prospects.      “It’s extremely important to be out there,” said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean. “If you’re not there, it’s out-of-sight-out-of-mind for voters, and just as importantly right now, for your fundraising efforts.”      For Christie and Santorum, missing the debate would put a spotlight on how far their stars have fallen.      Christie was once flying high in the polls. As early as last year he was considered by many a favorite to win the nomination. And Santorum is the most recent winner of the Iowa caucuses, having emerged in 2012 as the primary challenger to eventual nominee Mitt Romney.      Meanwhile, Kasich risks being frozen out of a debate that will take place in a state where he’s the sitting governor. For Perry, it would mean a missed opportunity for redemption after a mortifying brain-freeze on the debate stage essentially ended his presidential run in 2012.      A spot on the debate stage could legitimize Fiorina’s outsider bid while allowing her to showcase her much-lauded skills as a communicator. And some Republicans believe Jindal’s firebrand conservatism could catch on in Iowa, if only he could get the exposure.      It’s setting up as a dogfight among the campaigns to boost their standing nationally ahead of the debates. It means weighing the return on investment of spending early in an attempt to make the debate, versus mapping out a longer-term strategy.      “We’ve never seen anything like this,” said GOP strategist David Payne. “These candidates who are not polling well are forced to spend early money for national ad buys, while the earned media pathway is complicated by Donald Trump, who is costing every other candidate a chance to get in front of the camera. It’s a challenge.”      The campaign strategies for how the candidates plan to address that challenge are coming into view.      Christie’s campaign is betting big that a national advertising push can shore up his standing. This week, the campaign put 250,000 behind ads that will run on Fox News. The New Jersey governor is also getting an assist from a supporting super-PAC, which last week put more than 1 million into ads that will run in the Northeast.      Perry is hitching his train to Donald Trump. He has emerged as the most vocal opponent of the businessman and reality TV star, who is riding a media frenzy to the top of the polls. Perry could get a lift from Trump’s media coattails.      In addition, the former Texas governor is getting help from the well-funded super-PACs backing his bid. The Opportunity and Freedom PAC has booked nearly 1 million in national ads on conservative TV and radio outlets ahead of the debate.      Austin Barbour, who runs the PAC, noted that Perry tied for seventh in last week’s ABC News-Washington Post poll. “My hope is that we’ll see a couple more polls like that because of this earned media he’s getting off Trump, the speeches he’s giving and what we’ve been doing with paid media.”      Meanwhile, Santorum said at an event in Washington earlier this month that he’d ramp up his media appearances before the debate, and he’s following through. On Wednesday, Santorum did two Fox News hits, appeared on CNN and a Bloomberg online show and finished the day sparring with liberal host Rachel Maddow on MSNBC.      Kasich’s political team says their strategy is to focus on New Hampshire rather than on resources meant to raise his profile nationally. But the Ohio governor’s political team spent significantly on TV ads ahead of his launch and will hope his late entrance into the race is perfectly timed to give him a polling boost heading into August.      Predictably, the complaining over Fox News’s debate standards has picked up in recent days.      Sen.

And if we do fear debates, what business do we have trying to win elections,” wrote Curt Anderson. “The plan to limit the participants in these debates is ridiculous in almost every respect.”      The Louisiana governor has temporarily suspended his campaign to deal with a shooting at a movie theater in Lafayette.      Fox News is holding a one-hour forum for the candidates who don’t qualify for the main event earlier in the day.      “That secondary forum will have a lot of qualified, highly knowledgeable and articulate folks,” said Dave Catalfamo, a spokesperson for former New York Gov. George Pataki, who also barely registers in the polls. “It might end up being more substantive because the candidates won’t have to respond to whatever idiotic thing Donald Trump says.”      But most Republicans view it as a second-tier gathering nonetheless.      “If you’re not in that top 10, you’re not going to be taken as seriously,” said Bonjean. “You risk getting left behind.\\" ||||| Fox News is opening its 5 p.m. debate to all the announced Republican candidates who fail to make the cut for the Aug. 6 prime-time event, removing a requirement that participants reach at least 1 percent in polling.      The change amounts to an insurance policy for candidates who were in danger of being disqualified from the vital first debate based on low polls – Carly Fiorina, former New York Gov. George Pataki and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).      Story Continued Below      The announcement by Michael Clemente, Fox News Executive Vice President, News, means that all 16 announced candidates will qualify for Cleveland — either the 5 p.m. undercard, or the 9 p.m. main event.      The 9 p.m. debate will include the 10 candidates with the highest average in national polls, as determined by Fox News. The 5 p.m. forum will now include all the rest.      According to a POLITICO analysis of the latest national polling, the prime-time participants today would be Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Mike Huckabee, Ben Carson, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Rick Perry.      The next three, who would currently be relegated to 5 p.m., are Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Rick Santorum and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. They are followed by Fiorina, Pataki and Graham.      All of the candidates have been getting extensive Fox airtime. Here’s a tally of the total combined Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network appearances — several for an hour — by each of the hopefuls since their official campaign launches:      1) Paul, 35 … 2) Huckabee, 31 … 3) Trump, 30 … 4) Perry, 24 … 5-6) Fiorina and Jindal, 20 each … 7) Cruz, 17 … 8) Santorum, 16 … 9) Rubio, 14 … 10-11) Carson and Graham, 12 each … 12-13) Kasich and Pataki, 11 each … 14) Christie, 7 … 15) Walker, 4 … 16) Bush, 3.      “Due to the overwhelming interest in the FOX News Facebook Debate Event Night on August 6th and in a concerted effort to include and accommodate the now 16 Republican candidate field — the largest in modern political history — FOX News is expanding participation in the 5 PM/ET debate to all declared candidates whose names are consistently being offered to respondents in major national polls, as recognized by Fox News,” said Clemente in a statement.      “Although we are relaxing one component of our entry criteria – the requirement that candidates must score 1% or higher in an average of five most recent national polls – all other components of the criteria remain in effect for the 5 PM/ET debate. Participants must meet all U.S. Constitutional requirements; must announce and register a formal campaign for president; and must file all necessary paperwork with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), including financial disclosure.      “As for the 9 PM/ET debate, all components of the original criteria remain unchanged – including the requirement that participants must place in the top 10 of an average of the five most recent national polls, as recognized by FOX News, leading up to August 4th at 5PM/ET. Such polling must be conducted by major, nationally recognized organizations that use standard methodological techniques.      “Everyone included in these debates has a chance to be President of the United States and we look forward to showcasing all of the candidates in the first primary event of the 2016 election season.”      The 5 p.m. debate, which will last an hour, will be moderated by Bill Hemmer and Martha MacCallum. The 9 p.m. debate will run about 90 minutes (two hours with commercial breaks and introductions), and be moderated by Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace.      Follow @politico ||||| What is a summary?","output":"The first Republican debate is less than two weeks away and the race is on for the final spots on stage, especially for those candidates with low polling numbers. Fox News is capping the August 6 debate at 10 candidates and based on five polls by RealClearPolitics, eight candidates look like they will make the stage while the others will have a photo finish. This event represents their best chance to break out, therefore it's creating a high-stakes scramble to qualify for those with low polling numbers."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She began her acting career in 2001, with several minor television and film roles, and played a regular role on the Hope & Faith television sitcom. In 2004, she made her film debut with a role in the teen comedy Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen. In 2007, she co-starred as Mikaela Banes, the love interest of Shia LaBeouf's character, in the blockbuster action film Transformers, which became her breakout role. Fox was born on May 16, 1986 in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Her parents are Gloria Darlene (Cisson) and Franklin Thomas Fox. Fox's father, a parole officer, and her mother divorced when Fox was three years old. Her mother later remarried, and Fox and her sister were raised by her mother and her stepfather, Tony Tonachio. She was raised \\"very strictly Pentecostal\\", but later attended Catholic school for 12 years. Fox's parents divorced when she was young. She said that the two were \\"very strict\\" and that she was not allowed to have a boyfriend or invite friends to her house. She lived with her mother until she made enough money to support herself.  Fox began her training in dance and drama at age five, in Kingston, Tennessee. She attended a dance class at the community center there and was involved in Kingston Elementary School's chorus and the Kingston Clippers swim team. At 10 years of age, after moving to St. Petersburg, Florida, Fox continued her training. When she was 13 years old, Fox began modeling after winning several awards at the 1999 American Modeling and Talent Convention in Hilton Head, South Carolina. At age 17, she tested out of school via correspondence in order to move to Los Angeles, California.  Fox has spoken extensively of her time in education; that in middle school she was bullied; consequently she ate lunch in the bathroom to avoid being \\"pelted with ketchup packets\\". She said that the problem was not her looks, but that she had \\"always gotten along better with boys\\" and that \\"rubbed some people the wrong way\\". Fox also said of high school that she was never popular and that \\"everyone hated me, and I was a total outcast, my friends were always guys, I have a very aggressive personality, and girls didn't like me for that. I've had only one great girlfriend my whole life\\". In the same interview, she mentions that she hated school and has \\"never been a big believer in formal education\\" and that \\"the education I was getting seemed irrelevant. So, I was sort of checked out on that part of it\\". Where did she get her education?","output":"Megan Fox got her education in different places.

Sentence 1: The four largest ethnicities reported in the town are 29% Irish, 16% German, 11% English, and 7% Italian. Sentence 2: The four largest ethnic groups reported in the town are 29% Irish, 16% German, 11% English, and 7% Italian. Step 2: Analyze the structure and the words used in the sentences. Both sentences have the same structure and follow the same pattern: \\"The four largest ____ reported in the town are 29% Irish, 16% German, 11% English, and 7% Italian.\\" The only different words in the sentences are \\"ethnicities\\" in the first sentence and \\"ethnic groups\\" in the second. Step 3: Understand the meaning of the different words. The term \\"ethnicities\\" refers to categories or groups of people who identify with each other on the basis of shared attributes like nationality, culture, language, or history.  The term \\"ethnic groups\\" also refers to categories of people who identify with each other due to shared attributes such as culture, language, or history. Step 4: Compare the meanings of the words in the context of the sentences. In the context of these sentences, both \\"ethnicities\\" and \\"ethnic groups\\" are used to categorize people based on their cultural, historical, or national characteristics. The exact percentages of the four groups (Irish, German, English, and Italian) reported in the town are exactly the same in both sentences.

He alleges that Mark Dobson, a HBOS manager who was jailed, helped destroy his business called Unique Group. Mr Edmonds's lawyers have written to Antonio Horta-Osorio, chief executive of HBOS owner Lloyds, seeking payment. Two former employees at HBOS's Reading office were part of a £245m loans scam that cheated small business customers by insisting that they use a specific turnaround firm. The HBOS managers were then compensated with bribes including cash and prostitutes. They were eventually jailed along with four other people involved in the scam. Lloyds subsequently set up a £100m fund to compensate 64 victims of the fraud. Mr Edmonds's lawyer Jonathan Coad, from Keystone Law, said he would be pressing for half that amount to go to his client. \\"We expect half of the £100m to go to my client, and we expect Lloyds will have to increase their provision substantially,\\" Mr Coad said. Lloyds has said it would increase the amount of compensation if a review found that to be necessary. The letter to Mr Horta-Osorio says that Mr Edmonds' \\"reputation as a successful business entrepreneur was destroyed by humiliating media coverage of the collapse of his business empire\\". Mr Edmonds confirmed that his lawyers had sent a letter. He said: \\"I am now trusting that Mr Horta-Osorio is true to his word and ensures that I am 'fairly, swiftly and appropriately' compensated for both the destruction of my businesses and the significant damage to my reputation. \\"If he is not, then I will pursue my claim against Lloyds via the courts.\\" His lawyer said Mr Edmonds had litigation funding in place should legal action proceed.

Q:Information:  - The Notting Hill Carnival is an annual event that has taken place since 1966 on the streets of Notting Hill, and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, London, England, each August over two days (the August bank holiday Monday and the preceding Sunday). It is led by members of the British West Indian community, and attracts around one million people annually, making it one of the world's largest street festivals, and a significant event in British culture. In 2006, the UK public voted it onto the list of icons of England. Despite its name, it is not part of the global Carnival season preceding Lent.  - The Elim Pentecostal Church is a UK-based Pentecostal Christian denomination.  - Portobello Road is a street in the Notting Hill district of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in west London. It runs almost the length of Notting Hill from south to north, roughly parallel with Ladbroke Grove. On Saturdays it is home to Portobello Road Market, one of London's notable street markets, known for its second-hand clothes and antiques. Every August since 1996, the Portobello Film Festival has been held in locations around Portobello Road.  - Kensington Temple is a large Pentecostal church in the Notting Hill area of London , England . It is pastored by Reverend Colin Dye , and is the largest church in its denomination , the Elim Pentecostal Church .  - A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity, identified by traits such as a name, organisation, leadership and doctrine. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church or sometimes fellowship. Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine; issues such as the nature of Jesus, the authority of apostolic succession, eschatology, and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations  often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties  are sometimes known as \\"branches of Christianity\\" or \\"denominational families\\".  - Notting Hill is an affluent district in West London, located north of Kensington within the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea as well as Westminster. Notting Hill is known for being a cosmopolitan neighbourhood, hosting the annual Notting Hill Carnival and Portobello Road Market.  - Carnival (see other spellings and names) is a Western Christian festive season that occurs before the liturgical season of Lent. The main events typically occur during February or early March, during the period historically known as Shrovetide (or Pre-Lent). Carnival typically involves a public celebration and/or parade combining some elements of a circus, masks, and a public street party. People wear masks and costumes during many such celebrations, allowing them to lose their everyday individuality and experience a heightened sense of social unity. Excessive consumption of alcohol, meat, and other foods proscribed during Lent is extremely common. Other common features of carnival include mock battles such as food fights; social satire and mockery of authorities; the grotesque body displaying exaggerated features, especially large noses, bellies, mouths, and phalli, or elements of animal bodies; abusive language and degrading acts; depictions of disease and gleeful death; and a general reversal of everyday rules and norms.

Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What mountains range does the high mountain pass through at an elevation of 6820 ft that has part of the Interstate Highway System that runs from San Diego, California, to Sweetgrass, Montana ? Answer:","output":"The mountain range that the high mountain pass goes through at an elevation of 6820 feet, which is part of the Interstate Highway System running from San Diego, California, to Sweetgrass, Montana, is the Rocky Mountain Range. The Rocky Mountains, also known as the Rockies, span a vast area of the United States and Canada, stretching more than 3,000 miles in length. They are a significant geographical feature in North America, contributing to the unique topography and ecosystems of the continent. Within the United States, the Rocky Mountains extend through Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. The specific mountain pass that reaches 6820 feet in elevation is found along the Interstate 15 (I-15) highway, which is the primary Interstate Highway System route that spans from San Diego, California to Sweetgrass, Montana. The section of I-15 going through the Rocky Mountains in Montana is referred to as the Montana Rockies. Within the Montana portion of the range, several high mountain passes contribute to the overall elevation and landscape. One of the most significant passes in this region is the MacDonald Pass, located west of Helena, Montana, on the Continental Divide. The elevation at the summit of the pass is approximately 6,312 feet. Additionally, the Elk Park Pass to the north of Butte, Montana, also features an elevation of around 6,377 feet. While these elevations are slightly lower than the requested 6820 feet, they illustrate the varied terrain and altitude changes that can be found within the Rocky Mountain Range along I-15. As the Interstate Highway System traverses the Rocky Mountains along I-15, it allows for immense opportunities to experience the diverse scenery and natural beauty of the region. Travelers are afforded the chance to explore a variety of landscapes, ranging from arid deserts in the south, to dense forests, snow-capped peaks, and countless valleys and plateaus characteristic of the Rocky Mountain Range. Apart from the spectacular vistas, the Rocky Mountains along the I-15 also serve as a host to diverse flora and fauna. This region is home to numerous national parks, such as Glacier National Park and Yellowstone National Park, which protect habitats for iconic North American species such as grizzly bears, wolves, elk, bighorn sheep, and mountain goats. In conclusion, the mountain range in which the high mountain pass at an elevation of 6820 feet lies, forming part of the Interstate Highway System running from San Diego, California, to Sweetgrass, Montana, is none other than the expansive and majestic Rocky Mountain Range. The mountain passes found along I-15 throughout the Rockies reveal the sheer magnitude and magnificent diversity of this remarkable landscape."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Public Policy Polling released Sunday had the Crist and Scott at 44% each.

Heimskringla, Fagrskinna and Morkinskinna all describe the period up to the year 1177, although the parts of Morkinskinna that are preserved only extend to 1157. These three sagas were written c. 1220-1230, and in using them as historical sources, it has to be remembered that they were thus written a fair amount of time after the events they describe. However, they are likely to have been based on earlier works, in particular the saga Hryggjarstykki, written c. 1150, which is lost to us, but was available to the authors of the three aforementioned sagas. Ágrip af Noregs konunga sögum also describes the civil war era, but has only been preserved up to the events of c. 1136. The period 1177 to 1240  is treated in detail in contemporaneous sagas: Sverris saga  the Bagler sagas  and Håkon Håkonsson's saga . These sagas were written very shortly after the events they describe. However, as they don't overlap, we are given only one version of events , and this version tends to be from the viewpoint of the main character of the saga. From the later part of the period, fragments of documentation start to appear. The oldest Norwegian royal letter which is preserved was made out by Philippus the bagler king. Also, a couple of runic inscriptions written by central figures survive: A rune letter, probably written by King Sverre's son, Sigurd Lavard c. 1200 has been found during excavations in Bergen, and an inscription by Magnus Erlingsson's brother, Sigurd Erlingsson Jarlsson, dated 18 June 1194, has been preserved from a portal of the now dismantled Vinje stave church.

Given the below context:  By 1957 Grainger's physical health had markedly declined, as had his powers of concentration. Nevertheless, he continued to  visit Britain regularly; in May of that year he made his only television appearance, in a BBC \\"Concert Hour\\" programme when  he played \\"Handel in the Strand\\" on the piano. Back home, after  further surgery  he recovered sufficiently to undertake a modest winter concerts season. On his 1958 visit to England he met Benjamin Britten, the two having previously maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence. He agreed to visit Britten's Aldeburgh Festival in 1959, but was prevented by illness. Sensing that death was drawing near, he made a new will, bequeathing his skeleton \\"for preservation and possible display in the Grainger Museum\\". This wish was not carried out.Through the winter of 1959–60 Grainger continued to perform his own music, often covering long distances by bus or train; he would not travel by air. On 29 April 1960 he gave his last public concert, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, although by now his illness was affecting his concentration. On this occasion his morning recital  went well, but his conducting in the afternoon  was, in his own words, \\"a fiasco\\".  Subsequently confined to his home, he continued to revise his music and arrange that of others; in August he informed Elsie  that he was working on an adaptation of one of Cyril Scott's early songs.  His last letters, written from hospital in December 1960 and January 1961, record  attempts to work, despite failing eyesight and hallucinations: \\"I have been trying to write score for several days. But I have not succeeded yet.\\"Grainger died in the White Plains hospital on 20 February 1961, at the age of 78. His body was flown to Adelaide where, on 2 March, he was buried in the Aldridge family vault in the West Terrace Cemetery, alongside Rose's ashes.

Movie title: Nayak Context: A famous star of Bengali films, Arindam Mukherjee (Uttam Kumar), is invited to the capital to receive a prestigious award. All the flights are booked, which forces him to take the train. The morning newspaper arrives and carries with it a detailed article on an altercation he'd been involved in. In the restaurant car, he meets Aditi Sengupta (Sharmila Tagore), a young journalist who edits a modern women's magazine, Adhunika.[2] Filled with contempt for the likes of him, she secretly plans to interview him because she thinks it'd attract more readers. He soon starts to reveal his personality, and also brings to surface the inner insecurities and his consciousness of the limitations of his 'powers'. Aditi initially takes notes, surreptitiously, but later on, out of empathy almost bordering on pity,stops. However, critical of the star, she interrogates him, leading to further introspection on his part. Slowly, his guilt about the way things turned out is very visible. Arindam also mentions Shankar-da, his mentor, who had never wanted Arindam to join films, being a strong opposer of the medium. He talks about his first day in film, and on the different experiences in faced with other workers in the field and some of the things that happened to them. Toward the end of the train journey, Arindam is drunk and feels a need to confide his wrongdoings. He asks the conductor to fetch Aditi. He begins to reveal the reason behind the altercation he was a part of, but Aditi stops him, as she has already guessed. It was an affair he'd had with one of his co-actors, Promila. Afraid that he might commit suicide, Aditi makes sure he returns to his cubicle, before going back to her own. As the star re-lives and examines his life with Aditi, a bond develops between them. Aditi realizes that in spite of his fame and success, Arindam is a lonely man, in need of empathy. Out of respect for him, she chooses to suppress the story and tears up the notes she has written. She lets the hero preserve his public image.

My work to date has been concerned with the communication of public and private information to an audience so that it may be retold, distributed. The stories I tell are political dramas, which unfold through my past experience and into the present where they interact with the currency of media as the dialectic of aesthetic pleasure and pain. Through various layers of distribution and interpretation, pictures are drawn using interactive models established through the stories’ (technological) framework where they are revealed and shared. With an audience locked in participation, my story may be retold.      The 3rdi is just such a platform for the telling and retelling of another story. A camera temporarily implanted on the back of my head, it spontaneously and objectively captures the images – one per minute – that make up my daily life, and transmits them to a website for public consumption.      During my journey from Iraq to Saudi Arabia, on to Kuwait and then the U.S., I left many people and places behind. The images I have of this journey are inevitably ephemeral, held as they are in my own memory. Many times while I was in transit and chaos the images failed to fully register, I did not have the time to absorb them. Now, in hindsight, I wish I could have recorded these images so that I could look back on them, to have them serve as a reminder and record of all the places I was forced to leave behind and may never see again.      The 3rdi arises from a need to objectively capture my past as it slips behind me from a non-confrontational point of view. It is anti-photography, decoded, and will capture images that are denoted rather than connoted, a technological-biological image. This will be accomplished by the complete removal of my hand and eye from the photographic process, circumventing the traditional conventions of traditional photography or a disruption in the photographic program. Barthes has said, \\"...from an aesthetic point of view the denoted image can appear as a kind of Edenic state of the image; cleared utopianically of its connotations, the image would become radically objective, or, in the last analysis, innocent.\\" It is this 'innocent' image that I wish to capture through the 3rdi.      Technically, the 3rdi is an automatic photographic apparatus that is comprised of three different components: a small digital camera permanently surgically mounted to the back of my head with a USB connection, a lightweight laptop which I carry on my body connected to the camera with a USB cable, and a 3G wireless connection to access the internet. The website www.3rdi.me acts as storage and display for the images captured by the camera. The functioning of the apparatus, in theory, is as follows: The camera, through no intervention of the artist, captures an image automatically once a minute and send this image through the USB connection to the receiver (the computer) on my body. The receiver then sends this image through the 3G network to the website, where the images are archived and made available to the public.      The 3rdi makes a technological apparatus part of my body and distributes the recorded content openly within space using the internet. The arbitrary imagery captured by the device will retain fractured records and distribute a narrative to be completed by the viewer as their corporeal space is also compromised by the presentation. Benjamin has described the storyteller as one “who could let the wick of his life be consumed completely by the gentle flame of his story.” (Illuminations) In this way I become locked to the story as its teller, passing the interpretive mode to an audience with little context so it may be transformed for their subjective interactions and subsequent expressions. Using this narrative triangle, the work will comment on ways in which imagery is used for the telling and retelling of stories, whether they belong to us or we make them ours.      Installation Description      In addition to the 3rdi device and its online presence, a physical installation opened December 15 in Doha, Qatar as part of the Told/Untold/Retold exhibition inaugurating the new Arab Museum of Modern Art. Hence the 3rdi is in total: a device, a website, and a larger installation that mimics the online platform from which the images are intended to be viewed. The installation will act as a concentrated display that asks the viewer to experience the images in both time space.      The physical installation consists of three distinct rooms. The first, a smaller room, acts as an entrance to the main installation space and provides a separation from the gallery at large. This room prepares the viewer by providing information via wall text that describes the philosophy and background of the 3rdi project. The text is displayed on the wall to the right of the installation entrance. On the left is a medium-sized LCD display with a loop of a documentary on the 3rdi. The exit from this room is open and directly opposite it is a large wall partition that masks the exit from the second room, the main installation space. On this wall is a life-sized photo of the artist facing away from the camera with the 3rdi attached to his head. The partition leads the viewer to either the left or right to gain entrance to the main installation space.      The main installation space is much larger than the first room. After walking around the partition the viewer is confronted by a large bank of small LCD screens, displaying the 3rdi images, stretching from the floor and curving to the ceiling. When a viewer gazes at a certain image, this image stays stable while the other images shift to form a virtual halo around the viewer. Opposite the LCD bank is a large mirrored surface that serves to double the images and broaden the space. The floor too is composed of a mirrored surface further doubling the images from the LCD displays and again broadening the space. The space itself is painted black. Interaction within this portion of the space is subject to both the number of bodies occupying the room and their movement within the space; the number and rate of images is affected by the number of people present. More people means faster movement of the images; with fewer viewers the images slow down. Movement through the space also triggers a flickering and whitening of the images. As a viewer moves from the entrance to the exit of the space, the images nearest them flicker and turn to white. The images in this mode of interaction are elusive to the viewer.      An exit leads to a third room, where the viewer can sit and observe the images as they stream in live from the 3rdi device. This space is a viewing room and a reprieve from the previous installation space. Viewers here will be able to converse and discuss the images as they are transmitted. It is intended to be a sharp contrast to the overwhelming experience of the installation space, allowing the viewer to digest the prior experience while integrating the new information constantly coming in from the 3rdi. This portion of the installation has an exit into the gallery at large, ending the 3rdi space, and allowing the viewer to pursue the 3rdi on their own.      On a whole the installation is intended to provide a broad viewing experience, similar to that of the internet, for the 3rdi apparatus. The extension of the 3rdi into physical space explores issues of perception, image recognition, surveillance, internet viewing, and information saturation. |||||","output":"Wafaa Bilal, a New York University arts professor, experienced a medical setback in his innovative art project \\"The 3rd I.\\" He was compelled to undergo surgery to remove a titanium post that anchored a camera to his skull after his body rejected it.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Matthew Paris, known as Matthew of Paris (Latin: Matthaeus Parisiensis, lit. \\"Matthew the Parisian\\"; c. 1200 - 1259), was a Benedictine monk, English chronicler, artist in illuminated manuscripts and cartographer, based at St Albans Abbey in Hertfordshire. He wrote a number of works, mostly historical, which he scribed and illuminated himself, typically in drawings partly coloured with watercolour washes, sometimes called \\"tinted drawings\\". Some were written in Latin, some in Anglo-Norman or French verse. From 1235, the point at which Wendover dropped his pen, Paris continued the history on the plan which his predecessors had followed. He derived much of his information from the letters of important people, which he sometimes inserts, but much more from conversation with the eyewitnesses of events. Among his informants were Richard, Earl of Cornwall and King Henry III, with whom he appears to have been on intimate terms.  The king knew that Paris was writing a history, and wanted it to be as exact as possible. In 1257, in the course of a week's visit to St Albans, Henry kept the chronicler beside him night and day, \\"and guided my pen,\\" says Paris, \\"with much goodwill and diligence.\\" It is curious that the Chronica majora gives so unfavourable an account of the king's policy. Henry Richards Luard supposes that Paris never intended his work to be read in its present form. Many passages of the autograph have written next to them, the note offendiculum, which shows that the writer understood the danger which he ran. On the other hand, unexpurgated copies were made in Paris's lifetime. Although the offending passages are duly omitted or softened in his abridgment of his longer work, the Historia Anglorum (written about 1253), Paris's real feelings must have been an open secret. There is no ground for the old theory that he was an official historiographer.  Naturalists have praised his descriptions of the English wildlife of his time, brief though they are: in particular his valuable description of the first irruption into England in 1254 of the common crossbill. was being a historian related to the church","output":"In the article, it is mentioned that Matthew Paris was a Benedictine monk based at St Albans Abbey in Hertfordshire. The fact that he was a monk indicates a connection to the church. Additionally, Matthew Paris wrote a history, and King Henry III wanted it to be as exact as possible. The quote that supports this is: \\"The king knew that Paris was writing a history, and wanted it to be as exact as possible. In 1257, in the course of a week's visit to St Albans, Henry kept the chronicler beside him night and day, 'and guided my pen,' says Paris, 'with much goodwill and diligence.'\\" Thus, it can be inferred that being a historian was related to the church in the case of Matthew Paris, as he was a Benedictine monk writing historical works."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Tim is trying to boil two pots of water, pot A and pot B. Tim has a device which lets him see what the average kinetic energy is of the particles in each pot is. After examining each pot, Tim discovers that pot A has particles with a very high average kinetic energy, and pot B's particles have a low average kinetic energy.  Hint: The particles of soup have greater average kinetic energy than the particles of water in the tub, explaining why the soup has a higher temperature. However, the mass of the water in the tub is much greater than the mass of the soup in the pot. This means that there are many more particles of water than soup. All those moving particles give the water in the tub greater total kinetic energy, even though their average kinetic energy is less. Therefore, the water in the tub has greater thermal energy than the soup. To compare the thermal energy of some other materials, go to the following URL and click on the interactive animation “Temperature and Thermal Energy.” The answer is:","output":"Pot A is closer to boiling.  The reason for this is because the average kinetic energy of the particles in pot A is significantly higher than the particles in pot B. When a substance is heated, its particles gain more kinetic energy, and when they have enough energy, the substance undergoes a phase transition, such as water boiling and turning into steam. In this case, since pot A has a higher average kinetic energy, the water particles are likely moving faster and with more collisions, which indicates that they are closer to reaching the boiling point. In the given hint, the relationship between temperature and average kinetic energy was used to explain why the soup has a higher temperature than the water in the tub. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy in a substance, and a higher average kinetic energy leads to a higher temperature. Therefore, it can be inferred from the hint that a substance with a greater average kinetic energy will have a higher temperature and be closer to boiling. Additionally, the hint also explains the difference between thermal energy and temperature. While the water in the tub may have a greater total kinetic energy (thermal energy) due to the large number of particles and higher mass, the average kinetic energy of these particles is lower than that of the soup in the pot. This means that the water in the tub is not as close to boiling as the soup, despite having more thermal energy. In conclusion, based on the information provided about the average kinetic energies of the particles in pot A and pot B, it is clear that pot A is closer to boiling. This is because the higher average kinetic energy of the particles in pot A suggests a higher temperature, which indicates that it is closer to reaching the boiling point."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Make sure you are getting enough magnesium in your daily diet to help absorb the calcium supplements you're taking.  To increase your magnesium, eat whole grains, vegetables such as summer squash, green beans, broccoli, cucumbers, and spinach, and nuts and seeds.  Adult women under 30 need 310 milligrams a day, while women over 30 need 320 milligrams. Men need 400 milligrams before 30 and 420 milligrams after 30. An ounce of almonds has 80 milligrams of magnesium. If your supplement needs are greater than 500 milligrams per day after accounting for the calcium consumed in your diet, split up your supplement.  Your body is only able to process up to 500 milligram at a time.  Taking more calcium than you need can be dangerous. It increases your chance of having kidney stones and may also contribute to problems with your heart.  Preteens and teenagers (ages 9 to 18) need 1,300mg of calcium per day. Vitamin D also contributes to absorbing calcium into your system. Because of this relationship, most milk has added vitamin D to help you take in the calcium.  Many dairy products, such as butter, cheese, and milk have vitamin D. Fortified cereals and fish are also good sources of this vitamin.  For adults under 70 years of age, 600 international units of vitamin D per day is sufficient. Adults over 70 should consume 800 international units. To get your recommended intake, 3 ounces of swordfish has 566 international units, while a cup of milk has 115 to 124 international units per serving. This type of calcium, which is readily available, is best taken with food. It needs stomach acid to be absorbed properly, and the food activates your stomach acid. Other types of calcium, such as calcium citrate, does not need to be taken with food. This type of calcium is usually more expensive than calcium carbonate. This type is especially good for people who have stomach issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome. The same is true of your multivitamin if your multivitamin contains iron.  Your body processes iron and calcium in much the same way, so taking them at the same time interferes with the body's ability to absorb both. The same rule applies to food and beverages consumed with both supplements. Calcium supplements should not be taken with foods high in iron, such as liver or spinach. Iron supplements should not be taken with calcium-rich products like a glass of milk. These acids can bind with calcium and keep it from being absorbed. Many foods high in magnesium are also high in these acids. Therefore, while it's important to eat these foods to get the magnesium you need, you should avoid taking your supplement along with these foods. For instance, spinach, many nuts and seeds, rhubarb, sweet potatoes, beans, and collard greens are all high in phytic and oxalic acids. Whole grains and wheat are also high in these acids, but don't seem to affect calcium absorption as much as other foods in this category. Alcohol can decrease your body's absorption of calcium. On average, don't drink more than one drink a day if you're a woman and two drinks a day if you're a man. \\"One drink\\" is the equivalent of 12 oz of beer, 5 oz of wine, or 1.5 oz of liquor.","output":"Magnesium is an essential element that aids in calcium absorption and contributes to building healthy bones. To ensure adequate magnesium intake, consume whole grains, vegetables like summer squash, green beans, broccoli, cucumbers, and spinach, as well as nuts and seeds. The daily recommended amounts of magnesium differ for men and women based on age. Calcium is vital for maintaining strong bones, and its optimal intake, particularly for preteens and teenagers, is crucial to prevent health issues. Vitamin D plays a vital role in calcium absorption and can be found in various foods, such as dairy products, fortified cereals, and fish. The recommended daily intake of vitamin D differs for adults under 70 years and those 70 and above. Calcium supplements come in different forms; calcium carbonate requires consumption with food for better absorption, while calcium citrate can be consumed without food. It is essential to avoid taking calcium along with iron-rich foods or iron supplements, as they can interfere with the absorption process. Certain foods high in phytic and oxalic acids can bind with calcium and hinder absorption. While it is essential to consume these foods for magnesium intake, avoid taking calcium supplements alongside them. Foods rich in these acids include spinach, nuts and seeds, rhubarb, sweet potatoes, beans, collard greens, and whole grains. Alcohol consumption can negatively impact calcium absorption. Limit alcohol intake to one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men. Remember that over-consuming calcium supplements can result in kidney stones and heart issues. Additionally, note that the body can process up to 500 milligrams of calcium at a time, and it's ideal to split the dosage if greater than this amount."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The weather phenomena this last month had an immense impact on Dirk county, the precipitation lead to many flood evens, the steady rain lead to massive water infiltration. 20 miles away, in Saulk county, they had a few thunderstorms, they had quite a bit of runoff, but less infiltration and less soil saturation.  Which county experienced more infiltration?  Hint: Precipitation can impact infiltration in many ways. The amount, type and duration of precipitation all have an impact. Rainfall leads to faster infiltration rates than any other precipitation events, such as snow or sleet. In terms of amount, the more precipitation that occurs, the more infiltration will occur until the ground reaches saturation, at which point the infiltration capacity is reached. Duration of rainfall impacts the infiltration capacity as well. Initially when the precipitation event first starts the infiltration is occurring rapidly as the soil is unsaturated, but as time continues the infiltration rate slows as the soil becomes more saturated. This relationship between rainfall and infiltration capacity also determines how much runoff will occur. If rainfall occurs at a rate faster than the infiltration capacity runoff will occur.","output":"Given the information presented, it is clear that Dirk County experienced more infiltration due to the weather phenomena this past month. There are multiple factors that contributed to this conclusion, which include the amount, type, and duration of precipitation experienced in both counties. In Dirk County, the weather phenomena consisted of immense precipitation, leading to many flood events. This steady rain, along with the massive water infiltration, has caused significant soil saturation. As more precipitation occurs, greater infiltration follows until the ground reaches its saturation point. The amount of precipitation in Dirk County, therefore, has resulted in increased infiltration. Comparatively, Saulk County experienced a few thunderstorms. Although some runoff occurred, there was less infiltration and soil saturation in this region. The difference in the type of precipitation between the two counties played a vital role in infiltration. Rainfall leads to faster infiltration rates than other types of precipitation such as snow or sleet. Therefore, Dirk County, receiving steady rainfall, experienced more infiltration than Saulk County, with only a few thunderstorms. Lastly, the duration of rainfall also impacts infiltration capacity. As Dirk County had steady rain for an extended period, the initial rapid infiltration gradually slowed as the soil became more saturated. However, this prolonged rainfall contributed to the overall infiltration being higher in Dirk County since the precipitation event lasted for a longer duration. In conclusion, Dirk County experienced higher infiltration due to the greater amount, steady nature, and extended duration of the precipitation events in comparison to Saulk County. The impact of these factors combined created higher soil saturation levels in Dirk County, leading to increased infiltration. Consequently, runoffs occurred at a lesser rate in Dirk County due to higher infiltration capacity, whereas, in Saulk County, despite fewer infiltration and saturation levels, runoffs occurred at a comparatively higher rate due to its lower infiltration capacity and shorter duration precipitation events."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose wound is disinfected happens, how will it affect less bacteria to reproduce.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"B: less When a wound is disinfected, the chances of bacteria reproducing and spreading are significantly reduced. Disinfecting a wound involves the process of cleaning and treating the affected area with antiseptic solutions or ointments to remove or kill pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, or fungi. This helps to minimize the risk of infection and facilitates the healing process. Disinfection of a wound can be done through various methods, such as directly applying an antiseptic solution, using an antiseptic-impregnated dressing, or washing the wound with water and soap before applying a suitable dressing. Some commonly used disinfectants include hydrogen peroxide, alcohol, iodine, and povidone-iodine. By reducing the number of bacteria present in the wound, there will be less bacteria available to reproduce. This minimizes the potential for bacterial colonies to grow, multiply, and spread within the wound, or to invade surrounding tissues. Thus, proper disinfection of a wound can greatly influence the prevention or control of potential bacterial infections. Furthermore, keeping the wound clean and dry, as well as proper wound dressing techniques, can also contribute to a decrease in bacterial colonization. Regularly changing the dressings, avoiding contamination of the wound by hands or objects, and seeking medical advice if the wound shows signs of infection (e.g., excessive redness, swelling, or pus) are also important steps to minimize the likelihood of bacterial reproduction and infection. In summary, disinfecting a wound significantly reduces the presence of bacteria, leading to less bacteria available for reproduction and spread.

This clandestine organization, responsible for numerous acts of terror and political violence, has been the subject of a massive manhunt for years, with many of its members having disappeared without a trace. The police finally scored a significant victory in their relentless pursuit of bringing the group to justice. This breakthrough in counter-terrorism efforts will likely serve as a catalyst for further investigations and eventual dismantling of the clandestine organization. Background: The Red Brigades, or Brigate Rosse in Italian, emerged in the 1970s as a left-wing paramilitary organization committed to social and political change. The group, primarily made up of disillusioned students, factory workers, and intellectuals, acted in response to growing economic and social disparities in the country. The organization resorted to violent means to voice their dissent, aiming to clear the path for a Marxist revolution. The height of their activities between 1970 to the mid-'80s, referred to as \\"Years of Lead,\\" saw the group carry out kidnappings, bombings, and assassinations targeting Italy's political and economic elites. Among their most high-profile acts was the abduction and assassination of former Prime Minister Aldo Moro in 1978. Despite severe crackdowns throughout the 1980s and '90s, the Red Brigades remained active, with some of their members having assumed distinct low-profile lives. The discovery of the alleged hideout has piqued intrigue and raised questions over the extent of the group's current activities. Police Raid and Discoveries: In a strategic operation, law enforcement authorities stormed the nondescript building, located in an otherwise peaceful neighborhood. The residence, according to police sources, served as a hidden base for the Red Brigades' members. Upon raiding the property, the officers uncovered an incriminating stockpile of weapons, explosives, and other resources, including materials for forging documents. Apart from the trove of physical evidence, police found several documents revealing intelligence on the organization's membership, operations, and potential targets. The discovery of the Red Brigades' covert network has provided authorities with invaluable insights into the extremist group's strategies and will likely help in tracking down any remaining members. Impact on Counter-Terrorism Efforts: The unearthing of the alleged Red Brigades hideout marks a pivotal moment in Italy's counter-terrorism efforts. The operation demonstrates the continued vigilance of law enforcement authorities and their commitment to thwarting any potential resurgence of outdated, extremist ideologies that have been responsible for causing so much unrest in the past. By achieving this breakthrough, the Italian security forces have shown that they are capable of adapting to unconventional tactics employed by such terrorist organizations. Additionally, the discovery of the hideout and the intel it provides can help facilitate international cooperation in fighting against terrorism.  Conclusion: The surprising discovery of the alleged Red Brigades hideout has reignited concerns about the group's potential activities and acts as a stark reminder of the ongoing threat posed by these organizations. Nevertheless, this successful operation underscores law enforcement's continued vigilance and provides a much-needed boost to Italy's counter-terrorism strategies. As authorities continue to identify and apprehend members of this clandestine organization, they will be instrumental in reinforcing security and facilitating peace and stability not only in Italy, but across the global stage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Kathlamet language is very famous.","output":"While it is true that the Kathlamet people spoke the Kathlamet language, which was a dialect of the Chinookan language, in their historical homeland along the Columbia River in present-day southwestern Washington state, describing it as \\"very famous\\" might not capture the complete essence of the language and its significance. Instead, it would be more accurate to consider the Kathlamet language as an important and distinctive part of the cultural heritage of the Kathlamet people. As a dialect of the Chinookan language, the Kathlamet language reflects the unique linguistic features, customs, and traditions of its speakers. The Kathlamet people had cultural and trading connections with other Native American tribes within the region, such as the Clackamas and the Chinook. This allowed for linguistic exchange and contributed to the common linguistic heritage in the area. It is important to note that due to the passage of time and unfortunate circumstances like colonization, many indigenous languages, including the Kathlamet language, have been lost or endangered. Preserving the memory of these languages is essential to honoring the history and cultural richness of the tribes that spoke them, including the Kathlamet people. It is through the study and documentation of these languages that researchers and communities can broaden their understanding of the history, interactions, and migrations of Native American tribes in North America. In conclusion, while the Kathlamet language may not be widely recognized as \\"very famous,\\" it holds a significant place in the cultural history of the Kathlamet people, as well as within the broader linguistic landscape of Chinookan languages and Aboriginal communities in the Pacific Northwest. Recognizing the importance of this language and working to preserve its memory helps to maintain the rich heritage and interconnectedness of these indigenous communities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To do this, we follow these steps: Step 1: Identify the equation The given equation is n + 1 = -3. Step 2: Identify the goal The goal is to solve for 'n.' Step 3: Isolate the variable 'n' In this step, we will isolate 'n' on one side of the equation. Since we have 'n' on the left side of the equation, we will isolate 'n' on the left side. The equation is in the form n + 1 = -3. We need to eliminate the '+1' term on the left side of the equation. To do this, we will perform the inverse operation. The inverse operation of addition is subtraction. So, we will subtract 1 from both sides of the equation in order to cancel out the '+1' term on the left side. n + 1 - 1 = -3 - 1 Now, the '+1' and '-1' on the left side of the equation will cancel each other out, leaving only 'n': n = -3 - 1 Step 4: Simplify the equation Now we need to simplify the right side of the equation by performing the arithmetic operation: n = -4 So, the solution to the given equation n + 1 = -3 is n = -4."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which test would see decrease in pressure, case A or case B?  David was trying to see how steam engines work. For that, he conducted two tests, test A and test B. In test A, he used low temperature. On the other hand, in test B, he used high temperature. David started thinking about how he could use the results of his tests in everyday life.  Hint: Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease. The answer to this question is:","output":"The test that would see a decrease in pressure is case A, in which low temperature is used. According to the hint provided, decreasing the temperature has the opposite effect of increasing it; thus, the pressure of an enclosed gas, such as the one in the cylinder, would decrease.

By Jason Groves for the Daily Mail Ukip last night warned they will target Boris Johnson over his support for a migrant amnesty if the Conservatives try to use him to erode their support. Tory sources yesterday confirmed that the London Mayor will be deployed as a ‘Ukip killer’ in next year’s general election, following confirmation that he wants to return to parliament.

Please write a short summary for the following article: 'Dallas' does Dallas: Where to find the Ewings now Margot and Bill Winspear Opera House (CNN) -- Who shot J.R.? Why is zombie Bobby taking a shower? And can Texans really pull off a cowboy hat with a suit? A new incarnation of the groundbreaking television saga that raised these questions will return to TNT June 13. The new series isn't just a remake; it's a continuation of the original, which means that television's most notorious family is back in the Big D. But the city has changed a lot since we last checked in with J.R. and company. For instance, it lost a lot of oil derricks and gained a few modern marvels, including a signature bridge and a stadium that rivals the construction of the Death Star. Women's hairstyles aren't as high and neither are the peaks of 10-gallon Stetsons. The Dallas Cowboys are now a source of great embarrassment and the Texas Rangers are the pride of the metroplex. But that's not to say there isn't still plenty of the unapologetic glam and high-society Western culture celebrated in the show's original 14 seasons. The Ewing clan would feel just as at home in today's Dallas as they did during the series' heyday. Here are a few spots where you just might run into them. 'Dallas' vs. Dallas: Where TV stops and reality begins Five Sixty by Wolfgang Puck at Reunion Tower Built in 1978, the same year \\"Dallas\\" premiered on CBS, Reunion Tower served as Dallas' most iconic building for three decades before the \\"Big Ball\\" underwent a much-needed makeover. Now Reunion Tower boasts one of the finest dining experiences in Dallas, with a 560-foot-high revolving restaurant and an Asian fusion menu crafted by celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck. Summer Travel: World's best affordable beach resorts J.R. wouldn't be caught dead in this dive bar that's covered floor to ceiling in graffiti, photos, stickers, neon lights and mounted horns. But a younger Ewing would feel right at home at Adair's, where you're likely to see just as many businessmen as you do cowboys. The 49-year-old honky tonk features some of the best burgers in Dallas and live music almost every night (usually of the country and western persuasion), and you're more than welcome to join the trove of two-steppers, whether you're wearing designer or dungarees. Bang & Olufsen, Harry Winston, Diane von Furstenberg, Hermes, Stella McCartney, Chanel, and Christian Louboutin are just a few of the high-end shopping options available at this 20,000-square-foot outdoor mall. You might find one of the Ewing boys shopping for a 130,000 rifle at the Beretta Gallery, or a soon-to-be Mrs. Ewing picking out an Oscar de la Renta wedding dress at Warren Barrón Bridal. Summer Travel: Secret hotels of Florida's Gulf Coast Of course, the Ewings would be nothing without the world-renowned Southfork Ranch. The home base of Dallas' most famous TV dynasty actually sits just outside the city, in Parker, Texas. The Ranch is still alive and well, and has served as a tourist destination and an event and conference center since the '80s. Many of Dallas' most elite soirees are held on the property, including the Cattle Baron's Ball, which draws in thousands of guests donning their finest Western attire. This time around the Ewings are spending about as much time around Dallas' South Side as they are around Southfork. Members of the cast and crew stayed in the South Side on Lamar, a loft apartment building that lures creative spirits and young professionals, and provides the city's best views of the Dallas skyline. Many of the scenes were also filmed in South Side, which originally served as the home of the historic Sears, Roebuck & Co.'s Catalog Merchandise Center. Margot and Bill Winspear Opera House Dallas' new stunning, state-of-the-art opera house is the most prestigious venue in the world that warmly welcomes cowboy boots. Eager to promote culture in North Texas, Margot and Bill Winspear donated 42 million with a vision of promoting great opera to help Dallas become a top international city. Located in the AT&T Performing Arts Center, the opera house has certainly upped the city's cultural cred. In 2010, the Winspear hosted Dallas' first opera premiere, with Jake Heggie's \\"Moby-Dick,\\" and with each new show, the venue has continued to help fulfill the Winspears' dream. Saint Ann Restaurant & Bar \\"Dallas\\" veteran Linda Gray (Sue Ellen Ewing) and newcomer Jordana Brewster (Elena Ramos) were spotted filming at this minimalist Uptown restaurant set in an old Catholic school house, the first in the city to teach Hispanic children. With a chalkboard wall, notebook-paper menus and original beams sitting below glass flooring, you won't soon forget the trendy restaurant's past life. But history isn't all Saint Ann has to offer -- the eatery also features the city's largest patio garden and one of the longest pre-seat waiting periods. So be sure to make a reservation. Rosewood Mansion on Turtle Creek For starters, it's so elegant it's known simply as The Mansion. It's also the most historic and elite hotel in Dallas, and the bar and restaurant are no exception. The Mansion Bar's recent renovation enhanced the den's club ambiance, with cognac-colored leather walls covered in fine art and shelves filled with leather-bound books. You half-expect to see J.R. sitting out on the terrace overlooking Turtle Creek, sipping on his signature Bourbon and Branch cocktail.

Imagine you have 973 toy blocks, and you make a big tower with them - that's how high the airport is above the sea level. Lastly, the runway where airplanes take off and land has a special name, \\"16/34.\\" This is like when you call your toy car \\"Speedy\\" or your teddy bear \\"Snuggles.\\" So the airplanes at Andrews County Airport use the \\"16/34\\" runway to come and go on their journeys!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Some good news for online holiday shoppers: bargain-hunting binges   will drive prices down as web-based retailers compete to offer bigger discounts, marketing researchers predict. A recent survey by Shopzilla found that nearly 84 percent of online retailers would offer Cyber Monday discounts, up 12 percent from last year. Cyber Monday, the first Monday after Thanksgiving, is the online response to Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving when stores are traditionally flooded with customers, some of whom camp at the entrances overnight to take advantage of discounts. However, in the current economic climate, online retailers have felt pressure to offer sales and discounts even before Black Friday. But how online retailers decide to offer those big savings isn't a simple matter of trying to attract the consumers who are watching their wallets, Bohlmann of Sabanci University in Istanbul says. Online stores will also pay attention to the deals their competitors are offering, potentially leading to price wars between certain retailers to attract all those potential bargain-hunting customers. Online shoppers can be divided into two types, Bohlmann said, --switchers and --loyals. Switchers compare prices between retailers and go for the cheapest one, while loyals stick to one brand or store. It almost doesn't matter what price you charge. Online retailers will look at the percentage of switchers and loyals they have in order to decide whether to offer discounts. The more switchers they have, the more likely they will offer discounts. But retailers don't just look at the percentage of their own customers; they also look at the competition. If one online store has a higher percentage of loyals than the competitor, it can afford to keep prices higher. On the contrary, if it has a higher percentage of switchers than the competitor, it might want to lower prices. Question: It can be inferred from the text that   _ - retailers should know more about customers' interest - There will be no shoppers who go out in crowds - Barnes&Noble's prices are lower than other companies' - Retailers like the switchers more than the loyals A:","output":"Retailers should know more about customers' interest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Politicians, health care experts and a VA official agreed solutions exist, but more than three hours of questioning by the House Veterans' Affairs Committee showed that responses so far by Congress and the administration fall short of what's needed. \\"It's going to take wholesale, systematic reform of the entire department,\\" said Republican Rep. Jeff Miller of Florida, the committee chairman. \\"It's very clear the status quo is not acceptable and it's time for real change.\\" Dr. Robert Jesse, a top official in the VA health administration, also acknowledged the need for major changes after revelations first reported by CNN of sometimes deadly waits for medical care faced by veterans. \\"We own this\\" \\"We know that we have let veterans down, but we're going to make it right,\\" Jesse told the panel, adding that \\"you all deserve better from us.\\" Declaring that \\"we own this\\" and \\"we're going to fix it,\\" he later said: \\"Today we really need to be looking at the entire structure of the organization to move forward. We really need to examine everything.\\" An internal VA audit released Monday found that tens of thousands of newly returning veterans wait at least 90 days for medical care, while even more who signed up in the VA system over the past 10 years never got an immediate appointment they requested. The VA has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care, and CNN's reporting uncovered the deaths of dozens of others who were waiting for VA care in Phoenix. Despite efforts in recent years to address longstanding problems at the department, including reductions in backlogs for benefits and the number of homeless veterans, the long waits have continued for newly enrolled veterans to get initial appointments for care. Reasons for the chronic problems include the increasing number of veterans returning from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a bonus system that rewarded managers for meeting goals regarding access to treatment. The VA audit confirmed CNN reports of secret wait lists used to cover up wait times that exceeded department guidelines. The controversy led to the resignation of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, while some VA officials have been put on administrative leave pending investigations by the VA inspector general's office and Congress. FBI getting involved. On Wednesday, the FBI said it opened a criminal investigation of the VA in conjunction with the inspector general's probe, which has expanded to 69 facilities. \\"At the department's direction, the FBI has instructed agents in its Phoenix office to conduct an investigation into the allegations related to the VA,\\" a Justice Department spokesman said. \\"Federal prosecutors will be working with these investigators to determine whether there is a basis for criminal charges.\\" Meanwhile, both the House and Senate have passed legislation to permit veterans experiencing long wait times for medical appointments to seek care at non-VA facilities at the government's expense. They now will negotiate a compromise between differences in the two measures. Interim Veterans Affairs Secretary Sloan Gibson, who took over when Shinseki stepped down, also has announced a series of steps in response to the problems. They include a hiring freeze at central headquarters and 21 regional facilities, suspension of all performance awards for senior managers in fiscal year 2014, eliminating an unattainable goal of getting newly enrolled veterans an appointment within 14 days, and ordering an independent outside audit of VA medical care scheduling practices across the system. The VA also has contacted 50,000 veterans waiting for care and will continue reaching out to others, Gibson said after the release of the VA internal audit. Health care audits told the House committee on Thursday that such steps, while welcome, failed to address the underlying need for systemic reforms at the VA to instill a culture of serving the veterans, rather than the bureaucracy. Outside cultural assessment. \\"There is a pervasive VA culture that puts personal gain in the system ahead of veterans. That's wrong,\\" said Tim McClain, president of Humana Government Business. Saying more than \\"band-aids\\" were needed, McClain added that \\"any long-term solution must include a culture and organizational assessment from the outside.\\" Betsy McCaughey, a conservative health care activist known for her opposition to President Barack Obama's health care reforms, complained the Senate legislation included provisions that would undermine the intended goal of letting veterans access civilian medical facilities. McCaughey, the former lieutenant governor of New York, pointed out that veterans would need to prove they had experienced unacceptable waits for VA care, and that any private doctor treating them would have to first call the VA for authorization. Noting the bureaucratic dysfunction at the department, she said: \\"Good luck getting anybody to answer that call.\\" Jesse, the VA's acting under secretary for health, insisted the VA had the capacity to handle the system proposed in the Senate legislation, though he acknowledged that problems occurred at some facilities. The VA legislation was moving quickly through Congress, showing the political sensitivity of the issue in an election year defined by partisan divide. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi signaled Thursday that a final compromise must leave intact the government role of providing health care for veterans instead of privatizing it, as sought by GOP conservatives.

Over the last 20 years the majority of British films are about how horribly poverty stricken the UK is and how our youth doesn't stand a chance of a good life whilst they live on the mean streets of British cities. The British film industry is obsessed with the idea of 'broken Britain'. Trainspotting, This is England, Kidulthood, Football Factory, Kes and From London to Brighton. Bullet Boy is just another British movie added to that list. The main character expresses a desire to go straight yet he still insists on hanging around with dead beats who carry guns and fight with gang members over nothing. I was never convinced that he did want to go straight as there was nothing stopping him pursuing an education or a trade. In fact it would have been a breath of fresh air if he had of gone straight and we had a character who turned his life around. Instead he spends his time helping his friend trying to commit murder. I felt no sympathy when he is predictably shot by another teen at the end of the film, which is sad because at the beginning of the film I really liked the entire family and their desire for success. I believe the makers missed a great chance to show the world that success belongs to those who are willing to really strive for it (like the Pursuit of Happiness).  I know the purpose of this film was to try and paint a realistic picture of what life is like for black teens living in working class areas of Britain but don't we already have enough films in the UK with that very same plot? Isn't it time these talented producers and writers give Britains youth something to aspire to and show them a better life is just around the corner? I applaud the makers of Bullet Boy for not loading the film full of mindless violence in order to try and get success through shock factors (like Kidulthood, Football Factory) but at the same time this movie offers nothing new to a long list of British films that are effectively dull and depressing to watch.

Its statement has been circulated by high-profile al-Qaeda supporters on the Telegram messaging app. The attack in St Petersburg killed 16 people, including the suicide bomber. Russian officials later said Akbarzhon Jalilov, a Russian citizen born in Kyrgyzstan, detonated a bomb between two metro stations in the city. The Imam Shamil Battalion statement said the bombing was revenge for Russian military actions in Muslim countries such as Syria and Libya as well as the Muslim region of Chechnya in Russia's North Caucasus. More attacks were being planned, the statement said. The authenticity of the claim has not been independently verified. It emerged in news outlets used by jihadists in Africa, including the Mauritania-based website Agence Nouakchott Info, but has not appeared on official al-Qaeda channels. The Russian authorities have so far made no comment. Analysts say the name of the group claiming the bombing may be a reference to Imam Shamil - a 19th Century leader of anti-Russian resistance in the Caucasus. Ten people have been detained in Russia in connection with the bombing. Last week, Abror Azimov, one of the suspects, denied he was behind the attack.

Answer the following question: when does season 2 of the greenhouse academy come out?","output":"Season 2 of the Greenhouse Academy was released on February 14, 2018. The show, created by Giora Chamizer and Paula Yoo, is a Netflix Original Series based on the Israeli television series \\"The Greenhouse\\" (Ha-Hamama). It is a teen drama and mystery series that follows two siblings, Hayley and Alex Woods, as they enroll in a prestigious boarding school for gifted students. The show explores the sibling rivalry, friendships, romances, and mysteries that emerge in this unique and competitive environment. Greenhouse Academy premiered its first season on Netflix on September 8, 2017, and the reception was positive enough for the streaming service to renew it for a second season. Just five months after the release of Season 1, Season 2 began streaming on February 14, 2018, as a special treat for fans on Valentine's Day.  Since its release, the show has seen a total of four seasons become available on Netflix. Season 3 premiered on October 25, 2019, and Season 4, which is the most recent season, was released on March 20, 2020. All the episodes of each season are currently available for streaming on Netflix, so if you haven't watched Season 2 yet, you can start binge-watching it in pace with the other seasons anytime.  The Greenhouse Academy has not been officially renewed for a fifth season yet, and there's no news on the future of the series. However, it's always possible that Netflix may decide to continue the story in the future.

Translate \\"Emotions on the draft directive ran high from the outset.\\" to Finnish?","output":"The translation of \\"Emotions on the draft directive ran high from the outset.\\" in Finnish would be \\"Tunteet luonnosdirektiiviä kohtaan olivat kireät alusta alkaen.\\"  This sentence might need some context to ensure perfect translation, but this sentence means generally the same. The phrase \\"ran high from the outset\\" is idiomatically translated as \\"olivat kireät alusta alkaen\\", in direct English translation it means \\"were tense from the start\\". The phrase \\"Emotions on the draft directive\\" is translated as \\"Tunteet luonnosdirektiiviä kohtaan\\" which directly translates to \\"Emotions towards the draft directive\\".  Like in any translation, sentence structure and idiomatic expressions do not always translate directly from one language to another. In this case, the phrase \\"ran high from the outset\\" needed to be translated in a more contextual, idiomatic way to maintain its meaning in Finnish. The same applies to \\"Emotions on\\", which translated would look strange in Finnish if taken literally, and thus it is translated in a form that is common in Finnish language to express the same meaning.  Translating complex sentences like this one also involves understanding the semantic features of Finnish language structure and culture. The subject of the sentence, the 'draft directive', was kept as the object in the Finnish sentence to keep the translation consistent with the original text. Finnish, like English, is a subject-verb-object language, which means that the structure of the sentence is generally the same in both languages. This also helped in translating the sentence to Finnish.  In conclusion, the translation of \\"Emotions on the draft directive ran high from the outset.\\" to Finnish as \\"Tunteet luonnosdirektiiviä kohtaan olivat kireät alusta alkaen\\" maintains the original meaning and sentiment of the sentence while adjusting to the semantic and structural features of the Finnish language."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: The Scottish government had hoped to unite all of Holyrood's parties behind a call to \\"fully protect\\" Scotland's place in the single market. However, after a chamber debate on the issue, Labour abstained and Tories and Lib Dems voted against the SNP motion. Economy Secretary Keith Brown said the EU was a \\"vital\\" market for Scotland. He had hoped for all parties to \\"show consensus\\" in backing single market membership and \\"unanimously\\" lobby the UK government, but in the end SNP members were backed only by Green MSPs. Holyrood's Europe committee has called for single market access to be a key priority in the Brexit talks, although the UK government has refused to give a \\"running commentary\\" on its negotiating position. Mr Brown's motion for the debate called for parliament to recognise the \\"overwhelming vote\\" in Scotland to remain in the EU, before calling for \\"Scotland's place in the single market to be fully protected\\". He said the single market had provided considerable benefits for Scotland, noting that leaving could cause job losses and increase the cost of exports. The cabinet secretary also said the UK government did not have a mandate to take the country out of the single market, only the European Union. Opposition parties submitted amendments to this motion underlining priorities of their own. The Scottish Conservatives called attention to the vote of the UK as a whole to leave the EU, asking parliament to \\"support the UK government in its efforts to secure a positive trading relationship with the EU\\". Tory MSP Murdo Fraser pointed out that this was Holyrood's 11th Brexit debate, asking if the SNP was scheduling so many similar debates to distract attention from its \\"failing domestic agenda\\". He added that Scotland's exports to the rest of the UK are four times the level of exports to the EU, noting that \\"access to the UK single market should not be at risk\\". This position was echoed by Labour's Jackie Baillie, who submitted an amendment saying parliament should \\"recognise the importance of Scotland's place in the UK single market\\". Referring to the figure cited by Mr Fraser, she said \\"tearing Scotland out of the UK\\" would be \\"an act of economic vandalism at least four times greater than Brexit\\". She said it was \\"vital\\" to get the best deal for Scotland, but said it was more realistic to aim for access to the single market rather than full membership. The Scottish Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, put forward an amendment calling for a referendum on the final terms of the deal negotiated between the UK government and the EU. Leader Willie Rennie said MSPs should recognise that \\"voting for a departure is not the same as voting for a destination\\", accusing the Conservative UK government of seeking a \\"blank cheque Brexit\\" by pursuing exit from the EU at all costs. Scottish government Brexit minister Mike Russell said opposition parties had an \\"obsession with independence\\", saying their positions had \\"absolutely nothing to do with Europe\\". In the final votes each of the amendments was rejected in turn, winning support only from the parties putting them forward. Mr Brown's motion then passed by 65 votes to 32, with 20 abstentions.","output":"The Scottish National Party (SNP) has failed in its bid to unite Holyrood’s parties in a call to guarantee Scotland’s place in the single market.
