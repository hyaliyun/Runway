OPT: [+] reactor [+] magnet [+] generator [+] battery Answer the following question given this paragraph:   A battery is an electrochemical cell or series of cells that produces an electric current. In principle, any galvanic cell could be used as a battery. An ideal battery would never run down, produce an unchanging voltage, and be capable of withstanding environmental extremes of heat and humidity. Real batteries strike a balance between ideal characteristics and practical limitations. For example, the mass of a car battery is about 18 kg or about 1% of the mass of an average car or light-duty truck. This type of battery would supply nearly unlimited energy if used in a smartphone, but would be rejected for this application because of its mass. Thus, no single battery is “best” and batteries are selected for a particular application, keeping things like the mass of the battery, its cost, reliability, and current capacity in mind. There are two basic types of batteries: primary and secondary. A few batteries of each type are described next.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of fewer places for owls to perch could have both direct and indirect effects on the different stages of the bird reproduction and development process. 1. Mating: If there are fewer places for owls to perch, it may be harder for them to find a suitable place for courtship displays and mating rituals. They may need to expend more energy searching for an appropriate location, which could lead to lower mating success. 2. Nesting: Owls require secure places to build a nest and lay eggs. If the availability of good nesting sites is reduced, it can potentially limit the number of eggs that can be successfully laid and incubated. This could contribute to a decrease in the population of owls. 3. Incubation: If the remaining perching sites are not well-suited for incubating eggs, it may negatively impact the incubation process. A lower incubation success rate can lead to fewer bird hatchlings. 4. Rearing offspring: Parent birds require safe locations to rear, protect, and feed their growing offspring. Decreased availability of perching locations might make it harder for parents to meet these needs, which could cause a higher mortality rate among juveniles. 5. Learning to fly: Young birds need to learn to fly, often practicing from their perching location. If there are fewer suitable perching sites, it might take longer for fledglings to develop the necessary skills to fly successfully. This would increase their vulnerability to predators and potentially lead to a higher mortality rate. 6. Breeding: If fewer birds are able to leave the nest successfully and reach maturity due to the factors mentioned above, it can lead to a smaller breeding population in the future, potentially resulting in even fewer offspring overall. In summary, the perturbation of fewer places for owls to perch could have negative effects on various stages of the bird reproduction and development process, from mating and nesting to learning to fly and breeding. These effects can lead to a decrease in the overall bird population."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. As a mother, I’m right now navigating the hardest moment with my two daughters and my son … I was raped at 15 and molested by a teacher from 15–16 … it took 13 years of fighting before I saw any justice for those crimes and it paled in comparison to having to live with that trauma for the last 25 years. I thought I had moved past it for the most part, thanks to supportive family and lots of counseling and medication to treat my treatment resistant depression I’ve struggled over the last 25 years. I will be 40 this year. My son, the oldest, turned 15 this year … the same age I was when it began. I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally. Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim. I hope they grow up and see just how strong their mother is and how she has worked in the community to raise awareness and help others. Question: How does the mom feel about the world? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"The mother feels a mix of emotions about the world. On one hand, she has experienced a great deal of pain and suffering due to the traumatic events she faced in her teenage years. As a result, she cannot help but worry for her children's safety, particularly her daughters. She likely views the world with a sense of caution and concern, given her own experiences and how young she was when she was abused. On the other hand, the mother has also experienced support, healing, and growth through counseling, medication, and the love from her family. This demonstrates that there are people and resources in the world that can help survivors of trauma heal and move forward. Through her memoir and public speaking, she is working to raise awareness and help others, showing that she also believes in the power of change and the ability to make the world a better and safer place. In her efforts to educate her children about body safety and activism, she's striving to balance awareness and protection with empowering them to be strong, resilient individuals who don't need to fear the world. She hopes that her own strength and dedication to helping others, as well as the important values she instills in her children, will contribute to a more just and compassionate world. In summary, the mother feels a complex range of emotions about the world - from worry and fear arising from her traumatic past, to hope and determination as she works to create change and support others. It is a difficult balancing act, but she focuses on both protecting her children and teaching them to be strong and resilient, working towards a safer and more understanding world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Herbert was a blacksmith , and had a thriving trade making horseshoes. He was determined that his first-born son would follow him into the blacksmith. For this reason, Edward had to leave school at the age of 12,and worked with his father.  However, Edward was _ a blacksmith. Although he has an athletic body, he didn't have strong arms like his father, and he felt dizzy in the heat of the smithy. When he tried to find alternative employment, he found it difficult because he had never learnt to read or write.  One day, he went for an interview at a solictior's office. The job was a runner, taking documents from the office to other offices in the city. The solicitor was pleased to see that Edward was physically fit, but when he discovered that the young man couldn't read or write, he decided against employing him. \\"How can you deliver documents to other offices,\\" he asked, \\"if you can't read the addresses on them?\\"  Bitterly disappointed, Edward left the building and went to wait for a tram to take him back to the suburb where his father's smithy was. Next to the bus stop, a man was selling newspapers from a stand .  \\"Excuse me, son?\\" he said. \\"Would you look after my stand for a moment?\\"  For the next 20 minutes, Edward sold newspapers, lots of them. When the man came back, he was so delighted with his new assistant's honesty, that he offered him a job. Edward took it immediately.  In the next few months, the two men progressed from working on newspaper stands to selling newspapers, tobacco,confectionery and other goods in a shop. Then they opened a second shop, and a third. Eventually, they had a chain of 25 shops in three cities.  Edward became very rich, so he employed a tutor to teach him to read and write. The tutor was amazed at what Edward had achieved. \\"Imagine what you could do if you'd been able to read and write when you were younger!\\" he said.  \\"Yes!\\" said Edward. \\"I could have run myself to exhaustion delivering documents for a solicitor!\\" 1.

News article: To the extent that we think about them at all, people tend to regard dung beetles as entertainment, rolling, tumbling, even somersaulting over massive balls of elephant poop. But the 5,000 or so species at work on every continent except Antarctica are as important as pollinators.      Animals unload an estimated 100 billion tons of dung on Earth every day. Just one cow can drop 20 cowpats daily and quickly smother a landscape in manure. By bringing poop back to their underground nests and feeding it to their young, dung beetles not only clear pastureland and reopen it for grazing, but also help to cycle nutrients through the land, aerate soil, disperse seeds, and reduce the output of methane by 40 percent. Dung beetles \\"can potentially do in 48 hours what would take a couple years\\" for nature to accomplish without them, a Missouri livestock researcher recently enthused. Studies have valued the services provided by dung beetles to the cattle industry in the United States and the United Kingdom alone at about 910 million a year.      But like pollinators, dung beetles are now in trouble. That's partly from habitat loss, as forests and grasslands give way to agriculture. Poachers who kill 33,000 elephants and 1,200-plus rhinos every year also hurt dung beetles, because there's less poop for them to eat.      A bigger threat to their survival, though, may come from one of our most successful humanitarian efforts. Ivermectin, an antifilarial drug, is the essential tool in eradicating river blindness from the developing world. It's also the standard treatment for infection by a microfilarial worm that can cause elephantiasis, a grotesque swelling of the lower limbs. Over 30 years, ivermectin, distributed for free for these purposes by Merck & Co., has lifted hundreds of millions of the world's poorest people up from disability and despair. This past fall, the developers of ivermectin earned a share of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. It would be hard to imagine a discovery more worthy of the honor.      Ivermectin is also one of the most widely used veterinary drugs and, for many years, it made Merck more than 1 billion a year. Livestock producers all over the world administer it to control liver flukes, eye worms, lungworms, roundworms, mites, horn flies, ticks. In case all this seems remote, it also prevents your dog from getting heartworm and can cure your kids of head lice.      But a little-noticed study in the journal Scientific Reports suggests the drug has a major downside: Anywhere from 62 to 98 percent of every dose ends up in \\"highly toxic concentrations\\" in the recipient's droppings, where it eventually gets consumed by dung beetles.      When that happens, ivermectin can disrupt a dung beetle's ability to use its antennae to communicate, find a mate, or locate food. Even if the dung beetle could find its way, ivermectin also interferes with the movement of muscles in its forelegs.      When ivermectin knocks down the population of dung beetles in a cattle field, an extra 312 pounds of dung can pile up on every acre every year.      The study links the drug to the decline of seven dung beetle species across the Iberian Peninsula and by implication to similar declines elsewhere. To which anyone who has ever witnessed a person suffering the horrible effects of river blindness or elephantiasis might well reply, \\"So what?\\"      The answer looms larger than we might think: Ivermectin may be doing to dung beetles what DDT did to birds, what diclofenac did to vultures in India, or what neonicotinoid insecticides are thought to be doing to honeybees, now in decline worldwide. Companies keep finding great products to control one big problem without \\"thinking downstream at all,\\" said Sacha Spector, an environmental program director at the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation.      For instance, said Elizabeth Nichols, a Swarthmore College biologist, a healthy dung beetle population rapidly reduces the standing dung heaps that would otherwise host a variety of disease-causing worms. Anything that impairs that ability can inadvertently increase the number of pests and parasites—and thus the diseases that affect some of the poorest people on Earth. \\"It's ironic,\\" she said, \\"when you consider that we blanket large parts of the world with ivermectin\\" to treat diseases.      By one estimate, when ivermectin knocks down the population of dung beetles in a cattle field, an extra 312 pounds of dung pile up on every acre every year. More than a quarter of Earth's ice-free land—nearly 8 billion acres—is now being used to graze livestock, which means the great pileup is happening everywhere. And an extra burden of dung makes fields less productive, driving farmers to clear more land for pasturage.      So is there anything to be done? An article last year in Progressive Cattleman advised readers to administer ivermectin in injectable form so less of the drug passes through the animal and onto the field—and to use it only during cooler weather when dung beetles are dormant and there may be fewer cattle in the fields. But in warm climates \\"there really isn't a good time to do that,\\" said Norm Conrad, an agricultural specialist. He suggests limiting ivermectin treatment in animals to cases where parasitic infections are severe. That could have the added benefit of delaying the spread of ivermectin resistance, which has already begun to appear in some livestock parasites. Researchers are concerned it might also emerge in parasites that plague humans. People with river blindness infections have to take the drug once or twice a year for up to 18 years for a full cure. Widespread resistance to the drug, just as the world is on the brink of eradicating the disease, would be catastrophic.      They might not be as easy to romanticize as honeybees or butterflies flitting from flower to flower, but dung beetles rank high among the little things that run the planet. Given the potential effects of losing them, something about ivermectin no longer smells quite right. ||||| Research led by the University of Alicante's Ibero-American Centre for Biodiversity shows the adverse effects of a drug commonly administered to livestock, ivermectin, on populations of a key dung beetle in Mediterranean ecosystems.      A multidisciplinary research team made up of researchers from the Spanish universities of Alicante, Jaen and Granada, the French universities of Montpellier and Paul-Valéry Montpellier, CSIC's National Museum of Natural Sciences and the IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation has analysed the impact of ivermectin on Scarabaeus cicatricosus populations in the Mediterranean. Led by José R. Verdú from the Ibero-American Centre for Biodiversity (CIBIO) at the Universidad de Alicante (University of Alicante, UA), this research shows that arthropods that ingest this substance, even in low doses, become unable to interact with their surroundings since it affects both their olfactory and locomotor capacity. This fact may explain the population decline observed for this dung beetle.      The article \\"Low doses of Ivermectin cause sensory and musculoskeletal disorders in dung beetles\\" was published in Scientific Reports in September.      Ivermectin is a very effective anti-parasitic drug that has been used as a preventative in livestock since its discovery in 1981. Since then its use has increased exponentially to become a standard drug in the treatment and prevention of common parasites, including in human beings. Considered by the World Health Organization as an essential medication, Verdú points out that, although this drug has proven very effective, its widespread use comes at a price.      The issue, researchers have found, is that the ivermectin molecule can survive its journey through the animal and be excreted unchanged. Also, once on the ground, residues can remain active in animal dung for at least a month. This means the drug hits the arthropod populations as hard as it does the parasites it is intended to prevent. It is in this context that Verdú's team draws attention to the declining beetle populations, reporting that the ingestion of ivermectin affects even mature dung beetles, seriously compromising their mobility, orientation and reproductive capacities.      These findings contradict international veterinary manuals and yet offer an explanation for thedecline in population levels reported in other research.      For this study, researchers used electroantennography, olfactometry and muscle force tests for the first time to obtain measures of the insects' sensory and muscle power. It was carried out in the Doñana Natural Park in southern Spain, testing specimens taken from protected, ivermectin-free sites and land where ivermectin is used. Different rates of decomposition of dung were observed between the two sites, rates being some 30 percent lower in the sites where ivermectin was used. This can be ascribed to the absence of dung beetles as, without them, dung accumulates in the field unprocessed. With populations of beneficial dung feeder species declining over the past 20 to 30 years, \\"the difference between land with beetles and land without is the difference between roughly 350 kilograms of dung per hectare per year that is not being buried in areas affected by ivermectin,\\" the researcher said.      So aside from the lethal and sub-lethal effects of ivermectin on dung feeders, the use of this drug has a knock-on effect on the quality of the pasture for livestock, not to mention the irreparable loss of biodiversity in Mediterranean ecosystems. A further consequence is the growth of highly nitrophilous plants, which again are no good for livestock grazing. Researchers also speculate that ivermectin may be present in the food chain, pointing to the insectivorous birds that feed on dung beetles. ||||| Dung beetle behaviour has fascinated humans for thousands of years – including the ancient Egyptians, who incorrectly believed the beetles reproduced only from males. But Egyptian observations that the beetles’ ball rolling is influenced by the sun is accurate and could be the first recorded accounts of animal behaviour.      Dung beetles evolved at least 65 million years ago, as the dinosaurs were in decline, and the mammals (and their droppings) were getting bigger. There are about 6000 species worldwide, concentrated in the tropics where they feed mainly on the dung of terrestrial vertebrates.      Dung beetles have been cleaning up the planet ever since; but what on earth do they do with all that poo? Here are the top five most interesting.      Eat it      Vulgar and aggressive, but true. Dung beetles eat dung. But they are fussy eaters, picking out the big bits and concentrating on the tiniest particles, 2-70 microns big (1 micron = 1/1000 of a millimetre), which is where most of the nitrogen in dung is to be found.      All organisms need nitrogen to build proteins, such as muscle. Dung beetles get theirs from dung. By eating poo, dung beetles may be selecting the cells from the gut wall of the herbivore which made it. These are a protein-rich nitrogen source.      The latest studies show that obesity and diabetes in humans might be linked to our individual gut microbiomes. Dung beetles might be using their gut microbiome to help them digest the difficult components of dung.      Roll it – although only a minority do      90% of dung beetles tunnel directly beneath the dung pat and make an underground nest of brood balls in which they lay eggs. You’ll never see them unless you are prepared to poke around in the stuff.      On the other hand, the rollers transport their prize on the soil surface. They use celestial cues such as the sun or the moon to keep to a straight track away from competitors that might steal their ball.      There is one species which has been shown how to use the stars of the Milky Way as its celestial compass, allowing it to dominate the midnight market in dung transport.      Make a packed lunch      This is what the brood ball represents to the larval dung beetle. Hatching from a single egg inside each brood ball, the larva eats its way around the interior of the ball.      This dung is coarse and crunchy, so the larva has chewing mouthparts not found in the adult beetle, and doesn’t have the luxury of selecting what it can eat or discard, so it eats everything – several times. Therefore, its microbiome is different from their parents’, and might contain symbiotic microorganisms living in a mutually beneficial relationship with the host larva.      That gives the larva access to sugars in otherwise indigestible cellulose, and may even “fix” nitrogen from the atmosphere.      Marcus Byrne      Woo girlfriends      All that is needed is a small ball of poo. Place the poo at the base of a short tunnel, then retreat to the entrance where you stick your bum in to the air and release a pheromone which alerts nearby female beetles that you have a juicy prize for them. This is in return for sexual favours.      Pheromones are chemical messengers, which leave the body and are often associated with sexual attraction.      But sometimes the males cheat. They make the tunnel, do the head-standing trick to lure a naïve female, who after succumbing to his wiles discovers that males are not to be trusted – even the six-legged versions.      Chill on it      On a hot day in the Kalahari the soil surface can reach 60°C, which is death to any animal that can’t control its body temperature.      Dung beetles are small, and so is their thermal inertia. Consequently they heat up very rapidly. To avoid overheating while rolling their balls in the blazing midday sun, they climb on top of the ball to momentarily cool off, before hot-footing across the sand looking for shade. Giving them chilled dung balls from the fridge allows them to roll further before going back onto the ball.      Heated balls have the opposite effect. And giving them insulating silicon boots lets them tolerate high temperatures for longer, showing that the dung ball is used as a thermal refuge from the heat.      Each example shows how evolution has co-opted a single, seemingly odd behaviour of eating dung into a more sophisticated use of the same material in different roles, each of which have enhanced the animal’s survival. This ranges from making nuptial gifts to thermal refuges.      Those beetles that discovered these new behaviours by accident had more offspring, bearing their slightly different genes and behaviour into the next generation. This is where they became entrenched as an evolutionary adaptation to a successful way of life at the back-end of the food chain. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Dung beetles are very helpful because they clean poop from the environment, which helps in many ways, like making room for animals to graze, keeping the soil healthy, and even lessening gases that warm our planet. But, dung beetles are having a hard time because of changes we're making to their homes and because we're giving a medicine called ivermectin to animals.  This medicine is great for treating animals and even people with certain diseases, but when the animals poop, the medicine is still there, and when dung beetles eat this poop, they can get very sick. They can have trouble moving, smelling, and even finding mates. Without dung beetles, a lot of poop will accumulate that is bad for the environment. Scientists are suggesting we change how we use this medicine by injecting it directly into the animals or using it less often. They're worried that if we don't make changes, we could lose dung beetles completely, which would be bad for our planet.  In the meantime, dung beetles will continue to do their job of cleaning up for us, eating and rolling poop, even using it to attract mates or cool off in hot weather. While they may seem strange to us, dung beetles are truly important for Earth's health."},{"instruction":"Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

Answer:","output":"The information provided above is about Carlos Echeverri Cortés, a Colombian economist, diplomat, and politician. He was the Permanent Representative of Colombia to the United Nations and held various other political positions in Colombia, including the Colombian Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. Born on June 23, 1900, in Bogotá, Colombia, Carlos Echeverri Cortés was educated at the University of London and later became a respected economist. He was married to Gloria Rodríguez García and passed away on March 14, 1974, in Bogotá, Colombia. During his career, Echeverri Cortés had multiple successors at different points, such as Evaristo Sourdis Juliao, Carlos Albornoz, and Eduardo Zuleta Ángel. His terms in office had varying start and end dates, with his term as Permanent Representative of Colombia to the United Nations lasting from August 1952 to March 1953. As a member of the Conservative party in Colombia, Echeverri Cortés was deeply involved in national politics, following in the footsteps of others like Roberto Mariano Ospina Pérez, Urdaneta Arbeláez, Laureano Gómez Castro, and Roberto Urdaneta Arbeláez, who have all been Presidents of Colombia. His predecessors in various roles included Elíseo Arango Ramos and José Tomás Angulo. Carlos Echeverri Cortés' work and contributions were not limited to Colombia, as he represented his country at the United Nations. His position as Permanent Representative made him an ambassador from Colombia to this international organization. In this role, he had the opportunity to meet and work with prominent global figures, such as U.N. Secretary-General Trygve Lie. A photograph of their meeting, titled \\"Carlos Echeverri Cortés and Trygve Lie, UN photo.jpg,\\" captures this moment in history. Aside from his political career, Echeverri Cortés was a Roman Catholic and Colombian national. While there is no direct mention of Peru or Mexico in his biography, it is important to note that Latin America underwent significant political changes during his lifetime, with diplomatic relations and political alliances often evolving in the region. As a prominent figure in Colombian politics and diplomacy, it is likely that his work would have had some interaction or influence with neighboring countries like Peru and Mexico."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As a result, people from one culture often think the foods that people from another culture eat are unacceptable. Many people would find it terrible to eat rats, but there are forty-two different cultures whose people regard rats as proper food. Food likes and dislikes do not always seem related to nutrition. For example, broccoli   is first on a list of the most nutritious common vegetables, but it is twenty-first on a list of vegetables that Americans like most to eat. Tomatoes are sixteenth on the list of most nutritious vegetables, but they are first on the list of vegetables that Americans like most to eat. But dislikes is not the only reason why some cultures will not eat a certain food. In some cultures, certain foods are taboo. Taboo is a word from the language of the Fiji Islands that is used to describe something that is forbidden. We do not usually think about why certain things are taboo in our culture. One example is that Americans do not eat dogs, although people from some other cultures regard them as good food. In the United States, dogs are very important to people as pets. They are usually regarded as part of the family, almost like a child in some cases. In addition, dogs have value as protection against criminals  . Actually, the dog's place in society as a companion makes the dog taboo as food. Scientists believe that most food likes and dislikes are a result of the ways of life of different people. People will not eat pets such as dogs. Americans eat a lot of beef because there is plenty of land for raising cattle and their meat can be shipped cheaply for long distances by railroads.

PUBLISHED:. 07:59 EST, 4 November 2012. |. UPDATED:. 08:04 EST, 4 November 2012. A couple have told of their horror after discovering an earwig inside a sealed bag of bread rolls picked up on their weekly supermarket shop. Jane Naisbett, who bought the rolls at an Asda Superstore in Sunderland while shopping with her partner Gary MacPhail, said she was 'terrified' when she spotted the bug as she prepared to make some sandwiches. 'If I was partially sighted I might have eaten it,' the 53-year-old said. Shock: The couple say there is no way the earwig could have got into the bag after they brought it home as it was still completely sealed. The disgusted couple, from Hendon in Sunderland, complained to the store on the Leechmere Road Industrial Estate, but Asda bosses say they could not fully investigate because the pair did not leave the item with them. An inspection has since been carried out at the bakery but the supermarket said it found no evidence of insects. Ms Naisbett and her partner Mr MacPhail, a 47-year-old council worker, said they bought the rolls fresh on Monday and put them straight into their freezer when they got home. After removing them to defrost on Wednesday the couple say they found the earwig lurking inside the bag. Disgust: Gary MacPhail and Jane Naisbett, seen with the bread rolls, say they will be taking their business elsewhere. Mr MacPhail said: 'Jane lifted out the pack of rolls to make some sandwiches and when they had defrosted there was earwig inside the bag. 'The bag is still completely sealed, there's no way it could have got in there,' he added. Mr MacPhail claims he was offered a £5 voucher after taking the rolls back to Asda - although the store insists he was offered a £10 voucher as a goodwill gesture. His partner said she would be taking her business elsewhere. 'I've shopped there for over 20 years,' Ms Naisbett said. 'But I won't be setting foot in there again.' An Asda spokesman said: 'The quality of our products is our number one priority and we take any customer complaints incredibly seriously. 'We are at a loss to understand how this could have happened and unfortunately we were not given the opportunity to look at this product or investigate it properly. 'However, a thorough inspection of our bakery has found no evidence of any pests,' the spokesman added.","output":"1.

The other members did not take his statement seriously, until an article appeared in New Musical Express on 4 April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed without telling the rest of the Kinks. Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in the past, as a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.Ray Davies travelled to Los Angeles in April 1969 to help negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, opening up an opportunity for them to return to touring in the US. The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene. Before their return to the US, the Kinks recorded another album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). As with the previous two albums, Arthur was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical hooks. A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics. Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband, Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the Second World War. The Kinks embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969. The tour was generally unsuccessful, as the group struggled to find cooperative promoters and interested audiences; many of the scheduled concert dates were cancelled.

Would \\"A burn is a type of injury to flesh or skin caused by heat , electricity , chemicals , friction , or radiation .\\" be a reasonable answer?","output":"That statement (\\"A burn is a type of injury to flesh or skin caused by heat, electricity, chemicals, friction, or radiation.\\") is a correct definition of burns, but it doesn't answer the question about when to go to a burn center. A more appropriate answer would be: To determine whether a burn is severe enough to require treatment at a burn center, you should consider the following criteria: 1. Depth of the burn: Burns are classified into three degrees of severity:    a. First-degree burns: These only affect the outer layer of skin (the epidermis) and usually heal well without medical intervention.   b. Second-degree burns: These affect both the outer and underlying layer of skin (the dermis). They might require treatment at a burn center if they are deep, extensive, or present on critical body areas (face, hands, etc.).   c. Third-degree burns: These burns destroy both layers of skin along with nerves, blood vessels, and other tissues. They are critical to treat at a burn center as soon as possible. 2. Size of the burn: Larger burns (covering more than 10% of the body surface area in adults or 5% in children) typically need advanced care, which burn centers can provide. 3. Location of the burn: If the burn is in critical areas such as the face, hands, feet, or joints, it may be best to seek treatment from a burn center regardless of the burn's degree. 4. Presence of additional injuries: Burns accompanied by trauma or medical complications, such as broken bones or respiratory distress, should also be treated at a burn center. 5. High-risk populations: Children, elderly individuals, and those with weakened immune systems may benefit from the specialized care available at burn centers, even for less severe burns. When in doubt, it's best to seek professional medical advice to determine the appropriate course of action for treating a burn."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Susquehannock had become allied with the English in the Maryland colony in 1661. The English had grown fearful of the Iroquois and hoped an alliance with Susquehannock would help block the northern tribes' advance on the English colonies. In 1663 the Iroquois sent an army of 800 warriors into the Susquehannock territory. They repulsed the army, but the invasion prompted the colony of Maryland to declare war on the Iroquois. By supplying Susquehannock forts with artillery, the English in Maryland changed the balance of power away from the Iroquois. The Susquehannock took the upper hand and began to invade Iroquois territory, where they caused significant damage. This warfare continued intermittently for 11 years. In 1674 the English in Maryland changed their Indian Policy and negotiated peace with the Iroquois. They terminated their alliance with the Susquehannock. In 1675 the militias of Virginia and Maryland captured and executed the chiefs of the Susquehannock, whose growing power they feared. The Iroquois made quick work of the rest of the nation. They drove the warriors from traditional territory and absorbed the survivors in 1677. During the course of this conflict, in 1670 the Iroquois also drove the Siouan-speaking Mannahoac tribe out of the northern Virginia Piedmont region. The Iroquois claimed the land by right of conquest as a hunting ground. The English acknowledged this claim in 1674 and again in 1684. They acquired the land from the Iroquois by a 1722 treaty.","output":"Why did the Iroquois decide to attack the Susquehannock tribe after defeating the tribes in the north and west, and how did the English colony of Maryland get involved in the conflict between the two tribes?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English English:","output":"In Russia, HEU will be processed and converted into LEU, thus eliminating the possibility of using it in bomb production. Detailed answer: In Russia, the Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) will undergo a process to be converted into Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU). This conversion is a significant step in ensuring the reduction of nuclear weapon proliferation, as it diminishes the possibility of utilizing the uranium for bomb production.  Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) contains a higher percentage of the isotope U-235, usually over 20%, and is primarily used in the production of nuclear weapons. In contrast, Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU) contains less than 20% U-235 and is typically used in nuclear reactors for power generation. The process of converting HEU to LEU involves down-blending the uranium, thereby reducing the concentration of U-235 and making it unsuitable for nuclear weapon applications.  As part of international efforts to promote non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament, various programs and agreements have been established to encourage countries like Russia to convert their excess stockpiles of HEU into LEU. One such example is the Megatons to Megawatts Program, which was a joint initiative between the United States and Russia that aimed to down-blend Russian HEU into LEU for use in US commercial nuclear power plants. This program not only reduced the availability of weapons-grade material but also provided economic incentives for Russia by turning a potential threat into a valuable energy resource.  Therefore, the conversion of HEU into LEU in Russia plays a pivotal role in preventing the usage of this material in bomb production and promoting a more secure international landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Comisia este rugată să acorde o atenție sporită în ceea ce privește implementarea acestei politici și să analizeze posibilitatea introducerii acesteia într-un mod care să permită aderarea voluntară a celor implicați în proces. Este esențial ca orice decizie luată în acest sens să țină cont de nevoile, interesele și preocupările multiple ale membrilor și actorilor implicați, asigurându-se astfel că politica în cauză este adaptată în mod corespunzător cazurilor individuale și sectoriale. Introducerea unei astfel de politici pe bază voluntară în locul unei abordări obligatorii ar putea avea numeroase beneficii. În primul rând, un astfel de cadru ar permite organizatorilor și instituțiilor din diferite sectoare să evalueze și să se alinieze în mod eficient cu noile schimbări și cerințe. Astfel, în cazul în care o companie sau o organizație se confruntă cu provocări și obstacole specifice în implementarea acestei politici, procesul de adaptare și ajustare se va desfășura mai ușor și fără a crea riscuri sau presiuni nerezonabile. În al doilea rând, o abordare pe bază voluntară ar facilita evaluarea impactului politicii și identificarea modalităților în care aceasta poate fi perfecționată. De exemplu, în cazul în care un grup restrâns de organizații decide să adopte politica într-o fază pilot, ea poate genera informații și feed-back valoros privind aplicarea și impactul acesteia asupra diferitelor sectoare și activități. Aceste informații ar putea fi apoi folosite pentru a ajusta și adapta politica înainte de a o extinde la un public mai larg. În al treilea rând, o implementare voluntară ar putea contribui la creșterea gradului de acceptare și susținere a politicii în rândul tuturor actorilor implicați. Dacă oamenii și instituțiile consideră că au posibilitatea de a lua decizia cu privire la aplicarea politicii pe baza propriilor nevoi și circumstanțe și nu ca urmare a unei obligații impuse de o autoritate centrală, acest lucru poate contribui la o mai mare disponibilitate în a susține și a răspunde la provocările și cerințele politicii. În concluzie, reconsiderarea politicii și introducerea acesteia într-un cadru voluntar este o recomandare echilibrată și flexibilă, care ia în considerare necesitatea de a adapta măsurile și soluțiile politice la realitățile diferitelor sectoare și situații.

Aaliyah Dana Haughton (; January 16, 1979 – August 25, 2001) was an American singer, actress, and model. Born in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Detroit, Michigan, she first gained recognition at the age of 10, when she appeared on the television show Star Search and performed in concert alongside Gladys Knight. At the age of 12, Aaliyah signed with Jive Records and her uncle Barry Hankerson's Blackground Records. Hankerson introduced her to R. Kelly, who became her mentor, as well as lead songwriter and producer of her debut album, Age Ain't Nothing but a Number. The album sold 3 million copies in the United States and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). After facing allegations of an illegal marriage with Kelly, Aaliyah ended her contract with Jive and signed with Atlantic Records. Aaliyah worked with record producers Timbaland and Missy Elliott for her second album, One in a Million, which sold 3 million copies in the United States and more than 8 million copies worldwide. In 2000, Aaliyah appeared in her first film, Romeo Must Die. She contributed to the film's soundtrack, which spawned the single \\"Try Again\\". The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 solely on airplay, making Aaliyah the first artist in Billboard history to achieve this goal. \\"Try Again\\" also earned Aaliyah a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female R&B Vocalist.

Summarize: It was only the second time in the award's history that a children's book had won - and it was over a decade since Philip Pullman scooped the prize for The Amber Spyglass. But change could be afoot as, only last month, The Fox and the Star - an illustrated fable about a fox and his friend - beat the competition to be named Waterstones Book of the Year. Hardinge, delivering the winner's speech she had not thought she needed to prepare, urged more people to explore the \\"beautiful jungle\\" of children's and young adult (YA) fiction, whatever their age. Has the genre finally stepped out of the shadows to stand side-by-side with adult fiction? We asked authors and industry experts for their views: I think there has been a general sea change - and we're definitely seeing it now, a move away from considering children's literature to be a little bit more lightweight. I'd have been happy to see the Costa Book of the Year go to any children's book - but I'm very happy it's mine. The cross-over market is now much more established than it was. Many adults feel less self-conscious to be seen reading, enjoying and appreciating it. There has been interesting and complex children's and young adult fiction for quite some time, but in terms of the consumer landscape and people's attitudes, I think Harry Potter had a lot to do with it. There has been a tendency to make assumptions about the books, to deem them as simplistic. But now, people are seeing their complexity. The idea of the 'beautiful jungle' sprung to mind because it's a place of excitement, danger, beauty - and the unexpected. We have published seven books by her and to now get properly recognised in this way, because Costa is one of the largest awards, feels amazing. I think Frances does share some things with Philip Pullman, in that what she writes appeals to children and appeals to adults. They are adult books, but the main character happens to be a child of 14. You get adults and children picking up the books. I hope that Frances will reach a much broader audience. Children's books do tend to get less mainstream coverage than adult books, so when something like this happens, it's incredibly important. We really need to help parents, teachers and children themselves to have access to quality literature and find out about it. So anything that engages them, inspires them and gets them to read is really important. The wider world is realising what people within children's publishing have known for a while - which is that the quality and output is getting better, year on year. I don't think we're necessarily going to see children's and young adult books winning more adult book prizes, but in terms of people recognising the quality of children's literature, that will happen more often and people will pay more attention to children and young adult book prizes - there are so many of them. As CS Lewis said, 'A children's story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children's story in the slightest' - and I think that's definitely the case. For far too long, people have had this idea in their heads that children's and teenagers' literature was somehow inferior. But the children's market has grown more quickly than the adult book market and hasn't been affected by the digital drive. Hopefully, we will see more and more people recognising the quality of a really great children's book. YA fiction has been dismissed as 'issue lit', but The Lie Tree shows it can be incredibly varied and very diverse. It can be very difficult for children's books to go up against adult books, but The Lie Tree has a wider appeal beyond younger readers. In the UK in particular, we have such a rich heritage of children's books, going all the way back to Alice in Wonderland - there is such a rich seam, and some of the very best books are actually for children. Now, in terms of writing and production, children's publishers have really stepped up to the plate. The Fox and the Star was about the quality and the beautiful design, while the Lie Tree is really about the storytelling and richness. But I honestly don't know if I think it's going to be less rare for them to win such awards. I have definitely noticed within the industry there's a lot more respect for children's publishing and children's book selling as a crucial part of the market. Children's books are selling so well, that people have been paying more attention.\\" I feel that a story is a story, regardless of age, and this is something that has been recognised this year by the Costa awards, which is fantastic. I don't think it's the case it makes the genre more credible, it's just that other parts of the book publishing industry are realising that there is an inventiveness, enjoyment and profundity in these books which appeals to readers. The books have to stand up to being read many times, and have layers of meaning, and it's something that the industry now realises. There was such a big gap between the last children's book winning Costa book of the year and now, so we can only hope there will now be more. And to have two awards for children in a short space of time is great.\\" I think Frances' prize is such a brilliant thing for young adult fiction. For me, YA has been the biggest success story of the publishing industry over the past 25 years. Publishers were aware because of the sales figures, and young readers were aware, but it never got the critical attention it merited. This [Costa award] has forced people to sit up and take notice of how great this fiction is. There's been a traditional view in certain quarters that writing for children or teenagers is easier than writing for adults. Having done both, I can say it isn't. There can also be a view it isn't 'proper' literature, but anyone who reads it would be surprised at just how good the books are - they aren't inferior in literary terms. But it takes a long time for these attitudes to disappear. I hope if enough of these books come to the public's attention, it will gradually erode this misconceived ideas. It could be another 15 years before another children's book wins the Costa award - but it's a step in the right direction and will lead to more awareness.","output":"Recently, a children's book won a big award for the second time ever. This happened more than 10 years after the first time. People who write and work with children's books think this is great because it shows that these books can be just as good as books for grown-ups. They believe that more people should read and enjoy children's books, no matter how old they are. Some people used to think that children's books were simpler and not as interesting as adult books, but now they are changing their minds and understanding that children's books can also be complex and exciting. This could help children's books get more attention and be more popular in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The life of 15th century French serial killer Gilles de Rais is believed to be the basis of which story by Charles Perrault?","output":"The life of Gilles de Rais, a 15th century French serial killer, is believed to be the basis for the story \\"Bluebeard\\" by Charles Perrault. This French literary fairy tale, published in 1697 as \\"La Barbe bleue\\" in \\"Histoires ou Contes du temps passé, avec des moralités,\\" features a wealthy, aristocratic man with a blue beard who has been married several times, but whose previous wives have all mysteriously vanished. Similarities between Gilles de Rais and Bluebeard are numerous and striking, making a connection between the two figures quite plausible. Gilles de Rais was born in 1404 into a wealthy family with multiple castles and lands in Brittany, France. Raised by his grandmother after he was orphaned, he became a page and squire, eventually joining the French army under the command of Joan of Arc. Following successful military campaigns, he was made Marshal of France. Throughout his life, de Rais had a keen interest in art, theatre, alchemy, and other intellectual pursuits. However, his excessive spending plunged him into financial turmoil, and he was forced to sell some of his properties. In 1440, Gilles de Rais was arrested and later convicted for the abduction, torture, and murder of dozens, if not hundreds, of children—many of whom were boys from lower social classes. He was executed by hanging and burning in 1440 at the age of 36. The gruesome details of his murderous deeds, which involved luring young victims into his castle, mirror Bluebeard's actions in Perrault's story. In \\"Bluebeard,\\" the titular character marries a beautiful, young woman after having been rejected by other ladies due to his blue beard—a symbol of evil and deception. In the story, he leaves his new wife in charge of their castle and provides her with a set of keys, but forbids her from using one particular key to unlock a room. Out of curiosity, the wife disobeys and discovers the corpses of Bluebeard's previous wives, revealing his dark secrets. The plot unfolds as the wife desperately attempts to escape the wrath of Bluebeard, leading to the climactic moment when her brothers save her and put an end to Bluebeard's violent acts. Considering the historical context and eerie similarities between Gilles de Rais and the character Bluebeard, it is widely believed that Perrault took inspiration from the life of the notorious 15th-century French serial killer to create his dark and cautionary tale."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Theodore II Doukas Laskaris or Ducas Lascaris (\\"Theodros II Doukas Laskaris\\") (1221/1222  August 18, 1258) was Emperor of Nicaea from 1254 to 1258.  - Late Antiquity is a periodization used by historians to describe the time of transition from classical antiquity to the Middle Ages in mainland Europe, the Mediterranean world, and the Middle East. The development of the periodization has generally been accredited to historian Peter Brown, after the publication of his seminal work \\"The World of Late Antiquity\\" (1971). Precise boundaries for the period are a continuing matter of debate, but Brown proposes a period between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Generally, it can be thought of as from the end of the Roman Empire's Crisis of the Third Century (c. 235  284) to, in the East, the early Islamic period (7th9th centuries), following the Muslim conquests in the mid7th century. In the West the end was earlier, with the start of the Early Medieval period typically placed in the 6th century, or earlier on the Western edges of the empire.  - A capital city (or simply capital) is the municipality exercising primary status in a country, state, province, or other region, usually as its seat of government. A capital is typically a city that physically encompasses the offices and meeting places of its respective government; the status as capital is often designated by its law or constitution. In some jurisdictions, including several countries, the different branches of government are located in different settlements. In some cases, a distinction is made between the official (constitutional) capital and the seat of government, which is in another place.  - Constantine the Great (27 February 272 AD  22 May 337 AD), also known as Constantine I or Saint Constantine (in the Orthodox Church as Saint Constantine the Great, Equal-to-the-Apostles), was a Roman Emperor from 306 to 337 AD. Constantine was the son of Flavius Valerius Constantius, a Roman Army officer, and his consort Helena. His father became \\"Caesar\\", the deputy emperor in the west, in 293 AD. Constantine was sent east, where he rose through the ranks to become a military tribune under the emperors Diocletian and Galerius. In 305, Constantius was raised to the rank of \\"Augustus\\", senior western emperor, and Constantine was recalled west to campaign under his father in Britannia (Britain). Acclaimed as emperor by the army at Eboracum (modern-day York) after his father's death in 306 AD, Constantine emerged victorious in a series of civil wars against the emperors Maxentius and Licinius to become sole ruler of both west and east by 324 AD.  - The Count of Flanders was the ruler or sub-ruler of the county of Flanders, beginning in the 9th century. The title was held for a time by the Holy Roman Emperor and the King of Spain. During the French Revolution in 1790, the county of Flanders was annexed to France and the peerage ceased to exist. In the 19th century, the title was appropriated by Belgium and granted twice to younger sons of the King of the Belgians. The most recent holder died in 1983.  - Constantinople  was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD.  - An empire is defined as \\"an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former British Empire, French Empire, Brazilian Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire.\\" An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire.  - The Empire of Romania, more commonly known in historiography as the Latin Empire or Latin Empire of Constantinople, and known to the Byzantines as the Latin Occupation, was a feudal Crusader state founded by the leaders of the Fourth Crusade on lands captured from the Byzantine Empire. It was established after the capture of Constantinople in 1204 and lasted until 1261. The Latin Empire was intended to supplant the Byzantine Empire as the titular Roman Empire in the east, with a Western Roman Catholic emperor enthroned in place of the Eastern Orthodox Roman emperors. Baldwin IX, Count of Flanders, was crowned the first Latin emperor as Baldwin I on 16 May 1204. The Latin Empire failed to attain political or economic dominance over the other Latin powers that had been established in former Byzantine territories in the wake of the Fourth Crusade, especially Venice, and after a short initial period of military successes it went into a steady decline. Weakened by constant warfare with the Bulgarians and the unconquered sections of the empire, it eventually fell when Byzantines recaptured Constantinople under Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261. The last Latin emperor, Baldwin II, went into exile, but the imperial title survived, with several pretenders to it, until the 14th century.  - The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\".  - The Empire of Trebizond or the Trapezuntine Empire was a monarchy that flourished during the 13th through 15th centuries, consisting of the far northeastern corner of Anatolia and the southern Crimea. Originally formed during a revolt against the usurpation of the imperial throne by the grandsons of Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos, Trebizond (current Trabzon, Turkey, with which the name of the empire is a cognate) became a Byzantine Greek successor state established after the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine) in the Fourth Crusade, along with the Empire of Nicaea and the Despotate of Epirus. The Emperors of Trebizond pressed their claim on the Imperial throne for decades after the Nicaean reconquest of Constantinople in 1261.  - The Empire of Nicaea was the largest of the three Byzantine Greek successor states founded by the aristocracy of the Byzantine Empire that fled after Constantinople was occupied by Western European and Venetian forces during the Fourth Crusade. Founded by the Laskaris family, it lasted from 1204 to 1261, when the Nicaeans restored the Byzantine Empire in Constantinople.  - The Fall of Constantinople ('; Conquest of Istanbul) was the capture of the capital of the Byzantine Empire by an invading army of the Ottoman Empire on 29 May 1453. The Ottomans were commanded by the then 21-year-old Mehmed the Conqueror, the seventh sultan of the Ottoman Empire, who defeated an army commanded by Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos. The conquest of Constantinople followed a 53-day siege that had begun on 6 April 1453.  - Alexios Komnenos Strategopoulos ( Greek :    ) was a Byzantine general during the reign of Michael VIII Palaiologos , rising to the rank of megas domestikos and Caesar . Of noble descent , he appears in the sources already at an advanced age in the early 1250s , leading armies for the Empire of Nicaea against Epirus . After falling out of favour and being imprisoned by Theodore II Laskaris , Strategopoulos sided with the aristocrats around Michael Palaiologos , and supported him in his rise to the throne after Theodore II 's death in 1258 . He participated in the Pelagonia campaign in 1259 , going on to capture Epirus , but his successes were undone in the next year and he was captured by the Epirotes . Released after a few months , he led the unexpected reconquest of Constantinople from the Latin Empire in July 1261 , restoring the Byzantine Empire . He was captured again by the Epirotes in the next year and spent several years in captivity in Italy , before being released . He retired from public affairs and died in the early 1270s .  - Michael VIII Palaiologos or Palaeologus (\\"Mikhal VIII Palaiologos\\"; 1223  11 December 1282) reigned as Byzantine Emperor 12591282. Michael VIII was the founder of the Palaiologan dynasty that would rule the Byzantine Empire until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. He recovered Constantinople from the Latin Empire in 1261 and transformed the Empire of Nicaea into a restored Byzantine Empire.  - Istanbul (or ), historically known as Constantinople and Byzantium, is the most populous city in Turkey and the country's economic, cultural, and historic center. Istanbul is a transcontinental city in Eurasia, straddling the Bosphorus strait (which separates Europe and Asia) between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea. Its commercial and historical center lies on the European side and about a third of its population lives on the Asian side. The city is the administrative center of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (coterminous with Istanbul Province), both hosting a population of around 14.7 million residents. Istanbul is one of the world's most populous cities and ranks as the world's 7th-largest city proper and the largest European city.  - The Laskaris or Lascaris family was a Byzantine Greek noble family whose members formed the ruling dynasty of the Empire of Nicaea from 1204 to 1261 and remained among the senior nobility up to the dissolution of the Byzantine Empire, whereupon many emigrated to Italy and then to Smyrna (much later). According to George Pachymeres, they were also called Tzamantouros (T). The feminine form of the name is Laskarina ().  - Komnenos, Latinized Comnenus, plural Komnenoi or Comneni (, pronounced /komniní/), is the name of a noble family who ruled the Byzantine Empire from 1081 to 1185, and later, as the Grand Komnenoi (, \\"Megalokomnenoi\\") founded and ruled the Empire of Trebizond (12041461). Through intermarriages with other noble clans, notably the Doukai, Angeloi, and Palaiologoi, the Komnenos name appears among most of the major noble houses of the late Byzantine world.

Each time the events unfold from the beginning, a new vantage point is shown revealing additional details, which ultimately completes the story of what actually took place during the incident.[2] From the first vantage point, GNN producer Rex Brooks (Weaver), directs various media personnel from a mobile television studio as the president arrives at the gathering. Mayor De Soto (Rodriguez) delivers a short speech and then introduces the president, who is shot twice as he greets the crowd from the podium. An explosion outside the plaza soon follows. Moments later, the podium itself is destroyed by a secondary explosion, killing and injuring numerous people. As the smoke clears, GNN reporter Angie Jones (Saldana) is seen lying dead in the rubble.[2] The second vantage point follows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes (Quaid) and Kent Taylor (Fox). Barnes notices a curtain fluttering in the window of a nearby building that was allegedly vacated. He also observes American tourist Howard Lewis (Whitaker) filming the audience. After the president is shot, Barnes tackles a man rushing to the podium named Enrique (Noriega). Taylor pursues a lead to a potential assassin. Following the second explosion, Barnes barges into the GNN production studio and asks to view their footage. He calls Taylor, who reports the direction of the suspected assassin's escape route. Barnes then views an image on one of the camera's live feeds that startles him and prompts him to run out.[2] In the third vantage point, Enrique, a Spanish police officer assigned to protecting the mayor of Salamanca, sees his girlfriend Veronica (Zurer), being embraced by a stranger and overhears them speaking about meeting under an overpass.

(AP) — Police are searching for a 6-year-old boy who is believed to have wandered away from his home in suburban Denver on New Year's Eve, authorities said.      The FBI and other law enforcement agencies helped in the hunt for David Puckett on Monday, going door-to-door within 2.5 miles of his home in Aurora. Bloodhounds and a helicopter have also been used.      An Amber Alert was issued and police said a 10,000 reward was offered.      Aurora police appealed for help to find David as quickly as possible partly because of coming cold weather, with lows expected in the upper teens.      \\"The public can help by physically searching their homes, automobiles, and any structures on their property where a child may be able to hide,\\" a police statement said.      Authorities have said that foul play isn't suspected, but they said they have contacted registered sex offenders who live in the area and have searched nearby bodies of water.      Monday evening, police disclosed that someone outside the family had seen the boy the day he went missing, but they didn't elaborate.      The FBI told the Denver Post that the agency assigned 50 agents to the case, including one who is highly specialized in missing children searches.      His mother on Sunday issued a tearful appeal for people to help find him and said he was only wearing a light jacket.      Police said David has wandered off before. ||||| Police and FBI officers intensified their search Monday for a missing 6-year-old Aurora boy who police say wandered away from home on New Year’s Eve as the temperature was expected to drop into the upper teens.      The Colorado Bureau of Investigation issued an Amber alert Monday for David Puckett because of the cold weather and the amount of time the boy has been missing, Aurora police spokesman Crystal McCoy said.      As night fell Monday, police held a news briefing as FBI agents again canvassed the neighborhood where the boy lived with his family, which includes three juvenile siblings. Authorities planned to continue their search well into the night, McCoy said.      David disappeared from his home in the 15700 block of Amherst Avenue around 5:30 p.m. New Year’s Eve. Some family members were home, McCoy said. She did not disclose who was there.      Police also said someone outside the family had seen the boy the day he went missing, but McCoy did not elaborate on who that was or where or when the sighting was made.      The family searched for David for an hour before calling Aurora police. And the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office had its bloodhound on the trail within an hour of Aurora police receiving the call, McCoy said.      There has been no indication that police have found any sign of David since the search began.      Although police said they have no indication of foul play, officials emphasized the investigation was ongoing, McCoy said. The FBI joined the investigation because of the increased resources the bureau can provide.      The FBI has assigned 50 agents to the case, including one who is highly specialized in missing children searches, said Deborah Sherman, an FBI spokeswoman. The FBI has set up a command post although Aurora police remains the lead agency in the search.      More than 100 officers joined the searched on Monday, including the Arapahoe County water rescue team and officers from area police and sheriffs departments.      Police have contacted registered sex offenders who live in the area and have searched nearby bodies of water looking for any signs of cracked ice, McCoy said. Police and FBI agents canvassed neighborhoods and set up checkpoints to notify motorists of the search.      David’s family has cooperated with police, who have searched the family home multiple times, McCoy said.      On Monday evening, the CBI issued a statement about the decision to issue an Amber Alert three days after the boy was first reported missing.      While the circumstances surrounding David’s disappearance have not changed, the bureau decided to activate the alert out of an abundance of caution.      The alert is one tool that can be used to disseminate information that already has been released about the boy and his disappearance, the CBI statement said. The statement praised Aurora police, saying that department “has been exceptional” in using the media and social media to relay information about the search.      Aurora police have said they consulted with the CBI about a possible Amber Alert since the child first was reported missing. However, David’s disappearance had not met the criteria for Amber Alert notifications.      The CBI will continue to communicate with Aurora police and provide resources as needed, the statement said.      Earlier Monday, volunteers were called to join the search, which has been confined to a 2.5-mile area. By mid-afternoon, police had asked volunteers to stop looking for Puckett because their efforts could disrupt the work of the bloodhounds who were on the trail again.      “We are continuing to do thorough searches of the neighborhood,” McCoy said. “We will notify people once again when we’re ready for the community to start searching.”      Authorities were also looking for residential and commercial video to aid in their investigation, McCoy said. She asked anyone who finds any evidence that they think could be related to David’s disappearance to call police rather than pick items up or post images of them on social media.      Police were growing more concerned Monday night as the search extended beyond 48 hours and with temperatures headed toward the teens. The boy was not appropriately dressed to be out all night in freezing temperatures.      David attends Dartmouth Elementary, where he wandered away once before. Previous reports that the boy had wandered away from home more than once do not appear to be true. McCoy said Aurora Public Schools were making mental health professionals available to staff and students.      “At this time we believed he wandered off,” McCoy said. “We have one documented instance where he wandered off from school.”      Aurora police Chief Nick Metz said on Sunday there was no evidence of a kidnapping.      “That could change as the investigation moves forward,” Metz said.      David is about 4 feet tall and weighs 48 pounds. He has light brown hair and blue-green eyes. He was last seen wearing green camouflage pants, a black T-shirt, orange boots and a tan girl’s coat, according to police.      The boy’s mother made a tearful plea Sunday for the public’s help, emphasizing that the coat was not very thick.      “If you guys can, please help me find him. If you see him, please call the police immediately. If, by chance, you picked him up last night because you thought it would be best please bring my baby home,” she said.      Aurora police are asking those with information to call any of their tip lines: 303-739-1865, 303-739-1868 or 303-739-1870. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A 6-year-old boy named David Puckett went missing in Aurora, Colorado, on New Year's Eve and is believed to have wandered away from his home.

Q: The grasp reflex in humans is an example of what kind of behavior?    Choices:  - habit  - inclination  - trait  - innate  A: Answer:","output":"The grasp reflex in humans is an example of innate behavior. Innate behaviors are those that are genetically predetermined and appear in an individual's repertoire without the need for learning or prior experience. Such behaviors are present from birth and are crucial for the survival and development of the organism. The grasp reflex, also known as the palmar grasp reflex, is a primitive reflex observed in infants. When an object is placed in an infant's palm or their hand is gently stroked, the infant's fingers will involuntarily close around the object or the stimulating finger. This reflex serves the essential purpose of ensuring that infants are able to hold onto their caregiver or objects for support and safety. Innate behaviors differ from habits, inclinations, and traits in several ways: 1. Habits are acquired behaviors that develop over time through repeated actions or experiences. They are not present from birth and require learning and conditioning to form. Innate behaviors, on the other hand, do not require learning or prior experience. 2. Inclinations refer to a natural tendency or predisposition to behave in a certain manner or to have a certain preference. While they may have some genetic basis, inclinations are often influenced by an individual's environment or learned experiences. Innate behaviors, however, are solely determined by genetics and are not influenced by the environment or experience. 3. Traits are characteristics or qualities that mark an individual's personality, temperament, or physical attributes. Traits can be influenced by genetic factors, as well as environmental factors and personal experiences. Innate behaviors, in contrast, are solely determined by an individual's genetic makeup and are not influenced by external factors. In conclusion, the grasp reflex in humans is an example of an innate behavior because it is present from birth and requires no learning or prior experience. This genetically predetermined behavior is essential for the survival and development of the infant, as it enables them to securely hold onto their caregiver or objects for support and safety."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Soon after, George is struck blind when he enters a previously unexplored tomb. Upon their return in New York City, George is informed that the loss of his eyesight will only be temporary. Susie begins to act strangely, and her younger brother Tommy (Giovanni Frezza), who stayed behind in New York with the family's au pair Jamie Lee (Cinzia de Ponti), is also affected by the mysterious amulet. Both Susie and Tommy have gained supernatural access to dimensional doorways. A few days later, George's eyesight returns, and he describes the design on the wall of the tomb he'd entered to a colleague called Wiler. A little while later, Luke Anderson (Carlo De Mejo), an eccentric colleague of Emily's, arrives to work with her on her latest story detailing her travels in Egypt. When Luke hears a noise coming from Susie's bedroom, he goes in, only to be sucked into the dimensional portal and finds himself transported to the deserts of Egypt where he later dies from dehydration in the vast, arid desert. The Hackers think Luke's disappearance is merely a practical joke, but they never learn of his fate, nor find any trace of him. Jamie Lee takes the kids out to nearby Central Park to play where she takes photos of them. A woman picks up a discarded Polaroid photo taken of Susie. It shows nothing but the amulet against the grassy background. The woman contacts a man called Adrian Marcato (Laurence Welles) with her find.

Write an article based on this summary: Dog walkers have been ordered to bin their pet's waste after a deer's stomach was found to be full of plastic poo bags at a park in Leicestershire. Article:","output":"Title: Poo Bag Usage Urged for Dog Walkers After Deer Found With Stomach Full of Plastic Bags in Leicestershire Park Introduction: Dog walkers in Leicestershire are now being strictly advised to use the bins provided to dispose of their pet's waste, after a distressing incident took place at a local park. The issue gained attention when a deer was discovered, its stomach filled with plastic poop bags. The incident has highlighted the importance of proper pet waste disposal for ensuring the well-being of the environment and safety of local wildlife. (Step 1: Start with an attention-grabbing title and a brief introduction) First Section: Importance of Waste Disposal Proper disposal of dog waste plays a crucial role in maintaining cleanliness and hygiene in public spaces. It prevents the spread of diseases, while also safeguarding wildlife and the environment from the hazards of plastic pollution. The irresponsible actions of some dog walkers, such as leaving plastic poo bags in parks and green spaces, can lead to dire consequences for park ecosystems and their inhabitants. (Step 2: Discuss the importance of waste disposal)  Second Section: Impact of Plastic Waste on Wildlife Leicestershire parkgoers were stunned and concerned when a deer was found with a stomach full of plastic poo bags. Plastics, especially discarded bags, pose significant dangers to wildlife like deer, who may accidentally consume them while grazing on vegetation. Having a stomach full of plastic can be fatal for animals, as it causes digestive blockages and even chemical poisoning. (Step 3: Highlight the impact of plastic waste on wildlife) Third Section: Consequences of Ignoring Park Rules Besides the detrimental environmental and wildlife impact, disregarding the park's rules on waste disposal can result in fines for dog owners. Various parks in Leicestershire have placed bins specially designed for disposing of pet waste, but some individuals continue to ignore these facilities. Strict enforcement of these regulations is essential to prevent similar incidents from occurring. (Step 4: Mention consequences for dog owners who ignore park rules) Fourth Section: Encouraging Responsible Dog Ownership Responsible dog owners must ensure that they are carrying poo bags and use park-provided bins to dispose of their pet's waste correctly. To further foster responsible dog ownership within the community, parks could organize educational events that engage and inform the public about proper waste disposal practices. Additionally, reminders and signage around the parks can serve as a prompt for dog walkers to adhere to the rules and care for the environment. (Step 5: Promote responsible dog ownership and suggest improvements) Conclusion: The unfortunate incident of the deer found with a stomach full of plastic poo bags in Leicestershire serves as a stark reminder to dog walkers about the importance of responsible pet waste disposal. Proper waste management not only benefits the environment but also safeguards the well-being of wildlife living within these shared public spaces. It falls upon every dog owner to ensure that the parks remain clean and safe for everyone to enjoy.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Another possible benefit of aggregation is to protect against predation by group anti-predator behavior. Many species exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual at lower density. This increased vigilance might result in less time and energy spent on foraging, thus reducing the fitness of an individual living in smaller groups. One striking example of such shared vigilance is exhibited by meerkats. Meanwhile, other species move in synchrony to confuse and avoid predators such as schools of sardines and flocks of starlings. The confusion effect that this herding behavior would have on predators will be more effective when more individuals are present.Cooperative feeding  Now, I have a new situation: In the sub-Saharan African country of Nigeria, there are two main species that tend to travel in groups. The antelope tend to travel in groups in high numbers, and thus exhibit a high density. Meanwhile, the bison tend to travel in groups of small numbers, and therefore exhibit low density. Both the antelope and the bison have natural predators that exist in Nigeria.  Answer this question please: Individuals from which species, the antelope or the bison, will have higher rates of predator vigilance behavior? Answer:","output":"In the scenario provided, the antelope and bison are both species that reside in Nigeria and have natural predators. To determine which of these species will exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior, we need to consider the information provided about their group density and the concept of aggregation. Aggregation, or group formation, has been postulated to serve as a defense mechanism against predation. The more individuals present in a group, the more effective it becomes for the species to hinder or avoid the attention of predators. There are different strategies used by the species, such as shared vigilance (as in the example of meerkats), or synchronized movement leading to the confusion effect (like schools of sardines and flocks of starlings). It is stated that many species exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual at lower density. In the context of the Nigeria example, antelopes tend to travel in high numbers, resulting in a high-density group. In contrast, bison travel in smaller groups, resulting in a low-density group. Based on the information provided, we can infer that individuals from the bison species, which travel in smaller, low-density groups, will have higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual. This is because the smaller groups lead to each bison needing to be more vigilant about predators, potentially due to the reduced effectiveness of the confusion effect or a lower likelihood of shared vigilance among individuals. Although this increased vigilance may help bison detect and avoid predators more effectively, it should be noted that it might also result in trade-offs, such as reduced foraging efficiency. The energy and time spent on increased vigilance may detract from other crucial activities like feeding, which could ultimately influence the overall fitness of these individuals in the long run. In conclusion, individuals from the bison species, which travel in low-density groups, are more likely to exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual in comparison to the high-density antelope groups."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Michael C. van Walt van Praag writes that Godan granted Sakya Pandita temporal authority over a still politically fragmented Tibet, stating that \\"this investiture had little real impact\\" but it was significant in that it established the unique \\"Priest-Patron\\" relationship between the Mongols and the Sakya lamas. Who was the leader of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism?","output":"The leader of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism during the time of Mongol prince Godan's attack in 1240 was Sakya Pandita (1182–1251)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Two triangles can be proved similar by the angle-angle theorem which states: if two triangles have two congruent angles, then those triangles are similar. [substeps] This theorem is also called the angle-angle-angle (aaa) theorem because if two angles of the triangle are congruent, the third angle must also be congruent. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? There are ways to tell if triangles are similar","output":"Yes, the next sentence follows given the preceding text. In the context of discussing the Angle-Angle (AA) or Angle-Angle-Angle (AAA) theorem, the statement \\"There are ways to tell if triangles are similar\\" is relevant as it introduces various methods to prove the similarity of triangles. To provide a detailed and long answer on proving similar triangles and understanding the angle-angle (AA) theorem, let us discuss additional ways of proving triangle similarity and elaborate on the AA theorem. 1. Angle-Angle (AA) Theorem: The AA theorem states that if two angles of one triangle are congruent to two angles of another triangle, then those triangles are similar. Since the sum of interior angles of any triangle is 180 degrees, knowing two angles are congruent in each triangle automatically implies that the third angle must be congruent as well. Hence, it is also called the Angle-Angle-Angle (AAA) theorem. To use this theorem for proving two triangles to be similar:     a. Identify the pairs of congruent angles in both triangles.     b. Ensure the angles are in the same positions in their respective triangles.     c. Conclude that the triangles are similar based on the AA theorem. 2. Side-Side-Side (SSS) Similarity Theorem: The Side-Side-Side (SSS) Similarity theorem states that if the corresponding sides of two triangles are proportional, then those triangles are similar. If all three sides of one triangle have the same ratio of lengths as the three sides of another triangle, the triangles are similar. To use the SSS theorem to prove similarity:     a. Identify the corresponding side pairs of the triangles.     b. Check whether the side lengths are proportional by finding the ratio between each pair of sides.     c. If all three ratios are equal, conclude that the triangles are similar using the SSS theorem. 3. Side-Angle-Side (SAS) Similarity Theorem: The SAS Similarity theorem states that if an angle of one triangle is congruent to an angle of another triangle and the sides including that angle are proportional, then those triangles are similar. To use the SAS theorem to prove similarity:     a. Identify the congruent angle pairs and the pairs of sides that include the congruent angles in both triangles.     b. Check whether the side lengths including the congruent angles are proportional by finding the ratio between each pair of sides.     c. If the ratio is equal and the included angles are congruent, conclude that the triangles are similar using the SAS theorem. In conclusion, given the Angle-Angle (AA) theorem, the following sentence \\"There are ways to tell if triangles are similar\\" is valid and correlates with the previous text. To prove that two triangles are similar, you can use one of the three primary methods: Angle-Angle (AA) theorem, Side-Side-Side (SSS) Similarity theorem, or Side-Angle-Side (SAS) Similarity theorem. Understanding these methods will enable you to determine the similarity between triangles effectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Katrina worked in a smaller hospital..","output":"B). Katrina worked in a smaller hospital. Megan and Katrina were both highly skilled and dedicated nurses, each working tirelessly and devoting themselves to their passion for helping and healing others. Megan worked at a large, bustling metropolitan hospital, widely known for its comprehensive and cutting-edge medical care. In contrast, Katrina worked at a smaller, community-focused hospital in a quiet rural town.  The sheer size of Megan's hospital provided her with a constant flow of patients to attend to, as they were admitted off the busy city streets. From minor injuries and illnesses to critical patients struggling with life-threatening conditions, Megan faced an endless variety of medical challenges every day. She was consistently under pressure to maintain a high level of efficiency due to the high demands of her workplace. Nevertheless, she loved her job, as she believed that her work made a positive impact on countless lives. Katrina's small-town hospital, on the other hand, catered to a much smaller and more close-knit community. While the medical issues she encountered were typically less complex, Katrina appreciated the relationships she formed with her patients and their families, which provided her with a sense of connection and belonging that was sometimes lacking in larger medical facilities. The slower pace also allowed her to offer patients more personal and holistic care, as she was frequently able to spend more time with each individual and engage more deeply in their health journey. Despite the differences in scale, both Megan and Katrina shared a fierce commitment to providing the best care possible for their patients. They each found satisfaction in their respective working environments, valuing the unique aspects they were able to bring to their roles. Megan thrived on the intensity and range of challenges she faced daily, and her ability to learn and grow was amplified by the cutting-edge technology and highly skilled team that surrounded her. Katrina esteemed her ability to genuinely connect with her patients and their families, becoming a beloved and recognized figure within her community. Their professional paths would occasionally intersect, as they attended conferences together and sought to advance their knowledge and skills through continuous training programs. It was during these gatherings that they would regale each other with stories of their experiences, discussing both the similarities and disparities of their workplaces. Each woman respected the other's chosen path, understanding that their varied circumstances brought invaluable perspectives to their shared passion for nursing. As the years wore on, Megan and Katrina continued to excel in their respective roles, earning promotions and accolades for their outstanding care and ever-expanding expertise. Megan eventually became an expert in her field, training others, and contributing to groundbreaking innovations in medical treatment.

Write an article based on this summary: – In a bit of scheming that would do Claire Underwood proud, Robin Wright says she threatened her way into getting equal pay on House of Cards, Sky News reports. After seeing data that Claire was at points more popular than fictional husband Frank Underwood, she decided it was time she was paid the same as Kevin Spacey. \\"I capitalized on it,\\" the Huffington Post quotes Wright as saying during an event Tuesday in New York. \\"I was like, ‘You better pay me or I’m going to go public.' And they did.” Wright was estimated to be making about 420,000 an episode in 2015. Spacey was reportedly already earning 500,000 per episode in 2014. “It was the perfect paradigm,\\" Wright says. \\"There are very few films or TV shows where the male, the patriarch, and the matriarch are equal. And they are in House of Cards.\\" (Some of the show's stars have shared their pick for president.) Article:","output":"Equal Pay on the Cards: Robin Wright Empowers Change in House of Cards Robin Wright made headlines when she revealed during an event in New York on Tuesday that she had threatened to go public if she wasn't given the same pay as her House of Cards co-star, Kevin Spacey. Wright, who plays Claire Underwood on the popular Netflix series, had found herself in a unique paradigm, with her character becoming as prominent, if not more, as her fictional husband, Frank Underwood. Upon discovering her character's popularity, she decided it was time to capitalize on it and fight for equal pay, with the star earning around 420,000 per episode in 2015 as opposed to Spacey's 500,000. The demand for equal pay has been a hot topic in Hollywood and other industries in recent years. In this instance, Wright used her character’s strong impact on the show as leverage in negotiating her salary increase. Her role is vital to the storyline, as the show focuses on the power dynamics between Claire and Frank Underwood. For House of Cards to maintain its credibility and authenticity, it was crucial for Netflix to acknowledge their characters' equal weight and popularity, and as a result, offer Wright the compensation she rightfully deserved.  Wright's stand against pay disparity reflects the ongoing growth of the feminist movement across various workplaces, where women are actively questioning and fighting against the systemic gender pay gap. According to a 2019 report by the American Association of University Women (AAUW), women earned 82 percent of what men earned, with the pay gap being even more significant for women of color. The pressure from high-profile actresses such as Robin Wright, Jennifer Lawrence, and Patricia Arquette demanding pay equity continues to push the entertainment industry to address these disparities. Robin Wright's exploit has further implications than just her own salary negotiations. Her actions have helped inspire and highlight the need for women to demand equal pay, both within the entertainment industry and beyond. For these demands to produce truly tangible results, society needs to place more importance on understanding, listening to, and valuing women's perspectives and contributions. Only by embracing these changes can we forge a path towards pay equity and gender equality.  Drawing inspiration from Wright's character Claire Underwood, we can recognize and celebrate the growing influence of strong female characters on television, film, and across various sectors. As more women step up and fight for equal pay, we demonstrate the collective strength of the feminist movement, embodying the courage and determination of characters like Claire Underwood.  In conclusion, Robin Wright's demand for equal pay on House of Cards signifies a much-needed shift in how the entertainment industry and society address gender pay disparities. With more women standing up for their rights and the increasing number of strong female characters on screen, we pave the way for a future where pay equity is a reality for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Today, he wants to make curds out of milk and see how it differs from plain milk. For his experiment he collected three bottles of milk, bottle A, bottle B, and bottle C. Bottle A and bottle B milk are pasteurized, but bottle C milk is just raw milk. He kept the bottle A milk intact, but made curd out of bottle B and bottle C milk.  Which milk would not require added lactic acid bacteria, bottle B or bottle C? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, we'll examine the process of making curd and the characteristics of each bottle of milk.  Step 1: Understand the process of making curd Curd is formed by fermenting milk using lactic acid bacteria. These bacteria convert lactose (milk sugar) into lactic acid, which causes the milk proteins to coagulate and form curd.  Step 2: Examine the characteristics of each bottle of milk Bottle A: Pasteurized milk (no curd-making process applied) Bottle B: Pasteurized milk turned into curd Bottle C: Raw milk turned into curd Step 3: Analyze milk types based on bacterial content Pasteurized milk undergoes a process that kills harmful bacteria and extends the shelf life of the milk. However, it also destroys the beneficial lactic acid bacteria needed for making curd. So, additional lactic acid bacteria must be introduced to make curd from pasteurized milk.  Raw milk, on the other hand, contains the necessary lactic acid bacteria naturally. Therefore, it doesn't require added bacteria to ferment the milk and make curd. Step 4: Compare bottle B and bottle C Since bottle B is made from pasteurized milk, it would require added lactic acid bacteria to make curd. On the other hand, bottle C, made from raw milk, doesn't need any additional bacteria for curd formation.

The inhabitants of Earth I released greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Earth II, however, was much more conscious about the environment and protected it from anthropogenic changes.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which planet didn't cause a reduction in wildlife population?  Hint: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Earth II is the planet that didn't cause a reduction in wildlife population. This planet was much more conscious about the environment and protected it from anthropogenic changes, unlike Earth I, where the inhabitants released greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. As stated in the hint, the release of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, has significant adverse effects on the planet and its natural environment. These gases are responsible for the greenhouse effect, trapping heat inside the Earth's atmosphere due to their complex molecular structure. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has reported that this warming contributes to the extinction of natural habitats and, consequently, a reduction in wildlife population. In contrast, Earth II was more environmentally conscious and avoided harmful human-made changes. As a result, the planet presumably did not experience the same detrimental effects of global warming and habitat loss as Earth I did. Therefore, Earth II did not cause a reduction in wildlife population."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the person who Mattheson claims was trimmed into other fashions by \\"the lofty schooling of opera\\"? is inside the article: Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig.  In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias.  Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\"., can you guess it ?

Answer the following question: Information:  - A major organ of the endocrine system, the anterior pituitary (also called the adenohypophysis or pars anterior), is the glandular, anterior lobe that together with the posterior lobe (posterior pituitary, or the neurohypophysis) makes up the pituitary gland (hypophysis). The anterior pituitary regulates several physiological processes including stress, growth, reproduction and lactation. Proper functioning of the anterior pituitary and of the organs it regulates can often be ascertained via blood tests that measure hormone levels.  - Hashimoto's thyroiditis, also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, is an autoimmune disease in which the thyroid gland is gradually destroyed. Early on there may be no symptoms. Over time the thyroid may enlarge forming a painless goitre. Some people eventually develop hypothyroidism with its accompanying weight gain, feeling tired, constipation, depression, and general pains. After many years the thyroid typically shrinks in size. Potential complications include thyroid lymphoma. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is thought to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include a family history of the condition and having another autoimmune disease. Diagnosis is confirmed with blood tests for TSH, T4, and antithyroid antibodies. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include Graves disease and nontoxic nodular goiter. Hashimoto's thyroiditis, regardless of whether or not hypothyroidism is present, can be treated with levothyroxine. If hypothyroidism is not present some may recommend no treatment while others may treat to try to reduce the size of the goitre. Those affected should avoid eating large amounts of iodine; however, sufficient iodine is required especially during pregnancy. Surgery is rarely required to treat the goitre. Hashimoto's thyroiditis affects about 5% of the population at some point in their life. It typically begins between the ages of 30 and 50 and is much more common in women than men. Rates of disease appear to be increasing. It was first described by the Japanese physician Hakaru Hashimoto in 1912. In 1957 it was recognized as an autoimmune disorder.  - Biography. He was born on May 5, 1881, in the village of Midai, Nishitsuge, in Mie Prefecture. He graduated from Kyushu University medical school in 1907. He then entered the First Surgical Bureau and studied medicine under the direction of Professor Hayari Miyake (18671945), the first Japanese neurosurgeon. Some years after, he studied pathology under Professor Eduard Kaufmann at the Georg-August University of Göttingen. He also studied in England. As World War I was about to break out, he was forced to return home to Japan. In 1916, he came back to his hometown, Igamachi, and became the town doctor. He fell ill with typhoid fever and died at home on January 9, 1934.  - Hypothyroidism , often called underactive thyroid or low thyroid and sometimes hypothyreosis , is a common disorder of the endocrine system in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone . It can cause a number of symptoms , such as poor ability to tolerate cold , a feeling of tiredness , and weight gain . In children , hypothyroidism leads to delays in growth and intellectual development , which is called cretinism in severe cases . Worldwide , too little iodine in the diet is the most common cause of hypothyroidism . In countries with enough iodine in the diet , the most common cause of hypothyroidism is the autoimmune condition Hashimoto 's thyroiditis . Less common causes include the following : previous treatment with radioactive iodine , injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland , certain medications , a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth , or previous thyroid surgery . The diagnosis of hypothyroidism , when suspected , can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid - stimulating hormone ( TSH ) and thyroxine levels . Hypothyroidism can be treated with manufactured levothyroxine ; the dose is adjusted according to symptoms and normalization of the thyroxine and TSH levels . In Western countries , hypothyroidism occurs in 0.3 -- 0.4 % of people while subclinical hypothyroidism , a milder form of hypothyroidism characterized by normal thyroxine levels and an elevated TSH level , is thought to occur in 4.3 -- 8.5 % of people . Dogs are also known to develop hypothyroidism and in rare cases cats and horses can also have the disorder . The word hypothyroidism is from hypo - meaning under or reduced , plus thyroid .  - The endocrine system is the collection of glands of an organism that secrete hormones directly into the circulatory system to be carried towards distant target organs. The phenomenon of biochemical processes' serving to regulate distant tissues by means of secretions directly into the circulatory system is called endocrine signaling. The major endocrine glands include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, and adrenal glands. The endocrine system is in contrast to the exocrine system, which secretes its hormones to the outside of the body using ducts. The endocrine system is an information signal system like the nervous system, yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably different. The endocrine system's effects are slow to initiate, and prolonged in their response, lasting from a few hours up to weeks. The nervous system sends information very quickly, and responses are generally short lived. In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The field of study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders is endocrinology, a branch of internal medicine. Special features of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. In contrast, exocrine glands, such as salivary glands, sweat glands, and glands within the gastrointestinal tract, tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen.    After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'hypothyroidism' exhibits the relationship of 'medical specialty'. Find the answer from the choices below.

Q: Passage: Early in the Global War on Terror, Fontes served at US Central Command J5 overseeing issues of political-military cooperation in Afghanistan. In June 2004, she was moved to Combined Forces Command - Afghanistan headquarters in Kabul and served under David Barno as the head of the CJ5 staff for political-military coordination. Her staff was responsible for keeping General Barno \\"on message\\", overseeing the policies impacting military operations, and performing liaison work with both the Afghan Ministry of Defense and United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. At the end of her first year in Afghanistan and following Karl Eikenberry's assumption of command from Barno, Fontes volunteered to lead the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Tarinkot. Daniel Green, the political adviser for the PRT, reported that though some Soldiers at the PRT had initial concerns due to her gender, those worries were shortly put to rest. She had been active in engaging with the Afghan people. Green said that Fontes, then a Lieutenant Colonel, pitched in a few hundred dollars of her own money to host a lunch on the PRT for local Afghan leaders. An article in Vanity Fair relates a story that she once refused to depart a meeting with Afghan elders in Chora District under threat of small arms fire, for fear of appearing weak in the face of the Taliban. Green asserts that in early 2006, she survived the first suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive device attack in Urozgan Province due in part to the device's failure to detonate all of the mortar shells of which it was comprised. She departed Afghanistan in May 2006 to attend the US War College, graduating in 2007. She had been promoted that year to colonel. She was subsequently assigned as the chief of the American Security Assistance Office in Pakistan.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - A larva is born - The caterpillar eats constantly until it grows bigger - The caterpillar starts to form a cocoon around itself - The caterpillar becomes a pupa - After some time the cocoon hatches - And a butterfly is born.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less food available happens, how will it affect less caterpillar form cocoons.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The given process describes the typical lifecycle of a butterfly, which involves the following stages: 1. A larva, or caterpillar, is born from an egg. 2. The caterpillar eats constantly, growing bigger in the process. 3. The caterpillar starts to form a cocoon around itself, also known as the chrysalis or pupal stage. 4. The caterpillar becomes a pupa and undergoes metamorphosis within the cocoon. 5. After some time, the cocoon hatches, and an adult butterfly emerges. Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis: the availability of food is reduced, and we must analyze the impact of this on the number of caterpillars that form cocoons and whether this perturbation has any direct or indirect effect on the process. While the perturbation hypothesis may have multiple outcomes, the most likely scenario is that it would lead to an overall decrease in the rate and number of caterpillars that form cocoons and subsequently transform into butterflies. This effect can result from several underlying factors: 1. Starvation: As caterpillars rely on a constant supply of food to grow and develop, reduced availability of food would increase the chance of starvation before they can even reach the stage where they form a cocoon. A higher number of caterpillars might perish before forming cocoons, leaving fewer to make the transition and continue the lifecycle. 2. Slower growth rate: With less food available, surviving caterpillars may not achieve the same rate of growth and development as they would in an environment with ample food. As a result, the time it takes for these caterpillars to reach the cocoon-forming stage could be prolonged. This delayed development might disrupt other aspects of the lifecycle, such as mating and reproduction patterns. 3. Smaller size and compromised health: Reduced food intake may cause surviving caterpillars to grow at a slower rate and reach smaller final body sizes. Smaller size and suboptimal food intake could negatively impact their overall health, and this compromised health might, in turn, affect their ability to form a cocoon and complete metamorphosis successfully. 4. Competition for food: With less food available, competition among caterpillars for resources becomes more intense. The caterpillars that are faster or better equipped to secure scarce food resources will have a better chance of surviving and forming cocoons, while others might not be as fortunate. The resulting selection pressure could lead to changes in the overall population dynamics and possibly even the evolution of specific traits or behaviors advantageous to those prevailing conditions. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis that suggests less food availability may lead to fewer caterpillars forming cocoons seems plausible. Reduced food in the caterpillar stage might have direct effects, such as starvation, slower growth, and compromised health, leading to a decreased number of cocoons formed. Indirect effects can include intensified competition for food resources, which could impact the overall population dynamics and shape the evolution of the species."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Q: An electron in an atom is completely described by four of what?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  The Pauli Exclusion Principle An electron in an atom is completely described by four quantum numbers: n, l, ml, and ms. The first three quantum numbers define the orbital and the fourth quantum number describes the intrinsic electron property called spin. An Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated a general principle that gives the last piece of information that we need to understand the general behavior of electrons in atoms. The Pauli exclusion principle can be formulated as follows: No two electrons in the same atom can have exactly the same set of all the four quantum numbers. What this means is that electrons can share the same orbital (the same set of the quantum numbers n, l, and ml), but only if their spin quantum numbers ms have different values. Since the spin quantum number can only have two values ⎛⎝± 1 ⎞⎠, no 2 more than two electrons can occupy the same orbital (and if two electrons are located in the same orbital, they must have opposite spins). Therefore, any atomic orbital can be populated by only zero, one, or two electrons. The properties and meaning of the quantum numbers of electrons in atoms are briefly summarized in Table 6.1.

When she is kidnapped by Nohrin General Raius, who is actually working for Sedessa, Delgo and his friend Filo are blamed and arrested. In the Nohrin prison, Delgo meets Nohrin General Bogardus, who was forced to illegally gamble with his weapons by Raius, because Bogardus opposed an all out war with the Lokni. Delgo, Filo, and Bogardus escape into some underground caverns and eventually reach Sedessa's stronghold and rescue Kyla. Together they hurry back to try to stop the war from taking place. They are too late, for the war has already begun. Bogardus meanwhile fights and defeats Raius, but is soon after mortally injured. Just as Bogardus dies, Delgo realizes that he was the Nohrin soldier who spared his life many years ago during the first war between the Nohrin and the Lokni. Meanwhile, Sedessa's army of monsters join in the battle. Kyla convinces the Nohrin generals to direct their troops to stop fighting the Lokni and instead pick them up and fly them away from the battlefield. Filo then directs an entire stampede of large animals onto the battlefield, sending Sedessa's minions fleeing for their lives. Delgo goes off to face Sedessa and find King Zahn, whom...

Read this: In February 1925, the Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri summoned him to the Vatican and informed him of Pope Pius XI's decision to appoint him as the Apostolic Visitor to Bulgaria (1925–35). On 3 March, Pius XI also named him for consecration as titular archbishop of Areopolis, Jordan. Roncalli was initially reluctant about a mission to Bulgaria, but he would soon relent. His nomination as apostolic visitor was made official on 19 March. Roncalli was consecrated by Giovanni Tacci Porcelli in the church of San Carlo alla Corso in Rome. After he was consecrated, he introduced his family to Pope Pius XI. He chose as his episcopal motto Obedientia et Pax (\\"Obedience and Peace\\"), which became his guiding motto. While he was in Bulgaria, an earthquake struck in a town not too far from where he was. Unaffected, he wrote to his sisters Ancilla and Maria and told them both that he was fine.

President Obama and Turkish President Abdullah Gul hold a joint news conference Monday. \\"I'm trying to make a statement about the importance of Turkey, not just to the United States but to the world,\\" Obama said at a joint news conference Monday with Turkish President Abdullah Gul. \\"This is a country that has been often said lies at the crossroads between East and West. It's a country that possesses an extraordinarily rich heritage but also represents a blend of those ancient traditions with a modern nation state that respects democracy, respects rule of law and is striving toward a modern economy.\\" \\"My sense is they are moving forward quickly,\\" he said at an earlier press conference with","output":"NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer. \\"This is a great opportunity for both the United States and Turkey to build on that history of cooperation and to strengthen the relationship even further for the future.\\" Obama's visit to Turkey is an important one, not only to improve bilateral relations but also to recognize Turkey's significant role in the global context. As a secular democratic nation with a predominantly Muslim population, Turkey holds a unique position that allows it to play a bridging role between the West and the Islamic world. This is of particular relevance considering the increasingly complex challenges that have emerged in international politics and security concerns, including the fight against terrorism and the need for cultural and religious understanding. Additionally, Turkey's strategic location between Europe and Asia and its proximity to the Middle East make it an influential player in regional politics. It shares borders with countries like Syria, Iran, and Iraq, where the US has vested interests. In recent years, Ankara has sought to play a more active and assertive role in regional affairs, such as mediating between Israel and Syria, engaging with Iran in energy and security talks, and taking on a substantial responsibility in the NATO mission in Afghanistan. These aspects evidently make Turkey an essential partner for the US in both political and security-related matters. Primarily, the strategic partnership between the US and Turkey is of mutual benefit and based on shared values, such as democracy, respect for human rights, and the rule of law. This partnership also underlines the necessity of closer collaboration in various areas, such as the promotion of democratic values and economic development in the region and addressing the emergent challenges, including the fight against terrorism. During his visit, Obama underscored the importance of Turkey's role as a mediator in the Middle East peace process. Given Turkey's historically good relations with both Israelis and Palestinians, it can provide valuable assistance in mediating between the parties and finding a solution to the long-lasting Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Moreover, Turkey's engagement in negotiations with Iran on its nuclear program demonstrates its commitment to finding a peaceful resolution to this issue. In the economic sphere, Turkey has been going through significant structural reforms and rapid change, transforming from a predominantly agrarian society to an industry-driven one. The country has shown considerable progress in macroeconomic management and fiscal discipline, experiencing an impressive average growth rate of 5% per year before the global economic crisis hit in 2008. This makes Turkey an attractive business partner and investment destination for American companies, which could contribute to boosting bilateral trade and investment. Furthermore, as a candidate for full European Union (EU) membership, Turkey plays a crucial role in its regional economic integration, which will eventually contribute to opening new markets for the U.S. and enhancing prosperity in Europe and the Middle East. In conclusion, President Obama's visit to Turkey aimed at sending a strong message highlighting the country's strategic importance to the United States and the world. Obama underlined the significance of improved collaboration in various areas, such as political, economic, and security domains, recognizing Turkey's unique position that enables it to promote understanding between the West and the Islamic world. Strengthening the relationship between the US and Turkey is crucial for addressing current global challenges and leveraging opportunities for mutual benefit in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What did Mozart hear in Mannheim?, using the article: During the 1750s  Messiah was performed increasingly at festivals and cathedrals throughout the country. Individual choruses and arias were occasionally extracted for use as anthems or motets in church services, or as concert pieces, a practice that grew in the 19th century and has continued ever since. After Handel's death, performances were given in Florence (1768), New York (excerpts, 1770), Hamburg (1772), and Mannheim (1777), where Mozart first heard it. For the performances in Handel's lifetime and in the decades following his death, the musical forces used in the Foundling Hospital performance of 1754 are thought by Burrows to be typical. A fashion for large-scale performances began in 1784, in a series of commemorative concerts of Handel's music given in Westminster Abbey under the patronage of King George III. A plaque on the Abbey wall records that \\"The Band consisting of DXXV [525] vocal & instrumental performers was conducted by Joah Bates Esqr.\\" In a 1955 article, Sir Malcolm Sargent, a proponent of large-scale performances, wrote, \\"Mr Bates ... had known Handel well and respected his wishes. The orchestra employed was two hundred and fifty strong, including twelve horns, twelve trumpets, six trombones and three pairs of timpani (some made especially large).\\" In 1787 further performances were given at the Abbey; advertisements promised, \\"The Band will consist of Eight Hundred Performers\\".In continental Europe, performances of Messiah were departing from Handel's practices in a different way: his score was being drastically reorchestrated to suit contemporary tastes. In 1786, Johann Adam Hiller presented Messiah with updated scoring in Berlin Cathedral. In 1788 Hiller presented a performance of his revision with a choir of 259 and an orchestra of 87 strings, 10 bassoons, 11 oboes, 8 flutes, 8 horns, 4 clarinets, 4 trombones, 7 trumpets, timpani, harpsichord and organ.

Question: Process: - Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - The magma cools - With enough time the pressure builds up greatly - The resulting volcano may explode.  Question: suppose during hot days happens, how will it affect magma is pushed with pressure to cool.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"During hot days, the temperature of the Earth's surface may increase slightly, but it has minimal to no effect on the process of magma being pushed to the surface and cooling. Geothermal forces and processes at work deep within the Earth are the primary drivers for volcanic activity, and they are orders of magnitude more powerful and influential than surface temperature variations.  The process of volcano formation begins when gases, primarily water vapor and carbon dioxide, get trapped beneath the earth's crust. These gases create pressure that accumulates, and when the pressure reaches a critical point, molten magma rises to the Earth's surface, either through cracks or through volcanic conduits. Once the magma reaches the surface, it cools and starts to solidify, sometimes causing the formation of new land or islands when it cools in the Earth's ocean. Temperature differences on the Earth's surface due to hot days have minimal effect on the magma because of the vast temperature differences between the surface and the interior of the Earth. The average temperature of the Earth's crust is around 200 to 400 degrees Celsius (up to 750 degrees Fahrenheit), with the temperature increasing as we go deeper into the Earth. In comparison, magma temperatures can reach around 700 to 1300 degrees Celsius (1300 to 2400 degrees Fahrenheit). The temperature contrast between hot days and the Earth's interior is not significant enough to impact how magma is pushed to the surface or how it cools. Additionally, the formation and activity of a volcano are closely related to the movement of tectonic plates, which is not affected by surface temperatures. The upwelling of material from the Earth's mantle at divergent plate boundaries and subduction of one plate beneath another at convergent plate boundaries are key factors that stimulate volcanic processes. In conclusion, while hot days may slightly increase the Earth's surface temperature, they do not have a significant effect on the processes involved in the formation and activity of volcanos. The pressure buildup beneath the earth, movement of tectonic plates, and Earth's interior temperatures are all factors that play much more pivotal roles in the volcanic process. Therefore, the correct answer would be C: no effect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

'Spider': John Coffey (pictured) was at head of a traveller family which avoided paying taxes and falsely claimed benefits totalling £600,000. Five members of a traveller family who avoided paying £500,000 in taxes and fraudulently claimed £100,000 in benefits were sentenced today. Husband and wife John and Brigid Coffey, and their children Michael, Mary and Helen were earning millions of pounds from two resurfacing and block paving businesses. While John and Michael Coffey deliberately laundered the money to avoid paying taxes, the female members of the family claimed thousands of pounds in benefits. This was despite the family owning valuable real estate and a number of expensive cars. John Coffey, 49, sat alongside Brigid, 51, Mary, 28, Helen 26, and Michael, 23, at Bristol Crown Court after pleading guilty to 20 tax evasion and other fraud offences between 2001 and 2008. The court heard the family, who lived in South Wales and Gloucestershire, dealt mostly in cash, with John and Michael Coffey only declaring an income of £250 a week between them. During a police interview, John Coffey claimed their money came from block paving, horses and 'general wheeling and dealing'. Judge David Ticehurst jailed John Coffey, whose tax evasion amounted to £450,000, for two years and nine months and was told he must repay the amount in full within 28 days. Michael Coffey, who avoided paying £50,000 in tax, was handed a sentence of 12 months imprisonment suspended for two years. He was also told he would have to repay the money. 'It’s individuals like you that give the travelling community a bad name,' Judge Ticehurst said. 'Criminal conduct like yours brings your community into disrepute and reinforces prejudice. None of us like paying taxes, but society functions on the fact that people pay money to the revenue. 'These taxes are used to fund hospitals, schools, nurses and roads. You, however, choose not to pay tax and to falsely claim benefits of which you were not entitled. 'What is overwhelmingly clear in this case is that each one of you is dishonest. There can be no excuses for your behaviour.' Lavish: The Coffey family's property portfolio included Ton Y Pill farm, which has tall gates and CCTV cameras. Conning the public purse: John Coffey (pictured, left, outside Bristol Crown Court) and his son Michael Coffey (right) laundered money from their paving and resurfacing businesses to avoid paying £500,000 in taxes. The court heard Brigid Coffey claimed £39,789 in benefits, while Helen Coffey claimed £14,544.40 and Mary Coffey a sum of £53,893.44. Brigid Coffey was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months and ordered to complete 100 hours of unpaid work. Helen Coffey was handed a 12-month prison sentence also suspended for 18 months. She was told to complete 200 hours of unpaid work. Mary Coffey was given a suspended sentence of 12 months imprisonment and ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work. Compensation. orders were made in the amounts claimed by Brigid and Helen Coffey. while Judge Ticehurst adjourned making an order against Mary Coffey for. further representations to be made. 'Dishonest': Michael Coffey, pictured carrying a large holdall, was given a suspended prison sentence. Opening the case, Don Tait, prosecuting, said: 'All of the defendants in this case are members of the travelling community, living predominantly in South Wales and Gloucestershire. 'It is the Crown’s case that the family as a whole operated for most of their life on the fringe of society.' The family, who owned two Mercedes, an. Audi and a Mitsubishi pick-up, were able to pass almost £2million. through their 35 bank accounts by using false names and documents. In. one fraudulent house transfer, John Coffey hired two sets of solicitors. and acted the roles of both seller and purchaser simultaneously in. order to transfer property around the family in different names - making. it unclear who owned what. A. number of properties, including two farms in Peterstone Wentlooge,. Cardiff, a £500,000 house in West Drayton, Middlesex, and two houses in. Rumney, Cardiff, were registered to the family. Spared jail: Wife Brigid Coffey, who tried to conceal her identity (right) was given an 12-month suspended prison sentence for falsely claiming nearly £40,000 in benefits. They lived in Ton Y Pill Farm - a walled property, which boasted high gates and CCTV cameras. But the court heard it was not clear where the funds to buy the properties came from. The family also owned and used two plots at the Mount View Caravan Site in Naas Lane, Brookthorpe, near Gloucester. The properties were mostly paid for by cash or banker’s draft with no mortgages. The family ran two companies, B&B Welsh Paving and Sunset Drives and Landscapes Ltd, which provided driveway resurfacing services. Walked free: Helen Coffey (left) and her sister Mary (right) were given 12-month suspended prison sentences after fraudulently claiming £14,544.40 and £53,893.44 respectively. The latter was set up in 2006 as a front to deliberately conceal the extent of their business revenues, Mr Tait said. But investigations into the family’s bank accounts showed a vast turnover of money. 'The. family appeared to be awash with cash, invested in real estate and. vehicles, yet the female family members were claiming benefits using. subterfuge and non-declaration, said Mr Tait. The. family looked to invest in Spanish properties in the Costa del Sol and. Riviera del Sol, although they never completed on any of their plans to. buy. John Coffey was described by the judge as the 'spider' at the centre of a web of deceit. The court was told his son was just 12 years old when the family fraud began and 17 when he was first arrested in 2007. Addressing. the judge, Raymond Tully, defending Michael Coffey, said: 'It goes. almost without saying you are sentencing a son for crimes committed. together with his father at a time when he was of very tender years.' While the men avoided paying tax, the family women fraudulently claimed £100,000 in benefits. Unwelcome publicity: Helen Coffey, 26, makes an offensive gesture as she hides her face from photographers. The three women told authorities they had no savings or assets and claimed income support, housing and council tax benefit and money from a Social Fund Budgeting Loan. They used a variety of names and stories, on occasion claiming to be single parents who needed the money to buy clothing and footwear. Prithvijit Hoon, defending Brigid Coffey, said: 'One of the ethos of the travel community is the status of the wife being deferential towards her husband.' Christopher Quinlan, mitigating for John Coffey, said: 'Mr Coffey was running a business in respect to which work was done and money was paid. He did not declare that income in terms of tax. 'Mr Coffey is an industrious, hard-working man and the Revenue have got their money through his hard work.' The court heard £500,000 has already been restrained from the family’s bank accounts and is now subject to confiscation proceedings. In 2010 John Coffey and Michael Coffey pleaded guilty to two counts of fraudulently taking steps to divert money from HM Treasury or to deprive HM Treasury of money to which it was entitled. John Coffey also admitted two counts of knowingly using a false Irish driving licence. Facing justice: Mary Coffey (left) and Brigid Coffey (centre) outside Bristol Crown Court, where they were sentenced. Brigid Coffey pleaded guilty to five counts of making a false statement to obtain benefits, while mother-of-five Mary Coffey pleaded guilty to seven counts of making false statements. Helen Coffey, a mother of one, pleaded guilty in respect of an ongoing claim for income support, failing to notify the Department for Work and Pensions of her bank accounts with positive balances, and the fact that she was married. She also admitted making a false statement to obtain a Social Fund Budgeting Loan and two counts of providing the false name Helen Delaney to Cardiff Magistrates’ Court in October 2005 and April 2006. Officers from five police forces, HM Revenue and Customs and the Department for Work and Pensions worked together to bring the Coffeys to justice. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Shorrock, who led the investigation for Gloucestershire Police, said: 'The sentencing of the Coffey family marks the culmination of many years of work by literally hundreds of officers and officials. Covered up: Defendants John Coffey (left) and Helen Coffey (right) tried to hide their faces outside court. 'This family had been engaging in questionable financial and business activities for many years, until we collectively caught up with them.' Simon De Kayne, assistant director of criminal investigation, HM Revenue and Customs, said: 'The Coffeys blatantly evaded UK tax laws to selfishly steal around £500,000 of taxpayers’ money to fund their criminally gained lifestyles and expanding property portfolio. 'The sentencing shows HMRC, along with our partner agencies, will not only pursue and prosecute tax fraudsters but also seek to reclaim the proceeds of their crimes.' Andrew Biker, of CPS central fraud division, said: 'No income was ever declared by John Coffey to the Inland Revenue despite him working all his life in the tarmac and block paving industries. 'Even more money was made buying and selling cars and trading horses. 'The sheer number of bank accounts operated by the family and their ability to transfer significant funds between them fly in the face of their claims of illiteracy and ignorance of matters such as income tax. 'No matter how you earn money, paying tax matters. But denying the honest British public of their contribution to tax was not enough for the Coffeys who went further by setting out to take funds set aside for those who most need them. 'People can rest assured that the CPS will do all it can to deprive these criminals of their assets and put the money back where it belongs - into the public purse.'

This sentence, when spaced correctly, reads as: \\"Jeremiah was set over both Judah and Israel.\\" The sentence refers to the prophet Jeremiah in the context of the ancient biblical kingdoms of Judah and Israel.  Jeremiah, a major prophet in the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament, is known for his prophecies, warnings, and vision for the future of these two kingdoms. According to the Bible, his calling to be a prophet and his divine appointment was to communicate the will of God to both the Kingdom of Judah and the Kingdom of Israel. The context in which this sentence is likely used discusses the biblical history of Judah and Israel. These two kingdoms have a rich history, deeply intertwined with the stories of other biblical figures. In the Bible, Israel was the larger and more prosperous of the two kingdoms. However, it was frequently affected by civil unrest and was eventually conquered by the Assyrians in circa 722 BCE. Judah, on the other hand, was smaller and less prosperous but had a more stable political history. It survived until the Babylonian invasion in circa 586 BCE, which led to the destruction of Jerusalem and the exile of many of its inhabitants. During his time as a prophet, Jeremiah faced significant opposition and persecution for his bold messages and challenging outlook. He warned of the impending judgment from God and urged both Judah and Israel to repent and return to a covenantal relationship with their Creator. Often called the \\"weeping prophet,\\" Jeremiah was noted for his strong empathy and sorrow over the foreseeable consequences of his people's disobedience. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Jeremiah was set over both Judah and Israel\\" highlights the important role that the prophet Jeremiah played in the spiritual lives of these two kingdoms. His messages, prophecies, and call to repentance had a significant impact on the biblical history of Judah and Israel as he communicated God's will to the people in a time of great turmoil and uncertainty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Donald specifically mentions a previous instance when Scofield told him that Mike was not at home, which he believes is a lie. Scofield, on the other hand, denies lying and claims that Mike indeed wasn't at home when he made that statement. He is defensive in his response, which suggests that he might be feeling wrongly accused or misunderstood. Donald remains skeptical of Scofield's claim and refuses to believe what he says. At this point, Scofield seems to realize that attempting to convince Donald any further may be futile, and he resigns himself to the situation by responding with \\"okay then.\\" Throughout this conversation, there is tension between Donald and Scofield, mainly due to a lack of trust between the two.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Question: How does the actress feel about the playwright?

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century?  Pierre Benjamin Monteux (pronounced [pjɛʁ mɔ̃.tø]; 4 April 1875 – 1 July 1964) was a French (later American) conductor. After violin and viola studies, and a decade as an orchestral player and occasional conductor, he began to receive regular conducting engagements in 1907.  He came to prominence when, for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company between 1911 and 1914, he conducted the world premieres of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and other prominent works including Petrushka, Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, and Debussy's Jeux. Thereafter he directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century. From 1917 to 1919 Monteux was the principal conductor of the French repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He led the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1919–24), Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra (1924–34), Orchestre Symphonique de Paris (1929–38) and San Francisco Symphony (1936–52).  In 1961, aged eighty-six, he accepted the chief conductorship of the London Symphony Orchestra, a post which he held until his death three years later.  Although known for his performances of the French repertoire, his chief love was the music of German composers, above all Brahms. He disliked recording, finding it incompatible with spontaneity, but he nevertheless made a substantial number of records. Monteux was well known as a teacher. In 1932 he began a conducting class in Paris, which he developed into a summer school that was later moved to his summer home in Les Baux in the south of France. After moving permanently to the US in 1942, and taking American citizenship, he founded a school for conductors and orchestral musicians in Hancock, Maine. Among his students in France and America who went on to international fame were Lorin Maazel, Igor Markevitch, Neville Marriner, Seiji Ozawa, André Previn  and David Zinman. The school in Hancock has continued since Monteux's death.

When we say \\"Borinquen\\", it's often referring to what is now called Puerto Rico, before it was discovered by Europeans. It's like the old name for that place. Just like your Grandma's house is still the same house, even if we start calling it \\"Grandma's palace\\", okay?

It is winter and Johnathan's car won't start, so he needs to walk to work. Even though it's sunny outside he's going to have to bundle up due to the cold temperature. In his closet there is a large black coat and a large white coat. He can't decide which coat to wear.                                                                                                                     Sarah is going to a family picnic in the park and is trying to decide what dress to wear. She knows it is going to be very hot and sunny today and she has narrowed her choices down to two different dresses. One is a dark colored dress and the other is a white dress.  Hint: Light may transfer its energy to matter rather than being reflected or transmitted by matter. This is called absorption . When light is absorbed, the added energy increases the temperature of matter. If you get into a car that has been sitting in the sun all day, the seats and other parts of the car’s interior may be almost too hot to touch, especially if they are black or very dark in color. That’s because dark colors absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them.","output":"Based on the given information, the white coat would absorb less sunlight compared to the black coat.  In the context of the provided paragraph, it is explained that light can transfer its energy to matter through absorption, which in turn increases the temperature of the matter. Dark colors, such as black, are known to absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them. This absorption occurs because dark surfaces have less capability to reflect light and tend to absorb more wavelengths of the incident light.  On the other hand, light colors, such as white, have a higher capacity to reflect sunlight, and therefore, they absorb less light energy. As a result, wearing a white coat will lead to absorbing less sunlight and staying relatively cooler compared to wearing a black coat. This concept is evidenced by Sarah's decision-making process on choosing a dress for a hot and sunny day for a family picnic in the park. She might prefer wearing a white dress, as it absorbs less sunlight and helps her stay cooler during the day. In conclusion, the white coat would absorb less sunlight due to its higher capacity to reflect light when compared to a black coat. This is important to consider in various situations, such as dressing for an outdoor event on a sunny day, as it can significantly impact one's comfort level in terms of temperature regulation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Due to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere more an more carbon dioxide is mixing with ocean water - thus increasing the acidity of the world's oceans. Rob is a climate scientist. He is measuring the acidity of the Atlantic ocean and the Pacific Ocean. To determine ocean water acidity he performed an acid-base titration. His conclusion is that Atlantic Ocean's acidity reached higher level than Pacific Ocean's acidity.  In the Pacific Ocean's acidity test would the y-axis be higher or lower than Atlantic Ocean's acidity test  Hint: To determine the concentration of an acid in an aqueous solution, an acid-base titration is commonly performed. A strong base solution with a known concentration, usually NaOH or KOH, is added to neutralize the acid solution according to the color change of the indicator with the amount of base added.[7] The titration curve of an acid titrated by a base has two axes, with the base volume on the x-axis and the solution's pH value on the y-axis. The pH of the solution always goes up as the base is added to the solution. The answer to this question is:","output":"The y-axis for the Pacific Ocean's acidity test would be lower than the Atlantic Ocean's acidity test. Step-by-step explanation: 1. Rob, a climate scientist, is measuring the acidity of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. 2. Rob uses an acid-base titration to measure the acidity, where a strong base solution (NaOH or KOH) is added to neutralize the acid solution. The titration curve has two axes - base volume on the x-axis and the pH value on the y-axis. 3. The pH value is a scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of a solution. A lower pH value indicates a higher acidity level, while a higher pH value indicates a lower acidity level. 4. According to Rob's conclusion, the Atlantic Ocean's acidity has reached a higher level than the Pacific Ocean's acidity. 5. Since the Atlantic Ocean has higher acidity, its pH value on the y-axis would be lower than the Pacific Ocean's pH value. 6. Therefore, the y-axis for the Pacific Ocean's acidity test would be higher (with a higher pH value, indicating lower acidity) than the Atlantic Ocean's acidity test (with a lower pH value, indicating higher acidity)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Dig deeper into the poll, and you’ll find that among the voters labeled “most attentive,” Bachmann is leading by a whopping 32% to 18%, Aaron Blake of the Washington Post observes. That’s huge because Iowa’s caucus system is inherently dominated by those “most attentive” voters. “She’s clearly got a constituency: The aware and the hard-core,” said one Democratic pollster. But there’s still a looming question mark over the race: Rick Perry. GOP insiders tell Politico that Perry is dropping heavy hints that he’s jumping into the race, though his chief strategist says he may not decide until Labor Day. He'll get a warm welcome; a collection of major donors and party officials tell the Washington Post they’re waiting for a horse to back, with eyes on Perry. “It’s a huge opening for Rick Perry—huge, huge, huge,” said one New Hampshire operative.

(CNN) -- They've been man's best friend since the beginning of time. And now, thanks to modern technology, two best friends are together again. When Giuseppe DiBella's beloved 6-month-old puppy Nika disappeared from his home in Newburgh, New York, he immediately plastered countless fliers around town showing pictures of Nika as well as the toy fox terrier's microchip number. But no luck ... time ticked on, and two years passed. While DiBella may have been devastated, he says he \\"never gave up.\\" In mid-September, the 3-pound pooch showed up at the front door of a home in Ocala, Florida, more than 1,000 miles away. When CNN asked how his little pup could've made her way from","output":"New York to Florida, DiBella couldn't help but express his amazement and wonder. \\"It's truly a miracle. I always had a small glimmer of hope, but to see Nika show up all the way in Florida is beyond belief,\\" he said. Nika's journey from Newburgh to Ocala seems like something out of a movie. After the initial shock and heartbreak, DiBella started to piece together what might have happened to his missing companion. It's believed that Nika may have been accidentally picked up by travelers passing through New York, likely attracted to the friendly and playful puppy. Over the course of two years, the people who had taken Nika in somehow lost track of her, and she ended up alone in Florida. Meanwhile, back in Newburgh, DiBella maintained his diligence in searching for his lost friend. He regularly updated the fliers around town and continued to check local animal shelters and online databases for any sign of Nika. By doing so, he had unknowingly created a network of support that would eventually lead to their reunion. The key to this unbelievable story lies in Nika's microchip. When the family in Ocala found the lost dog at their doorstep, they took the little pup straight to their nearest vet clinic. The veterinarian scanned Nika's microchip and immediately found her identification number, which led them to connect with DiBella. Unable to contain his joy, DiBella booked a flight as soon as possible to reunite with his long-lost companion. Microchipping plays a vital role in the reunification of lost pets with their owners. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), lost pets with microchips are 2.5 times more likely to be reunited with their families. It's an unfortunate fact that only around 22% of lost dogs who enter animal shelters are reunited with their owners. However, this number rises to a remarkable 52% when the lost dog has been microchipped. In light of Nika's safe return, DiBella has become an advocate for microchipping and encourages other pet owners to do the same. \\"It's a small investment that can make a world of difference,\\" he says. \\"I could have lost Nika forever had it not been for the microchip. If sharing my story can help other pet owners understand the importance of microchipping and potentially prevent them from experiencing the heartache I went through, then it's worth it.\\" Nika's story of love, heartbreak, and eventual reunion is a testament to the profound bond between humans and their pets. It acts as a reminder never to give up on hope, no matter how much time passes or how far apart we are from our loved ones. This incredible tale of a dog's journey spanning over 1,000 miles only further cements the idea that the bond between a person and their pet can conquer even the most insurmountable odds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Some scholars and organizations disagree with the notion of \\"separation of church and state\\", or the way the Supreme Court has interpreted the constitutional limitation on religious establishment. Such critics generally argue that the phrase misrepresents the textual requirements of the Constitution, while noting that many aspects of church and state were intermingled at the time the Constitution was ratified. These critics argue that the prevalent degree of separation of church and state could not have been intended by the constitutional framers. Some of the intermingling between church and state include religious references in official contexts, and such other founding documents as the United States Declaration of Independence, which references the idea of a \\"Creator\\" and \\"Nature's God\\", though these references did not ultimately appear in the Constitution nor do they mention any particular religious view of a \\"Creator\\" or \\"Nature's God.\\" If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What do scholars also agree with about the way the Supreme Court has interpreted what?","output":"Alright buddy, imagine that some very important people write the rules for a big group of friends. Now, some of these important people don't want everyone to only play with the toys from one kid's house, because they think it's better if we can play with toys from different houses. Some very smart people, called scholars, have different opinions about how these rules should be followed. They talk about two important things: \\"church\\" which means the place where people learn about God and pray, and \\"state\\" which means the big group of friends and the rules they follow. The Supreme Court is like the big kids who help decide what the rules mean. Some scholars think that the Supreme Court's ideas about how much the church and state should be together or apart are not what the important people who wrote the rules wanted. But even when these scholars disagree, they can also agree on some things, like how important people used to talk about \\"church\\" and \\"state\\" together in the past, and how the rules mention a \\"Creator\\" and \\"Nature's God\\" but not any specific God or church.

Kidder also spent time growing up in Labrador City, Newfoundland and Labrador. Her mother was from British Columbia, Canada, and her father was from New Mexico, United States. She is of Welsh and English descent. In 2000, Kidder played Eileen Canboro in Apocalypse III: Tribulation, a Christian film dealing with Christian eschatology and the Rapture. Kidder stated afterwards that she did not realize until she was on the set that the movie was serious. Also that year she appeared in three episodes of Peter Benchley's Amazon (1999 TV series), playing a striking role as an insane Canadian woman bent on domination of all the local tribes. In 2001, she played the abusive mother of a serial killer in \\"Pique\\", an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. In 2002, she appeared alongside Crispin Glover and Vanessa Redgrave in the film adaptation of Crime and Punishment.

Movie title: Ratatouille Context: Remy is an idealistic and ambitious young rat, gifted with highly developed senses of taste and smell. Inspired by his idol, the recently deceased chef Auguste Gusteau, Remy dreams of becoming a cook himself. When an old French woman discovers Remy's clan in her house, they are forced to flee, and Remy becomes separated from his family in the panic. He ends up in the sewers of Paris and eventually finds himself at a skylight overlooking the kitchen of Gusteau's restaurant. As Remy watches, a young man named Alfredo Linguini is hired as a garbage boy by Skinner, the restaurant's devious current owner and Gusteau's former sous-chef. When Linguini spills a pot of soup and attempts to recreate it, Remy recognizes that he is ruining it instead, and repairs Linguini's mistakes. Linguini catches Remy, but hides him when he is then confronted by Skinner for tampering with the soup. As the two argue, the soup is accidentally served and proves to be a success. Colette Tatou, the staff's only female chef, convinces Skinner to retain Linguini, who is assumed to be the soup's creator. When Skinner catches Remy trying to escape, he orders Linguini to kill the rat, but Linguini discovers Remy's intelligence, and decides to keep him instead.     Remy discovers that he can control Linguini's movements by pulling his hair. On Linguini's first day as a chef, he and Remy find a way to communicate: Remy guides Linguini like a marionette by pulling on his hair while hidden under Linguini's toque, while Skinner assigns Colette to train his new cook.

For most rock bands, the pursuit of wisdom's a low priority compared to fame, fortune and fornication. Such a band was Strange Fruit.\\" Thus begins the opening dialog of Hughie, (Billy Connolly) as he launches into a brief history of the British band: in the late 1970's Strange Fruit, consisting of guitarist Brian Lovell (Bruce Robinson), his brother and lead singer Keith, keyboard player Tony Costello (Stephen Rea), bassist Les Wickes (Jimmy Nail) and drummer Beano Baggot (Timothy Spall) were HUGE. When Keith died of a drug overdose, he was replaced on vocals by Ray Simms (Bill Nighy). Watched over by road-dog Hughie and Girl Friday Karen (Juliet Aubrey), they soldiered on until the disastrous appearance at the open-air Wisbech (U.K.) Rock Festival, when lightning struck the stage during their opening number. The already-contentious band members decided it was a sign and immediately broke up forever (all this in the first five minutes of the film). Forever, that is, until in the present (OK, 1998) Tony is spotted on Ibeza (he now stocks condoms in the restrooms at the resorts there) by the son of the Wisbech promoter, who wants to put together a 20th anniversary reunion concert with all the original acts. Tony seeks out Karen, now a divorced mother who coordinates conferences for a major hotel, suggesting a possible reunion. She is ambivalent, as is Les (now a successful roofer with a family) and Ray (a struggling solo artist with a demanding second wife -- Swedish -- and a mansion he can't afford).

Does \\"President Washington dispatched a newly trained army to the region, which decisively defeated the Indian confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794.\\" correctly answer the question of When was this deciding battle fought?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"President Washington dispatched a newly trained army to the region, which decisively defeated the Indian confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794\\" correctly answers the question of when the deciding battle was fought. The Battle of Fallen Timbers took place in 1794 and was a decisive and crucial conflict between the United States and the Indian confederacy. To add context and detail to this answer, the Battle of Fallen Timbers was part of the Northwest Indian War, fought from 1785 to 1795, which happened in the region that would become the Northwestern United States. The Indian confederacy consisted of various Native American tribes, such as the Shawnee, Delaware, Ottawa, and Anishinaabeg, who were supported by the British Empire. Following the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which ended the American Revolutionary War, tensions arose between Native Americans and the newly-formed United States. The Northwest Territory, which included present-day Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, was viewed as crucial for American expansion. Conflicts between Native American tribes and American settlers grew, resulting in the Northwest Indian War. U.S. forces experienced initial setbacks and defeats in this conflict, notably in 1791, with the most significant one being the defeat of Major General Arthur St. Clair's troops by Native American forces led by Little Turtle and Blue Jacket. As a result, President George Washington decided to reorganize and train a new American army under General Anthony Wayne. Washington's decision paid off in 1794 when, on August 20, General Wayne led his forces against the Indian confederacy in the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The battle took place near present-day Maumee, Ohio, close to the site where fallen trees had been uprooted by a recent tornado. The skilled and disciplined American forces outmatched the confederated tribes, highlighting a stark contrast to the previous defeats. Wayne's victory in the Battle of Fallen Timbers significantly weakened the Indian confederacy and marked a turning point in the war. Ultimately, this decisive win paved the way for the Treaty of Greenville in 1795, which established peace between the United States and the Native American confederacy. It also opened up the Northwest Territory for further American expansion, enabling the country to grow and prosper. In conclusion, the statement provided answeres the question correctly, as the deciding battle, the Battle of Fallen Timbers, was fought in 1794. This battle marked a turning point in the Northwest Indian War, ultimately leading to the Treaty of Greenville and establishing peace in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"The hypothesis - \\"The figures show the wealth distribution of the country\\" - seems to be entailed by the premise provided. Let's break down the premise to understand how it supports the hypothesis, providing essential information about wealth distribution. Premise: 1. Wealth-Income Ratio (1960-2000) 28 2. Figure 1.3: Family Net Worth by Income Level in 1998 3. Figure 1.4: Share of Elderly Households' Income by Source of The premise provides three pieces of information that all pertain to wealth distribution within the country: 1. Wealth-Income Ratio (1960-2000) 28: This information conveys the relationship between wealth (net worth) and income over four decades (1960 to 2000), providing an understanding of how wealth and income have varied. This ratio can give us insights into inequality levels within the country - a higher ratio may indicate the concentration of wealth among the wealthy, while a more equal distribution may lead to a lower ratio. 2. Figure 1.3: Family Net Worth by Income Level in 1998: This figure will presumably show the distribution of family net worth across different income levels in 1998. Family net worth is an essential aspect of a country's wealth distribution, as it indicates families' financial statuses by considering their assets and liabilities. By observing how family net worth changes across income levels, one can gain insights into the inequality present within the country concerning households' financial situations. 3. Figure 1.4: Share of Elderly Households' Income by Source of: The final piece of information refers to the breakdown of income sources for elderly households. This information helps to determine wealth distribution for a specific demographic - the elderly. By understanding the sources of their income (e.g., pensions, investments, social security, etc.), it provides a more detailed view of wealth distribution within the country and highlights any potential gaps or inadequacies in the support systems for this particular population. So, considering the information presented in the premise, it aligns with the hypothesis that the figures show the wealth distribution of the country. The data points provided all contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the distribution of wealth and income across different time periods, income levels, and for a specific demographic group (the elderly)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter      MIAMI (CBSMiami) – Relatives of a 17-year-old are angry the teenager was shot and killed by a homeowner who police say was protecting her property.      The sister of the teen who died identified him as Trevon Johnson. She said he was a student at D. A. Dorsey Technical College.      “I don’t care if she have her gun license or any of that. That is way beyond the law… way beyond,” said Johnson’s cousin Nautika Harris. “He was not supposed to die like this. He had a future ahead of him. Trevon had goals… he was a funny guy, very big on education, loved learning.”      On Thursday, police say Johnson burglarized a home south of 79th Street near I-95 — just blocks away from where he lives.      The 54-year-old woman told police her surveillance system alerted her to the break-in of her home. She said she rushed home and found the teen climbing out of a window.      “She observed a subject leaving the home through the rear,” said police Det. Dan Ferrin.      Miami-Dade police said there was a confrontation and shots were fired. Police said they were on scene seconds after the shooting and gave CPR to the teen. Johnson was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.      “What’s wrong with her,” asked Johnson’s sister Nisha Johnson. “She did not have to shoot him.”      “It’s no reason she should have waited until I think he walked out the yard to try to shoot him,” said Harris. “If she called the police already why would she shoot him?”      Relatives said they don’t believe Johnson stole anything from the home but detectives would not confirm that.      “You have to look at it from every child’s point of view that was raised in the hood,” said Harris. “You have to understand… how he gonna get his money to have clothes to go to school? You have to look at it from his point-of-view.”      Police said the homeowner is cooperating with detectives and was taken to a police station for questioning.      “She’s a person that is a little distraught because this is her home that someone obviously was in,” Ferrin said.      Investigators said they’re still trying to sort all of this out and want the public to remember that, if possible, it’s best not to take these types of situations into your own hands.      “If there’s any type of situation that happens or they believe there’s a burglary at the home or any type of confrontation, dial 911. Have the police make that confrontation,” Ferrin said. “That’s what we’re here for.”      The case has been handed over to state attorney’s office but, so far, no charges have been filed against her. ||||| NORTHWEST MIAMI-DADE, Fla. (WSVN) -- A teenage boy who was allegedly caught burglarizing a Northwest Miami-Dade home died Thursday night after, police said, he was shot during a confrontation with the homeowner.      Police have released 17-year-old Trevon Johnson's name and mug shot Friday afternoon. The mug shot provided was taken from a prior arrest earlier this year.      According to Miami-Dade Police, at around 5:30 p.m., the 54-year-old homeowner was alerted of the attempted burglary from an alarm system at her residence, located near Northwest 72nd Street and 19th Avenue. \\"We received a call, possibly of her alarm going off,\\" said Miami-Dade Detective Dan Ferrin. \\"As she was en route to the home, the police was called out as well.\\"      The homeowner said when she arrived at her home, she saw Johnson attempting to break in. Investigators said the homeowner pulled up to her home and went room to room.      Police said the altercation ended with at least one gunshot and the suspect bleeding on the ground. \\"At that point, Miami-Dade Fire Rescue responded to the scene and transported the victim to [Ryder] Trauma, where he later was pronounced deceased,\\" said Ferrin.      Back at the scene of the break-in, crime scene detectives and homicide investigators spent hours picking up every piece of evidence they could find. Police said the homeowner has been cooperative throughout the investigation. Officials worked through the night and into the morning on this case and checking out her story. As of Friday afternoon, officials have confirmed that her story checks out.      Ferrin said the most significant details of the investigation may come from the woman who, police said, pulled the trigger. \\"She's very cooperative, she's been talking to our detectives, she's gathering all the information,\\" he said. \\"You have to remember, she's 54 years of age, OK? She's a person that obviously is a little distraught because this is her home that someone obviously was in.\\"      Meanwhile, at Jackson Memorial Hospital, 7News cameras captured Miami-Dade Police officers speaking with a doctor who then comforted the family of the deceased teen.      Detectives are attempting to determine whether there is surveillance video of the incident, as well as how many shots were fired during the confrontation. Ultimately, they said, it will be up to the State Attorney's Office to decide if charges will be filed against the homeowner.

She lives in Liberty City, a high-crime neighborhood in a high-crime town. Her low-slung duplex backs onto the railroad tracks and has been targeted in the past.      She can also be forgiven for racing home when, on Thursday afternoon, her security system alerted her to another break-in at the property.      But can she be forgiven for, according to police, fatally shooting a teenager as he fled her house, even as officers were on their way to help?      That is the question now facing the state’s attorney’s office.      Seventeen-year-old Trevon Johnson died Thursday night after Jenrette shot him once as he allegedly fled the scene of the home invasion, according to Miami-Dade police. There have been no indications that Johnson was armed.      The slaying of the teenage burglary suspect was reported triumphantly by local television station WSVN, which said Jenrette had “turned the tables” on Johnson.      “Police say this would-be robber chose the wrong home because this homeowner did more than just call the cops,” reported WSVN’s Brandon Beyer. “She had a gun.”      But Johnson’s family said the young man didn’t deserve to die over mere property, which they said he hadn’t even taken.      “I don’t care if she have her gun license, her rights or any of that. That is way beyond the law,” Johnson’s cousin Nautika Harris told CBS Miami. “Way beyond.”      The law on home invasions and use of force, however, varies widely from one state to the next. Similar cases across the United States have produced starkly different outcomes, with some homeowners who shot intruders charged with manslaughter or even murder.      The Miami shooting comes at a crucial moment in the debate over gun control in this country. In January, President Obama announced new executive orders to combat gun violence, angering gun rights advocates. And amid an incessant string of mass shootings, states continue to expand their open-carry regulations.      As violent crime edged up last year for the first time in decades, America appears divided over whether increased gun ownership is part of the problem or the solution.      [Concealed-weapon owner shoots hatchet-wielding attacker in Wash. 7-Eleven]      Over the past two years, a handful of U.S. homeowners have been charged for fatally shooting intruders.      In 2013, James George Stiffler fatally shot a man he found allegedly ransacking his Helena, Mont., home. The homeowner, then 66, said he feared his wife was in the house and that the intruder, 37-year-old Henry Thomas Johnson, was dangerous.      At first, authorities sided with Stiffler. But then the medical examiner determined that Johnson had been shot in the back.      “I believed Stiffler was not at fault,” Lewis and Clark County Sheriff Leo Dutton told the Billings Gazette. “But forensic evidence indicates a different event.”      Prosecutors charged Stiffler with murder in 2015. His attorneys slammed the charges.      “Mr. Stiffler has mourned the loss of life, even as he was left with no choice but to fire his weapon,” Stiffler’s attorneys said in a statement. “But it is a travesty of justice that Johnson’s conduct also now threatens to ruin Mr. Stiffler’s life as well.”      Last month, a jury failed to reach a verdict in the murder trial, according to the Missoulian.      In another recent case, an Akron, Ohio, man was indicted in October for fatally shooting a home invader. David Hillis, 21, was charged with voluntary manslaughter, a first-degree felony, according to Cleveland.com. He pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial for the Aug. 7, 2015, slaying of Marcus Glover.      When Glover and another man tried to rob Hillis, he grabbed a gun and chased them outside, firing several shots after them, according to police. Glover was found dead two houses away. Akron prosecutors said that by chasing the intruders, Hillis was no longer protected by Ohio’s Castle Doctrine law, which allows homeowners to use lethal force, according to Cleveland.com.      In many more cases, though, homeowners have not been charged with a crime after killing suspected burglars.      Perhaps the most famous recent case occurred in July 2014, when 80-year-old Long Beach, Calif., homeowner Thomas Greer fatally shot a female intruder even after she begged for her life and claimed she was pregnant.      According to prosecutors, the woman, 28-year-old Andrea Miller, and a male accomplice had robbed Greer at least once before. When they returned on July 22, 2014, Greer grabbed his gun, chased them outside and shot Miller in the back.      “Don’t shoot me, I’m pregnant! I’m going to have a baby!” Miller claimed, falsely, before Greer shot her once more.      “He meted out his own punishment,” wrote syndicated columnist Ruben Navarrette. “Was that because Greer was angry and frustrated at being victimized and wanted retribution? If so, that’s not a good excuse for taking a life.”      In January 2015, prosecutors announced they would not file charges against Greer, according to the Los Angeles Times.      A missing child alert for Johnson from November.      Charges are even less likely in Thursday’s shooting in Miami.      Johnson’s family made an impassioned claim that the teenager deserved justice, despite the circumstances of his death.      “He was not supposed to die like this,” Harris, his cousin, told CBS. “He had a future ahead of him. Trevon had goals. He was a funny guy, very big on education, loved learning.”      Johnson was a student at D.A. Dorsey Technical College, barely a block away from where he died. He also lived in the same neighborhood, and his cousin said Liberty City shared some blame in his death.      “You have to look at it from every child’s point of view that was raised in the hood,” Harris said. “You have to understand … how he gonna get his money to have clothes to go to school? You have to look at it from his point-of-view.”      She and other family members said that Jenrette did not need to shoot Johnson, especially since police were on their way.      “If she called the police already, why would she shoot him?” Harris told CBS.      There is little clarity in the reports of what happened that afternoon after Jenrette rushed home. It’s unclear whether Jenrette called the police or whether they were automatically called to the house by the alarm system. A police statement said she “arrived prior to the officers and began to inspect the exterior of the home, when a confrontation occurred with the burglar. The homeowner produced a firearm and shot the subject.”      Other news reports quoting police said she “went room to room” searching the house before finding Johnson, according to WSVN.      “She observed a subject exiting the home through the rear,” Miami-Dade police spokesman Daniel Ferrin told the television station. “At that point there was some type of a quick confrontation.”      “The police told her don’t go in the house,” Vaughan Johnson, Trevon’s brother, told WPLG. “She’s still going in the house searching for something. Then she says this lady came out and shot one time and shot him in the chest.”      “What’s wrong with her?” Johnson’s sister, Nisha Johnson, told CBS. “She did not have to shoot him.”      Police arrived moments after the shooting and tried to revive Trevon, but it was too late. He was pronounced dead at a hospital.      Johnson had been arrested earlier this year, although the charge was not disclosed because he was a juvenile, WSVN reported.      The state’s attorney’s office will decide whether charges will be filed against Jenrette. But Florida statutes provide some of the staunchest protections in the country for homeowners who confront intruders.      “A person is justified in using or threatening to use deadly force if he or she reasonably believes that using or threatening to use such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony,” according to state law. “A person who uses or threatens to use deadly force in accordance with this subsection does not have a duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground if the person using or threatening to use the deadly force is not engaged in a criminal activity and is in a place where he or she has a right to be.”      But Florida law goes far beyond this “Stand Your Ground” law, which became the focal point in the 2012 shooting of another 17-year-old, Trayvon Martin, in Sanford, Fla.      Instead, in Florida, anybody who “unlawfully and by force enters or attempts to enter a person’s dwelling, residence, or occupied vehicle is presumed to be doing so with the intent to commit an unlawful act involving force or violence.”      That means that homeowners are presumed to have “reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another” whenever someone “unlawfully and forcefully” enters their house, essentially giving homeowners broad license to shoot at intruders.      Florida law also provides homeowners who shoot intruders with sweeping protections against civil lawsuits, meaning Johnson’s family is unlikely to receive a wrongful death settlement.      Police said Jenrette is cooperating with the investigation and accompanied officers to the station for questioning.      “She’s a person that is a little distraught because this is her home that someone obviously was in,” Ferrin told CBS.      He also asked citizens to let officers do their jobs, however.      “If there’s any type of situation that happens or they believe there’s a burglary at the home or any type of confrontation, dial 911. Have the police make that confrontation,” he said. “That’s what we’re here for.”      Read more:      ‘Worst nightmare’: Woman with concealed gun permit shoots at fleeing shoplifter outside Home Depot      Mich. woman who shot at shoplifters gets 18 months probation, vows to ‘never help anybody again’      Concealed gun permit holder fatally shoots suspected robber during Chicago stickup ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Relatives of an African-American teenager shot dead in Miami by a homeowner while allegedly burglarizing their house are angry the homeowner has not been charged with murder.

Four passengers were ejected, including a toddler in a car seat. The driver, identified by the FHP as 34-year Latorya Brown, was wearing a seatbelt and suffered non-life-threatening injuries, cops tell Florida Today. The three people who died were all said to be girls under the age of 18, per the FHP, while the toddler, who was lofted over what various sources say was a 25- to 30-foot-high barrier wall, was found in the nearby yard of an unoccupied home. \\"When they arrived on scene, officers, troopers, and deputies heard the crying and found the child on the other side of the wall,\\" FHP spokesman Steve Montiero says. The child was brought to a local hospital and is in stable condition.

Her parents, Francis Calyxtus O'Keeffe and Ida (Totto) O'Keeffe, were dairy farmers. Her father was of Irish descent. Her maternal grandfather George Victor Totto, for whom O'Keeffe was named, was a Hungarian count who came to the United States in 1848. O'Keeffe then spent part of nearly every year working in New Mexico. She collected rocks and bones from the desert floor and made them and the distinctive architectural and landscape forms of the area subjects in her work. Known as a loner, O'Keeffe explored the land she loved often in her Ford Model A, which she purchased and learned to drive in 1929. She often talked about her fondness for Ghost Ranch and Northern New Mexico, as in 1943, when she explained: \\"Such a beautiful, untouched lonely feeling place, such a fine part of what I call the 'Faraway'. It is a place I have painted before ... even now I must do it again.\\"  Due to exhaustion and poor health, she did not work from late 1932 until about the mid-1930s. She was a popular and reputed artist. She received a number of commissions and her works were exhibited in New York and other places. In 1936, she completed what would become one of her most well-known paintings, Summer Days, in 1936. It depicted a desert scene with a deer skull with vibrant wildflowers. Resembling Ram's Head with Hollyhock, it depicted the skull floating above the horizon.  In 1938, the advertising agency N. W. Ayer & Son approached O'Keeffe about creating two paintings for the Hawaiian Pineapple Company (now Dole Food Company) to use in their advertising. Other artists who produced paintings of Hawaii for the Hawaiian Pineapple Company's advertising include Lloyd Sexton, Jr., Millard Sheets, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Isamu Noguchi, and Miguel Covarrubias. The offer came at a critical time in O'Keeffe's life: she was 51, and her career seemed to be stalling (critics were calling her focus on New Mexico limited, and branding her desert images \\"a kind of mass production\\"). She arrived in Honolulu February 8, 1939 aboard the SS Lurline, and spent nine weeks in Oahu, Maui, Kauai, and the island of Hawaii. By far the most productive and vivid period was on Maui, where she was given complete freedom to explore and paint. She painted flowers, landscapes, and traditional Hawaiian fishhooks. Back in New York, O'Keeffe completed a series of 20 sensual, verdant paintings. However, she did not paint the requested pineapple until the Hawaiian Pineapple Company sent a plant to her New York studio.  During the 1940s O'Keeffe had two one-woman retrospectives, the first at the Art Institute of Chicago (1943). Her second was in 1946, when she was the first woman artist to have a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in Manhattan. Whitney Museum of American Art began an effort to create the first catalogue of her work in the mid-1940s.  In the 1940s, O'Keeffe made an extensive series of paintings of what is called the \\"Black Place\\", about 150 miles west of her Ghost Ranch house. O'Keeffe said that the Black Place resembled \\"a mile of elephants with gray hills and white sand at their feet.\\" She made paintings of the \\"White Place\\", a white rock formation located near her Abiquiu house.","output":"This text is about the renowned American painter Georgia O'Keeffe. Born on November 15, 1887, in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, O'Keeffe was the daughter of dairy farmers Francis Calyxtus O'Keeffe and Ida (Totto) O'Keeffe. She was named after her maternal grandfather, George Victor Totto, a Hungarian count who immigrated to the United States in 1848. O'Keeffe is well-known for her close association with the landscape of New Mexico, where she spent significant amounts of time working and capturing the distinct natural beauty, architecture, and geological forms of the region. She had a deep connection with the places she painted, including Ghost Ranch and Northern New Mexico, and drew inspiration from the rocks and bones she collected from the desert floor. Although O'Keeffe faced periods of exhaustion, poor health, and wavering career success, she persevered, earning recognition and commissions for her work. She created numerous iconic paintings, such as 1936's Summer Days, that featured deer skulls, vibrant wildflowers, and desert scenes. In 1938, she accepted a commission from advertising agency N.W. Ayer & Son to create two paintings for the Hawaiian Pineapple Company, which led her to spend nine weeks in Hawaii producing a series of lush, tropical paintings. O'Keeffe broke barriers as a female artist, becoming the first woman to have a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in Manhattan in 1946. Throughout the 1940s, she continued to explore various landscapes in her work, painting the \\"Black Place\\" and \\"White Place\\" near her New Mexico homes. O'Keeffe's legendary career serves as an inspiration to artists worldwide, and her art remains a testament to her talent and dedication to her craft."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: To make a dustpan when you don't have one readily available. Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To make a dustpan when you don't have one readily available, you can choose from a few methods using materials commonly found at home. I will discuss some methods and compare their effectiveness to help you decide which one makes the most sense. Method 1: Cardboard dustpan You can create a makeshift dustpan using a piece of cardboard. To craft a cardboard dustpan:  1. Find a piece of cardboard (a cereal box or any thin cardboard packaging would do). 2. Using a pair of scissors or a box cutter, cut a rectangle of approximately 10 inches by 12 inches. 3. Fold the cardboard in half lengthwise, creating a crease down the middle. 4. Then, fold the bottom third back towards the crease, making sure the edges align. This creates the surface that will scoop the dust. 5. Tape the folded edges tightly to make a durable dustpan. Cardboard dustpan pros: - Easy to make from readily available materials - Lightweight - Biodegradable Cardboard dustpan cons: - Not very durable and may not hold up against heavy-duty cleaning tasks - Can become ineffective when wet Method 2: Plastic bottle dustpan Another option is to create a dustpan by re-using an empty plastic bottle. Here's how to create a plastic bottle dustpan: 1. Take a plastic bottle with a flat bottom (a 2-liter bottle works best). 2. Remove the label and clean the bottle thoroughly. 3. Using a pair of scissors, cut off the top part of the bottle, leaving only the bottom half. 4. Cut a vertical line straight up from the bottle's bottom to its middle. 5. Start cutting along the edge of the bottle's bottom to create a flat surface on one side. 6. Trim the edges to ensure smoothness and stability for your dustpan. Plastic bottle dustpan pros: - More durable than a cardboard dustpan - Can be used for wet and dry cleaning tasks - Provides a practical way to upcycle plastic waste Plastic bottle dustpan cons: - May require a little more cutting and trimming compared to cardboard dustpan - Could be less environmentally friendly if not properly disposed of In comparing these two methods, the cardboard dustpan might be ideal if you have limited resources on hand, and you need a quick, temporary solution. However, the plastic bottle dustpan offers better durability, is suitable for both wet and dry cleaning tasks, and helps upcycle an otherwise discarded item.  In conclusion, considering the durability and versatility, the plastic bottle dustpan makes more sense to accomplish the goal of creating a dustpan when you don't have one readily available. However, it is crucial to ensure that you properly dispose of the plastic dustpan later to minimize environmental impact. The cardboard dustpan can still be a preferable solution in cases where you need a quick and biodegradable option."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: An astronaut's work may sound exciting, but living in space isn't as fun as you think. The website www.space.com lists the disadvantages of living in space. Here are some of them. When astronauts work outside the station during spacewalks, they have to wear special gloves. The gloves are very tight. They can hurt the astronauts' fingernails  and even make them fall off. In space, you don't have many choices in what you eat. It's hard to get fresh fruits and vegetables. It is not OK to eat bread because it leaves crumbs . Crumbs could fly around everywhere. In space, it is impossible to have a good shower because water can fly all over the ship and break the machines. Astronauts have to use a special water-shooting  gun and a washcloth. Astronauts lose their bone strength quickly during their stay in space. So far, there is no way to solve this problem. They do exercise while they're in space to try to keep their bones strong as long as possible. Perhaps the hardest part of life in space is the feeling of loneliness. Astronauts sometimes have to spend weeks and even months away from Earth. They miss their friends and families. Question: What's the hardest part of life for astronauts in space? Answer: Answer:","output":"The hardest part of life for astronauts in space can vary depending on individual preferences and experiences. However, based on the information provided in the article, it appears that the feeling of loneliness might be considered the most challenging aspect of living in space. Astronauts often have to spend weeks and even months away from Earth, separated from their friends and families, which can lead to feelings of isolation and emotional distress. Additionally, there are various physical and practical challenges that astronauts have to face while living in space. These include wearing tight gloves during spacewalks that can hurt their fingernails and cause them to fall off, limited food choices with a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables, the inability to eat bread due to the risk of crumbs flying around and damaging equipment, and difficulties in maintaining personal hygiene with no access to a proper shower. Moreover, astronauts also suffer from a reduction in bone strength during their stay in space, for which no solution has been found yet. They try to counteract this by exercising while in space to keep their bones strong as long as possible. In conclusion, the hardest part of life for astronauts in space could be the feeling of loneliness resulting from the long-duration stays away from Earth and their loved ones. However, this is accompanied by various other physical and practical challenges that make living in space far more complex and demanding than what one might initially imagine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: Where was Moore when he took timed-sketching classes and saw a cast of the Chac Mool? is inside the article: After the Great War, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing..., can you guess it ?","output":"Moore took timed-sketching classes and saw a cast of the Chac Mool during his stay in London while studying at the Royal College of Art.

Entailment in a linguistic context refers to the relationship between two sentences where the truth of one sentence (let's call it Sentence A) guarantees the truth of another sentence (Sentence B).

On the contrary, the second sentence, \\"The Cabinet had no idea how close they were to disaster\\", suggests that the Cabinet was unaware of their proximity to disaster.

News article: Israel accused Iran of responsibility for twin bombing attempts aimed at Israeli embassy personnel in New Delhi and Tbilisi, Georgia, on Monday, fueling a growing confrontation over Iran’s nuclear program.      The rare coordinated attempts on the lives of Israeli diplomatic representatives came a month after the latest assassination of an Iranian nuclear scientist and were set against an escalating war of words between Israel and Iran over a possible Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities. The attempted attacks also coincided with the fourth anniversary of the assassination of Imad Mughniyeh, a leader of Hezbollah, a militant Shiite Lebanese group backed by Iran.      Tehran has vowed revenge for the killing of its scientists, which it has blamed on Israel, and Hezbollah has vowed to avenge the slaying of its leader, considered a mastermind of some of the group’s deadliest attacks.      There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the incidents, but Israeli officials said they appeared to have been directed by Iran, and they warned that if the Islamic republic becomes a nuclear power, it could provide greater protection for militant groups that would be emboldened by its support. Iran denied responsibility for the bombing attempts, calling them an Israeli provocation.      Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cited places where he said attacks on Israelis and Jews had recently been foiled, including Thailand and Azerbaijan, and he accused Tehran of orchestrating Monday’s plots, calling Iran “the greatest exporter of terrorism in the world.”      “In all these cases, the elements behind the attacks were Iran and its proxy, Hezbollah,” Netanyahu said. “We will continue to act with a strong hand, systematically and patiently, against international terrorism, whose source is Iran.”      In Washington, White House spokesman Jay Carney was more cautious, saying that the United States had “no information yet on who is responsible for these attacks” and adding, “We have not made a judgement yet.”      Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton issued a condemnation of the bombing incidents, calling them acts of terrorism, but she avoided any accusation of responsibility.      The United States is leading a global push for sanctions that it hopes will force Iran to suspend its uranium-enrichment program, while urging caution on Israel, which is weighing a preemptive strike against Iranian nuclear facilities. The United States, Israel and others suspect that Iran is trying to acquire the material and technology needed to build a nuclear weapon. Iran, however, says its nuclear program is aimed only at producing energy and medical isotopes.      ‘Psychological warfare’      Iran’s ambassador to India, Mehdi Nebizadeh, said Iran played no role in Monday’s attack in New Delhi.      The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, said Israel was behind the bombing incidents, which he said were intended to “tarnish Iran’s friendly ties with the host countries” and wage “psychological warfare against Iran,” according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. “Iran condemns terrorism,” the spokesman added.      In New Delhi, the wife of a member of Israel’s defense mission to India and her driver, along with two people in a nearby car, were wounded when a magnetic bomb was slapped onto her car by a passing motorcyclist as she headed to pick up her children from the American Embassy School, according to accounts by Indian and Israeli officials. The woman, Tal Yehoshua-Koren, works at the Israeli Embassy and was hospitalized with moderate injuries, Israeli officials said.      The attack, a few hundred yards from the prime minister’s residence, bore eerie similarities to the Jan. 11 killing of Iranian nuclear chemist Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan, a 32-year-old deputy head of procurement at the Natanz enrichment facility. The scientist was killed in an explosion after an unknown assailant on a motorcycle slapped a magnetic bomb on his car as he commuted to work.      Iran has openly threatened retaliation for the recent killings of its nuclear scientists and has blamed the assassinations on Israel and the United States. Clinton has categorically denied any U.S. involvement; Israeli officials have refused to comment.      At about the same time as the attack in New Delhi, officials said, a grenade was found taped to the bottom of the car of a driver for the Israeli Embassy in Tbilisi, capital of the former Soviet republic of Georgia. It was safely defused.      Already on high alert      Netanyahu offered no specific evidence for his claim that Iran was responsible for Monday’s incidents. But Israel had put its foreign missions on high alert in recent days because of the anniversary of the death of Mughniyeh, the Hezbollah mastermind, who was killed in Damascus, Syria, on Feb. 12, 2008, when a bomb planted in a headrest in his car was detonated.      Yuli Edelstein, the Israeli minister of public diplomacy, said Hezbollah and other militant groups sponsored by Iran would gain additional protection if Tehran were allowed to obtain a nuclear bomb.      “If the umbrella is based on a strategic weapon — a nuclear weapon — then it will be very difficult to penetrate that umbrella,” he told Israel Radio. “As terrorist groups, it will be very comfortable for them to be under that umbrella.”      But Shlomo Brom, an analyst at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, drew a distinction between Monday’s incidents and the standoff over Iran’s nuclear program. He said the bombing attempts were part of a shadow war that has been going on for years between Israel and Iran and the militant groups it supports.      “This is part of the covert war between the two sides,” Brom said. “The secret war is a separate playing field and is not something new. As long as both sides want to keep it there, it won’t affect the general tension.”      Denyer reported from New Delhi. Correspondents Thomas Erdbrink in Tehran and Kathy Lally in Moscow contributed to this report. ||||| Authorities in the former Soviet republic of Georgia say an explosive device was planted on the car of a driver for the Israeli Embassy but was defused.      Shota Uitashvili, spokesman for the Georgian Interior Ministry, said the driver noticed a package attached to his car's undercarriage on Monday and called police.      Police found a grenade in the package and it was defused, Utiashvili said. He did not specify where the car was parked when the device was discovered.      The Israeli Embassy in Tbilisi declined comment. ||||| An explosion tore through an Israeli diplomat's car on the streets of New Delhi on Monday, Israeli officials said. The driver and a diplomat's wife were injured, according to Indian officials.      The explosion took place in the late afternoon close to the embassy, said embassy spokesman David Goldfarb.      Television footage showed a charred minivan with blue diplomatic plates, its rear door apparently blown out.      Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor would not discuss who was injured nor the extent of the injuries because it was a security matter.      \\"We are looking into the incident and cooperation with local security forces is excellent,\\" Palmor said, from Israel.      Indian foreign ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said two people were wounded, the driver and the wife of an Israeli diplomat.      \\"They are in the hospital and being tended to,\\" he said.

Answer the following question: Information:  - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing.  - Arithmetic or arithmetics (from the Greek  \\"arithmos\\", \\"number\\") is the oldest and most elementary branch of mathematics. It consists of the study of numbers, especially the properties of the traditional operations between themaddition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Arithmetic is an elementary part of number theory, and number theory is considered to be one of the top-level divisions of modern mathematics, along with algebra, geometry, and analysis. The terms \\"arithmetic\\" and \\"higher arithmetic\\" were used until the beginning of the 20th century as synonyms for \\"number theory\\" and are sometimes still used to refer to a wider part of number theory.  - A machine is a tool containing one or more parts that uses energy to perform an intended action. Machines are usually powered by chemical, thermal, or electrical means, and are often motorized. Historically, a power tool also required moving parts to classify as a machine. However, the advent of electronics has led to the development of power tools without moving parts that are considered machines.  - The Corporate Machine is a strategy computer game from Stardock in which the goal is to create a corporation in one of four industries ( automobiles , aircraft , computers , or soft drinks ) and eventually dominate rival companies . To win the player must dominate the chosen market ( getting 55 % to 65 % of the market share depending on the number of opponents . ) The Corporate Machine is a follow up to the game Business Tycoon , which was itself a sequel to the game Entrepreneur , all developed by Stardock .  - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon.  - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers.  - Microsoft Corporation (commonly referred to as Microsoft or MS) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington, that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computers and services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, Microsoft Office office suite, and Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface tablet lineup. As of 2016, it was the world's largest software maker by revenue, and one of the world's most valuable companies.  - Stardock Corporation is a software development company founded in 1991 and incorporated in 1993 as Stardock Systems. Stardock initially developed for the OS/2 platform, but was forced to switch to Microsoft Windows due to the collapse of the OS/2 software market between 1997 and 1998. The company is best known for computer programs that allow a user to modify or extend a graphical user interface as well as personal computer games, particularly strategy games such as the \\"Galactic Civilizations\\" series, \\"\\", \\"\\", and Ashes of the Singularity.  - Galactic Civilizations is a turn-based strategy video game developed by Stardock and released in March 2003. The game is a remake of a vintage OS/2 series of the same name. An expansion pack entitled \\"Altarian Prophecy\\" was released in July 2004. A sequel, \\"\\", was released February 21, 2006. On May 14, 2015 Stardock released \\"Galactic Civilizations III\\".  - Computer software, or simply software, is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built.  - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines.  - Microsoft Windows (or simply Windows) is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the OS typically associated with IBM PC compatible architecture. Active Windows families include Windows NT, Windows Embedded and Windows Phone; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) or Windows Server. Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x; Windows 10 Mobile is an active product, unrelated to the defunct family Windows Mobile.  - A Company is a legal entity made up of an association of persons, be they natural, legal, or a mixture of both, for carrying on a commercial or industrial enterprise. Company members share a common purpose and unite in order to focus their various talents and organize their collectively available skills or resources to achieve specific, declared goals. Companies take various forms such as:  - A microwave oven (commonly referred to as a microwave) is a kitchen appliance that heats and cooks food by exposing it to microwave radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum. This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating. Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer of a homogeneous, high water content food item; food is more evenly heated throughout (except in heterogeneous, dense objects) than generally occurs in other cooking techniques.  - In consumer electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, used to operate the device wirelessly from a short distance. Remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the consumer, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level.  - A smartphone is a mobile phone (also known as cell phones or cell mobiles) with an advanced mobile operating system that combines features of a personal computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use. Smartphones, which are usually pocket-sized, typically combine the features of a mobile phone, such as the abilities to place and receive voice calls and create and receive text messages, with those of other popular digital mobile devices like personal digital assistants (PDAs), such as an event calendar, media player, video games, GPS navigation, digital camera and digital video camera. Smartphones can access the Internet and can run a variety of third-party software components (\\"apps\\" from Google Play, Apple App Store, etc). They typically have a color display with a graphical user interface that covers more than 76% of the front surface. The display is almost always a touchscreen and sometimes additionally a touch-enabled keyboard like the Priv/Passport BlackBerrys, which enables the user to use a virtual keyboard to type words and numbers and press onscreen icons to activate \\"app\\" features.  - A corporation is a company or group of people authorized to act as a single entity (legally a person) and recognized as such in law. Early incorporated entities were established by charter (i.e. by an \\"ad hoc\\" act granted by a monarch or passed by a parliament or legislature). Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through registration.  - A mobile device (or handheld computer) is a small computing device, typically, small enough to hold and operate in the hand and having an operating system capable of running mobile apps. These may provide a diverse range of functions. Typically, the device will have a display screen with a small numeric or alphanumeric keyboard or a touchscreen providing a virtual keyboard and buttons (icons) on-screen. Many such devices can connect to the Internet and interconnect with other devices such as car entertainment systems or headsets via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or near field communication (NFC). Integrated cameras, digital media players, mobile phone and GPS capabilities are common. Power is typically provided by a lithium battery.

The two leaders butted heads over the conflict in Syria, the Washington Post reports. \\"Our opinions do not coincide,\\" said Putin. \\"But all of us have the intention to stop the violence in Syria.\\" Obama echoed that, saying \\"we do have differing perspectives on the problem.\\" While the US has agreed to supply rebel forces with weapons, Russia remains Assad's main weapons supplier; the White House also announced today that it will send another 300 million in aid for Syrian refugees, reports the BBC. The AP notes that Syria will continue to be the hot topic among G8 leaders at a working dinner tonight; Obama is expected to push Britain and France to join the US in arming the rebels. But the real standoff between Obama and Putin happened outside of a meeting room, reports the Sun. According to a source: \\"Both wanted the gym and Obama’s people requested it first. It could have sparked a bitter battle and ended up a laughable sticking point at the talks—but the Russians backed down.\\" So while Obama worked out in air-conditioned comfort, the notoriously tough Putin went swimming in a chilly nearby lake. Another quirky G8 side note: Putin and Obama are neighbors. Article:","output":"Title: Tensions Rise between Obama and Putin at the G8 Summit over the Syrian Conflict The G8 Summit witnessed a tense two-hour meeting between the then US President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin today. At the center of their discussion was the ongoing conflict in Syria, which exposed their differing stances on the issue as reported by the Washington Post. As global powers, both leaders expressed their desires to put an end to the violence in Syria; however, their approaches to achieve this goal seemed to diverge significantly. During the meeting, Putin candidly admitted the difference in opinions by stating, \\"Our opinions do not coincide, but all of us have the intention to stop the violence in Syria.\\" Obama, in his response, acknowledged this by saying, \\"We do have differing perspectives on the problem.\\" This open admission of opposing views by both leaders highlights the complicated nature of international diplomacy when it comes to resolving conflicts like the one in Syria. The tussle between both leaders could be attributed to their respective country's positions on the Syrian crisis. While the United States decided to side with the Syrian rebels, agreeing to supply them with weapons to fight against the ruling regime, Russia, on the other hand, remained a staunch supporter of President Bashar al-Assad's government by providing them with weapons supplies. This fundamental difference in their approach to address the Syrian conflict only added to the heated discussion between both leaders. Moreover, the White House announced on the same day that it would be sending an additional 300 million in aid to support the Syrian refugees, according to the BBC. It is evident that the Syrian crisis topped the G8 Summit's agenda, as the leaders attended a working dinner following the Obama-Putin meeting, with Syria continuing to be the primary topic of conversation. Anticipating further discussions on the issue, Obama was expected to persuade Britain and France to join the United States in arming the Syrian rebels. However, the real standoff between Obama and Putin manifested outside the meeting room, as reported by The Sun. A peculiar incident that could have developed into an international diplomatic dispute was averted when both leaders wanted to use the gym facilities at the same time. Obama's team was the first to request access to the gym, potentially sparking a tense battle between the leaders. In a surprising turn of events, the Russians backed down, enabling Obama to enjoy an air-conditioned workout while the \\"notoriously tough\\" Putin opted for a swim in a chilly nearby lake instead. Interestingly, Putin and Obama were neighbors during the G8 Summit, further highlighting their unavoidable proximity despite their markedly different views. In conclusion, the G8 Summit shed light on the uneasy relationship between former US President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin, as the Syrian conflict consistently revealed their contrasting viewpoints. The high-profile meeting between the two leaders demonstrated the inherent challenges and complexities of international diplomacy, with the future of peace and stability in Syria hanging in the balance at the time. Although the two leaders openly expressed their opposing opinions, their commitment to finding a resolution to the violence in Syria was a shared objective that could not be understated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: I loved KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER since I saw it on the night it premiered on September 13, 1974. I loved the monsters which seemed scary at the time and the cool music by Gil Melle (hey, where's the soundtrack guys?) and have often thought about what makes this show work for me so completely and have finally concluded that the reason it endures when many others do not is one simple, important element it has that almost no other scary show seems to have and that is a main character that most people can relate to on an everyday level. When Darren McGavin's Carl Kolchak starts to discover odd situations, he reacts like most people would. He finds them odd and as he gets closer to danger, he is frightened, even if he knows he must move forward to try to defeat whichever menace is being showcased in that episode. It's rare that he is brave enough to stand up against some superior supernatural force. He's usually set a trap and is hiding or waiting in the wings to see if it works. Sometimes, he seems as surprised that he managed to defeat a foe as we are. In one episode, he goes to find a monster in a sewer but when he first sees it, he runs to get out of there but is trapped so reluctantly, he must go back and defend himself. He's heroic because he is willing to do things most of us probably wouldn't do but that doesn't mean he probably wouldn't much rather someone else did it instead of him. He's a regular guy, doing a job, trying to make a buck, not a monster-hunter. He just gets wrapped up in things involving the supernatural, which he has an interest in but he doesn't want to be hurt or killed anymore than any of the rest of us do. If his plan to defeat the creature didn't work, you will often see him running for his life to get away from it, which is of course what I would do in the situation. That's why I was often watching the climax of the shows through my fingers as a kid. Kolchak was likable and you cared if something bad happened to him. You were scared for him and for the other characters too. The producers and writers obviously knew that anyone can create a monster suit, scary music and direct a suspenseful scene but it's all for naught if you don't care about the characters. Darren McGavin said that the reason why the show only lasted on season was because he got tired of doing a \\"monster of the week\\" show and he decided not to continue. I can tell you I mourned when this show was canceled when I was a kid but, as an adult, I can see why it couldn't go on in that formula for very long. I still love the 20 episodes and two movies that starred McGavin as the bumbling, determined and brusk but good-hearted reporter for the INS, known as Carl Kolchak. I seriously doubt anyone who makes shows or movies will ever really understand why I loved the show. It's not the monsters, darkly-lit sets, creepy music or goofy guest stars, although they are all vital ingredients. The secret to it's success is right there in the title - \\"Kolchak: The Night Stalker\\". Without McGavin's lovable, bumbling Carl Kolchak to root for and to care for, then it just ain't a Night Stalker.

Very difficult,' she added, referring to Taylor and Russell's five-year-old daughter Kennedy. And Kyle said news of Russell's death was a 'complete shock.' She said: 'I always saw him as being reserved and. quiet. I knew that they had their issues. But no-one could have. anticipated something like that.' But all three housewives were adamant when asked by Today show host Savannah Guthrie if appearing on the reality show had 'racked up the pressure' on Russell. 'We lead and they follow,' said Lisa. 'We create and they document. I've never felt any responsibility to bring drama. 'If you follow the lives of six people over a year, and we've all had some major issues in the last year and a half, they just tell the accurate story.' 'It's basically documenting our lives. It's reality TV and it's very real,' added Adrienne,. They also admitted there was some thought about whether the season would go ahead. 'I think we all had to reflect at some point,' admitted Adrienne. Their responses came just days after Russell's mother John Ann. Hotchkiss released a statement expressing her dissatisfaction that the season would not be delayed following her son's death by hanging at a friend's house in L.A. on August 15. Difficult: Lisa Vanderpump revealed she had spent a few evenings with cast mate Taylor Armstrong, who had been 'trying to digest' the events of the past few weeks. Speaking out: Kyle came to the defence of the reality show, saying that Russell Armstrong had signed up for season two, while Adrienne said they had to 'reflect' following the tragedy. 'When I was informed of this, I thought, \\"I hope Bravo will take the. high road and keep it tasteful. Let's not murder my son twice.\\" She. said: \\"I began to notice things starting to fray when the television. thing came into being, and I was very concerned. The programme itself. really brought him down.' However Kyle reiterated that Russell had 'signed up for season one and came back for season two.' She. added: 'When we started the show, they cast six women and they didn't. really know anything about our story. Not appearing: Russell Armstrong, seen here in a first season episode of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, will not be seen in the first few episodes of the new season. 'They didn't know in season one. that Kelsey was going to leave Camille or the issues between my sister. (Kim) and me. They certainly didn't know the troubles that he had.' 'This show is about. six strong, aggressive, successful beautiful women and their stories,' added Ross. 'And although Taylor and Russell's story is a part of it, it's not the. whole show. 'But we did want to address it appropriately and that's why. tonight's episode gets the entire cast together to sit down and. reflect and talk about their feelings of sadness and grief and try to. put the season we shot six months ago in perspective.' Controversial: Tonight's season premiere of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills will go ahead as planned despite the Armstrong tragedy.

With his underworld dealing catching him up, Andre is given 24 hours to find 20,000 Euros to pay off his debts and save his life.

The Paris region hosts France's highest concentration of the grandes écoles – 55 specialised centres of higher-education outside the public university structure. The prestigious public universities are usually considered grands établissements. Most of the grandes écoles were relocated to the suburbs of Paris in the 1960s and 1970s, in new campuses much larger than the old campuses within the crowded city of Paris, though the École Normale Supérieure has remained on rue d'Ulm in the 5th arrondissement. There are a high number of engineering schools, led by the Paris Institute of Technology which comprises several colleges such as École Polytechnique, École des Mines, AgroParisTech, Télécom Paris, Arts et Métiers, and École des Ponts et Chaussées. There are also many business schools, including HEC, INSEAD, ESSEC, and ESCP Europe. The administrative school such as ENA has been relocated to Strasbourg, the political science school Sciences-Po is still located in Paris' 7th arrondissement and the most prestigious university of economics and finance, Paris-Dauphine, is located in Paris' 16th.

Tristan Tzara (French: [tRista dzaRa]; Romanian: [tris'tan 'tsara]; born Samuel or Samy Rosenstock, also known as S. Samyro; April 16 [O.S. April 4] 1896 - December 25, 1963) was a Romanian and French avant-garde poet, essayist and performance artist. Also active as a journalist, playwright, literary and art critic, composer and film director, he was known best for being one of the founders and central figures of the anti-establishment Dada movement. Under the influence of Adrian Maniu, the adolescent Tzara became interested in Symbolism and co-founded the magazine Simbolul with Ion Vinea (with whom he also wrote experimental poetry) and painter Marcel Janco. During World War I, after briefly collaborating on Vinea's Chemarea, he joined Janco in Switzerland. S. Samyro, a partial anagram of Samy Rosenstock, was used by Tzara from his debut and throughout the early 1910s. A number of undated writings, which he probably authored as early as 1913, bear the signature Tristan Ruia, and, in summer of 1915, he was signing his pieces with the name Tristan.  In the 1960s, Rosenstock's collaborator and later rival Ion Vinea claimed that he was responsible for coining the Tzara part of his pseudonym in 1915. Vinea also stated that Tzara wanted to keep Tristan as his adopted first name, and that this choice had later attracted him the \\"infamous pun\\" Triste Ane Tzara (French for \\"Sad Donkey Tzara\\"). This version of events is uncertain, as manuscripts show that the writer may have already been using the full name, as well as the variations Tristan Tara and Tr. Tzara, in 1913-1914 (although there is a possibility that he was signing his texts long after committing them to paper).  In 1972, art historian Serge Fauchereau, based on information received from Colomba, the wife of avant-garde poet Ilarie Voronca, recounted that Tzara himself had explained his chosen name was a pun in Romanian, trist in tara, meaning \\"sad in the country\\"; Colomba Voronca was also dismissing rumors that Tzara had selected Tristan as a tribute to poet Tristan Corbiere or to Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde opera. Samy Rosenstock legally adopted his new name in 1925, after filing a request with Romania's Ministry of the Interior. The French pronunciation of his name has become commonplace in Romania, where it replaces its more natural reading as tara (\\"the land\\", Romanian pronunciation: ['tsara]).

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: An examination of digital equipment recovered from the home of the couple who killed 14 people in San Bernardino last week has led FBI investigators to believe the shooters were planning an even larger assault, according to federal government sources.      Investigators on Thursday continued to search for digital footprints left by Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, scouring a downtown San Bernardino lake for electronic items, including a hard drive that the couple was hoping to destroy, sources told The Times.      FBI agents will probably spend days searching Seccombe Lake and canvassing the neighborhood for clues after receiving a tip that the couple may have visited the area on the day of the attack, according to David Bowdich, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office.      Farook and Malik were in the final planning stages of an assault on a location or building that housed a lot more people than the Inland Regional Center, possibly a nearby school or college, according to federal sources familiar with the widening investigation.      Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times A memorial to victims of the terrorist attack in San Bernardino continues to grow near the Inland Regional Center. A memorial to victims of the terrorist attack in San Bernardino continues to grow near the Inland Regional Center. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times)      Investigators have based that conclusion on evidence left behind on Farook and Malik's computers and digital devices, not all of which the couple were able to destroy before they were killed in a firefight with police, the sources said.      Images of San Bernardino-area schools were found on a cellphone belonging to Farook, according to a law enforcement source. But the source cautioned that Farook may have had a legitimate reason to have the images because his work as a county health inspector involved checking on school dining facilities.      On Thursday, one of the federal government sources told The Times that Farook asked his friend and neighbor, Enrique Marquez, to buy two military-style rifles used in the attacks because he feared he \\"wouldn't pass a background check\\" if he attempted to acquire the weapons on his own. The rifles were bought at a local gun store, the source said.      The timing of the rifle purchases is significant to FBI investigators. Another federal government source previously told The Times that Farook may have been considering a separate terror plot in 2011 or 2012.      Farook was self-radicalizing around that time, FBI Director James Comey said, and met Malik soon after, eventually escorting her to the United States. Farook was a practicing Muslim. Marquez converted to Islam around the time he purchased the weapons, sources have told The Times.      FBI agents believe Farook abandoned his plans to launch the earlier attack after a law enforcement task force arrested three men in Chino in November 2012. The men were later convicted of charges related to providing material support to terrorists and plotting to kill Americans in Afghanistan. A fourth man arrested in Afghanistan also was convicted in the scheme.      Bowdich said federal agents are investigating whether the men had ties to Farook.      Marquez has emerged as a central figure in the investigation. The FBI had been conducting interviews with 24-year-old, who checked himself into a mental health facility after the attacks.      The former Wal-Mart security guard has waived his Miranda rights and cooperated with the inquiry, and it was Marquez who told FBI agents about Farook's earlier plans, according to one of the government sources, who also requested anonymity.      (Rick Loomis / Los Angeles Times)      \\"They were talking generally about something, but I don't think it made it to anything specific,\\" one of the sources said of the earlier plot. \\"I don't think it got to a time or a place.\\"      The source said it remains unclear whether Marquez had any involvement in the planning of the shooting or had any prior knowledge that an attack was pending.      Marquez, a cycling enthusiast who wanted to join the U.S. Navy, was a longtime friend and neighbor of Farook. He also married the sister of Farook's sister-in-law last year, although the circumstances of the union are now under investigation, a government official previously told The Times.      There was no paperwork transferring ownership of the assault rifles from Marquez to Farook, as required by California law, government officials told The Times.      Hours after the shooting, Marquez posted a cryptic message on his Facebook page.      \\"I'm. Very sorry sguys,\\" the message read. \\"It was a pleasure.\\"      Bowdich on Thursday declined to answer questions about Marquez, who has not been charged with a crime.      Marquez told FBI agents that the Facebook post has been \\"misunderstood,\\" according to one of the government sources. Agents are concerned that Marquez's mental and emotional state may affect what he has been telling interrogators, the source said.      While Marquez has spoken to agents about his ties to Farook, federal officials are still working to verify the information he has provided, the source said.      Marquez's mother, Armida Chacon, addressed reporters on Thursday from her Tomlinson Avenue home in Riverside, sobbing as she said she hadn't been in contact with her son since the day of the massacre.      \\"I don't know how this happened.... My world is upside-down,\\" she said. \\"My life changed Wednesday.\\"      Chacon was outside with one of her sons, cleaning up the broken glass and twisted panels of their garage door. The damage occurred when federal agents raided the stucco home over the weekend.      As she combed through the wreckage of the garage door, Chacon eventually turned to the reporters camped out on the street and agreed to an off-camera interview.      Marquez was his mother's \\"right hand at home,\\" helping take care of his brothers, she said.      She said her son loved to hang out with friends and go to parties.      \\"My son is a good person,\\" she said.      When asked about Farook, Chacon said her son was friends with him and \\"nothing more.\\" ||||| SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (Reuters) - A week-old investigation into the shooting rampage that left 14 people dead at a holiday party in Southern California turned on Thursday to a small lake near the scene of the massacre, where divers searched for evidence.      FBI agents pack up diving gear after searching in the water at Seccombe Lake Park, after last week's shooting in San Bernardino, California December 10, 2015. REUTERS/Patrick T. Fallon      The FBI also revealed investigators were looking into any connections there may have been between one of the two killers in San Bernardino last week and four men arrested in 2012 in a separate federal terrorism case brought in nearby Riverside, California.      Thursday’s underwater search stemmed from unspecified leads indicating the married couple who carried out the shooting spree had been in the vicinity of Seccombe Lake in San Bernardino on the day of the killings, said David Bowdich, assistant director of the FBI field office in Los Angeles.      Bowdich said he would not discuss the “specific evidence we’re looking for.”      CNN reported investigators were seeking a computer hard drive that belonged to the couple, who the FBI has said were inspired by Islamic extremists. Bowdich said investigators already have combed the surrounding park, and that the search of the lake by FBI and Sheriff’s Department divers could take days.      Seccombe Lake Park lies about 2.5 miles (4 km) north of the Inland Regional Center, the social services agency where 14 people were killed and 22 others injured when Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, stormed a holiday gathering of his co-workers there on Dec. 2 and opened fire with assault rifles.      Farook, 28, a U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native he married last year in Saudi Arabia, were slain hours after their attack in a shootout with police.      The FBI said it is treating the mass shooting as an act of terrorism, citing the couple’s declaration that they were acting on behalf of the militant group Islamic State, as well as a large cache of weapons, ammunition and bomb-making materials seized in the investigation.      The couple’s motives remain unclear. But if the crime proves to have been the work of killers driven by militant Islamic ideology, as the FBI suspects, it would mark the deadliest such attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2011.      The latest slayings and disclosures about the killers’ backgrounds have put law U.S. law enforcement on heightened alert and reverberated into the U.S. presidential campaign, intensifying debates over gun control, immigration and national security.      POSSIBLE LINKS TO 2012 PLOT EXAMINED      Speaking to reporters at Seccombe Lake on Thursday, Bowdich disclosed the FBI was examining whether Farook had any links with the four conspirators in the Riverside case, as CNN and other media outlets have reported.      A jury last year convicted two of those men, including Afghan-born ringleader Sohiel Omar Kabir, of conspiring to provide material support and resources to al Qaeda and plotting to attack U.S. military forces in Afghanistan. Their two co-defendants pleaded guilty in the case.      CNN, citing unnamed officials, reported Farook had been a member of Kabir’s social circle. Asked whether the FBI knew of any ties between Farook and the four convicted Riverside conspirators, Bowdich said: “It would be irresponsible not to investigate.” He stressed the four Riverside defendants were never accused of planning attacks within the United States.      FBI Director James Comey told a U.S. Senate committee on Wednesday that the couple were discovered to have been discussing jihad and martyrdom online with each other as far back as 2013, a year before they met in person.      Flowers and candles are displayed at a makeshift memorial after last week's shooting in San Bernardino, California December 10, 2015. REUTERS/Patrick T. Fallon      Comey said the precise origins of the couple’s radicalization were as yet unknown but appeared to predate the rise of Islamic State, the militant group that has seized vast swaths of Iraq and Syria and last month claimed responsibility for the assaults on Paris that left 130 dead.      U.S. government sources told Reuters on Thursday that Malik tried in vain to contact multiple Islamic militant groups in the months before she and Farook staged their attack, but her overtures were ignored.      The organizations Malik sought out likely shied away out of extreme caution in communicating with individuals unknown to them and a fear of being caught up in a law-enforcement “sting” operation, sources said.      The number of organizations that Malik attempted to approach and how she sought to reach them were unclear, though the groups almost certainly included al Qaeda’s Syria-based official affiliate, the Nusrah Front, the government sources said.      One source said investigators have little, if any, evidence that Malik or her husband had any direct contact with Islamic State.      Slideshow (22 Images)      LAWMAKERS BRIEFED      While the militant group has since embraced the couple as among its followers, U.S. government sources have said there was no evidence Islamic State even knew of the couple before the San Bernardino killings.      Comey, along with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and John Mulligan, deputy director of the National Counterterrorism Center, briefed members of both houses of Congress on Thursday about the investigation in closed, classified sessions.      “The current impression is that these two people were acting alone,” U.S. Senator Angus King of Maine told CNN after the briefing. But he added that he was troubled by the fact that the couple had tried to cover their tracks by destroying their cell phones and other electronic equipment.      Representative Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, told reporters afterward that there were people in the community who saw suspicious activity at the shooters’ house but decided not to tell authorities “for a variety of reasons.”      New York Representative Peter King, a senior Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee, emerged from the session calling for “more surveillance in the Muslim community here in the United States.”      He drew comparisons to heightened scrutiny law enforcement placed on Italian-American and Irish-American communities during past investigations of organized crime.      “You look where the terror is going to come from, and right now, it is going to come from the Muslim community,” he said. “It’s a small percentage, but to me, the only way you find out about it in advance is having sources and informers on the ground, having constant surveillance.”      Investigators also have been looking into the couple’s ties with Enrique Marquez, a boyhood friend of Farook and Muslim convert who bought the two rifles used in the attack. A federal law enforcement source said Marquez and Farook appear to have contemplated some sort of attack around 2012 but abandoned the idea.      Marquez, who is related to Farook’s family by marriage - his wife and the wife of Farook’s older brother are sisters - has not been charged with any crime. ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government appears not to have picked up on extremist messages exchanged during the online courtship two years ago between the American-born man accused in the California shootings and his then-fiancée in Pakistan, according to lawmakers detailing closed-door briefings by federal officials on Capitol Hill.

(Associated Press)      American officials say 28-year-old Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, 29-year-old Tashfeen Malik, discussed martyrdom and jihad online as early as 2013. But the couple never surfaced on law enforcement's radar and Malik was able to enter the U.S. on a fiancée visa last year despite having professed radical views online.      Meanwhile, the investigation into the shootings that left 14 dead last week continued in San Bernardino, where an FBI dive team searched a small, urban lake about 3 miles north of the shooting site. Authorities said the shooters, who killed 14 people at a holiday gathering on Dec. 2, had been in the area.      The couple died in a shootout with law enforcement hours after the attack and left behind a 6-month-old daughter.      FBI Director James Comey and other senior American officials briefed members of Congress Thursday. Lawmakers repeatedly questioned officials on whether any red flags may have been missed in the last two years.      One official said information that the FBI has been able to glean came from an examination of the pair's electronic devices after the attack, rather than intercepts.      \\"Everyone's asking the same questions about how it is that law enforcement didn't know, or intelligence officials didn't know — that they could have flown under the radar and nothing gave an indication that they were a threat,\\" said Rep. Jim Langevin, a Rhode island Democrat and member of the House Homeland Security Committee.      Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Malik was subjected to an in-person interview during the application process for a visa.      He noted that while there were some indications that might have alerted law enforcement to Farook, he declined to detail what those might have been.      \\"I don't think we know yet enough to say these were apparent without the advantage of hindsight,\\" Schiff said.      Republican Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said there's currently no evidence Malik's radicalization would have been readily apparent when she was evaluated for a fiancée visa.      \\"I don't think there was missed information,\\" he said. \\"It appears that there was not any evidence that would have been discoverable during an interview for a visa.\\"      He declined to discuss what specifically led investigators to conclude that the couple had radicalized independently as early as 2013, but suggested the information did not come from intercepts. Comey has said Farook had been in communication with individuals who were being scrutinized by the FBI in terrorism investigations, but that the contact he had was not enough to bring him onto the law enforcement radar.      \\"It's safe to say that the information about what happened prior to their marriage and to the attacks in San Bernardino was acquired through forensic investigations of these individual lives,\\" Hurd said, adding: \\"These people weren't on the radar.\\"      Multiple lawmakers raised the fact that neighbors saw suspicious activities but failed to mention them to investigators until after the attack.      \\"There were people who were aware of things, thought they were suspicious, but did not want to be accused of being discriminatory for reporting something,\\" said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. He said these people saw activity around the garage that they thought was suspicious.      Asked repeatedly whether any hints could have led law enforcement to prevent the attack, Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C. replied, \\"Explain to me how you do that without any bread crumbs that are obvious, without somebody that's inside a mosque, that's inside a person's family that tips you off. In this particular case there was nothing like that that gave them a reason to look at this couple sooner than after the attack.\\"      More than three years ago, Farook's longtime friend and relative-through-marriage Enrique Marquez bought the assault rifles used in the shooting.      Marquez, who checked himself into a mental hospital after the attack, told investigators that he and Farook were plotting an attack in 2012. Idaho Sen. Jim Risch, a Republican who sits on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said they had an actual plan, including buying weapons, but became apprehensive and shelved it because of law enforcement activity and arrests in the area. Marquez hasn't been charged with a crime.      Lawmakers said the FBI wouldn't provide details about his ties to the case, citing an \\"ongoing criminal investigation.\\" Marquez's mother Armida Chacon told reporters Thursday that her 24-year-old son is a good person.      ___      Associated Press writers Brian Melley, Michael R.

Always cut and then stamp, so you can ensure that the stamp fits onto the cookie. 2). Always stamp and then cut, as stamping will change the size and thickness of the cookie.","output":"When deciding how to accomplish the goal of stamping cookies with a pattern, we can choose from the given options and justify each step accordingly: OPTION 1: 1. Always cut and then stamp, so you can ensure that the stamp fits onto the cookie. Steps: Step 1: Roll out the cookie dough to the desired thickness using a rolling pin. Step 2: Use a cookie cutter to cut out the desired shapes from the dough. Step 3: Press the cookie stamp gently onto the cut cookies, ensuring the stamp fits perfectly on each cookie. Justification: By cutting the cookies first, you will have the desired shape ready before applying the stamp pattern. This method works well if your stamp has a smaller surface area than your cookie shape, ensuring the entire pattern transfers to the cookie without any adjustments. OPTION 2: 1. Always stamp and then cut, as stamping will change the size and thickness of the cookie. Steps: Step 1: Roll out the cookie dough to the desired thickness using a rolling pin. Step 2: Use the cookie stamp to press the desired patterns into the dough. Step 3: Cut around the stamped pattern using a cookie cutter or a knife.

Its name resonates through the culinary world for its select culinary artistry reflecting the traditional yet innovative Chinese food it offers to its mature clientele.  The restaurant's ethos is embedded in delivering the rich tapestry of Chinese gastronomy, providing its customers an array of dishes that are not only palatable but also aesthetically pleasing. From succulent Peking duck to spicy Szechuan delicacies, Loch Fyne curates each dish with immense attention to detail, ensuring a sublime feast for the senses. Despite its lack of family-friendly activities and services, it stands as a beacon for lovers of Chinese cuisine seeking an exclusive and high-end dining environment. The ambiance of Loch Fyne leans toward an elevated, mature atmosphere, more akin to a quiet, intimate dinner rather than a boisterous family gathering. While the name Loch Fyne might imply a Scottish origin, the restaurant diverges from the traditional local food of the highlands, instead, it ventures into the enigmatic and diverse world of Chinese food. This mesmerising blend of different food cultures under one roof has managed to catch the attention of food connoisseurs and critics, who often laud Loch Fyne for its bold and experimental approach to Chinese cuisine. Its matured and polished audiences often engage in insightful conversations, leaving an eloquent baritone murmur hovering above the clinking of fine china and silver cutlery. Often it's the hub for business meetings and romantic dinners, which require a sophisticated environment that the restaurant maintains meticulously. Loch Fyne reinforces the idea that dining out is not just about feeding your hunger, but it's an immersive experience involving all of your senses. The restaurant offers an escape from the mundane, a chance to delve into an exotic culinary adventure. With Loch Fyne, the journey to experience authentic and elegant Chinese cuisine is just as appealing as the destination itself.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Apple Inc. (AAPL) surpassed Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) to seize the title of world’s most valuable company, as investor confidence in high-tech growth prospects exceeded faith in the oil industry’s gushing profits.      While both companies declined today, Exxon fell more, leaving it with a market value of 330.8 billion, compared with 337.2 billion for Apple at the close of U.S. markets. Yesterday was the first time Apple passed Exxon in intraday trading.      The showdown with Exxon follows Apple’s 14-year transformation from a personal-computer also-ran into a seller of everything from smartphones to digital music. Apple has already eclipsed Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and Intel Corp. (INTC), whose dominance of the technology industry in the 1990s helped nudge Apple to the fringes of the PC market.      “The Apple of today is different from the Apple of even a few years ago,” Shaw Wu, an analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach, said in an interview. “People who buy Apple tend to buy big and get your friends and family to do it as well. There’s nothing else like that.”      The shares have climbed 13 percent this year, fueled by sales of the iPad and iPhone, and a burgeoning business in China. Apple fell 2.3 percent to 363.69 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Shares of Irving, Texas-based Exxon declined 4.4 percent to 68.03 on the New York Stock Exchange.      Oil Futures      Exxon has tumbled since trading in July at more than 85 a share, as oil futures in New York have dropped. Exxon bought XTO Energy Inc. last year to tap natural-gas shale deposits in North America and is seeking to buy more gas reserves, even as futures remain about 4 per million British thermal units.      “Two things that I would definitely say have hurt Exxon are lower oil prices and its increasing reliance on natural gas,” said Philip Weiss, an analyst at Argus Research in New York. Weiss, whose family owns some Exxon shares, has a “buy” rating on the company.      Apple, meanwhile, is poised to increase computer sales as much as twofold over the next few years, and the iPhone business may triple in size, Wu said. If successful, the company’s new iCloud music and information-storage service, which only works with Apple products, could further lock its customers into buying the company’s devices.      Profit Surge      Apple’s profit more than doubled last quarter to 7.31 billion on revenue of 28.6 billion. The company had record sales of iPhones and iPads -- products that didn’t exist five years ago -- and they now account for about two-thirds of revenue. Apple also has accumulated 76.2 billion in cash and other holdings.      Even so, the company’s profits are eclipsed by Exxon’s. Analysts estimate that Apple’s net income will reach almost 26 billion in the fiscal year ending in September, according to Bloomberg data. That compares with about 42 billion for Exxon in calendar 2011.      The gulf between the companies’ revenue is even larger. Apple’s sales will be 108.1 billion this fiscal year, analysts estimate. For Exxon, the projection is 481.6 billion.      Apple Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs, who co-founded the company at the age of 21, was ousted by the board in 1985. When he returned 12 years later, Apple had run up 1.86 billion in losses over two years. It was 90 days away from bankruptcy, Jobs would later say.      New Markets      He engineered the company’s comeback by honing Apple’s industrial design, tightly integrating software with hardware, and pushing into new markets, such as phones, music and tablets.      The iPhone, introduced in 2007, has become Apple’s best- selling product and turned the company into the world’s biggest smartphone maker. After winning customers away from Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM) and Nokia Oyj, Apple is now sparring with Google Inc. for leadership in the market for mobile-phone software.      The company stoked recent growth with a new version of its Mac computer operating system called OS X Lion, along with updated computers. ICloud, meanwhile, will let users store, synchronize and access files from different Apple devices.      Apple’s shares are up from an adjusted 5.48 on Sept. 16, 1997, the day Jobs retook the reins as head of the company.      To contact the reporter on this story: Adam Satariano in San Francisco at asatariano1@bloomberg.net      To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net ||||| The iPhone and iPad maker had the lead for much of the afternoon before its stock closed just behind Exxon's. The two companies are so close that Apple is likely to keep the top spot soon.      Apple Inc.'s stock gained 5.9 percent to 374.01 on Tuesday, bringing its market capitalization to about 347 billion.      Exxon Mobil Corp.'s stock, meanwhile, closed up 2.1 percent at 71.64. That gives the oil company a market cap of 348 billion. Its stock was down earlier in the day, allowing Apple to take the lead.      Other big-name corporations, such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and General Electric Co., don't even come close. Apple overtook Microsoft Corp., the previous No. 2, just last year.      Does this mean people need iPads more than oil?      \\"Exxon obviously sells a product that people need. Apple sells a product that people want,\\" said Brian Marshall, an analyst with Gleacher & Co. who follows Apple.      Exxon, which set a record in 2008 for the highest quarterly earnings by any company, has limited growth prospects, which are driven by oil prices and discovering new oil. It's growing, but not as quickly as Apple, which is charging ahead at the pace of a startup, Marshall says, even though the company is 35 years old.      Apple, which is based in Cupertino, California, has been on a roll with the soaring popularity of its iPad tablet computer and strong sales of the iPhone. Its growth is limited only by innovation. Investors expect it to grow as long as it keeps making products that people want. So investors are betting on Apple's stock even though it currently makes less money than Exxon.      In its latest quarterly report, Apple said stronger iPhone and iPad sales helped more than double its net income to 7.31 billion and grow revenue by 82 percent to 28.6 billion.      Exxon Mobil, meanwhile, posted a 41 percent increase in its second-quarter earnings to 10.68 billion, the largest since it set a record of 14.8 billion in the third quarter of 2008. Its revenue grew 36 percent to 125.5 billion.      International companies that vie for the most valuable spot in the world include PetroChina Co., the publicly traded unit of China's biggest oil and gas company, and Petrobras, Brazil's state-controlled energy company.      In the U.S., Exxon and General Electric had been trading off the No. 1 and No. 2 spots until Microsoft surpassed them both in early 1999, at the height of the dot-com boom. By 2000, though, GE was No. 1 once again. According to data from FactSet, the three were close over the next five years, though Apple was ascending quickly.      Exxon Mobil, which is based in Irving, Texas, took the top spot in 2005 and, for now, remained there on Tuesday.      Marshall believes Apple may pass yet another milestone next year, when it's likely to surpass Hewlett-Packard Co. as the world's largest technology company by revenue. In the quarter that ended in April, HP reported 31.6 billion in revenue, compared with Apple's 28.6 billion in the just-ended period. HP reports results for the May-July period next week. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Apple Inc. surpassed Exxon Mobil Corp. to become the world's most valuable company, reflecting investor confidence in high-tech growth prospects over the oil industry. Although both companies experienced a decline, Exxon fell more, resulting in a market value of 330.8 billion compared to Apple's 337.2 billion at the close of U.S. markets. The milestone followed Apple's transformation from a struggling personal computer company into a leading seller of smartphones and digital music, and came after Apple had already overtaken major technology companies like Microsoft, IBM, and Intel in market value. With a focus on innovation, Apple's growth continues to rapidly accelerate, driven by sales of its popular iPad, iPhone, and increasing business in China."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Before I start, I just want to clarify that when I am referring to detox I mean the ones that you buy where you have to take a million various tablets a day and stick to a very restricted diet. If you are going to 'detox' by simply eating healthily then all power to you. That will most definitely do wonders for your body. These detox kits won't. They will produce results; however, the results will be temporary.

They remain vague and just leave you to let your imagination run wild. Do they mean chemicals, waste products from digestion, bacteria? I guess I imagined it as the waste products from digestion but it would be interesting to hear what other people perceive as the 'toxins' in their bodies. I read an interesting article on British Beauty Blogger about how Veet gave Chinese women a problem they never had. Chinese women naturally have very little body hair so hair removal products have always been poor sellers. Therefore, Reckitt Benckiser (who own Veet) devised  a marketing campaign to convince Chinese that any body hair is unsightly and released ads equating hair free skin with health, confidence and \\"shining glory\\" (the full marketing concept can be read here). I feel that this is the same as what is happening in regards to detoxes. The marketers of the products have convinced us that our bodies are full of these so called 'toxins', from our unhealthy lifestyles, that need to be removed with a detox.

The next day, Andrew McWhirter, close friend of Fisher and Strongâand Timmy Callhan's former boyfriendâintroduce Donald and Timmy to the lesbian couple after a contentious school board meeting at which Dorothy, a guidance counselor at the school, is placed on paid leave due to objections from a homophobic parent whose gay son Derek has been counseled by Fisher.

Time appears to have a direction—the past lies behind, fixed and immutable, while the future lies ahead and is not necessarily fixed. Yet for the most part the laws of physics do not specify an arrow of time, and allow any process to proceed both forward and in reverse. This is generally a consequence of time being modeled by a parameter in the system being analyzed, where there is no \\"proper time\\": the direction of the arrow of time is sometimes arbitrary. Examples of this include the Second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy must increase over time (see Entropy); the cosmological arrow of time, which points away from the Big Bang, CPT symmetry, and the radiative arrow of time, caused by light only traveling forwards in time (see light cone). In particle physics, the violation of CP symmetry implies that there should be a small counterbalancing time asymmetry to preserve CPT symmetry as stated above. The standard description of measurement in quantum mechanics is also time asymmetric (see Measurement in quantum mechanics). What laws specify as an arrow of time? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"Some laws that specify an arrow of time include: 1. The Second Law of Thermodynamics: This law states that entropy, or the degree of disorder in a system, tends to increase over time. This provides a natural direction for the arrow of time, as processes tend to move from a state of lower entropy to higher entropy. 2. The Cosmological Arrow of Time: This arrow of time points away from the Big Bang, the event that started our universe. The expansion of the universe from the initial singularity to the present and continuing into the future provides a direction for the arrow of time. 3. The Radiative Arrow of Time: This arrow of time is caused by light only traveling forwards in time, as represented by the concept of the light cone. Electromagnetic waves, such as light, always propagate forward in time, providing a clear indication of the direction of time. 4. Time Asymmetry in Particle Physics: The violation of CP symmetry (the combination of charge conjugation and parity symmetry) in some particle interactions implies that there should be a small counterbalancing time asymmetry to preserve the overall CPT symmetry (the combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal symmetry). While most of these laws and phenomena don't directly specify the arrow of time, they do offer a means to effectively distinguish between the past and the future, providing an implied direction for time's arrow in various situations and contexts."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - Lycaenidae is the second-largest family of butterflies (behind Nymphalidae, brush-footed butterflies), with over 6,000 species worldwide, whose members are also called gossamer-winged butterflies. They constitute about 30% of the known butterfly species.  - Polyommatinae, the blues, are a subfamily of gossamer-winged butterflies (Lycaenidae). It was long used to assign taxa of unclear relationships, and its contents are in need of revision. Several genera might not even belong here.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - Nabokovia is a Neotropical genus of butterflies , named by Arthur Francis Hemming in honour of Vladimir Nabokov , who extensively studied the Polyommatinae subfamily . Species include : Nabokovia faga ( Dognin 1895 )    After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'nabokovia' exhibits the relationship of 'parent taxon'.

Answer: In some micro climates or shaded areas these rather 'basic' tarpaper roofs can last well in relation to the cost of materials purchase and cost of laying them, however the cost of modern membranes such as EPDM has come down over recent years to make them more and more affordable. Question: how long is a flat membrane roof good for? Answer:","output":"A flat membrane roof's longevity depends on various factors such as the type of material used, installation quality, climate, and maintenance. Among the commonly used materials for flat membrane roofs are Thermoplastic Olefin (TPO), Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM), and Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC). These modern membranes have become more affordable in recent years, making them an attractive option for many building owners and contractors. TPO is a popular choice for flat membrane roofs due to its energy efficiency and durability. TPO roofs typically have a lifespan of 22 to 30 years when properly maintained. They are resistant to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, chemicals, and punctures, making them a suitable option for various climates and environments. EPDM roofs, also known as rubber roofs, are known for their flexibility and resistance to various weather conditions. With proper installation and maintenance, EPDM roofs have a lifespan of around 25 to 30 years. They can withstand extreme temperatures, UV radiation, and exposure to chemicals. PVC roofs are another popular choice for flat membrane roofs due to their durability and resistance to chemicals, fire, and punctures. With proper care, a PVC roof can last between 25 to 35 years. This type of roof offers excellent protection against harsh weather conditions, making it an ideal option for regions with heavy rain, snow, or wind. The quality of installation plays a significant role in determining a flat membrane roof's lifespan. Expert installation by qualified professionals ensures that the roof is appropriately sealed and protected against water infiltration and other potential issues that could affect its durability. Regular maintenance, including inspections, cleaning, and timely repairs, is essential in maintaining the roof's condition and maximizing its lifespan. Considering these factors, a flat membrane roof can generally last between 22 to 35 years, with variations depending on the type of material used, installation quality, and maintenance practices. Ultimately, the longevity of a flat membrane roof is influenced by the specific materials and environmental conditions, so it is crucial to choose the right materials and maintain them properly for optimal performance and longevity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: when did michael jordan do the air jordan?","output":"Michael Jordan, often referred to as the greatest basketball player of all time, is synonymous with the term \\"Air Jordan.\\" It references both his iconic athletic prowess and his legendary sneaker line produced by Nike. Jordan first earned the nickname \\"Air Jordan\\" during his initial years in the NBA due to his ability to seemingly defy gravity with his amazing vertical leap and acrobatic dunks. As for the specific time when Michael Jordan truly displayed the \\"Air Jordan\\" persona, it is often regarded as the NBA Slam Dunk Contest that took place on February 6, 1988. Held in Chicago, during the NBA All-Star Weekend, Jordan executed a series of breathtaking dunks that left audiences in awe. During the contest, Jordan faced stiff competition from Dominique Wilkins, another high-flying dunker and a two-time winner of the contest. Both players managed to impress the judges in the first rounds with their powerful and athletic dunks. The climax of the competition came in the final round when Michael Jordan unveiled his now-iconic dunk, which is still considered one of the most famous dunks in basketball history. The dunk, dubbed the \\"Kiss the Rim\\" or \\"Free-Throw Line Dunk,\\" saw Jordan take off from just inside the free-throw line with the ball in his right hand, soaring toward the hoop while switching the ball to his left hand and finally slamming it in. His display of athleticism, hang time, and incredible leaping ability during this contest helped solidify his image as \\"Air Jordan.\\" Jordan won the 1988 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, marking his second consecutive win, having also won the contest in 1987. It's important to note that the Air Jordan brand was launched by Nike in 1984, after signing Michael Jordan to an endorsement deal. The first pair of Air Jordan sneakers, the Air Jordan 1, was released in 1985 and forever changed the sneaker industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"The two sentences express different points of view on a matter, which means that they each convey a different sentiment or tone. Their truthfulness depends on the context in which they are being used. Sentence 1—Well, that's a nice way of putting it—implies that the speaker approves of how a thought, idea, or situation has been described. It suggests that the speaker feels the description is polite, respectful, or even diplomatic. Sentence 2—That is a mean way to phrase it—conveys that the speaker takes issue with how an idea or situation has been expressed. They find the phrasing negative, harsh, or judgmental. Looking at both sentences, one must consider the context in which each statement is made. If they are applied to the same situation, it means that two individuals have differing opinions on the language used to describe a situation or idea. In this case, their truthfulness would not be in direct opposition, but rather display subjective opinions on how to best communicate a certain matter. Instead of focusing on whether one sentence is true and the other false, it is important to consider the range of opinions and emotions involved. People might interpret the phrasing of a statement differently, and the truthfulness of each sentence would depend on the perspective of the person making the judgment. In short, if the first sentence is true according to the speaker's perspective, it doesn't necessarily mean the second sentence must be false. Both sentences can be true from different points of view, or they could both be false, depending on how the description is received and interpreted by the listener.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. – In traditional, opposite-sex relationships, most women still do the vast majority of chores—regardless of how many hours they work or how much money they make. But for same-sex couples, where there isn't the traditional gender-based division of labor to fall back on, the chores are more often shared and divvied up according to personal preference. So finds a survey of 103 same-sex couples and 122 straight couples put out this week by the Families and Work Institute; all were dual-earner couples. Though NBC News reports same-sex couples didn't share an \\"overabundance\\" of chores, they did out-share their straight counterparts in a number of areas: In same-sex couples, 74% share child care, 62% share sick child care, 44% share laundry, and 33% share household repair. The corresponding figures for straight couples are 38%, 32%, 31%, and 15%. So does that increased sharing lead to increased happiness regarding chores? Perhaps surprisingly, not hugely. \\"I probably went in with the bias that sharing is going to be better,\\" acknowledges the diversity strategy leader for study-sponsor PwC. But on a scale where 5 is most satisfied, when it comes to the division of household responsibilities, gay men scored 4.18 and lesbians scored 3.99; straight men scored 4.02 and straight women 3.82. There was a happiness trigger, though: communication. Per the study, \\"When couples discussed what each one wants in terms of labor division, their overall happiness went up markedly, and when they did not, they were much more likely to be dissatisfied with their domestic workload.\\" Study author Ken Matos highlights the finding. \\"That's probably the biggest takeaway of the survey,\\" he tells the Washington Post. \\"How important it is to talk and say what you want. ... The people who said they bit their tongue had a lower satisfaction with division of household responsibilities.\\" (Should women simply let things get dirty?) Expand this summary.","output":"A recent survey by the Families and Work Institute has found that same-sex couples tend to share household chores more equally than their straight counterparts. The survey included 103 same-sex couples and 122 straight couples, all of whom were dual-earner couples. Results showed that in same-sex couples, 74% shared childcare, 62% shared sick childcare, 44% shared laundry duties, and 33% shared household repairs. In comparison, the figures for straight couples were 38%, 32%, 31%, and 15% respectively. However, this increased sharing of chores did not necessarily lead to increased satisfaction regarding household responsibilities. On a satisfaction scale where 5 is the most satisfied, gay men scored 4.18, lesbians 3.99, straight men 4.02, and straight women 3.82. The study found that communication was the key factor in improving satisfaction levels. When couples discussed their preferences for the division of labor, their overall happiness increased significantly. In contrast, those who did not engage in such conversations tended to be more dissatisfied with their domestic workload. According to study author Ken Matos, the main takeaway from the survey is the importance of open communication about individual preferences and needs within couples. Clear communication leads to better satisfaction regarding the division of household responsibilities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Colleague or co-blogger: The individual could be someone who works with Eric on a common project, such as managing a blog or website. They might collaborate by sharing tasks, like writing entries or interacting with readers. This would make sense given that they mention \\"all the blogging while Eric sleeps.\\" 2. Friend or roommate: It's possible that the person is a close friend or lives with Eric, and thus knows his daily routines and habits.

The fact that they know when he gets up, has breakfast, and other specifics imply that they have a close connection. 3. Partner or family member: Another possibility is that the individual is intimately related to Eric, such as a romantic partner or a family member. If they live together and share responsibilities, it's likely that they are aware of each other's daily activities and help each other out when necessary. 4. Caregiver or personal assistant: There is also a chance that the person is a hired caregiver or personal assistant to Eric. This would explain their knowledge of his daily habits and their role in taking care of important tasks, such as blogging, while he rests.

Q: Q: Vertebrates evolved from primitive forms of which creature?   A: A:","output":"Vertebrates are thought to have evolved from a group of animals known as chordates. Chordates are characterized by having at some stage in their lives a notochord, a dorsal nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, endostyle, and a post-anal tail. Vertebrates are a subgroup that evolved within the chordates. To go further and pinpoint the exact type of early chordate from which vertebrates evolved from, it's widely believed that it's a type of creature known as \\"ancestral chordate,\\" which had all the five chordate features mentioned.  Let's look closer at this evolution process. The very first vertebrates are believed to have evolved around 530 million years ago during a period known as the Cambrian explosion. This was a period of rapid evolutionary development when most of the major animal phyla first appeared. These early vertebrates were jawless, armless fish-like creatures, often collectively referred to as ostracoderms. They had a notochord (the precursor to the spinal cord), a basic vertebra-like structure for support, and rudimentary sensory organs. They were considered primitive, lacking many of the advanced features seen in later vertebrates. The evolution of a jaw, which first appeared in fish, was a significant evolutionary step for the vertebrates. The development of the jaw allowed for a wider variety of food sources and was likely a major factor in the successful diversity and survival of this group. Through millions of years, the descendants of these early jawed fish began to evolve a wide variety of characteristics and took on many forms. Some of these became the first amphibians, evolving lungs and legs and, for the first time, ventured onto land. From these amphibians, the reptiles evolved. They developed a new method of laying eggs, allowing them greater independence from water. It was from a lineage of reptiles that both mammals and birds evolved, with mammals appearing around 220 million years ago and birds a bit later, approximately 150 million years ago. Among mammal descendants are humans, evolved around 6 million years ago. In conclusion, vertebrates—encompassing a group whose members include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals—evolved from primitive forms of chordates, specifically an ancestral chordate creature with primitive, fish-like characteristics. And it is through this lineage that we, as human beings, trace our own evolutionary history back hundreds of millions of years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They notice that the old rope swing is frayed in parts and very thin, while a new rope swing nearby is not frayed and much thicker. Which rope swing would be more likely to snap under the force of swinging? (A) old rope swing (B) new rope swing  Choose the answer between \\"new rope swing\\" and \\"old rope swing\\". Answer:","output":"The answer would be the \\"old rope swing\\". Allow me to explain why. As a material ages, it gets subjected to various conditions that can weaken its strength. For instance, a rope swing by a river would probably be exposed to harsh weather elements like sun, rain, snow, and humidity, all of which can cause the rope to degrade over time. This can significantly weaken the rope, thereby reducing its load-bearing capacity. This process of weakening is evident through the visual cue of fraying. When a rope frays, its threads unravel and separate from each other, reducing the overall mass of the rope that contributes to tensile strength. Remember, the tensile strength of a rope (its ability to withstand pulling forces) is greatly determined by the sum of the strength of its individual fibers. When a rope begins to fray, the total number of intact fibers is reduced, thereby reducing its tensile strength. However, a new rope, particularly one that is thicker, is less likely to snap under force. First, its relative newness implies it may not have gone through the same degree of weathering, reducing the probability of internal degradation. Secondly, thickness in rope usually equates to added strength. A thicker rope would have more fibers contributing to its overall strength and would therefore be more capable of withstanding force as compared to a thin rope. So in this case, given the visible signs of wear and tear (fraying and thinness) on the old rope swing, it would more likely be the one to snap under the force of swinging compared to the new, thicker rope swing. This is based on the logical understanding of how material strength degrades over time and under environmental stressors. So, once again, between the old rope and the new rope swing, the more likely to snap under force would be the \\"old rope swing\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Available options:  - yes;  - it is not possible to tell;  - no;","output":"Based on the information given in the premise, we can analyze the details and determine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: \\"Three women and one man is jumping into off a pile a sand with their over their heads.\\" This statement describes a scenario where there are a total of four individuals, out of which three are women, and one is a man. They are engaging in an activity where they are jumping off a pile of sand, and their hands are over their heads. Hypothesis: \\"There are both men and women in the photo.\\" The hypothesis focuses on establishing the presence of both men and women in a particular photo, presumably related to the premise. Now, let's look at the multi-select problem. Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true? To answer this, let's analyze the relationship between the premise and hypothesis. Since the premise states that there are three women and one man, we can assert that both men and women are present in the scenario. If we assume that the photo captures the scene described in the premise, it is reasonable to conclude that there would be both men and women present in the photo. Therefore, based on the information provided and assuming the photo captures the described event: Available options: - yes: This option affirms that if the premise is true and the photo represents that event, we can conclude that both men and women are in the photo, making the hypothesis true as well. - it is not possible to tell: This option is not accurate because the information given in the premise allows us to determine the presence of both men and women in the scenario, and if the photo captures the event, it would also contain both men and women. - no: This option is also not accurate because, as discussed earlier, the premise's information does support the hypothesis if we assume the photo represents the event.

My review in one word - disappointing. How about two words? Very disappointing. We were so excited to try this place after strong yelp reviews and friends' recommendations so we saved our first visit for my birthday. 6:15 Saturday night reservations started off great. Seated right away, asked if we had theater plans so they could make sure they tended us in a timely manner. Seemed like a great beginning. That was when it went downhill.   The two of us were seated along the wall where the \\" tables\\" for two are located. These tables are woefully small and completely inadequate for any dinner setting. And they are so close together!! They are essentially thigh width apart!! There should be a minimum state requirement of butt width for goodness sake! Even the skinny busboys couldn't wedge themselves in there. When your chair is wider than the table, you know it's bad. Makes for a very disruptive dining experience when your neighbor leaves. Plus, I think the fire marshall should have a look at this. Can't be safe. When I say close together, I mean the plates of the diners on either side of me were just as close to me as my wife's across the table! Everything was in arms reach. I wanted a table for two, not a party of six. I am not that interested in your life, trust me.   Beer served in cans is not my style but I did one anyway. Arrived warm. Wanted to try the smoked wings we'd heard about so we started with those and the curry mussels. Both came out together and we literally had to stack them on top of each other on the table since it was so tiny. Ridiculous. The wings were the best thing all night - good, not great. I'm a huge mussels fan and was excited when they arrived looking fresh and delish. They were large but not delish. There was NO flavor. Bland with a capital B. No curry flavor at all - I think the steaming liquid would have tasted better.  Did the spice cabinet turn out to be empty? Nice quantity though. Just not what I would have expected. Frankly I could have stopped eating here - and wish I had.   We had placed our entire order at one time. I ordered the brisket sandwich and my wife the short rib flatbread. Between appetizers and entree was at least 50 minutes. At one point I was finally able to grab our server ( where DOES she does disappear to?) and told her, if it's not out now, just cancel the order. She had stopped by 25 minutes prior and said they'd be out in one minute. Wrong.  Amazingly, mine came out but she dropped the flat bread in the kitchen.  Service disaster. Let's just say 2 1/2 hours is way too long for what we had. One hour waits between courses? Absurd. Service was among the worst I've ever experienced. And the brisket? After 3 bites I put my utensils down. Not good at all. Another flavorless serving. Flatbread? Awful. Short rib my eye. If there was more than an ounce of short rib on there I'll buy your next meal.   I feel bad giving it two stars but that was what my experience calls for. Oh, and the very limited draft beer menu? No Oktoberfest at all. Instead, a summer session ale? I mean, come on guys - this is October! There's no excuse for that. And at 7 and 10 each for our drafts, this is not a place I'd even want to drink.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person that is replaced by a monster?  A \\"skybike\\", a one-man, open-cockpit flying machine, attacks Dogen. Dogen shoots it down and finds one of Syn's crystals on the pilot's body. Carved into the crystal is a symbol of a dead tree. Dogen finds a murdered prospector, whose young daughter Dhyana saw him killed by Baal, Jared Syn's half-cyborg son. Baal sprayed the man with a green liquid that caused a nightmare dream-state, in which Syn appeared and executed him with a crystal. Dogen convinces Dhyana to help him find Syn. Dhyana takes Dogen to Zax, who identifies the crystal as a lifeforce storage device. Dhyana tells them about the ancient Cyclopians who once used such devices and says the only power against it is a magic mask located in their lost city. Zax affirms this and directs Dogen to find a prospector named Rhodes in the nearby mining town of Zhor. Dogen and Dhyana are blocked by vehicles driven by nomads commanded by Baal, who sprays Dogen with the green liquid, paralyzing him. Dhyana drives them off and cares for Dogen, who in the dream world finds Syn and Baal looming over him. Syn fails to pull Dogen away from Dhyana: their will is too strong. Dogen awakes, but Dhyana is suddenly teleported away. A summoned monster appears in her place and fires electric bolts at him. Dhyana simultaneously faces Syn in his lair. Dogen shorts-out the creature, and it vanishes. Dogen arrives in Zhor and finds Rhodes, a washed-up soldier, in a bar. Rhodes denies the lost city's existence and refuses to get involved. Dogen leaves and comes upon a group of miners beating a captured nomad soldier. Dogen assists him, and the miners turn hostile. Dogen is out-gunned until Rhodes helps him defeat the miners.

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation 24 = 9*o - 3*o for o, follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation on the right-hand side. The equation is simplified by combining the like terms. Both terms in the equation relate to 'o', so they can be combined. 9*o - 3*o equals 6*o. So now, the equation becomes 24 = 6*o . Step 2: Solve for the variable 'o'. In order to isolate 'o' and solve for it, divide both sides of the equation by 6 (that's the coefficient of 'o'). This gives you: 24/6 = 6*o/6.

Station in Kansas City to put song on heavy rotation on first night of series. Giants and Royals face off in Game 1 of World Series Tuesday night.","output":"Title: San Francisco Radio Stations Ban No. 1 Hit \\"Royals\\" Prior to World Series, While Kansas City Embraces the Tune As the highly anticipated World Series kicks off, the rivalry between the San Francisco Giants and Kansas City Royals is not just limited to the field. In an amusing display of team spirit and competition, San Francisco radio stations have collectively decided to ban Lorde's chart-topping hit \\"Royals\\" from Bay Area airwaves for the duration of the series, while a station in Kansas City plans to put the song on heavy rotation during the first night of the showdown. The Giants and Royals are set to face off in Game 1 of the World Series this Tuesday night, and listeners in San Francisco will notice a significant absence in the radio playlist. Bay Area stations have come together in agreement to remove the Grammy-winning song by New Zealand artist Lorde from their schedules as a way to show unwavering support for their home team. The interesting fact behind the 2013 hit song is that Lorde was actually inspired by a photograph she saw of Kansas City Royals' then-retired baseball player George Brett in a magazine, signing autographs for fans. The image, which was accompanied by the word \\"Royals\\", became the central theme of the song that went on to become a No. 1 hit in multiple countries. Given the connection to the Kansas City team, it's not surprising that San Francisco stations have chosen to distance themselves from the track for the time being. On the other side of the competition, Kansas City is embracing the tune wholeheartedly. A local radio station in Missouri's largest city announced that they would be putting \\"Royals\\" on heavy rotation throughout the first night of the World Series. This move is seen as a clever counter-response to the Bay Area's elimination of the song, and as a way of celebrating one of Kansas City's many claims to fame. This humorous tit-for-tat between the radio stations adds an extra layer of rivalry to the already intense World Series atmosphere. Fans on both sides of the matchup are sure to appreciate the lengths their respective cities are going to demonstrate team loyalty and dedication. As the World Series progresses, all eyes will be on the Giants and Royals, with their respective cities – and radio stations – standing firmly behind them. While it's unclear whether the temporary ban of \\"Royals\\" will have any noticeable psychological impact on the participating teams, it's a lighthearted and entertaining manifestation of the competitive spirit that makes baseball, and sports in general, such a thrilling experience for fans and players alike. In summary, the World Series between the San Francisco Giants and Kansas City Royals brings not just fierce competition on the baseball field, but also an amusing battle between radio stations and fanbases. San Francisco's decision to ban Lorde's \\"Royals\\" from their airwaves shows a commitment to the home team, while Kansas City's equal and opposite reaction of putting the song on heavy rotation highlights the pride and joy of their city and baseball legacy. As the games unfold, this soundtrack switch-up leaves fans everywhere excited to see how their cities will continue to support their teams in creative and engaging ways."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They threaten to detonate it, thereby contaminating 50% of the world's oil reserve, unless Israel withdraws its settlements from the West Bank. The fact that the KGB is behind this threat is unknown, as the culprits are believed by the Israelis and Americans to be Islamic fundamentalist extremists. The American president contemplates starting a war with Israel, in order to save the world from oil crisis. The director of the CIA offers the president an alternative solution. A CIA agent codenamed The Soldier (Ken Wahl), working outside the usual channels, is assigned to the case.

What is the answer: Which was the first Soviet Union republic to establish its independence when the Soviet Union was dissolving?","output":"The first Soviet Union republic to establish its independence when the Soviet Union was dissolving was Lithuania. This historic event was a result of a long struggle for freedom and growing nationalistic sentiments within the Lithuanian population during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Lithuania's journey towards independence started with the inception of the reform movement called \\"Sąjūdis\\" (Lithuanian Reform Movement) in June 1988. This movement was initiated by a group of intellectuals, artists, and politicians who aimed to bring democratic reforms and autonomy to Lithuania. Sąjūdis gained significant support from the Lithuanian population and managed to elect many of its sympathetic representatives to the Congress of People's Deputies in the Soviet Union, which was a result of several popular demonstrations and actions in support of their cause. During the Soviet Union's weakening economic and political situation in the late 1980s, the Lithuanian independence movement gained momentum. Under the pressure of various regional movements and widespread protests, the Soviet Union adopted a policy of decentralization and allowed more autonomy for its republics. On March 11, 1990, Lithuania's Supreme Soviet, which was the highest state organ in the Lithuanian SSR, adopted the \\"Act of the Re-establishment of the State of Lithuania.\\" In this declaration, Lithuania claimed its independence from the Soviet Union and decided to restore the independent Lithuanian state that had existed between the First and Second World War, before being occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940. The immediate international reaction was cautious, and it took some time for other countries to recognize Lithuania's independence. The Soviet Union, led by President Mikhail Gorbachev, opposed the declaration and tried to prevent Lithuania's independence by applying political pressure and economic sanctions. This Soviet response resulted in several confrontations between Soviet military forces and the Lithuanian independence movement. The critical event that furthered Lithuania's recognition as an independent state occurred in January 1991. Soviet authorities ordered a military intervention in Lithuania to suppress the growing independence movement. However, this action generated strong resistance from the Lithuanian population and prompted widespread international condemnation. As a result, the Soviet Union's authority and reputation were further undermined. By the summer of 1991, the situation in the Soviet Union had significantly deteriorated. In August, an unsuccessful coup attempt in Moscow marked the beginning of the end for the Soviet Union. Following this event, the Soviet Union started recognizing the independence of its former republics. Lithuania's steadfastness paved the way for other Soviet republics to demand independence, and soon, many of them declared their sovereignty. Eventually, on December 26, 1991, the Soviet Union was officially dissolved, marking the end of an era and giving birth to several new independent states, including Lithuania, which had bravely led the way in the quest for freedom and self-determination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies.  - Flaviviridae is a family of viruses. Humans and other mammals serve as natural hosts. They are primarily spread through arthropod vectors (mainly ticks and mosquitoes). The family gets its name from the Yellow Fever virus, the type virus of \\"Flaviviridae\\"; \\"flavus\\" means yellow in Latin, and Yellow fever in turn was named because of its propensity to cause jaundice in victims. There are currently over 100 species in this family, divided among four genera. Diseases associated with this family include: hepaciviruses, hepatitis, pestiviruses, hemorrhagic syndromes, fatal mucosal disease, flavivirus, hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, and the birth defect microcephaly.  - Pestivirus is a genus of viruses, in the family Flaviviridae. Viruses in the genus \\"Pestivirus\\" infect mammals, including members of the family Bovidae (which includes, but is not limited to, cattle, sheep, and goats) and the family Suidae (which includes various species of swine). There are currently four species in this genus including the type species Bovine viral diarrhea virus 1. Diseases associated with this genus include: hemorrhagic syndromes, abortion, fatal mucosal disease.  - Suidae is a family of artiodactyl mammals commonly called pigs, hogs, or boars. In addition to numerous fossil species, up to sixteen extant species are currently recognized, classified into between four and eight genera. The family includes the domestic pig, \\"Sus scrofa domesticus\\" or \\"Sus domesticus\\", in addition to numerous species of wild pig, such as the babirusa \\"Babyrousa babyrussa\\" and the warthog \\"Phacochoerus aethiopicus\\". All suids, or swine, are native to the Old World, ranging from Asia to Europe and Africa.  - Yellow fever is an acute viral disease. In most cases, symptoms include fever, chills, loss of appetite, nausea, muscle pains particularly in the back, and headaches. Symptoms typically improve within five days. In some people within a day of improving, the fever comes back, abdominal pain occurs, and liver damage begins causing yellow skin. If this occurs, the risk of bleeding and kidney problems is also increased. The disease is caused by the yellow fever virus and is spread by the bite of an infected female mosquito. It infects only humans, other primates, and several species of mosquitoes. In cities, it is spread primarily by mosquitoes of the \\"Aedes aegypti\\" type. The virus is an RNA virus of the genus \\"Flavivirus\\". The disease may be difficult to tell apart from other illnesses, especially in the early stages. To confirm a suspected case, blood sample testing with polymerase chain reaction is required. A safe and effective vaccine against yellow fever exists and some countries require vaccinations for travelers. Other efforts to prevent infection include reducing the population of the transmitting mosquito. In areas where yellow fever is common and vaccination is uncommon, early diagnosis of cases and immunization of large parts of the population is important to prevent outbreaks. Once infected, management is symptomatic with no specific measures effective against the virus. The second and more severe phase results in death in up to half of people without treatment. Yellow fever causes 200,000 infections and 30,000 deaths every year, with nearly 90% of these occurring in Africa. Nearly a billion people live in an area of the world where the disease is common. It is common in tropical areas of South America and Africa, but not in Asia. Since the 1980s, the number of cases of yellow fever has been increasing. This is believed to be due to fewer people being immune, more people living in cities, people moving frequently, and changing climate. The disease originated in Africa, from where it spread to South...  - The Bovidae are the biological family of cloven-hoofed, ruminant mammals that includes bison, African buffalo, water buffalo, antelopes, gazelles, sheep, goats, muskoxen, and domestic cattle. A member of this family is called a bovid. Consisting of 143 extant species and 300 known extinct species, the family Bovidae consists of eight major subfamilies apart from the disputed Peleinae and Pantholopinae. The family evolved 20 million years ago, in the early Miocene.  - Bovine Viral Diarrhea ( BVD ) or Bovine Viral Diarrhoea ( UK English ) , and previously referred to as Bovine Virus Diarrhoea ( BVD ) , is a significant economic disease of cattle which is endemic in the majority of countries throughout the world . The causative agent , bovine viral diarrhea virus ( BVDV ) is a member of the Pestivirus genus of the family Flaviviridae . BVD infection results in a wide variety of clinical signs , due to its immunosuppressive effects , as well as having a direct effect on respiratory disease and fertility . In addition , BVD infection of a susceptible dam during a certain period of gestation can result in the production of a persistently infected ( PI ) fetus . PI animals recognise intra-cellular BVD viral particles as \`\` self '' and shed virus in large quantities throughout life ; they represent the cornerstone of the success of BVD as a disease .

It was improvised by civilians who had never handled a hijacked aircraft that attempted to disappear, and by a military unprepared for the transformation of commercial aircraft into weapons of mass destruction. As it turned out, the NEADS air defenders had nine minutes' notice on the first hijacked plane, no advance notice on the second, no advance notice on the third, and no advance notice on the fourth. We do not believe that the true picture of that morning reflects discredit on the operational personnel at NEADS or FAA facilities. NEADS commanders and officers actively sought out information, and made the best judgments they could on the basis of what they knew. Individual FAA controllers, facility managers, and Command Center managers thought outside the box in recommending a nationwide alert, in ground-stopping local traffic, and, ultimately, in deciding to land all aircraft and executing that unprecedented order flawlessly. More than the actual events, inaccurate government accounts of those events made it appear that the military was notified in time to respond to two of the hijackings, raising questions about the adequacy of the response. Those accounts had the effect of deflecting questions about the military's capacity to obtain timely and accurate information from its own sources. In addition, they overstated the FAA's ability to provide the military with timely and useful information that morning. In public testimony before this Commission in May 2003, NORAD officials stated that at 9:16, NEADS received hijack notification of United 93 from the FAA. This statement was incorrect. There was no hijack to report at 9:16. United 93 was proceeding normally at that time. In this same public testimony, NORAD officials stated that at 9:24, NEADS received notification of the hijacking of American 77. This statement was also incorrect. The notice NEADS received at 9:24 was that American 11 had not hit the World Trade Center and was heading for Washington, D.C. In their testimony and in other public accounts, NORAD officials also stated that the Langley fighters were scrambled to respond to the notifications about American 77,178 United 93, or both. These statements were incorrect as well. The fighters were scrambled because of the report that American 11 was heading south, as is clear not just from taped conversations at NEADS but also from taped conversations at FAA centers; contemporaneous logs compiled at NEADS, Continental Region headquarters, and NORAD; and other records.  Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"FAA communication\\" correctly answer the question \\"What was overstated in regards to the perceived inadequacy in military response to 9/11\\"?   *no.  *yes.","output":"Yes, based on the paragraph, the response \\"FAA communication\\" correctly answers the question, \\"What was overstated in regards to the perceived inadequacy in military response to 9/11?\\" The paragraph describes that inaccurate accounts made by government officials led to the assumption that the military was notified timely on two of the hijackings, which then resulted in questions about the adequacy of their response. These accounts, in reality, overstated the FAA's capacity to provide timely and accurate information to the military on that morning. It is evident from this information that the perceived inadequacy in military response was largely due to incorrect information and overstated capabilities of FAA communication with the military."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Yes A detailed explanation for the choice would be: Upon reviewing the provided statement, \\"A black and white bird standing on a hand,\\" several context clues help us arrive at the conclusion that yes, a bird is stationary. First, let's break down the initial statement: - \\"A black and white bird\\": This portion of the statement describes the bird's physical appearance but does not offer any information about its movement or lack thereof. - \\"standing on a hand\\": This part of the statement is crucial in determining the bird's status, specifically its movement. \\"Standing\\" is a verb that implies stillness and stability, indicating the bird is not currently in motion. Based on the statement alone, we can logically infer that the bird being \\"stationary\\" is true. However, it is essential to acknowledge that this conclusion is based solely on the given information, and circumstances surrounding the situation may change our analysis. While the bird is standing on a hand at that moment, it could potentially fly off or move in the near future.

Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A cocky American athlete named Lee Sheridan (Robert Taylor) receives a scholarship to attend Cardinal College, Oxford University in 1937. At first, Lee is reluctant to go to the college owing to his father Dan's (Lionel Barrymore) limited income, but he finally does attend. Once in England, Lee brags about his athletic triumphs to Paul Beaumont (Griffith Jones), Wavertree (Robert Coote), and Ramsey (Peter Croft) on the train to Oxford. Annoyed, they trick Lee into getting off the train at the wrong stop. Lee, however, does make his way to Oxford where the students attempt to trick him again, this time into thinking that he is getting a grand reception. Seeing through the deception, he follows the prankster impersonating the Dean and after chasing him is thrown off and ends up kicking the real Dean of Cardinal (Edmund Gwenn) before retreating. This begins a contentious relationship between them when Lee reports to apologize. Lee considers leaving Oxford but stays on after being convinced by Scatters (Edward Rigby), his personal servant. Lee meets Elsa Craddock (Vivien Leigh), a married woman who \\"helps\\" the new campus students, and starts a relationship with Paul Beaumont's sister Molly (Maureen O'Sullivan). Lee makes the track team by outpacing other runners while wearing a cap and gown. Just when he begins to fit in, he is hazed for refusing to rest during a crucial relay race at a track meet and pushing his replacement Paul out of the way in his zeal to win. In a fit of anger, Lee goes to a pub, which students are forbidden to frequent, to confront Paul, finding him in a private booth with Elsa. He starts a fight with Paul but Wavertree warns them of the Bullers coming. Lee and Paul run and when they are almost caught by one of the Bullers, Lee punches him. Paul is called before the Dean, fined and warned for hitting the Buller. He is scorned for saying it was Lee who punched him and Lee is soon the favorite of Paul's old friends. Molly begins to see him again, but Lee still feels poor for what has happened... A:","output":"Title Suggestion: \\"Trials and Triumphs: An Oxford Journey\\" This movie title encapsulates the struggles and successes that Lee Sheridan encounters as a brash American athlete adjusting to the academics, social life, and culture of Oxford University in 1937. The title highlights the various trials Lee faces, from deception by his fellow students to his own missteps and relationship issues. The word \\"trials\\" emphasizes the challenges he experiences as he learns humility and develops deep connections with his new friends. At the same time, the word \\"triumphs\\" in the title points to Lee's achievements—both academic and personal—throughout his time at Oxford. By overcoming obstacles, Lee eventually becomes a respected and well-liked member of his college community. The title also hints at the overall theme of the movie, which is the transformative power of perseverance and personal growth during a college experience. Finally, \\"An Oxford Journey\\" in the movie title not only sets the geographical stage of the storyline but also serves as a metaphor for the character's emotional and psychological journey, reflecting the fundamental life lessons and maturity that are often gained through adversity. It invites viewers to join Lee on his inspiring journey of self-discovery amidst the storied halls of Oxford University."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Second question: Why do some people currently believe the earth is flat? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First question: Why do some people think that the Earth is flat when it is clear that it is not? The belief in a flat Earth can be attributed to various factors, despite overwhelming scientific evidence pointing to the contrary. Here are some reasons why certain individuals continue to maintain this belief: 1. Misinterpretation of scientific data: Some flat-Earthers misinterpret or misunderstand scientific data and observations to fit their worldview. This could stem from a lack of scientific education or a deliberate attempt to discredit mainstream scientific consensus. 2. Distrust of authorities and institutions: Some people may doubt the Earth's true shape because of a deep mistrust of governmental and scientific institutions. This skepticism can lead them to disregard widely-accepted facts and instead cling to alternative theories like the flat Earth notion. 3. Confirmation bias: People tend to have a strong desire to confirm their existing beliefs, leading them to seek out and interpret new information in a way that aligns with their preconceptions. This psychological phenomenon can cloud people's judgment and allow them to readily accept questionable evidence that supports their views. 4. Sensation and attention-seeking: Individuals may adopt the flat Earth belief as a means of provoking reactions from others and attracting attention. This motivation can stem either from the desire to feel unique and special or the thrill of engaging in controversial debates. 5. Internet and social media echo chambers: The internet fosters a self-reinforcing environment in which people can easily find like-minded individuals and content that reaffirms their beliefs. Social media algorithms also contribute to this effect, as they often suggest content similar to what a user has previously viewed or engaged with, leading to further polarization of opinions. 6. Desire for simplicity: Believing in a simplified model of reality, like a flat Earth, can appeal to those who want to ignore the complexities and uncertainties of the scientific world. For some, this simplified worldview may be comforting. Second question: Why do some people currently believe the earth is flat? There is significant overlap in the factors that contribute to the current trend of flat Earth beliefs. Some of the main reasons include: 1. Influence of the internet: The internet has allowed once-fringe beliefs, like the flat Earth theory, to reach wider audiences. Online platforms provide a means for spreading this information, and the anonymity of the internet enables people to express and share controversial ideas without much accountability. 2. Conspiracy theories and distrust: The proliferation of conspiracy theories has led to an environment where distrust of authority is increasingly common. As a result, the flat Earth belief, which is often associated with broader conspiracy theories, has gained traction as well. 3. Social and community aspects: People who believe in a flat Earth often find comfort and validation in connecting with like-minded individuals through online forums and social media groups. The strong sense of community that develops may encourage individuals to further embrace this belief. 4. Psychological factors: Certain psychological tendencies, such as confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance, may play a role in driving the belief in a flat Earth. These mental processes can cause people to interpret evidence in a way that confirms their existing beliefs and reject information that conflicts with their views. In conclusion, while these two questions appear to ask the same thing, they differ in that the first question focuses on the reasons people have historically believed in the flat Earth theory, while the second question highlights the factors that contribute to its continued prevalence in modern times. Though there is significant overlap between the reasons, the primary distinction is that the second question emphasizes the role of the internet and current sociopolitical climate, which has contributed to the resurgence of flat Earth beliefs."},{"instruction":"The Jones family and the Bell family both entered a medical study for diabetes.The members of Jones family had mostly type 1 diabetes, while Bell family members had type 2 diabetes because they ate junk-food.

Managers shouldn’t learn to speak tech, but they should drop the biz-buzzwords. A manager can say “We need to proactively impact our time-to-market” or simply use plain English and stick to “We gotta be on time with this project”. The latter makes total sense to everyone involved. When managers don’t know much about a technical question, they should simply admit it. Geeks respect them for that, but not for pretending to know. And they will catch it––geeks are smart––that's why you employed them after all! Even if you do know, don't lord this knowledge over everyone. Most geeks will be thinking the answer as quickly as you, there's no need to discuss the minutiae. The best thing you can do is to make it known that you are always available to answer questions or to clarify whatever you've just said. They'll take it from there and respect you all the more for it.","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of clear and honest communication between managers and their technical teams. It highlights how using management jargon or buzzwords can alienate experts in technology-related fields, who may view such language as superficial or insincere. Rather than trying to learn technical terms or pretending to know the ins and outs of a specific field, the article suggests that managers should focus on using plain English to convey their ideas and requirements. When managers are faced with technical questions that they may not have the expertise to answer, the article recommends admitting this lack of knowledge instead of attempting to bluff their way through. Tech experts value honesty and transparency, and will respect a manager who is open about their limitations. Pretending to know more than one does is likely to backfire, as technical professionals are often quick to detect any inconsistencies or inaccuracies in someone's claims. Instead of trying to prove themselves as knowledgeable in their team's field of expertise, managers should make it clear that they are always available for clarification or to provide support when needed. This approach fosters a positive working relationship built on trust and mutual respect, ultimately contributing to a more productive and harmonious work environment. In summary, managers should avoid management-speak and focus on honest and clear communication with their technical staff to build a strong and respectful working relationship."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: A Korean wave is sweeping across China, with many Chinese women worshiping South Korean actors Kin Soo-hyun and Lee Min-ho as demigods . Chinese netizens always have different opinions. Over South Korean TV dramas, but there is no doubt that programs from the neighboring country are now enjoying a new round of popularity in China, And a big part of the credit for that goes to You Who Came From The Star, the South Korean TV series which is on the air now. You Who Came From The Star and The Heirs   have been subjects of hot online discussions throughout Asia. Besides, the book, The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane, read by the hero You Who Came From The Star was a hard-to-get item on Amazon for a while. The two TV programs have several common elements  :a tall, handsome, and rich hero who loves the heroine blindly and always protects her, and an equally handsome man madly in love with the same woman. Both programs describe the purity of love, which is expressed through a kiss or a warm hug. Perhaps that's the secret of their success; perhaps people still like Cinderella-type stories. The widening wealth gap is a matter of social concern both in South Korea and China, and the challenges that young people face in their hope for a better life might have caused many ordinary girls to dream of marrying rich, caring men. This is precisely what the popular South Korean TV drams describe. _  Many netizens even said at an earlier time that South Korean TV dramas had become popular because of their stereotyped   themes: traffic accidents, cancer and other incurable diseases. But all that has changed with the success of You Who Came From The Star and The Heirs, which Chinese directors can use as examples, as well as inspiration, to improve their productions.

Even in his own homeland the general public was slow to recognise Smetana. As a young composer and pianist he was well regarded in Prague musical circles, and had the approval of Liszt, Proksch and others, but the public's lack of acknowledgement was a principal factor behind his self-imposed exile in Sweden. After his return he was not taken particularly seriously, and was hard put to get audiences for his new works, hence his \\"prophet without honour\\" remark after the nearly empty hall and indifferent reception of Richard III and Wallenstein's Camp at Žofín Island in January 1862.Smetana's first noteworthy public success was his initial opera The Brandenburgers in Bohemia, in 1866 when he was already 42 years old. His second opera, The Bartered Bride, survived the unfortunate mistiming of its opening night and became an enduring popular triumph. The different style of his third opera, Dalibor, closer to that of Wagnerian music drama, was not readily understood by the public and was condemned by critics who believed that Czech opera should be based on folk-song. It disappeared from the repertory after only a handful of performances. Thereafter the machinations that accompanied Smetana's tenure as Provisional Theatre conductor restricted his creative output until 1874. In his final decade, the most fruitful of his compositional career despite his deafness and increasing ill-health, Smetana belatedly received national recognition. Of his later operas, The Two Widows and The Secret were warmly received, while The Kiss was greeted by an \\"overwhelming ovation\\". The ceremonial opera Libuše was received with thunderous applause for the composer; by this time (1881) the disputes around his music had declined, and the public was ready to honour him as the founder of Czech music. Nevertheless, the first few performances in October 1882 of an evidently under-rehearsed The Devil's Wall were chaotic, and the composer was left feeling \\"dishonoured and dispirited.\\" This disappointment was swiftly mitigated by the acclaim...

We have the equation: -4*w + 346 = -169*w - 47*w + 39*w First, let's combine all the w terms on the right side of the equation. We have -169w, -47w, and 39w.

We can add 177w to both sides to move the w terms to the left side: -4w + 177w + 346 = -177w + 177w When we add up the w terms on the left, it looks like this: 173w + 346 = 0 Now, we will move the constant term (346) to the right side of the equation by subtracting 346 from both sides: 173w = -346 Finally, we have to find the value of w itself.

But Charlie has had a stop-start season and I don't think he needs as much of a rest.\\" Hearts will also face a Europa League qualifier at the end of June, but Strachan said Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson was keen for right-back Paterson, 21, to gain more international experience. \\"He has also had a six-week break as well with his injury, so that's the reason Callum is in there,\\" Strachan explained. \\"He is a goal threat, he can get forward and cross, he has a good physique about him, and he will get better and better because he is still a young fella.\\" Norwich striker Steven Naismith returns to the squad after pulling out of the friendly against the Czech Republic in late March, a 1-0 win Scotland repeated against Denmark five days later.

However, the teacher that I remember most was Mrs. Green from Marianna, Florida. She was my 5thgrade teacher. Since I was a new student, not only in her class, but at the school, she made my time there much more pleasant. I immediately began to like her. She was really funny and I knew that she liked me. She made learning fun. I remember one day for Christmas holidays, she taught us how to make ornaments  from eggs. My parents still have some of the ornaments I made. She made me leader for many group projects and that made me feel special. I think that would make any child feel special, especially when a child is in a new place with no friends. She made me want to be like that. Not to pick a \\"favorite\\" student, but to make every student feel that they are special. That year, I received the Presidential Academic Award  .

Wipe the length of the counter with a wet cloth. Microfiber cloths are best for this if you have them, they’ll give the counter a better scrub without needing to use a household cleaner.  If you need to clean your counter more thoroughly, you can use commercial cleaners specifically designed for marble. For marble floors, passing a dust mop on the surface regularly should be enough for regular cleaning. However, if the floor is dirty and requires some extra cleaning, add a couple of drops of dish soap to a bucket of water and use a microfiber head mop to clean the floor with this solution. Dry the floor thoroughly after cleaning it. This kind of cleaning should be done daily to clear crumbs or any dust that may have accumulated on the counter, it won’t clean serious stains. Don’t let the marble just air dry, since marble is easily marked by water spots. Use a microfiber cloth to wipe countertops until they’re dry. Mix three tablespoons (44ml) of baking soda with one quart (946ml) of water. Use a shammy to spread this mixture over your marble surface. Let the mixture sit on your marble for a few hours before wiping it away with a wet cloth.

After persistence, Macreedy rents a room, only to be harassed by a cowboy named Hector for no apparent reason.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  Songwriter Terry Trindale is attracted to Consuelo Croyden, a woman he sees nightly at a Palm Beach casino. He finally works up the courage to approach her and express his feelings, but she rebuffs his advances. When he later accrues a 3,200 gambling debt to her, Consuelo agrees to hire him as her secretary to work off what he owes her. One of Terry's duties is to assume the role of her fiancé in order to discourage the insistent attention of Tony Barling, to whom Consuelo once was engaged, and to keep her from succumbing to her former beau's charms. Tony refuses to believe she loves someone else, and, when he recognizes Terry from the casino, his suspicions are aroused, despite Terry's outward displays of affection for Consuelo. Tony convinces her to join him on a friend's yacht, but Terry reminds her of his responsibility, and keeps her from going. Four weeks later, Consuelo finds herself still saddled with Terry, who has refused to accompany his songwriting partner Chappie Champagne to New York City to promote their latest tune. Consuelo insists she no longer has any interest in Tony, and offers to cancel the rest of Terry's debt so he can join Chappie. Terry departs, and moments later, Consuelo receives a call from Tony and invites him to the house. Instead, it is Terry, who had disguised his voice, who arrives, and he berates Consuelo for her lack of self-control. Complications arise when Tony actually does arrive on the scene and finds Terry, wearing Consuelo's satin pajamas, in bed. When Terry refuses to admit the truth, an angered Tony departs for his hotel, Consuelo follows, and Terry is not far behind.

An Idaho man man used a shotgun to kill his longtime girlfriend and one of her five children before using the same weapon to kill himself, a preliminary investigation shows. Twin Falls County Prosecutor Grant Loebs says autopsy reports have not been finalized from the Nov. 15 deaths but the early investigation has found only the single weapon. Police say 36-year-old George Salinas likely killed 38-year-old LeAnn Schuldies and her 17-year-old daughter, Brianna Cox, before ending his life. Their bodies were found in a Twin Falls County home. Four other children, ages 6, 7, 9 and 13 survived. They're believed to be Salinas' children with Schuldies. Victims: LeAnn Schuldies (left) died alongside her 17-year-old Brianna Cox in Idaho. Police believe they were shot by Schuldies' longtime boyfriend George Salinas, who then killed himself. Schuldies was a well-liked bartender in Twin Falls. She had an order of protection against Salinas and was trying to end her relationship with him when she and her daughter were killed. Schuldies' four surviving children are staying with family. Salinas was not Cox's father. County court records show that on Nov. 5, Schuldies obtained a two-week 'no-contact' order against Salinas for herself and her children. On Nov. 12, she got a second order against him that extended past a court hearing planned for Friday. 'She was trying to get out of that relationship and move on with her life with her kids,' said her co-worker and friend Hannah Zamora, a manager at restaurant and bar Elevation 486. Schuldies leaves behind four surviving children ages 6, 7, 9 and 13. Police say George Salinas shot Schuldies and one of her five children before killing himself. 'Obviously, it was just paper to him. It wasn't anything that stopped him. It didn't seem like she had the help that she needed.' Zamora said she knew Schuldies for six years and, six months ago, helped her land a job at Elevation 486, where she worked as a bartender and where at least one other company tried to hire her away. 'Everybody loved her,' Zamora said. 'She was very warmhearted. She never showed what was going on in her life. She was always happy and smiling, always thinking of others.' But Zamora said Schuldies did share some of her problems — including her plans to end her relationship with Salinas — with a select few. 'She was tired of everything,' Zamora said. 'So she stood up for herself and her kids.' Elevation 486 closed for the day Saturday after workers learned of Schuldies' death. Employees since have created a link on the restaurant's Facebook page for those wishing to make a donation for Schuldies' surviving children. The restaurant overlooks the Snake River Canyon, a view Schuldies enjoyed, even during a snowstorm. 'On Friday I remember her saying, \\"Hannah, turn around and look at the snowflakes,\\"' Zamora said. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"1.

Step 1: Simplify the equation Combine all the terms with p in them: (189 + 119 + 73 - 108)p = 0 This simplifies to: 273*p = 0 Step 2: Solve for p Now, we'll solve the equation 273*p = 0 for p. Since there's only one term on the left and 0 on the right, we can quickly see that in order for the equation to be true, p has to be equal to 0. If p were a nonzero value, then 273*p would be a nonzero value as well, which won't equal 0. The only way for the left side of the equation to equal 0 is if p itself is 0.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. By. Daily Mail Reporter. BT Sport has sent shockwaves through the football world by outbidding Sky and ITV to secure exclusive rights to broadcast top European matches. The telecommunications giant has agreed a stunning £299million a season, three-year deal to show all 350 Champions League and Europa League games from 2015/16. It represents a staggering coup for the fledgling channel - which only launched in August this year - to have beaten off Sky, which has dominated the live football landscape in Britain for more two decades, while ITV has broadcast the Champions League since 1992. Mega deal: BT Sport has blown its rivals out of the water with a staggering £900m deal to show Champions League football. End of an era: ITV - originally with Bob Wilson anchoring the show - have shown the Champions League live since its creation in 1992. It means that, for the first time, fans will have to pay to watch European matches, which have always been shown on terrestrial television. Although BT Sport says it will make a handful of matches available for free, including the finals of both competitions, supporters will have to buy BT broadband or pay a subscription to watch through their Sky box. Making some matches free will appeal to sponsors, which was ITV's main trumpcard in its relationship with Europe's football governing body, Uefa. Gavin Patterson, BT chief executive, said: 'I am thrilled that BT Sport will be the only place where fans can enjoy all the live action from the Uefa Champions League and Uefa Europa League. 'Both tournaments are world class and firm favourites with many. The live rights will give a major boost to BT Sport and give people yet another reason to take our terrific service.' Overpriced: TV rivals Sky said the company has overpaid for the rights. The BT channels are also showing live FA Cup games and live football from the top leagues in Germany, Italy, France and Scotland plus the FA Women's Super League. Away from football, there will also be rugby union and women's tennis, plus MotoGP coverage from next year. Mr Patterson added: 'BT Sport has got off to a strong start with customers enjoying what we have to offer. We have attracted millions of customers by giving sport back to the fans, and we can assure people who want to catch all the action, that European football will be far more accessible and affordable with BT.' Sky, which is thought to have nearly matched BT's bid, said its rival had paid 'far in excess' of its own valuation for the rights to the European matches. A statement from Sky read: 'We bid with a clear view of what the rights are worth to us. It seems BT chose to pay far in excess of our valuation. 'There are many ways in which we can invest in our service for customers. We take a disciplined approach and there is always a level at which we will choose to focus on something else. If we thought it was worth more, we'd have paid more. 'Nothing changes until 2015 and we look forward to 18 more months of live Champions League on Sky Sports. We will now re-deploy resources and continue to bring customers the best choice of TV across our offering.' What are highlight points for this article?","output":"The article highlights BT Sport's acquisition of exclusive rights to broadcast top European football matches, outbidding rivals Sky and ITV.

The deal marks the end of Sky's dominance over live football broadcasts in Britain and ITV's long-standing tradition of broadcasting Champions League matches since 1992. For the first time, fans will have to pay to watch European football matches, as the majority of the matches will be accessible only through BT broadband or a paid subscription through Sky.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? Should I leave fallen fruits on the ground as  these help add organic beneficial materials to the soil?","output":"To determine whether you should leave fallen fruits on the ground to help add organic beneficial materials to the soil, consider the following steps: Step 1: Assess the fallen fruits First, look at the types of fruits that have fallen and their condition. Are they rotten or fresh? The decomposition of fallen fruits contributes to the organic matter in the soil, which can indeed be beneficial.  Step 2: Consider the potential downsides Leaving fallen fruits on the ground can sometimes attract pests, rodents, and unwanted insects. If you're trying to maintain a clean and pest-free garden, leaving fallen fruits on the ground might not be the best choice. Step 3: Check for potential diseases If the fallen fruits are from a diseased tree or plant, you should remove them from the ground to prevent the spread of disease to other plants. In this case, leaving the fallen fruits would not be beneficial to the soil. Step 4: Evaluate the soil needs Consider the current condition of your soil. If your soil is lacking organic matter or nutrients, leaving the fallen fruits might be a good idea. Check the soil's texture, structure, and nutrient content to make an informed decision. Step 5: Consider composting If you're concerned about pests or diseases but still want the benefits of organic matter, consider composting the fallen fruits. This process can help break down the fruits, allowing you to use the nutrient-rich compost as an amendment to improve your soil. Step 6: Make a decision Taking all the steps above into account, determine whether it's best to leave the fallen fruits on the ground or to remove and compost them. The goal is to promote healthy soil while minimizing any risks associated with leaving fallen fruits on the ground. Step 7: Monitor the results After deciding on the best approach, observe the effects on your soil and plants. This will help you determine if leaving the fallen fruits on the ground is indeed beneficial or if adjustments need to be made in the future."},{"instruction":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What is the name of the debut single released by the music group that created the album Three?","output":"To accurately answer this question, more specific information is needed about the music group in question, as there are multiple groups with an album titled \\"Three.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You have some choice when it comes to tomatoes, especially between determinate (bush) and indeterminate (vining) varieties. Both will have advantages for indoor gardens, so think about which kind is best for your purposes. Hypothesis: The type of tomato grown indoors should be based on your situation.","output":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that the type of tomato grown indoors should be based on an individual's situation from the given context. The context suggests that there are various factors to consider when choosing a suitable tomato variety to grow indoors. Below is a detailed overview of the hypothesis and the considerations that support it: Growing tomatoes indoors can be an enjoyable and rewarding experience if the right choices are made during the planning process. Each person has unique circumstances and preferences that can impact their decision-making, including their space, time, requirements, and expectations from their indoor garden. 1. Space limitations: One significant factor to consider when choosing a type of tomato plant to grow indoors is the amount of space available. Determinate (bush) tomato plants are more compact and can be ideal for small spaces or container gardening. These plants are generally shorter and have a well-defined growth period, producing all their fruits around the same time. Indeterminate (vining) tomato plants, on the other hand, can grow quite large and require more space and support structures. They produce fruits over an extended period and can be a good option for those with ample room for a larger indoor garden. 2. Time investment: The time and effort that an individual can invest in their indoor garden should also be considered. Indeterminate tomato plants need more pruning, training, and support as they grow taller and produce fruits over a longer period. Determinate tomato plants, with their set growth period and smaller size, require less maintenance and time investment. 3. Purpose of growing tomatoes: Each person's purpose of growing tomatoes indoors can also dictate their choice of plant variety. If they primarily want tomatoes for cooking or require a large harvest at once, determinate tomato plants would be a better choice. However, if they want a steady supply of fresh tomatoes to snack on or add to salads over several months, indeterminate tomato plants might be more suitable. 4. Personal preferences: It's essential to consider personal preferences when selecting a tomato variety. Different tomato varieties have distinct flavors, sizes, and appearances that can be better suited to different culinary pursuits or aesthetic preferences. In conclusion, the hypothesis that the type of tomato grown indoors should be based on an individual's situation is supported by the context. Considering various factors such as space availability, time investment, purpose, and personal preferences can help individuals make an informed decision when choosing a suitable tomato variety for their indoor garden. This can lead to a more successful and enjoyable indoor gardening experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

A warm up gradually increases your heart rate, body temperature, and blood flow. Warming up your body before exercise can help to prevent injury and reduce soreness from a workout.  A warm up should be a light version of your planned exercise. Warm ups should last for around ten minutes. You shouldn't feel exhausted or overly tired from your warm up. For example, before going for a fast walk, warm up by walking slowly for around ten minutes. It's important to gradually cool your body down after a workout. Cooling down can help your heart rate return to a normal resting rate and may help prevent injury or soreness after the workout.  A cool down requires you to gradually reduce the intensity of your chosen exercise or activity. Try to cool down for around ten minutes. You may want to include stretching in your cool-down. For example, if you went for a walk, reduce your pace for around ten minutes. Include stretching in your warm-ups and cool-downs to help your muscles stay flexible and maintain their full range of motion. Stretches should be held for around thirty seconds each before repeating the stretch on the opposite side of the body. Try including some of the following stretches in your workouts:  Keep your shoulders flexible by bringing your arm across your body and holding it in place with your opposite hand. Push slightly with your opposing hand and feel the stretch across your shoulder. Stretch your hamstrings by first laying down on your back. Put one of your legs up and rest your foot against the outer corner of a wall. Slowly straighten your leg and hold for thirty seconds. Repeat the same motion with your other leg. To stretch your quadriceps, grab your ankle while standing and pull it up and back. You will feel the stretch in the front of your leg.

In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - Neon Ballroom is the third studio album by Australian alternative rock band Silverchair, released in 1999 by record labels Murmur and Epic.  - Christopher John Joannou (born 10 November 1979) is an Australian musician, best known as the bassist for the Newcastle-based alternative rock band Silverchair.

By June 2011, after Silverchair's disbandment, Gillies was in the final stages of about 12 months of working on his solo album and he said that it was not a continuation of his earlier work with Tambalane. In 2012, he formed Bento, in which he performs lead vocals, and released the band's debut album \\"Diamond Days\\".  - Triple J is a government-funded, national Australian radio station intended to appeal to listeners between the ages of 18 and 25 which began broadcasting in January 1975.

(CNN) -- Horror-meister, Stephen King calls George Pelecanos \\"perhaps the greatest living American crime writer.\\" His stories are set in Pelecanos' hometown of Washington, D.C., but this is not the side of the U.S. capitol that you see portrayed on TV with white marble monuments, lawyers and lobbyists. Pelecanos is more interested in working families struggling to get by, the racial tensions in its ethnic neighborhoods and the low-lifes on the edges. His crime-writing peers call Pelecanos the \\"undisputed poet\\" of Washington's gritty side. The best-selling and award-winning author is out this week with his 17th and latest novel, \\"The Cut.\\" It's the first in a new series featuring Iraq war veteran and private investigator Spero Lucas. When he's not working for a Washington defense attorney, Lucas recovers stolen property for a 40% cut. Now, a high-profile crime boss hires Lucas to find out who's been stealing from him, and it could turn out to be Lucas' biggest payday or an untimely end. While Pelecanos made his bones in the noir tradition, there's a definite \\"Western\\" feel to \\"The Cut.\\" The new novel takes place in a morally gray and often violent world. It's peppered with pitch-perfect dialogue and captures the sights, sounds and taste of Washington in rich detail. In short, Pelecanos reads like the real deal. Pelecanos knows a thing or two about capturing the authenticity of urban America with an ethnically and socially diverse cast.

The adaptation of the name from Portus Magnus to Portmany demonstrates that the Ibicencos acknowledged the Roman influence but also wished to establish their own identity related to this location. The name change might also be attributed to linguistic changes over time as the old Latin transitioned to various Romance and Iberian languages. The hypothesis, on the other hand, assumes that the Ibicencos did not name the location, which is entirely based on an unfounded supposition. Given the premise, it's evident that the inhabitants of Ibiza (known as Ibicencos) found it relevant to give this location a name despite already having a Roman denomination. This action demonstrates the importance that the great port held for the Ibicencos and their connection to the site. In conclusion, if we trust the premise \\"The Romans called it Portus Magnus (great port), which the Ibicencos adapted to Portmany,\\" it directly contradicts the hypothesis \\"It was named \\"Portus Magnus\\" by the Romans, but the Ibicencos never bothered to give it a name.\\" The Ibicencos indeed gave it a name by adapting the Roman title into their version, Portmany, which sheds light on their acknowledgement of the Roman influence and their wish to create a localized identity for the great port."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The answer \\"problems\\" may not be as specific as the other possible answers, but it aligns with human common sense because it acknowledges that various underlying issues or difficulties in an individual's life may contribute to their motivation for committing murder.  In this context, \\"problems\\" can refer to a wide range of personal, emotional, mental, or social factors that may drive someone to commit such a violent act. For example: 1. Mental health issues - An individual coping with severe mental illness might experience impaired judgment, delusions, or hallucinations, leading them to commit murder. 2. Emotional distress - People going through intense emotional turmoil, such as grief, jealousy, or betrayal, might feel overwhelmed and act impulsively out of rage or despair. 3. Financial difficulties - Desperation stemming from financial problems, such as debt or poverty, could make someone resort to murder as a way to escape their situation. 4. Manipulation or coercion - Someone may be manipulated or coerced into committing murder by others who hold power over them or who prey on their vulnerabilities. 5. Ideologies or beliefs - Individuals who adhere to extreme ideologies or beliefs may be driven to murder those they perceive as enemies or threats. This can include political, religious or even personal convictions. It is important to note that \\"problems\\" as an answer does not justify or excuse the act of murder. Rather, it helps identify some of the potential root causes that might contribute to someone's decision to commit this heinous crime.

Alex Answer:","output":"Title: Eyes of Alex Genre: Action/Thriller Plot Summary: A skilled team of thieves plan for their biggest heist yet - stealing a rare and extremely valuable artifact from a high-security museum. As they meticulously construct their master plan, the team starts to suspect that someone has been watching them. The mysterious figure, Alex, seems to know their every move and sends a chilling message, warning them of impending doom if they proceed with the robbery. Act I: The film opens with the group of thieves - led by fearless Ryan and his loyal crew of professionals, including tech genius Lila, acrobatics and burglary expert Mark, and the empathetic but muscle-strong Marlon - successfully pulling off a smaller heist to showcase their exceptional skills. It is then that we are taken into the planning process of their next big heist, which involves careful reconnaissance and brainstorming sessions. The target: a high-security museum holding a 15th-century artifact worth millions. The group splits up to familiarize themselves with the timetable of the guards, the inner workings of the security system, and possible escape routes. As they advance their preparation, Lila comes across mysterious CCTV footage of a shadowy figure following Mark on his recon mission. They quickly realize that they are being watched by someone named Alex, as they receive a cryptic message from him, warning them to stop their plans. Act II: Unwilling to back down from their most ambitious heist, the team decides to use Alex's surveillance as an opportunity to feed false information, hoping to throw Alex off their trail. Ryan, unable to shake the feeling that he knows Alex from somewhere, dives deep into his past, retracing old scores and the relationships he's built and shattered throughout his criminal career. As the big day draws near, the group finalizes their highly intricate plan and implements multiple contingencies. However, the stakes rise when the museum announces that a massive gala event will coincide with the planned night of their heist. The group is now faced with a heightened level of security, the ticking clock and the ever-looming presence of Alex, who seems to be getting closer to their inner circle. Act III: On the night of the heist, the team executes their plan with astounding precision, avoiding detection inside the museum while simultaneously dealing with the busy gala event. But as they approach the artifact, they discover that Alex has outsmarted them by leaving a life-size replica in the display - he's already stolen the original himself. A tense chase unfolds, and the group discovers that Alex is no ordinary observer. He is in fact a former member of Ryan's old crew, who was presumed dead years ago in a heist gone wrong. Alex, harboring feelings of betrayal and vengeance against Ryan and seeking redemption in the criminal world, aims to thwart the group's plans at every turn and claim the treasure for himself. As Alex's true motives are revealed, the group must face the darkness of their past to overcome the formidable foe they have made in Alex, all while evading the law enforcement that's quickly closing in on them. Conclusion: The climax of the film features a classic standoff between Ryan and Alex in the museum, mastermind versus mastermind. As the two face off, a moment of vulnerability allows Ryan to reach out to Alex, evoking sympathy for the experiences they once shared. In a twist of fate, Alex sacrifices himself to ensure the group's escape, redeeming himself in the process. In the end, Ryan and his crew manage to pull off the heist of a lifetime, while forever carrying with them the memory of Alex's contribution. The film concludes on an introspective, bittersweet note as the thieves ponder the price they've paid for the ultimate thrill of their criminal lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: In recent weeks, the investigation into possible collusion between President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia has intensified, raising the prospect that the probe could become an issue in advance of the November midterm congressional elections. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort made another appearance in federal court in Washington Wednesday, where he pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller.  Last week, Rick Gates, Manafort’s former deputy, pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors and is now cooperating with the investigation. In mid-February, 13 Russians were indicted in connection with election meddling, which deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein described as an effort to “promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed.” Congressional inquiries also continue. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and a longtime Trump aide, was the latest figure to testify before a congressional committee on the Russia probe. Hicks declined to answer some questions before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, frustrating several Democrats. “This is not executive privilege. This is executive stonewalling,” said ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff.  But there was more pushback from the White House this week. President Trump fired off a series of tweets dismissing the probe as a “WITCH HUNT.” “They have had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government,” Trump told reporters at the White House last month. “And it has hurt our government, it does hurt our government. It is a Democrat hoax.” Democrats reject that view, including Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I continue to believe that this is the most important thing that I will work on in my whole public career, and getting the whole truth out is extraordinarily important,” he said.

What is the solution?","output":"Alright, let's solve it for z like we are explaining to a five-year-old.  Imagine we have 24 blueberries and 3 blueberries, and we add them together, we get: 24 blueberries + 3 blueberries = 27 blueberries Now, think of z as magic balloons. We have 27 z, which means we have 27 times those magic balloons. So, our math problem becomes 0 = 27*z + 108. Now, let's play a game and pretend that we have already gotten those 108 candies. To make it fair, we need to remove these candies from both sides. So, if we remove (subtract) 108 candies from both sides, we will have: -108 = 27*z Now, we need to find out how many magic balloons we have (z). To know this, we will share the candies we have evenly among all the magic balloons. So, we will divide the number of candies we have (-108) by the number of magic balloons (27): -108 ÷ 27 = -4 This means we have 4 magic balloons, but since we used 'magic' in our game, it's -4 magic balloons.

As parents Larry and Judith watch proudly, they start to hold hands and arms, as if beginning to reconnect.

[-] No. Answer:","output":"No. While it is true that excessive sweating can cause dehydration in animals, it is important to distinguish between dehydration and infection. Dehydration is a result of an insufficient amount of water in the body, whereas infection typically occurs due to the invasion of microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Sweating is a natural cooling mechanism for many animals, and while it may lead to dehydration if the animal does not consume enough fluids, it does not inherently cause infection. However, an animal with a compromised immune system or open wounds may risk infection through other means (e.g., poor hygiene, contaminated environments, or contact with other infected animals), which may or may not be related to sweating. In summary, while dehydration can be a consequence of an animal sweating, it does not directly lead to infection.

Under the Abortion Act of 1967, abortions are legal and can be performed at or before 24 weeks of pregnancy in England, Wales, and Scotland. The laws in Northern Ireland are different than the rest of the U.K. Abortions after 24 weeks are only permitted when the pregnancy poses a substantial risk to the mother or if there is significant evidence of fatal fetal abnormalities. Two doctors must agree that it is in the patient’s best interest to terminate the pregnancy. This usually includes your general practitioner and the doctor performing the procedure. The U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS) provides free medical care to citizens of England, Scotland, and Wales. Abortions are free at NHS clinics and hospitals. Your medical history and procedures are kept confidential. Your doctor or a professional at a sexual health service will refer you to a certified and licensed NHS clinic or hospital. If you wish to terminate the pregnancy as soon as possible, seeking care at a private clinic may be the best option for you.

Summarize the following: Before you start to clean, you should take a look at the hamster's cage to see what state it is in.  Look for anything that needs cleaning at least once everyday, even if it's not a scheduled cleaning day.  Cleaning your hamster's cage too often or too little can cause them undue stress, so make sure you are cleaning the right amount when needed.  Look for any droppings or wet areas in the bedding material.  You can spot remove some areas. However, if there are a lot of them you should change the bedding. Pick out any leftover food that your hamster may have left laying around the cage. Change the water daily.  If the bedding material has become soaked or damp near the water dispenser, you may want to change the bedding out. If the walls of the enclosure are looking dirty or smudged, it may be time for a full cleaning. If the cage smells you must clean it fully.  Hamsters have a very sensitive sense of smell and can fall ill if the cage is unclean or the air quality is too poor. Before you get started cleaning, it is a good idea to assemble everything you will need.  This can make the process much easier and less stressful for both you and your hamster.  Collect the following items to get started:  Wash cloth or baby wipes. This will be used for scrubbing and cleaning the cage and anything in it. Disinfectant.  You can use mild, antibacterial hand or dish soap.  Avoid harsh chemicals like bleach as these can harm your hamster.  Pet stores will often carry safe and approved cleaning solutions as well. New bedding to place in the cage after you've cleaned it. Keep about a third of the bedding so they don't get stressed. You won't be able to clean the cage properly unless you have removed your hamster from it.  Place your hamster in a secondary cage, exercise ball, or other safe enclosure while you work.  Handle your hamster gently as you remove them from the cage. Cup your hamster in your hands, fully supporting their entire body. Don't leave your hamster in the exercise ball for more than half an hour as they will need fresh air and a break from the activity. Wash your hands before and after handling your hamster to protect both of you from spreading germs and getting sick.  You can use regular unscented hand soap for this. After you have removed your hamster and have placed them in a secure environment, you will need to take out any objects in the cage.  Leaving anything in the cage will make cleaning it more difficult and not as effective.  Remove all food and water bowls or dispensers. Take out any toys or exercise equipment. The last thing you need to remove from the cage will be the bedding.  The bedding is where your hamster leaves its waste, resulting in what can be a strong ammonia scent which can cause respiratory problems for your hamster.  Make sure to keep a little to mix in with the new bedding and reduce the hamster's stress.  You may want to seal the old bedding in a waste bag of its own to lock in any smells. Summary:","output":"Regularly inspect the hamster's cage to determine if cleaning is necessary, as too much or too little cleaning can cause stress. Check for droppings, wet areas, dirty walls, and unpleasant odors. Before cleaning, gather a washcloth or baby wipes, disinfectant, and new bedding. Remove the hamster and place it in a safe enclosure during the cleaning process, remembering to wash your hands before and after handling it. Remove all objects and bedding from the cage. Keep a portion of the old bedding to mix with the new, reducing stress for the hamster. Dispose of the old bedding in a sealed waste bag to contain odors. Use mild disinfectants to clean the cage and its components. Always make sure the cleaning process is thorough to promote a healthy environment for your hamster."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Through the 1820s and the turn of the decade, American settlers kept up pressure on the US government to remove the Seminole from Florida to make way for their desired agricultural development. In 1832, a few Seminole chiefs signed the Treaty of Payne's Landing, by which they agreed to give up their Florida lands in exchange for lands west of the Mississippi River in Indian Territory. According to legend, Osceola stabbed the treaty with his knife, although there are no contemporary reports of this.  Five of the most important Seminole chiefs, including Micanopy of the Alachua Seminole, did not agree to removal. In retaliation, the US Indian agent, Wiley Thompson, declared that those chiefs were deposed from their positions. As US relations with the Seminole deteriorated, Thompson forbade the sale of guns and ammunition to them. Osceola, a young warrior rising to prominence, resented this ban. He felt it equated the Seminole with slaves, who were forbidden to carry arms.  Thompson considered Osceola to be a friend and gave him a rifle. Osceola had a habit of barging into Thompson's office and shouting complaints at him. On one occasion Osceola quarreled with Thompson who had the warrior locked up at Fort King for a two nights until he agreed to be more respectful. In order to secure his release, Osceola agreed to sign the Treaty of Payne's Landing and to bring his followers into the fort. After his humiliating imprisonment, Osceola secretly prepared vengeance against Thompson.  On December 28, 1835, Osceola, with the same rifle Thompson gave him, killed Wiley Thompson. Osceola and his followers shot six others outside Fort King, while another group of Seminole ambushed and killed a column of US Army, over 100 troops, marching from Fort Brooke to Fort King, in what Americans called the Dade Massacre. These nearly simultaneous attacks began the Second Seminole War. Answer this question \\"Did the warrior kill him?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Yes, the warrior Osceola killed Wiley Thompson with the same rifle Thompson gave him."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He confronts K, who is with his partner Agent J, telling him he is \\"already dead\\". J then discovers that K was responsible not only for capturing Boris, but for deploying the \\"ArcNet\\", a shield that prevented the Boglodites from conquering Earth and caused their extinction. Boris travels back in time to kill the young Agent K. With history altered so that K is long-dead, J finds that only his memory has been unaffected, and no one from the Agency understands his obsession with K until Agent O, the new Chief, deduces that there has been a fracture in the space-time continuum. With K out of the picture, the ArcNet was never deployed, and there is nothing to protect the present-day Earth from the Boglodite invasion, so J must travel back in time to stop Boris and save K. Back in 1969, he travels to Coney Island, knowing from the Agency's records that, in 1969, Boris will commit a murder there. He finds Boris, but is discovered and arrested by 1969 K, who prepares to wipe his memory, but decides at the last minute to investigate J's claims. K and J follow clues, leading them to a bowling alley, and then to The Factory, where they come across an alien named Griffin, who is in possession of the ArcNet. Griffin, who can see all possible future timelines and outcomes, senses Boris is coming and escapes, but he later captures him. J and K pursue and rescue Griffin, acquiring the ArcNet. 1969 Boris escapes and 2012 Boris arrives and they team up. Upon learning that they must go to Cape Canaveral, Florida and attach the ArcNet to the Apollo 11 rocket so it can be deployed in space, J reveals the real purpose of his mission to K, who initially takes the news badly.

Q: The airway and the lungs are part of what organ system?   A: Pick your answer from: - coronary; - pulmonary; - digestive; - respiratory; Answer:","output":"The airway and the lungs are part of the respiratory system. This system is essential for the process of respiration, which involves the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between an organism and its environment. The respiratory system can be divided into two main parts: the upper respiratory tract and the lower respiratory tract. The upper respiratory tract consists of the nose, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, pharynx (throat), and larynx (voice box). The lower respiratory tract consists of the trachea (windpipe), bronchi, bronchioles, and the lungs. The primary function of the respiratory system is to deliver oxygen from the environment to the blood and remove carbon dioxide, a waste product, from the blood back to the environment. Here is an overview of the process: 1. Inhalation: When we inhale, air enters through the nose or mouth and passes through the nasal cavity or oral cavity. The air is warmed, moistened, and filtered as it travels through these cavities and the associated structures. 2. Transport through upper respiratory tract: The air continues to travel through the pharynx and larynx, and then enters the trachea. The trachea divides into two primary bronchi, which further divide into smaller secondary and tertiary bronchi. 3. Bronchi and bronchioles: The bronchi continue to branch into smaller and smaller structures known as bronchioles. These bronchioles are lined with tiny hair-like structures called cilia, which help trap mucus and foreign particles, assisting in the defensive function of the respiratory system. 4. Alveoli and gas exchange: Eventually, bronchioles end in small sac-like airspaces called alveoli. The alveoli are covered by an extensive network of capillaries, which allow for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air and blood. Oxygen diffuses from the air in the alveoli into the blood, while carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood back into the alveoli. 5. Exhalation: After the exchange of gases in the alveoli, carbon dioxide-rich air is expelled from the lungs and up through the respiratory tract during exhalation. The respiratory system also plays a role in speech, smell, and maintaining the pH balance of the blood. In addition, it protects the body from harmful substances and pathogens that may be inhaled by producing mucus, initiating a cough reflex, and containing immune cells to combat infections. In summary, the airway and lungs are essential components of the respiratory system, which is responsible for vital life processes such as respiration, gas exchange, and defense against microbes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Also evident throughout the swamp are numerous indicators of pollution, which Pickett believes are connected to pesticide use on the island plantation. After Clint Crockett accidentally tips over Smith's canoe, he and his sister Karen escort Smith to the family mansion where he meets the entire Crockett family. The grouchy, wheelchair-bound patriarch Jason intends on spending the next day enjoying both the 4th of July and his own birthday celebrations uninterrupted. Due to the mutual dislike of the fauna around the mansion, Jason sends a man named Grover to spray pesticide in order to get rid of the frogs.

Which notorious real-life terrorist figures prominently in Robert Ludlum's Bourne Trilogy?","output":"The notorious real-life terrorist figure that prominently features in Robert Ludlum's Bourne Trilogy, specifically in the third novel – “The Bourne Ultimatum” – is the infamous international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal. His real name is Ilich Ramírez Sánchez. Born on October 12, 1949, in Caracas, Venezuela, Carlos the Jackal rose to notoriety as one of the most ruthless and feared terrorists during the 1970s and 1980s. He was involved in various terrorist activities, assassinations, and bombings across Europe and the Middle East. He worked for multiple revolutionary organizations, including the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), which was responsible for the terror attacks he was involved in. Some of his most infamous acts include the 1975 attack on OPEC headquarters in Vienna and a series of bombings in France in the early 1980s. In the Bourne Trilogy, Carlos serves as the primary antagonist for the protagonist, Jason Bourne. In the novels, Bourne (whose real name is David Webb) is a highly skilled CIA operative with amnesia, struggling to uncover his own identity and past as he is caught in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with Carlos. Ludlum weaves their rivalry through a compelling and suspenseful narrative, highlighting the various ways their lives and missions intersect and affect one another. The Bourne Trilogy comprises of three novels: \\"The Bourne Identity\\" (1980), \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" (1986), and \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" (1990). While Carlos the Jackal does not feature as prevalently in the first two novels, he is a central figure in the last one. In \\"The Bourne Ultimatum,\\" Bourne becomes more determined to bring Carlos to justice and end his reign of terror. As the story progresses, Bourne unearths the secrets of his own past, confronts Carlos, and outwits him in an intense final showdown. It is important to note that the Bourne Trilogy was later adapted into a series of successful films starring Matt Damon as Jason Bourne. However, the storylines of both the movies and the novels diverge significantly in details and themes, and the Carlos the Jackal character is not present in the film adaptations. Carlos the Jackal's placement in the Bourne Trilogy fictional narrative almost mirrors his real-life infamous status. The character's ruthless nature, elusiveness, and ability to stay ahead of various governments' attempts to apprehend him add depth and intrigue to the novels. Ludlum's inclusion of such a notorious historical figure serves to heighten the stakes within the story, making for an especially captivating read where fiction meets reality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jake Rainer, a former child psychiatrist turned therapist, is called on to probe the child's mind in order to solve the case.

She eventually warms to Jake's efforts, but is concerned when she learns he was implicated in the suicide of another young child who was under his care. Jake gradually befriends Tim. At first, Jake thinks that Tim is trying to communicate by cutting up playing cards, but Sylvie reveals that Tim is good at mimicking voices. Jake is able to trigger Tim's memory so that Tim mimics the voices he heard on the night of the murder by using the trigger phrase \\"God Damn,\\" which were the first words Tim heard from the murder.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the building that Viscount Grey de Wilton laid the first stone for? ?  Radcliffe Tower is all that remains of an early 15th-century stone-built manor house.  The structure is a Grade I listed building and protected as a Scheduled Monument.  The construction of a nearby tithe barn is not documented, but it was probably built between 1600 and 1720. It was used for storage of the local tithes (a tenth of a farm's produce).  Along with Radcliffe Tower, the Parish Church of St Mary is a Grade I listed building.  The town also has two Grade II* listed buildings; Dearden Fold Farmhouse, completed during the 16th century, and Radcliffe Cenotaph, built in 1922 to commemorate the First World War.  Outwood Viaduct, and Radcliffe's most visible landmark, St Thomas' Church, are Grade II listed buildings.  St Thomas' took nine years to complete. The first stone was laid by Viscount Grey de Wilton (grandson of the Countess Grosvenor) on 21 July 1862, and it was consecrated in 1864 by the first Bishop of Manchester, James Prince Lee.  Construction of the tower began in 1870 and the building was completed in 1871.  The building cost £7,273, (£670 thousand today) and the tower cost £1,800 (£160 thousand today). The first vicar was the Reverend Robert Fletcher. Radcliffe's first public ornament was a drinking fountain located at the bottom of Radcliffe New Road.  It was presented to the town by a Mrs Noah Rostron in memory of her husband, and erected in August 1896.  The fountain no longer exists at this location. Built in 1911 the town hall was on the junction of Water Street and Spring Lane.  For many years after the town lost its urban district status, the building was unoccupied.

The answer is:","output":"Cashmere comes from cashmere goats. These goats are the primary source of cashmere wool, a fiber renowned worldwide for its softness, warmth, and durability. Cashmere goats are found in various parts of the world, including Mongolia, China, Iran, Afghanistan, and Turkey, among others. The process of acquiring cashmere is tedious and is a contributing factor to its premium cost. The wool is diligently harvested by hand during the molting season, which typically falls in spring. The material is collected from the soft undercoat of the goat, rather than its rough outer hairs. It takes an average of two to three goats to produce enough wool to make a single cashmere sweater. Once collected, the cashmere fiber then undergoes a rigorous process of cleaning and separating, as the desirable undercoat needs to be separated from the rougher overcoat hairs. This process usually requires a lot of work, adding further to the luxury status of cashmere items.  Thus, the intricate process of obtaining cashmere from goats and the limited regions in which these goats are found contribute significantly to the relatively high costs of cashmere products around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Prosessin puitteissa on tehty useita toimia, joiden tarkoituksena on tukea poliittista vakautta, taloudellista kehitystä ja sosiaalista yhteenkuuluvuutta alueella. Yhteistyön kannalta keskeiset osa-alueet ovat muun muassa energia, liikenne, ympäristö, koulutus ja kulttuuri. Välimeren yhteistyöstrategiassa pyritään luomaan synergioita Euroopan unionin ja eteläisen Välimeren alueen maiden välille, jotta edistettäisiin yhteisiä strategisia etuja sekä vastattaisiin alueellisiin ja maailmanlaajuisiin haasteisiin. Viime vuosikymmenen aikana olemme nähneet, että poliittiset ja taloudelliset kriisit alueella heijastuvat vahvasti Euroopan unioniin, ja siksi onkin olennaisen tärkeää omaksua ennakoiva lähestymistapa, joka edistää alueen vakautta ja vaurautta. Euroopan naapuruuspolitiikka (ENP) ei ole ainoastaan keskittynyt Euroopan lähialueisiin, vaan siinä korostetaan myös yhteistyön merkitystä niin alueella kuin kansainvälisellä tasolla. ENP korostaa yhteisiä arvoja, kuten demokratiaa, oikeusvaltioperiaatetta ja ihmisoikeuksien kunnioittamista. Tavoitteena on, että Euroopan unionin on syvennettävä kumppanuutta ja yhteistyötä eteläisen Välimeren naapuriensa kanssa, jotta voidaan edistää poliittista ja taloudellista vakautta koko alueella ja tukea Euroopan unioniin pyrkivien maiden pyrkimyksiä demokratiaan ja hyvään hallintoon. Koska ENP:n tärkeänä osana on ollut edistää eteläisen Välimeren alueen maiden talouskehitystä, turvallisuutta ja vakautta, unionin on jatkettava konkreettisten toimien toteuttamista energian, liikenteen, kaupan ja ympäristön aloilla. Lopuksi on ehdottomasti tärkeää, että Euroopan unioni huomioi eteläisen naapurustonsa kehityksen ja tarpeet, niin ettei Välimeren alueen kumppaneiden kanssa tehty yhteistyö jää pelkäksi julistuksen tasolle. Euroopan unionin on oltava valmis toimimaan tehokkaasti alueen etujen sekä omien etujensa mukaisesti ja tarjottava horisontaalista, kumppanuuteen perustuvaa lähestymistapaa poliittisiin ja taloudellisiin kysymyksiin."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The leading U.S. presidential hopefuls reacted strongly Monday to the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Sunday's incident that left 49 people dead and 53 others wounded was the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. The gunman, Omar Mateen, was a U.S. citizen and the son of Afghan parents. In her first speech since the shooting, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told supporters in Cleveland, \\"The Orlando terrorist may be dead, but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive.\\" Clinton laid out a multi-faceted approach to combating terrorism. The plan would disrupt terrorist groups by infiltrating their online networks, enhancing intelligence sharing among local and federal law enforcement agencies, and asking allied nations to help \\"prevent the radicalization and recruitment\\" of potential terrorists in the U.S. and Europe. In an apparent response to presumptive Republican Party opponent Donald Trump's charge that President Barack Obama and other Democrats refuse to use the word \\"radical\\" to describe terrorists who happen to be Muslim, Clinton said earlier on CNN that she is not afraid to use the term, but says she refuses \\"to demonize and demagogue and declare war on an entire religion.\\" Doing so, she said, \\"plays right into the ISIS' hands.\\" ISIS is an acronym for Islamic State, which is also known as IS, ISIL and Daesh. Clinton called for citizens to reach out to Muslims in the United States \\"to help us defeat this threat.\\" She cited the need for \\"common sense reform\\" of gun ownership laws, including a ban on assault weapons. After Obama did not use the term \\"radical\\" in his remarks Sunday from the White House, Trump criticized Obama's approach to extremism and said the president \\"should step down.\\" Trump, meanwhile, renewed a call for a ban on the entry of Muslim immigrants into the United States. \\"The only reason the killer was in America in the first place was we allowed his family to come here,\\" Trump said in a speech to supporters in Manchester, New...

Article: The prefix = st1 /USgovernment has announced plans to list polar bears as a threatened species because of concerns that the ice where they live is melting. But as the BBC's Owen Clegg reports, theUSplans are also important for other reasons. It's estimated that there are no more than twenty-five thousand polar bears living in the wild, and this number could go down by a large amount as the floating ice upon which the bears survive melt away. Now, without admitting the cause of this melt, the US Fish and Wildlife Services are reviewing the bear's living conditions.    That action is being taken at all, and marks an important change for the Bush administration; for the first time, it may be forced to acknowledge a link between global warming and its effect on a species. Such a conclusion by an unwilling Bush administration could force far wider changes inWashington's policy towards the environment.    This review only came about after a union of environmental groups brought a legal case against the government to take action. Environmentalists, like David Doniger, believe that by calling on the protections of the Endangered Species Act, theUSgovernment may finally be forced to cut back on its sending out greenhouse gases:    \\"It is a very important thing today to have the Bush administration notice that global warming is threatening the existence of the polar bear. Now, it's up to the administration to do something to stop the global warming that's threatening the polar bear.\\" ( David Doniger)    The United States is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases which are blamed for trapping heat from the sun and changing the earth's climate. Since taking office in 2001, President Bush has refused to make the link with global warming, but the bad, serious situation of the polar bear may force that position to change. Question: What is the significance of US Fish and Wildlife Services' reviewing the bear's living conditions? Answer: Pick your answer from: 1. It brought a legal case against the government.; 2. It marks an important change for the Bush administration.; 3. It is a conclusion by a Bush administration.; 4. It makes the protections of the Endangered Species Act possible.; The answer is:","output":"2. It marks an important change for the Bush administration. The significance of the US Fish and Wildlife Services reviewing the polar bear's living conditions is that it marks an important change for the Bush administration. For the first time, they may be forced to acknowledge a link between global warming and its effects on a species, which could lead to wider changes in Washington's policy towards the environment. This review only came about after a group of environmental organizations brought a legal case against the government, urging them to take action to protect polar bears. By invoking the Endangered Species Act, the US government might finally be compelled to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which are the primary cause of global warming and the subsequent melting of polar ice – the polar bear's natural habitat."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Sir William Jones proposed that Sanskrit, Persian, Greek, Latin, Gothic, and Celtic languages all shared a common base. After Jones, an effort to catalog all languages of the world was made throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century. Publication of Ferdinand de Saussure's Cours de linguistique générale created the development of descriptive linguistics. Descriptive linguistics, and the related structuralism movement caused linguistics to focus on how language changes over time, instead of just describing the differences between languages. Noam Chomsky further diversified linguistics with the development of generative linguistics in the 1950s. His effort is based upon a mathematical model of language that allows for the description and prediction of valid syntax. Additional specialties such as sociolinguistics, cognitive linguistics, and computational linguistics have emerged from collaboration between linguistics and other disciplines.

When studying the kinetic-molecular theory, two teams of students did and experiment. Team A heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, team B heated a can of soup, but vented it first.  Which team lead a less safer experiment?  Hint: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. A:","output":"Based on the hint provided, Team A led a less safer experiment. Here's the step-by-step justification for this conclusion: 1. According to the kinetic-molecular theory, heating the can of soup provides the air inside with more kinetic energy, causing air molecules to move faster and impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. 2. Team A heated the can of soup without venting it first, which means the can remained a closed, rigid container. 3. As the air molecules inside the can gained more energy from the heat, the pressure inside the can increased due to more frequent and forceful collisions with the container walls. 4. Additionally, the soup may have begun to boil, releasing more gas and further increasing the pressure inside the can. 5. The combination of increased molecular activity and additional gas from boiling soup causes the pressure to build up inside the closed can, which may eventually exceed the can's strength, leading to an explosion. 6. Team B vented the can of soup before heating it, allowing the trapped air and excessive pressure to escape, thus mitigating the risk of explosion. In conclusion, Team A's experiment was less safe due to the potential for a pressure buildup from the increased kinetic energy and boiling of the soup, which might have caused the can to explode. Team B's experiment was considerably safer due to the venting done to prevent pressure buildup."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: You are considering whether to buy a product.

Group A ate lots of fats(lipids), while Group B  had a more balanced diet with few fats. Group A gained a lot of weight over the course of the 6 month study.  Which group had normal lipid levels in the blood?  Hint: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Group B, which had a more balanced diet with few fats, is more likely to have normal lipid levels in the blood. This is because they maintained a moderate fat intake, avoiding the negative effects associated with excessive dietary lipids, such as unhealthy weight gain and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, Group A, which consumed a high-fat diet, likely experienced increased lipid levels in their blood, leading to potential health problems. It is important to maintain a balanced diet with appropriate levels of fats, particularly focusing on consuming healthier unsaturated fats and limiting saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol intake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lanyard denies any involvement claiming that he is in London with his butler, Claudius Jamison to write a book on the jewels and was in New York when they were stolen.  Lanyard and Jamison are short of funds and when Ann Kelmscott, the daughter of wealthy gem collector Sir John Kelmscott, invites them to the family estate, they agree. Sir John confides that he is in desperate need of money and asks Lanyard to arrange a confidential loan with part of his jewel collection as collateral. Jamison tells his master that Lily  (Queenie Leonard), the maid, told him the butler, Henry Robards, is heartbroken because his former wife, actress Iris Chatham, has run off with Monty Beresford who financed the lavish stage production that launched Iris to stardom.  Back at his hotel, Lanyard receives a call from Iris, inviting him to the theater that night where she asks him to stay away from the Kelmscotts. At her apartment, Robards begs her for a reconciliation, but she demands something first. Lanyard decides to accept Kelmscott's offer and arranges to meet Bruce Tang, a gem dealer the next morning.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person whose \\"middle\\" compositional period was after 1901?  The Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major by Gustav Mahler is one of the largest-scale choral works in the classical concert repertoire. Because it requires huge instrumental and vocal forces it is frequently called the \\"Symphony of a Thousand\\", although the work is normally presented with far fewer than a thousand performers and the composer did not sanction that name. The work was composed in a single inspired burst, at Maiernigg in southern Austria in the summer of 1906. The last of Mahler's works that was premiered in his lifetime, the symphony was a critical and popular success when he conducted the Munich Philharmonic in its first performance, in Munich, on 12 September 1910. The fusion of song and symphony had been a characteristic of Mahler's early works. In his \\"middle\\" compositional period after 1901, a change of direction led him to produce three purely instrumental symphonies. The Eighth, marking the end of the middle period, returns to a combination of orchestra and voice in a symphonic context. The structure of the work is unconventional; instead of the normal framework of several movements, the piece is in two parts. Part I is based on the Latin text of a 9th-century Christian hymn for Pentecost, Veni creator spiritus (\\"Come, Creator Spirit\\"), and Part II is a setting of the words from the closing scene of Goethe's Faust. The two parts are unified by a common idea, that of redemption through the power of love, a unity conveyed through shared musical themes. Mahler had been convinced from the start of the work's significance; in renouncing the pessimism that had marked much of his music, he offered the Eighth as an expression of confidence in the eternal human spirit. In the period following the composer's death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has been heard regularly in concert halls all over the world, and has been recorded many times. While recognising its wide popularity, modern critics have divided opinions on the work; Theodor W....

Here is a detailed explanation of each part of the statement: 1. Outsized luggage: This term is used to describe larger or bulkier items that are not considered as regular luggage. These items often require special handling and storage due to their size and shape. Examples of outsized luggage include bicycles, surfboards, skis, snowboards, golf clubs, and other large or irregularly shaped items. 2. Bicycles, surfboards, etc.: This portion of the statement provides examples of the types of outsized luggage that the pricing applies to. In this case, bicycles and surfboards are specifically mentioned, with the \\"etc.\\" indicating that other similar items are also included. 3. Per calendar day or part thereof: The fee for storing outsized luggage is calculated on a daily basis. This means that if an item is stored for any part of the day, the full daily rate will be charged. For example, if you store your bicycle for 2 hours or 23 hours, the daily rate of 5.00€ still applies. However, if the item is stored for multiple days, the daily rate is multiplied by the number of days the item is stored. So, for example, if the item is stored for 3 days and 2 hours, the total fee would be (3 full days x 5.00€) + (1 partial day x 5.00€) = 20.00€. 4. 5.00€: This is the cost or fee associated with storing oversized luggage items for each calendar day or part thereof. The fee is in Euro (€) and applies to each outsized item separately. In summary, the statement \\"Outsized luggage (bicycles, surfboards, etc.) per calendar day or part thereof: 5.00€\\" is explaining the pricing structure for storing large and irregularly shaped items, such as bicycles and surfboards, at a particular service or facility.

Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: DO NOT get this book if you are trying to learn algebra Review: Do Not get this book if you are trying to learn algebra. The first half of the book is OK, the basic stuff. Once you get further along there are tons of problems with no explanation AT ALL as to why she is doing certain things in the problem. This is a good book for a refresher, that's it. Answer: A:","output":"There is a negative tone to this product review. The author of the review has expressed dissatisfaction and frustration with the book in question, specifically as a tool for learning algebra. This is made clear in both the title and the content of the review. The capitalization of \\"DO NOT\\" in the title indicates a strong warning against the book for anyone looking to learn algebra. The reviewer further emphasizes their disapproval by reiterating the title's sentiment - \\"Do Not get this book if you are trying to learn algebra\\" - in the opening line of the review. The reviewer does not provide a completely negative assessment, as they do admit that the first half of the book is \\"OK\\" for covering basic topics in algebra. However, the overall tone remains negative as the review discusses the major issues found in the later sections of the book. The mention of \\"tons of problems with no explanation AT ALL\\" conveys a sense of frustration and disappointment, especially for a book that is presumed to teach algebra. The reviewer clearly feels that the book essentially fails to fulfill its purpose. Their use of all-capital letters for \\"AT ALL\\" further emphasizes the reviewer's exasperation with the book. While the reviewer does try to offer a slightly positive point about the book being a potentially good tool as a refresher, the overall tone remains predominantly negative. The dissatisfaction with the book's usefulness in teaching algebra appears to be the driving factor behind this negative tone, indicating that, for the reviewer, the book is not a worthwhile investment for those seeking to learn the subject."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pointing to a color1ful flower, Campbell lifts her baby's soft hand, and rapidly moves it from one side of his nose to the other as she sniffs  .\\"Flower!\\" she says loudly. Gregory smiles and looks carefully. It could be a year before Gregory, 4 months old, can speak, but now his mother hopes to communicate with her baby through sign language. Like others around the world, Campbell is part of a growing movement of parents teaching hearing babies simple signs to communicate before they can talk. The baby sign language has been more popular in recent years. The movie,\\"Meet the Fockers\\",where the main character teaches his young grandson to sign, makes it well developed. Babies generally begin to talk between 12 and 15 months, but babies can use sign language to communicate before they learn how to speak. \\"We know they are learning language faster than they are able to show you with their speech production because that system takes a long time to develop.\\" says McRoberts, director of developmental research at the Haskins Laboratories. \\"They are understanding words before they are able to say them. From around 16 to 18 months, they might say 50 words but understand 200.They understand short sentences well.\\" says McRoberts.

As to whether hearing babies can communicate earlier with sign language, McRoberts says,\\"I think that's still unknown. It may not. I'm very interested in that very question.\\" Question: Which of the following does McRoberts agree with? Options: A: Babies learn to talk quickly.

The World No.1 avoided a potentially long and drawn out court case in Dublin, Ireland, after attempting to sue Horizon Sports Management, who in turn were counter-suing the golfer  by claiming the Northern Irishman owed them millions of dollars in commission on contracts up to 2017. McIlroy had labeled the contract he had signed with Horizon as \\"unconscionable.\\" \\"The legal dispute between Rory McIlroy and Horizon Sports Management has been settled to the satisfaction of both parties who wish each other well for the future,\\" said a joint statement from McIlroy and Horizon. \\"The parties will be making no further comment,\\" added the statement. McIlroy reportedly paid 22.8m million plus costs to settle the case. In an interview with CNN's Living Golf show month, McIlroy insisted the case had been about taking \\"control of things myself.\\" He added: \\"If there's one good thing that's came out of all of this, it's being able to set up my own management team and my own management company. \\"That's been huge. Even after all of this, having a great team around me and a great team in place, that's all been worth it.\\" The period under dispute coincided with McIlroy's sponsorship deal with Nike, which was reported be worth around 100m. McIlroy, who won the Dubai Desert Classic last weekend, was not in court when the settlement was announced, though he did make a brief appearance on Tuesday. The 25-year-old had claimed that the fees charged by Horizon were excessive, while simultaneously being accused of breaching his contract and owing outstanding fees. McIlroy terminated his contract with Horizon in 2013 to set up his own company. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Rory McIlroy is a very good golfer.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Sir Richard Starkey  (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number-four hit \\"It Don't Come Easy\\", and number ones \\"Photograph\\" and \\"You're Sixteen\\". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, \\"Back Off Boogaloo\\", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US.

In one study, striking increases in IQ occurred in 25 children who were moved from an orphanage  to more stimulating(,) environments.The children, who were all considered mentally retarded and unadoptable, were moved to an institution where they received personal attention from adults.Later, these supposedly retarded children were adopted by parents who gave them love, a family ,and a stimulating home environment.The children gained an average of 29 IQ points.For one child, the increase was an amazing 58 points.A second group of initially less \\"retarded\\" children, who stayed in the orphanage, lost an average of 26 IQ points. Other encouraging results can be found in early childhood education programs, which provide stimulating intellectual experiences for disadvantaged children.In one study, children from low-income families were given enriched environments from early infancy  through preschool.By age 2 their IQ scores were already higher than those in a control group.More important, they were still 5 points higher seven years later.High-quality enrichment programs such as Head Start can prevent children from falling behind in school. A particularly striking environmental effect is the fact that 14 nations have shown average IQ gains of from 5 to 25 points during the last 30 years.These IQ boosts, averaging 15 points, occurred in far too short a time for genetics to explain them.It is more likely that the gains reflect environmental forces, such as improved education, nutrition, and living in a technologically complex society.

She could read and write fairly well, and had been used to helping her husband the under-steward with his accounts at Muro, but even if she had looked at the recipe she would have understood nothing of the doctor's hieroglyphics and abbreviated Latin words. The prescription was for a preparation of arsenic, which Matilde had formerly taken for some time. The chemist would not make any difficulty about preparing twenty doses of it for the Countess Macomer, though the whole quantity of arsenic contained in so many would probably be sufficient to kill one not accustomed to the medicine, if taken all at once. But though Matilde was so anxious to have the stuff before luncheon, she had a number of doses of it put away in a drawer, which she took out and counted, after Elettra had gone. She opened one of the little folded papers and looked at the fine white powder it contained, took a little on the end of her finger and tasted it.

And Cabin Fever is definitely no exception. I couldn't even pay attention to most of this movie it was so frustrating and bad. here's the plot. Guy cuts up dead dog for some reason. Gets infected by random virus, transfers it to kids at a camp, kids start to get infected and die, town finds out about it and rather than help them, kills them. then the water is infected and everyone dies. the end.

Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture. Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff. The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife. Madge teams with Shaw to try to foil her sister's scheme, but Doris lures him to a mountain cabin and shoots him with a gun. A wounded Shaw sees both Hillmans struggle then fall to their deaths through a clifftop doorway, just minutes before Madge and the cops arrive., what would be the answer ?

Premise: \\"Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"There is little penalty for failing to meet the goal.\\"?","output":"Step 1: Identify the key information in the premise The premise provides the following key information: - The goal set by the Georgia State Bar for pro-bono service is 50 hours. - In 2002, only 23 percent (5,427 lawyers) of the state's 23,598 active lawyers met this goal. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis states that \\"There is little penalty for failing to meet the goal.\\" Step 3: Assess the relationship between the premise and hypothesis To assess the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, we need to consider the implications of the given information. - If 23 percent of active lawyers met the pro-bono goal, this means that 77 percent (18,171 lawyers) did not. - If there were significant penalties for not meeting the goal, we might expect a higher proportion of lawyers to meet the goal in order to avoid those penalties. - The premise does not provide any information on the penalties that may exist for not meeting the pro-bono goal, but it does show that a large majority of lawyers did not meet the goal. Step 4: Evaluate the hypothesis based on the premise The fact that 77 percent of the lawyers did not meet the pro-bono goal in 2002 suggests that either the penalties for not meeting the goal are not significant, or that they are not effectively enforced. While the premise does not conclusively prove the hypothesis, it does support the idea that there is little penalty for failing to meet the goal. Other factors might be at play, but with the available information in the premise, it seems reasonable to consider the hypothesis as plausible."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Weill Cornell Medicine is the biomedical research unit and medical school of Cornell University, a private Ivy League university. The medical college is located at 1300 York Avenue, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City, along with the Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences.  - Immunology is a branch of biology that covers the study of immune systems in all organisms. It was the Russian biologist Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov who boosted studies on immunology, and received the Nobel Prize in 1908 for his work. He jabbed the thorn of a rose on a starfish and noted that, 24 hours later, cells were surrounding the tip. It was an active response of the body, trying to maintain its integrity. It was Mechnikov who first observed the phenomenon of phagocytosis, in which the body defends itself against a foreign body, and coined the term. It charts, measures, and contextualizes the: physiological functioning of the immune system in states of both health and diseases; malfunctions of the immune system in immunological disorders (such as autoimmune diseases, hypersensitivities, immune deficiency, and transplant rejection); the physical, chemical and physiological characteristics of the components of the immune system \\"in vitro\\", \\"in situ,\\" and \\"in vivo\\". Immunology has applications in numerous disciplines of medicine, particularly in the fields of organ transplantation, oncology, virology, bacteriology, parasitology, psychiatry, and dermatology.  - Medicine (British English ; American English ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. The word \\"medicine\\" is derived from Latin \\"medicus\\", meaning \\"a physician\\". Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.  - The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is one of eleven agencies that are part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The NCI coordinates the U.S. National Cancer Program and conducts and supports research, training, health information dissemination, and other activities related to the causes, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer; the supportive care of cancer patients and their families; and cancer survivorship. On April 1, 2015, Douglas Lowy, M.D. was named the Acting Director of NCI.  - Alfred Pritchard Sloan, Jr. (May 23, 1875  February 17, 1966) was an American business executive in the automotive industry. He was a long-time President, chairman and CEO of General Motors Corporation. Sloan, first as a senior executive and later as the head of the organization, helped GM grow from the 1920s through the 1950s, decades when concepts such as the annual model change, brand architecture, industrial design, automotive design (styling), and planned obsolescence transformed the industry, and when the industry changed lifestyles and the built environment in America and throughout the world.  - The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), is a center of health sciences research, patient care, and education devoted solely to graduate education and located in San Francisco, California. The UCSF School of Medicine is one of the most selective medical schools in the United States based on average MCAT score, GPA, and acceptance rate. In 2015, 7,393 people applied and 437 were interviewed for 149 positions in the entering class. UCSF is ranked 3rd among research-oriented medical schools in the United States and ranked 3rd for primary care by \\"U.S. News and World Report,\\" making it the only medical school to achieve a top-5 ranking in both categories. UCSF is currently ranked 2nd among medical schools in the world by the Academic Ranking of World Universities (Clinical Medicine, 2015).  - Physiology is the scientific study of the normal function in living systems. A sub-discipline of biology, its focus is in how organisms, organ systems, organs, cells, and biomolecules carry out the chemical or physical functions that exist in a living system. Given the size of the field, it is divided into, among others, animal physiology (including that of humans), plant physiology, cellular physiology, microbial physiology (microbial metabolism), bacterial physiology, and viral physiology. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded to those who make significant achievements in this discipline by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In medicine, a physiologic state is one occurring from normal body function, rather than pathologically, which is centered on the abnormalities that occur in animal diseases, including humans.  - The term \\"microbiologist\\" comes from the Greek \\"mkros\\" meaning \\"small\\" , and \\"bios\\", meaning \\"life\\" , combined with \\"-logia\\" meaning one who studies. A microbiologist (from Greek ) is a biological scientist who studies microscopic life forms and processes or works in the field of microbiology. Microbiologists investigate the growth, interactions and characteristics of microscopic organisms such as bacteria, algae, fungi, and some types of parasites and their vectors. They contribute much to the field by trying to understand and learn about the interaction between these microbes and the environment and also among themselves and other organisms. Most microbiologists are qualified to work in offices and/or research facilities, such as a laboratory as well as in the academia. There, they conduct experiments that help them analyze microbes and their importance. A microbiologist's work is often repeated or improved in order to establish accurate research. Most microbiologists specialize in environmental, food, agricultural, industrial or medical aspects of microbiology including: virology (the study of viruses); immunology (the study of mechanisms that fight infections); bioinformatics (the methods for storing, retrieving, organizing and analyzing biological data) and Bioremediation (using microbes as environmental mitigation strategies). Many microbiologists use biotechnology to advance the understanding of cell reproduction and human disease. Some microbiologists have contributed to knowledge of pathogens and disease-causing microbes. While others, study their interaction with the environment and their use as potential environmental pollution cleaners.   - The Nobel Prize (; Swedish definite form, singular: \\"Nobelpriset\\") is a set of annual international awards bestowed in a number of categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, and/or scientific advances.  - San Francisco (SF) (Spanish for Saint Francis) officially the City and County of San Francisco, is the cultural, commercial, and financial center of Northern California. It is the birthplace of the United Nations. Located at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula, San Francisco is about in area, making it the smallest countyand the only consolidated city-countywithin the state of California. With a density of about 18,451 people per square mile (7,124 people per km), San Francisco is the most densely settled large city (population greater than 200,000) in California and the second-most densely populated major city in the United States after New York City. San Francisco is the fourth-most populous city in California, after Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Jose, and the 13th-most populous city in the United Stateswith a census-estimated 2015 population of 864,816. The city and its surrounding areas are known as the San Francisco Bay Area, and are a part of the larger OMB-designated San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland combined statistical area, the fifth most populous in the nation with an estimated population of 8.7 million.  - Life is a characteristic distinguishing physical entities having biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased, or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate. Various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria. The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define viruses, viroids, or potential artificial life as \\"living\\". Biology is the primary science concerned with the study of life, although many other sciences are involved.  - Harold Eliot Varmus (born December 18, 1939) is an American Nobel Prize-winning scientist and was the 14th Director of the National Cancer Institute, a post to which he was appointed by President Barack Obama. He was a co-recipient (along with J. Michael Bishop) of the 1989 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovery of the cellular origin of retroviral oncogenes. He is currently the Lewis Thomas University Professor of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and a Senior Associate at the New York Genome Center.  - Virology is the study of viruses  submicroscopic, parasitic particles of genetic material contained in a protein coat  and virus-like agents. It focuses on the following aspects of viruses: their structure, classification and evolution, their ways to infect and exploit host cells for reproduction, their interaction with host organism physiology and immunity, the diseases they cause, the techniques to isolate and culture them, and their use in research and therapy. Virology is considered to be a subfield of microbiology or of medicine.  - A diploma (from Greek µ \\"díplma\\", meaning \\"folded paper\\") is a certificate or deed issued by an educational institution, such as a college or university, that testifies that the recipient has successfully completed a particular course of study, or (US) recording that an academic degree has been awarded. In some countries, e.g. the United Kingdom and Australia, the word diploma also refers to an academic award (e.g. diploma of higher education, graduate diploma, postgraduate diploma). Historically, it can also refer to a charter or official document, thus diplomatic, diplomat and diplomacy via the \\"Codex Juris Gentium Diplomaticus\\".  - Algae (singular \\"alga\\" ) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of photosynthetic organisms which are not necessarily closely related, and is thus polyphyletic. Included organisms range from unicellular genera, such as \\"Chlorella\\" and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 m in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem, and phloem, which are found in land plants. The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds, while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta, a division of green algae which includes, for example, \\"Spirogyra\\" and the stoneworts.  - A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity.  - The Alfred P. Sloan Prize is an award given each year, starting in 2003, to a film at the Sundance Film Festival. The prize is given to a feature film that focuses on science or technology as a theme, or depicts a scientist, engineer, or mathematician as a major character.  - Bacteria (common noun bacteria, singular bacterium) constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep portions of Earth's crust. Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals.  - Bioremediation is a waste management technique that involves the use of organisms to remove or neutralize pollutants from a contaminated site. According to the United States EPA, bioremediation is a treatment that uses naturally occurring organisms to break down hazardous substances into less toxic or non toxic substances. Technologies can be generally classified as \\"in situ\\" or \\"ex situ\\". \\"In situ\\" bioremediation involves treating the contaminated material at the site, while \\"ex situ\\" involves the removal of the contaminated material to be treated elsewhere. Some examples of bioremediation related technologies are phytoremediation, bioventing, bioleaching, landfarming, bioreactor, composting, bioaugmentation, rhizofiltration, and biostimulation.  - The University of California (UC) is a public university system in the U.S. state of California. Under the California Master Plan for Higher Education, the University of California is a part of the state's three-system public higher education plan, which also include the California State University system and the California Community Colleges System.  - Primary care is the day-to-day healthcare given by a health care provider. Typically this provider acts as the first contact and principal point of continuing care for patients within a healthcare system, and coordinates other specialist care that the patient may need. Patients commonly receive primary care from professionals such as a primary care physician (general practitioner or family physician), a nurse practitioner (adult-gerontology nurse practitioner, family nurse practitioner, or pediatric nurse practitioner), or a physician assistant. In some localities such a professional may be a registered nurse, a pharmacist, a clinical officer (as in parts of Africa), or a Ayurvedic or other traditional medicine professional (as in parts of Asia). Depending on the nature of the health condition, patients may then be referred for secondary or tertiary care.  - Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), also known as Shanghai Ranking, is an annual publication of university rankings by Shanghai Ranking Consultancy. The league table was originally compiled and issued by Shanghai Jiaotong University in 2003, the first global ranking with multifarious indicators, after which a board of international advisories was established to provide suggestions. The publication currently includes world's overall and subject league tables, alongside independent regional \\"Greater China Ranking\\" and \\"Macedonian HEIs Ranking\\". ARWU is regarded as one of the three most influential and widely observed university measures, alongside \\"QS World University Rankings\\" and \\"Times Higher Education World University Rankings\\".  It is praised for its objective methodology but draws some condemnation for narrowly focusing on raw research power, undermining humanities and quality of instruction.  - The Sundance Film Festival, a program of the Sundance Institute, is an American film festival that takes place annually in Park City, Utah. With 46,660 attendees in 2016, it is the largest independent film festival in the United States. Held in January in Park City, Salt Lake City, and Ogden, as well as at the Sundance Resort, the festival is a showcase for new work from American and international independent filmmakers. The festival comprises competitive sections for American and international dramatic and documentary films, both feature films and short films, and a group of out-of-competition sections, including NEXT, New Frontier, Spotlight, Midnight, Premieres and Documentary Premieres. The 2017 Sundance Film Festival took place from January 19 to January 29, 2017.  - Alfred Bernhard Nobel (21 October 1833  10 December 1896) was a Swedish chemist, engineer, inventor, businessman, and philanthropist.  - Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data.

Specifically, it is inquiring about the two cities that are central to the plot of Charles Dickens's novel, A Tale of Two Cities.  A Tale of Two Cities is an 1859 historical novel written by Charles Dickens, one of the most famous English authors. The novel is set against the backdrop of the French Revolution and focuses on the experiences and struggles of those living during that tumultuous time. The tale involves themes like love, sacrifice, resurrection, and the importance of choices. The two cities referenced in the title and at the heart of the story are London, England, and Paris, France. The novel initially presents the socio-economic contrast between London, a relatively stable and growing city, and Paris, a city in turmoil due to the rebellious fervor leading up to the French Revolution. Dickens masterfully weaves the story of his characters' lives through their different experiences in both cities, ultimately showing how the lives and fates of people in both cities become intertwined.

Going on holiday makes you feel good while you're there-you gain the health benefits for months, new research shows. Jetting off to exotic destinations such as the Maldives cuts your blood pressure, helps you sleep better and bounce back from stress, it found. The benefits last at least a fortnight longer than the vacation and can be felt for months in some cases where it is claimed. Experts say workers should always take their full holiday entitlement each year-as many as one in three don't-to get the benefits. The study compared key health markers in holidaymakers visiting Thailand, Peru or the Maldives, with people who stayed at home and continued working. The average blood pressure of those on holiday dropped by 6% while the workers saw their blood pressure rise by 2% over the same period. The sleep quality of holiday-makers improved by 17% while that of the non-holidaymakers _ by 14%. The study also found the ability of vacationers to recover from stress--known as the stress-resilience test-improved by 29%. There was a 71% fall in stress resilience scores among workers. Test showed a fall in blood glucose levels, reducing the risk of diabetes, trimmer waistlines and enhanced mood and energy levels, with the effects sustained for at least 2 weeks after returning home. The Holiday Health Experiment was conducted by tour operator Kuoni and Nuffield Health, the UK's largest healthcare charity. The answer is:","output":"According to the Holiday Health Experiment conducted by tour operator Kuoni and Nuffield Health, what benefits can be gained from going on holiday? A. Improved sleep quality and decreased stress resilience B. Increased blood glucose levels and blood pressure C. Trimmer waistlines, lower blood pressure, better sleep, and improved stress resilience D. No significant health benefits"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Kurtwood Smith plays Myron Castleman, an everyman stuck in a loop that forces him to constantly relive the same hour of his life over and over, being the only person aware of this. During one loop, he discovers that a scientist named Nathan Rosenbluth has predicted an event that matches his experience. Castleman calls him and explains what is going on, however, Rosenbluth is highly skeptical of his claims. Over the next loops, Myron struggles to get into contact with Rosenbluth again, and in the process becomes frustrated to the point of screaming at his secretary and throwing his suitcase into traffic. Eventually, he does manage to talk to Rosenbluth, who initially dismisses Myron as crazy until Myron describes the transition as the scientist had predicted (including the phrase \\"Consciousness is an independent variable,\\" which is central to Rosenbluth's theories). The professor sadly informs Castleman that there is nothing that can be done, causing Myron to become hysterical and shoot himself.

Given the following context:  The museum's founder Sigurður Hjartarson worked as a teacher and principal for 37 years, teaching history and Spanish at Reykjavík's Hamrahlid College for the last 26 years before his retirement. As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment. His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: \\"Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'\\" According to Sigurður, \\"Collecting penises is like collecting anything. You can never stop, you can never catch up, you can always get a new one, a better one.\\" The collection was at first housed in Sigurður's office at the college until he retired from his teaching job. He decided, more as a hobby than a job, to put it on public display in Reykjavík and was awarded a grant from the city council of ISK 200,000 to...  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person to whom acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing whale penises?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Breathing is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs. The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung.  Question: \\"What happens to the size of your chest when you relax your diaphragm muscle?\\" Answer: \\"Increases\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"No, the answer to the question is not correct. When you relax your diaphragm muscle, the size of your chest decreases. This is because the diaphragm muscle moves upwards and reduces the chest space when it relaxes, causing air to be pushed out of the lungs during exhalation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If an element is an alphabet, we convert it to its respective number by finding its position in the English alphabet. We can achieve this by using the following formula: For uppercase letters: ord(<letter>) - ord('A') + 1 For lowercase letters: ord(<letter>) - ord('a') + 1 The ord() function returns the Unicode code point of a character, and by subtracting the ord() value of the first letter in the alphabet ('A' for uppercase or 'a' for lowercase), we get the position of the character in the alphabet.

I loved it, wore it for years, and haven't had another one since it stopped ticking a decade ago. Why? Because I don't need one. I have a mobile phone and I'm always near someone with an iPod or something like that. All these devices tell the time--which is why, if you look around, you'll see lots of empty wrists; sales of watches to young adults have been going down since 2007. But while the wise have realized that they don't need them, others--apparently including some distinguished men of our time--are spending total fortunes on them. Brands such as Rolex, Patek Philippe and Breitling command shocking prices, up to PS250.000 for a piece. This is ridiculous. Expensive cars go faster than cheap cars. Expensive clothes hang better than cheap clothes. But these days all watches tell the time as well as all other watches. Expensive watches come with extra functions--but who needs them? How often do you dive to 300 metres into the sea or need to find your direction in the area around the South Pole? So why pay that much of five years' school fees for watches that allow you to do these things? If justice were done, the Swiss watch industry should have closed down when the Japanese discovered how to make accurate watches for a five-pound note. Instead the Swiss reinvented the watch, with the aid of millions of pounds' worth of advertising, as a message about the man wearing it. Rolexes are for those who spend their weekends climbing icy mountains; a Patek Philippe is for one from a rich or noble family; a Breitling suggests you like to pilot planes across the world. Watches are now classified as\\"investments\\" . A 1994 Philippe recently sold for nearly PS350, 000, while the 1960s Rolexes have gone from PS15, 000 to PS30, 000 plus in a year.

Usage: As per the requirement, we need to apply the mathematical operator (multiplication in this case) to the numbers extracted from the text (i.e., 17 (cost of each ticket) and 8 (number of tickets bought)). Hence, 17*8=136. Part #4: Report only the final numerical answer. Usage: The final numerical answer, after applying the mathematical operators to the numbers from the text, is 136.

The answer is:","output":"+Before you try getting pregnant, talk to your doctor about your wishes. They may check your health to ensure you are healthy enough to get pregnant. Explanation: This answer is correct because it mentions the important step of talking to your doctor about your wishes and ensuring that you are healthy enough to get pregnant. This is a more general and reasonable advice for anyone wishing to have a child. The other answers are incorrect because: 1. The first option mentions a \\"practice-based sperm transfer,\\" which is not a standard or medically recommended procedure. Also, the mention of turning a baby boy into a man who is hygienic is not relevant to the question. 2. The second option also talks about gender selection, which is not the focus of the question, and implies that choosing a different baby boy is a simple process, which is not accurate. 3. The fourth option is confusing and seems unrelated to the question. It talks about trying procedures on younger or older individuals, which is not relevant to having a baby boy.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: A study of a million UK women, published today in The Lancet, has shown that happiness itself has no direct effect on mortality, and that the widespread but mistaken belief that unhappiness and stress directly cause ill health came from studies that had simply confused cause and effect. Life-threatening poor health can cause unhappiness, and for this reason unhappiness is associated with increased mortality. In addition, smokers tend to be unhappier than non-smokers. However, after taking account of previous ill health, smoking, and other lifestyle and socio-economic factors, the investigators found that unhappiness itself was no longer associated with increased mortality. The lead author, Dr Bette Liu, now at the University of New South Wales, Australia said: \\"Illness makes you unhappy, but unhappiness itself doesn't make you ill. We found no direct effect of unhappiness or stress on mortality, even in a ten-year study of a million women.\\" As in other studies, unhappiness was associated with deprivation, smoking, lack of exercise, and not living with a partner. The strongest associations, however, were that the women who were already in poor health tended to say that they were unhappy, stressed, not in control, and not relaxed. The main analyses included 700 000 women, average age 59 years, and over the next 10 years these women were followed by electronic record linkage for mortality, during which time 30 000 of the women died. After allowing for any differences already present in health and lifestyle, the overall death rate among those who were unhappy was the same as the death rate among those who were generally happy. The study is so large that it rules out unhappiness being a direct cause of any material increase in overall mortality in women. This was true for overall mortality, for cancer mortality, and for heart disease mortality, and it was true for stress as well as for unhappiness.

Movie plot title: The Killing Movie plot: Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) is a veteran criminal planning one last heist before settling down and marrying Fay (Coleen Gray). He plans to steal 2 million from the money-counting room of a racetrack during a featured race. He assembles a team consisting of a corrupt cop (Ted de Corsia), a betting window teller (Elisha Cook Jr.) to gain access to the backroom, a sharpshooter (Timothy Carey) to shoot the favorite horse during the race to distract the crowd, a wrestler (Kola Kwariani) to provide another distraction by provoking a fight at the track bar, and a track bartender (Joe Sawyer). George Peatty, the teller, tells his wife Sherry (Marie Windsor) about the impending robbery. Sherry is bitter at George for not delivering on the promises of wealth he once made her, so George hopes telling her about the robbery will placate and impress her. Sherry does not believe him at first but, after learning that the robbery is real, enlists her lover Val Cannon (Vince Edwards) to steal the money from George and his associates. The heist is successful, although the sharpshooter is shot and killed by the police. The conspirators gather at the apartment where they are to meet Johnny and divide the money. Before Johnny arrives, Val appears and holds them up. A shootout ensues and a badly wounded George is the sole survivor. He goes home and shoots Sherry before dying. Johnny, on his way to the apartment, sees George staggering in the street and knows that something is wrong. He buys the biggest suitcase he can find to put the money in (and struggles to lock it properly). At the airport Johnny and Fay aren't allowed to take the suitcase along as hand luggage because of its size, and instead must check it in as regular luggage. Johnny reluctantly complies. While waiting to board their plane they watch as the suitcase falls off a cart onto the runway, breaks open, and the loose banknotes are swept away by the backdraft from the plane's propellers.

Jerusalem (CNN) -- Following an investigation, Israel apologized to Egypt this week over an August incident in which five Egyptian border guards were killed, the Israeli Ministry of Defense said. The apology, issued Tuesday, was overshadowed by news that a deal had been reached for the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who was captured by the Palestinian group Hamas more than five years ago. However, it was largely seen as an olive branch to the transitional Egyptian government, as relations between Israel and Egypt have become strained in recent months. On August 18, militants crossed into Israel from Egyptian territory to attack Israeli civilian targets. Eight Israeli citizens were killed in the attacks, which Israel has said were the work of a jihadist group based in Gaza. Responding to the attacks, Israeli troops killed five Egyptian border guards while in pursuit of the militants. But \\"based on the findings of the investigation, the defense minister decided to express his apology to OPTIONS: - CNN over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" - Egypt over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" - Egyptian over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" - Gaza over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" - Gilad Shalit over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" - Hamas over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" - Israel over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" - Israeli over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" - Jerusalem over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" - Ministry of Defense over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" - Netanyahu over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" - Palestinian over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" - Shalit over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\"","output":"Egypt over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" The correct answer is \\"Egypt\\" because the apology was being issued to the nation of Egypt for the deaths of their border guards caused by Israeli forces.

CNN, Jerusalem, Gilad Shalit, Ministry of Defense, and Netanyahu - These options are incorrect because they are not the affected parties to whom the apology should be addressed. The apology is meant for Egypt as a nation. 2. Egyptian and Israeli - These options are incorrect because the correct term to use is \\"Egypt\\" and not \\"Egyptian\\" or \\"Israeli.\\" \\"Egyptian\\" refers to an individual from Egypt, while \\"Israeli\\" refers to an individual from Israel. The apology should be addressed to the country, not individuals. 3. Gaza and Hamas - These options are incorrect because Gaza and Hamas are not the parties affected by the incident. The incident involved Egyptian border guards, not Palestinians or a Palestinian organization. The apology should be directed to Egypt. 4. Palestinian - This option is incorrect because the apology is being issued for the deaths of Egyptian border guards, not Palestinian individuals.

Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"In order to generate a detailed description of the given data, I will first clarify the terminology and context of each data point, then make connections and describe the significance of each value.  Step 1: Terminology clarification - 10 Hygiea: The fourth-largest asteroid in the solar system, located in the asteroid belt. - Escape velocity: The minimum speed needed for an object to break free from the gravitational attraction of a celestial body without further propulsion. - Apoapsis: The point in the orbit of a celestial body where it is furthest from its focus, usually the central body it is orbiting. Step 2: Describing and relating the data points 10 Hygiea has an escape velocity of 0.21 kilometres per second, which means that in order to break free from its gravitational attraction, an object must achieve a speed of 0.21 km/s. This escape velocity is relatively low compared to other bodies in the solar system, such as Earth (approx. 11.2 km/s), which can be attributed to 10 Hygiea's smaller mass and size. The apoapsis of 10 Hygiea is 523,951,582.33968 kilometres. This is the point in the asteroid's orbit around the Sun where it is the furthest away. By contrast, the distance from the Earth to the Sun, known as an astronomical unit (AU), is approximately 149.6 million kilometres, so 10 Hygiea's apoapsis is around 3.5 AU from the Sun. This distance, along with the asteroid's orbit, places 10 Hygiea within the asteroid belt, which is located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. In conclusion, the data provided describes some key characteristics of the asteroid 10 Hygiea. With an escape velocity of 0.21 km/s, an object requires lesser energy in comparison to Earth to break free from Hygiea's gravitational pull. Furthermore, the apoapsis of 10 Hygiea locates it within the asteroid belt by positioning it approximately 3.5 times farther away from the Sun than Earth's average distance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Plot: Isabella, a talented artist, has recently moved to a small coastal town with her single mother, Maria, and her younger brother, José. On the other side of town resides Phineas, a brilliant but socially awkward high school physics teacher who lives with his eccentric, inventor grandfather, Theodore. Both Isabella and Phineas share the dream of experiencing a life-changing adventure, a summer story worth remembering. Due to her mother's illness, Isabella takes up a part-time job as a lifeguard at the local beach. Meanwhile, Phineas spends his spare time working on wild and innovative experiments as a way to escape boredom. When Phineas accidentally stumbles upon Isabella's beautiful seaside murals that have been captivating the town's residents, he becomes enamored with the artist behind the vibrant and enchanting artwork. With his grandfather's help, Phineas device a plan to meet this mystery painter, which leads him to the beach one fateful afternoon. Isabella encounters Phineas in a comical sequence of events involving a runaway kite and a stray seagull. In the chaos, Isabella saves Phineas from his own experiment-gone-wrong. The pair form an unexpected connection as they bond over their shared longing for adventure and passion for creativity. Over the course of summer, Isabella and Phineas embark on a journey of self-discovery and grow closer together. Through a series of heartwarming adventures -- from a late-night beachside dance party to a daring boat race against the town bullies -- they find solace in one another's presence. The climax of the movie unfolds during the annual town festival. When Maria's condition worsens, Isabella is forced to make a difficult decision - either to pursue her art scholarship in Paris, which she recently learned she won, or stay by her mother's side. In a touching moment, Phineas selflessly helps Isabella see that her dreams can still come true even in the face of adversity. The movie reaches its resolution with Isabella leaving for Paris, but not before a romantic and heartfelt goodbye with Phineas at the airport. The scene culminates in a long-awaited kiss between the two, sealing their bond for a future reunion.

They suggest that a sixth member of the gang - nicknamed 'The Joker' - who did the planning, but sat out the robbery, doesn't deserve a cut. As the robbery goes on, the clowns begin to kill each other in order to get a larger cut, until a school bus crashes through the wall of the bank, killing another clown. A mob bank manager, who was himself shot with an automatic weapon after he tried to take out the clowns with a shotgun, tells the remaining clown that he doesn't know who he is dealing with.

In our everyday lives whenever we meet people, we always try to judge them in terms of their statuses. For example, we must judge whether the person in the library is a reader or a librarian, whether the telephone caller is a friend or a salesman and so on. Our statuses often vary with the people we meet, and change through life. Most of us can, at very high speed, assume  the different statuses that various situations require. Much of social communication consists of recognizing and selecting among proper statuses and allowing other people to assume their statuses in relation to us. This means that we fit our actions to those of other people, based on a constant mental process of assessment and understanding. Although some of us find the task more difficult than others, most of us perform _ rather easily. A status has been compared to ready-made clothes. Within certain limits the buyer can choose style and material. But an American is not free to choose the clothes of a Chinese peasant or that of a Hindu prince. We must choose from among the clothing presented by our society. Furthermore, our choice is limited to a size that will fit, as well as by our wallet. Having made a choice within these limits, we can have certain changes made. But apart from small adjustments, we tend to be limited to what the stores have on their shelves. Statuses too come ready-made, and the range of choice among them is limited.","output":"Which of the following statements best describes the concept of status in our everyday lives? A. Status is a fixed position that an individual holds in society and it remains unchanged throughout one's life. B. Status is determined solely by one's economic background and education. C. Status is a role assumed by individuals in different situations, allowing much flexibility and adaptation to various social contexts. D. Status only applies to certain cultures and has no influence in multi-cultural settings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. PepsiCo's Frito-Lay is putting some more pop in its Cracker Jacks.      A new line extension called \\"Cracker Jack 'd\\" will hit stores soon, including a caffeinated variety called Power Bites that is drawing criticism from a health-advocacy group that fears the snack might make little Johnny a bit too hyper.      \\"Boxes of Cracker Jack are famous for having a toy surprise inside. But what parent suspects that Cracker Jack might come with a surprising dose of a mildly addictive stimulant drug?\\" the Center for Science in the Public Interest said Wednesday. CSPI, known for taking on big brands for a variety of reasons, charges that the planned snack violates federal food rules. \\"Caffeine is generally recognized as safe only in cola-type beverages and only at concentrations of 0.02% or less (about 72 mg per 12 oz.),\\" the organization said in a letter to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.      A Frito-Lay spokesman told Ad Age that Power Bites will include \\"two flavors that will contain coffee, a natural source of caffeine, as an ingredient.\\" He added: \\"We stand by the safety of all products in the Cracker Jack 'd line, including those that contain coffee. It is worth pointing out the regulation referenced in CSPI's letter to FDA speaks to caffeine -- not coffee -- and is not an exhaustive list of the safe uses of caffeine in foods and beverages. Rather it represents one particular recognized safe use.\\"      While Frito-Lay is still finalizing the product, Power Bites are expected to \\"contain approximately 70 mg of caffeine from coffee in each 2 oz. package,\\" he said.      The line extension comes as Frito-Lay seeks to expand its lineup of premium and value brands -- which include Cracker Jacks -- to appeal to an increasingly bifurcated consumer group. The Jack 'd lineup will include \\"a variety of products, including snack mixes [and] popcorn clusters\\" in addition to the Power Bites, the Frito-Lay spokesman said.      The website nationwidecandy.com shows what potentially might be on the way.      In a letter to PepsiCo executives, CSPI said \\"caffeine is a mildly addictive stimulant drug that is totally inappropriate to be included in foods consumed by children,\\" noting that effects include \\"anxiety, restlessness, irritability, excitability and insomnia.\\"      The Frito-Lay spokesman said: \\"Cracker Jack 'd is a product line specifically developed for adult consumers and will not be marketed to children. All marketing for the products will be exclusively aimed at adult consumers, and the package design and appearance are wholly different from Cracker Jack to ensure there is no confusion among consumers. The presence of coffee and the caffeine that comes with it is clearly called out on both the front and back of the package.\\"      CSPI also took issue with Kraft Foods Group's new Mio \\"energy\\" drink flavoring product, which contains caffeine, as well as Jelly Belly's \\"Extreme Sport Beans.\\" Kraft markets Mio to young adults. Sport Beans target athletes.      \\"Unless the FDA begins enforcing its regulations, I fear that we'll see caffeine being added to ever-more improbable drinks and snacks, putting children, unsuspecting pregnant women, and others at risk,\\" CSPI executive director Michael Jacobson said in a statement. \\"How soon before we have caffeinated burgers, burritos or breakfast cereals?\\"      A Kraft spokesman said: \\"We have carefully reviewed FDA requirements and believe our product is in compliance with current regulations for food ingredients. FDA is currently evaluating caffeine and has explained that they do not object to caffeine use in other beverages beyond colas. The caffeine level in our product is comparable to what is naturally found in coffee and tea.\\" ||||| Who needs coffee in the morning when you can wake up with caffeinated Cracker Jacks?      It's no joke: PepsiCo's Frito-Lay is rolling out a new line extension appropriately called \\"Cracker Jack'd\\" that will include a caffeinated variety called Power Bites. One serving, according to its packaging, packs the same amount of caffeine as a single cup of coffee.      As one might imagine, the product is raising a few eyebrows. The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a food activist group, says on its website that it believes Power Bites violates FDA regulations and urges government regulators to take action:      \\"Unless the FDA begins enforcing its regulations, I fear that we'll see caffeine being added to ever-more improbable drinks and snacks, putting children, unsuspecting pregnant women, and others at risk,\\" said CSPI executive director Michael F. Jacobson. \\"How soon before we have caffeinated burgers, burritos, or breakfast cereals?\\"      Ad Age spoke with a Frito-Lay spokesman, who said that Power Bites will feature \\"two flavors that will contain coffee, a natural source of caffeine, as an ingredient.\\" The product is still in development, he said, but it's expected to contain about 70 mg of caffeine in each 2 oz. package. He also stressed that Power Bites are perfectly safe, and that it will be marketed at adult consumers, not children.      Still, one has to question the clearness of that message. After all, the original Cracker Jacks, which contain small toys hidden within, are traditionally considered children's snacks. It's easy to see how a child -- or a parent, for that matter -- could be easily confused. The Power Bites packaging even features the brand's iconic mascots, Sailor Jack and his dog, Bingo.      It's unclear when Cracker Jack'd products will be hitting shelves, but online candy distributor Nationwide Candy is already taking pre-orders online. According to the site, the first shipments will be made after December 22. Six bags of 2 oz. packages of \\"Cracker Jack'D Power Bites Cocoa Java\\" are being sold 11.22.      Fears over excessive levels of caffeine in some products have hit full tilt in recent months. On Wednesday, the FDA confirmed that caffeine supplement 5-Hour Energy may have been a contributing factor in the deaths of 13 people over the last four years.      Last December, a 14-year-old girl died of \\"cardiac arrythmia due to caffeine toxicity\\" after consuming two 24-ounce cans of Monster Energy Drink in one day. Her mother later discovered that the drink had been tied to five other deaths in past years. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"PepsiCo's Frito-Lay is creating a new version of Cracker Jacks called \\"Cracker Jack 'd.\\" This new version will have a caffeinated variety named Power Bites. Some people are worried that this snack might not be good for children, because it has caffeine in it, which can make them feel too energetic and have trouble sleeping. Frito-Lay says that Cracker Jack 'd is made for adults, and the packaging will clearly show that it has caffeine from coffee in it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hunt Sales said that EMI \\"kind of freaked out a little bit at the strident, single-less Tin Machine debut\\", which partially explained why Bowie switched music labels. In March 1991, the band signed to Victory Music, a new label launched by JVC and distributed worldwide by London Records and Polygram, and recorded more new material. This was combined with tracks from the Sydney sessions to form the Tin Machine II album. The album was described as \\"just as impure and twisted [as their first album], but more R&B and less abrasive.\\" Gabrels explained the change between the first and second album was because by the second album, \\"we knew one another as musicians. ... It wasn't as dense. And we actually left more room, I think for David to come up with some interesting melodies. There was more room for vocals on this record.\\"  In late 1991 Bowie reiterated that he was still happy being in the band during that time, stating \\"I'm content. ... I'm deriving a great deal of fulfillment from working with Tin Machine\\", and band-mate Gabrels agreed, saying \\"we're doing exactly what we wanted to do.\\" During press performances for songs on the album, Gabrels played his guitar with a vibrator and for a performance on BBC's \\"Top of the Pops\\", who banned the use of the vibrator, he mimed playing his guitar with a chocolate eclair.  From 5 October 1991 to 17 February 1992, the group undertook a larger tour, known as the It's My Life Tour. The band was joined on this tour by guitarist Eric Schermerhorn.
