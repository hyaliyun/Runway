Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: James Tavernier supplied the first of a series of lethal finishes against part-timers the Ibrox side only managed to beat once in five outings last season. Michael Chopra equalised, but a Martyn Waghorn penalty soon restored the lead. Jason Holt and Kenny Miller killed the game before half-time and the latter added his own second late on. The thumping victory took Rangers to the top of the Scottish Championship table. A mere two games have been played and they are only ahead of Queen of the South and Dumbarton on goal difference. But the signs are there that this Ibrox side could dominate the division in a similar fashion to the Hearts one that left their Glasgow rivals trailing in their wake last term. Under Ally McCoist, Kenny McDowall and Stuart McCall, Rangers had struggled to overcome Alloa and much was made of their dislike of the artificial surface at Recreation Park. Successor Warburton promised no excuses this time and there was no need for them as his restructured team quickly found their feet in the Clackmannanshire sunshine. Tavernier has been a revelation since his summer purchase from Wigan Athletic and the right-back provided another thundering finish into the top corner after being played in behind the defence by Nicky Law - the Englishman's third goal in four games. The lead only lasted three minutes as Chopra was found by a Graeme Holmes chip over the visiting defence to apply the kind of lethal volleyed finish that reminded onlookers of the 31-year-old striker's days with Newcastle United, Cardiff City, Sunderland and Ipswich Town. Thoughts turned to December, when Alloa came from two goals down to defeat Rangers in the Petrofac Training Cup semi-final. However, there was to be no sting in the tail for the Wasps this time as Holmes spoiled his earlier work by barging Holt to hand Waghorn the opportunity to restore the lead from the penalty spot within another two minutes. Lee Wallace had a quiet game in his first as Rangers' official new captain, but it was the left-back's low drive, spilled by goalkeeper Andy McNeil, that allowed Holt further involvement with a goal of his own from close range. When Tavernier found Miller to finish from similar range shortly before the break, the game was effectively over. The interval was time for Alloa boss Danny Lennon to switch to a less vulnerable formation, but the damage was done. Rangers were by now in second gear and could afford some showboating from the midweek arrival from Tottenham Hotspur, Nathan Oduwa. They also had two goals disallowed and still managed a further goal-line finish from Miller in the closing minutes. Warburton's side march on to bigger challenges while Lennon, whose side lie bottom without a point, was left to wonder how long it will take his 14 new signings to gel. Alloa manager Danny Lennon: \\"You could certainly see the gulf between the clubs today, but what the biggest message for the players today was that they've got to have more belief, they've earned the right to compete in this league but what we have to do is compete better than what we showed today.\\" Match ends, Alloa Athletic 1, Rangers 5.

However, I can provide a detailed response to the question. On July 7, 1942, Dwight D. Eisenhower, who would later become the 34th President of the United States, was promoted to the rank of Major General (two stars) in the United States Army. This promotion occurred during World War II when Eisenhower was serving in various leadership capacities. Before this promotion, Eisenhower had been rapidly climbing the military ranks due to his demonstrated skills in organization, planning, and leadership. In February 1942, he was appointed as the Chief of the War Plans Division in Washington, D.C., and was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General (one star). In this position, Eisenhower was responsible for restructuring and developing strategies for the United States' overall war effort. It was during this time that he impressed the Army Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall, with his abilities. In June 1942, Eisenhower was appointed as the Commanding General of the European Theater of Operations (ETOUSA) and was based in London. This corresponds to the information provided in the initial statement. However, it doesn't address his promotion to Major General on July 7, 1942. As the Commanding General of ETOUSA, Eisenhower was responsible for overseeing the planning and coordination of the Allied forces' campaigns in Western Europe, including Operation Torch (the Allied invasion of North Africa) and Operation Overlord (the Allied invasion of Normandy on D-Day). His leadership and organizational skills played a crucial role in the success of these campaigns and contributed to the eventual defeat of the Axis Powers. In conclusion, the correct answer is 'no,' as the statement provided does not address Eisenhower's promotion on July 7, 1942. The correct information is that he was promoted to the rank of Major General on that day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Select from the following.  (a). no;  (b). yes;","output":"(b). yes; Both questions are asking about the potential consequences or outcomes of a scenario where everyone on Earth adopts a vegetarian lifestyle.  If every person on Earth turns vegetarian, there would be several significant impacts on various aspects of society, the economy, health, and the environment. Some of these potential effects include: 1. Health: A widespread switch to vegetarianism could lead to a generally healthier world population. Vegetarian diets are often rich in antioxidants, fiber, vitamins, and minerals while being lower in saturated fats. This could result in a decrease in chronic illnesses such as heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes. However, people would also need to be mindful of potential nutrient deficiencies related to the lack of animal proteins, such as vitamin B12 and certain essential amino acids. 2. Environment: A global shift to vegetarianism would have a profound impact on the environment. Livestock farming contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water pollution. By reducing the demand for animal products, greenhouse gas emissions related to agriculture would be substantially decreased. Additionally, land, water, and energy resources that are currently allocated to livestock production could be diverted towards growing plant-based food, reforestation, or ecosystem restoration projects. 3. Economy: The economic landscape would undergo a paradigm shift due to the change in demand and consumption patterns. As people transition to a vegetarian diet, demand for plant-based food sources would increase, pushing up prices in the short term. Simultaneously, the demand for meat and other animal products would plummet, leading to potential job losses within the livestock farming sector. However, these short-term disruptions could give way to new opportunities, such as growth in the plant-based food industry, innovations in alternative protein sources, and investments in regenerative agriculture. 4. Animal Welfare: The widespread adoption of vegetarianism would lead to a substantial decline in the demand for meat and dairy products, resulting in fewer animals being raised and slaughtered for human consumption. This would dramatically improve animal welfare and potentially reduce the scale of factory farming operations, enabling better living conditions and ethical treatment for the remaining animals in agriculture. 5. Hunger and Food Security: In a vegetarian world, food production could potentially become more efficient. Currently, a significant portion of plant-based calories and proteins are fed to livestock, ultimately providing only a small fraction of those nutrients when consumed as meat. By growing plant-based foods directly for human consumption, more food would be available to address hunger and malnutrition in regions where it is most needed. It is essential to note that while turning to vegetarianism would have several benefits, the practical implementation and management of this global dietary conversion pose challenges in terms of adequate access, balanced nutrition, and adaptation to cultural and culinary practices. However, even a modest reduction in meat consumption, alongside improvements in sustainable farming and food distribution practices, could contribute significantly to addressing many global problems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(iv) they encountered the wrath of Poseidon.","output":"A person takes a dive under the sea and feels faint, with a dart stuck to them. What might have happened? Based on the given fact that \\"poisonous darts are used for defense by sea anemones,\\" the most likely answer to this question is (i) they encountered a cnidaria.  Sea anemones are a group of marine predatory animals classified under the phylum Cnidaria. They come in various shapes, sizes, and colors, and use specialized cells called cnidocytes to fire venomous darts or nematocysts at potential threats or prey. These darts contain toxins that can immobilize or even kill small marine creatures. While the toxins' effects on humans differ depending on the species, some sea anemones are known to cause pain, skin irritation, and in rare cases, more severe symptoms. In this scenario, the person diving underwater might have accidentally touched or come in close contact with a sea anemone, causing it to feel threatened and release its venomous darts as a defense mechanism. The dart sticking to the person's skin could have introduced the toxins into their body, leading to a feeling of faintness and potential further symptoms. Considering the other options provided, the following explanations could be offered: (ii) They must have startled a shark: While sharks can be dangerous to humans in some cases, they do not use darts for defense or attack. A shark would likely have bitten the diver, which would be a more significant and noticeable injury than a dart puncture. (iii) They came in contact with a whale: Whales are generally very gentle and do not pose a threat to humans. A whale might accidentally knock a diver with its tail or body but would not cause a dart puncture. Additionally, whales do not have any venomous darts as a part of their anatomy. (iv) They encountered the wrath of Poseidon: Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea, is a mythological figure and not a scientifically plausible explanation for the dart puncture. It is essential to focus on realistic and evidence-based reasoning in explaining such phenomena. In conclusion, option (i), \\"they encountered a cnidaria,\\" is the most plausible answer to the question, given that we know sea anemones employ poisonous darts as a form of protection. This would explain the person's feeling of faintness and the dart that they found stuck to their skin."},{"instruction":"The frenetic lifestyle that many people live today is very harmful.

The social media web site has earned a reputation for reconnecting old friends. Last week,a guy whom I hadn't seen since my bachelor  party five years ago sent me a friend request. I accepted and waited for \\"Easy E\\" to send me a  greeting of some kind. He had sought me out,after all.  I learned from his profile that he was in a relationship and had a son. However,I'm pretty sure we won't ever write wall--to--wall,let alone e--mail each other. But he'll remain  a friend of online until one of us makes a point of removing the other from his official list. My pool of friends consists of family members,college buddies,co--workers from past and  present,and friends of friends. There are 35 in all.

A person could make a mission out of reconnecting with childhood friends,former  classmates,distant cousins, and those one would like to get to know better. And some people  can even handle hundreds of on--screen relationships,keeping up with the daily happenings of  their small army of companions.

Lush was founded in 1987 by longtime friends Miki Berenyi (vocals, guitar) and Emma Anderson (guitar, vocals), who had met while studying at the same school. Miki Berenyi contributed not only her distinctive vocals but also a unique guitar sound to the band, which greatly influenced their signature style and helped establish them as an important part of the alternative rock scene. Lush released several successful albums, including \\"Scar\\" (1989), \\"Spooky\\" (1992), \\"Split\\" (1994), and \\"Lovelife\\" (1996).

Write a question about the following article: The Cambodian-Spanish War    was an attempt by the Spanish Empire to conquer Cambodia, establish their own king, and Christianize the population. Along with the Spanish, the Japanese, Filipinos, Thai, Portuguese, and Dominicans participated in the invasion of Cambodia. Each country possessed different motives for their invasion of Cambodia. Specifically, the Thai interference and the Spanish expedition was a result of a power struggle between rival factions in Cambodia's government. In addition, both Spanish and Portuguese took part in the invasion of Cambodia because King Philip II ruled both Spain and Portugal. In February 1593, Thai ruler Naresuen attacked Cambodia in order to fight the Burmese. Later on, in May 1593, 100,000 Thai  soldiers invaded Cambodia. As a result of the Thai's invasion, Lovek was conquered in July 1594. In 1593, the Spanish expedition led by Gregorio Vargas Machuca and Blas Ruiz de Hernan Gonzales entered Cambodia through the city of Manila.Although the Spanish invasion of Cambodia  failed, Ruiz and Veloso succeeded in establishing king Barom Reachea II in May 1597. Private individuals of Muslim Malays, Chams, Cambodians retaliated to Spain and Portugal's invasion by slaughtering the Spanish and Portuguese, including Diogo Veloso.

Icahn Unveils 9.3% Stake In Nuance, Voice-Recognition Firm Reportedly Behind Apple's Siri Nuance is thought to be ehind the technology Apple uses to power Siri - Image credit: AFP/Getty Images via @daylife Carl Icahn just won’t sit tight. In a filing released after market hours on Monday, the billionaire investor revealed a 9.3% passive stake in Nuance Communications, a voice-recognition company reportedly behind Apple’s Siri. Shares in the company surged in after-hours trading. Icahn has amassed a 29.3 million-share position in the company, worth more than 591 million at Monday’s closing price of 20.18. The stock closed the day flat. News of Icahn’s position came a couple of weeks after private equity shop Warburg Pincus disclosed a 14.6% stake. Nuance, which had a market capitalization of 6.4 billion by the end of the trading day on Monday, develops voice-recognition technology. Reportedly, Apple’s Siri is powered by Nuance’s software. Voice-recognition technology, which has been around for quite some time, could potentially revolutionize human interaction with gadgets and digital devices, as improved hardware and software pave the way for smoother conversations with machines. Under Marissa Mayer’s leadership, Yahoo recently acquired news app Summly for 30 million, which, according to 17-year-old founder and CEO, “uses a genetic algorithm to mimic how a human actually thinks.” With Google reportedly working on “intelligent computers [that] understand human language,” some like Upstart’s Michael del Castillo suggest the move to bridge the communication gap between people and their devices is here to stay. Icahn’s investment is the latest in a series of moves by the billionaire, who Forbes just dubbed the richest man on Wall Street. At 77, Icahn is at the top of his game, as my colleagues Nathan Vardi and Steve Bertoni explained in their latest cover story on the famed activist, Icahn Unleashed.

Article:","output":"Title: Helping Cows Stay Healthy by Removing Sick Ones Hello kids! Today, we are going to talk about something important happening in Somerset and Gloucestershire. These are two places in England where farmers have lots of cows, and we get our milk and other yummy things from them. But there's a problem: some of these cows have become sick with a disease called Tuberculosis (TB). This disease can spread very easily from one cow to another and it's not good for the cows or the farmers. So, the government decided to do something to stop the disease from spreading. They came up with an idea called a \\"cull\\". This means removing the sick cows from the healthy ones, so that they can protect the healthy cows and help them stay strong. But do you remember the big, fun event called the Olympics that happened a while ago? During that time, everybody was very busy, and there was another issue with some people not agreeing with the plan. This made it difficult for the government to start the cull and there was limited time left before winter came. You see, in winter, it's harder to separate sick cows from healthy ones because they all stay close together to keep warm. So, it was important for the government to act quickly. That's why a very important person named Owen Paterson, who works for the government and takes care of our environment, decided to do something. Instead of going to another important place called Paris, he went to a big building called the Commons to talk to other important people about the cull. Together, they will work on helping the cows in Somerset and Gloucestershire stay healthy and continue to give us the milk and other yummy foods we love.

This article: The Rokeby Venus (; also known as The Toilet of Venus, Venus at her Mirror, Venus and Cupid, or  La Venus del espejo) is a painting by Diego Velázquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age.  Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid. The painting is in the National Gallery, London. Numerous works, from the ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving female nude by Velázquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively by members of the Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display. contains an answer for the question: Who is often described as looking at herself on the mirror in the work?, what is it ?

CAST ASHORE.  WHEN Jack opened his eyes he lay for some time wondering where he was and what had become of him. There were stars in the sky overhead, but the light was stealing over it, and he felt that it was daybreak. There was a loud, dull, roaring sound in his ears--a sound he could not understand, for not even a breath of wind fanned his cheek. At last slowly the facts came to his mind. There had been a great storm, the vessel was among the breakers, he had got into the long-boat with Arthur to put in the plugs, they had been lifted up and blown away--and then suddenly Jack sat upright.  It was light enough for him to see that he was still in the boat, but its back was broken and its sides staved in. Around him was a mass of tangled foliage, and close beside him lay Arthur Hill, the blood slowly oozing from a terrible gash in his forehead. Jack leaned over and raised him, and loudly shouted his name in his ear. With a sigh Arthur opened his eyes.  \\"What is it, Jack?\\" he asked feebly.  \\"We are saved, old man. We have been blown right ashore in the boat, and we have both got shaken and hurt a bit; but, thank God, we are both alive.\\"  \\"Where are we?\\" Arthur asked, looking round.  \\"As far as I can see,\\" Jack replied, \\"we are in the middle of a grove of trees that have been blown down by the gale, and the leaves and branches have broken our fall, otherwise we must have been smashed up. We must have been lying here for the last ten hours. It was just about six o'clock when we struck, for I looked at the clock in the cabin the last time we were down there; and as the sun will be up before long, it must be getting on for five now.

Myself and Riah travelled, I would say all the way out too Wheelers Hill, but it’s really not that far away, unless you live on the North side, which we both do. Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire’s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire’s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne’s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were. Overall the experience was also, I have a lot of friends who are artists so I hope to do more artist portraits in the future.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Two competing countries used different energy sources to produce their electricity. Turkey used mostly fossil fuels, while Greece used nuclear power.  Which country used more coal? The answer to this question is:","output":"Turkey used more coal in its energy production, since it relied mostly on fossil fuels for generating electricity. Fossil fuels include coal, natural gas, and petroleum, and are the leading energy sources in many countries due to their high energy density and relatively low cost. Greece, on the other hand, primarily used nuclear power to generate electricity. Nuclear power is a type of low-carbon energy produced by splitting uranium atoms in a process called nuclear fission. This process releases a huge amount of heat, which is then used to generate steam that powers turbines to produce electricity. Nuclear power plants do not directly emit greenhouse gases, and they contribute significantly to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in countries that depend on them for energy. Although Turkey's primary source of energy for electricity generation is fossil fuels, it does not necessarily mean that the country uses only coal. Turkey also has significant natural gas reserves and has made efforts to diversify its energy sources by investing in renewable energy such as solar and wind power. However, coal remains an important energy source in Turkey, and its consumption has been increasing in recent years due to the country's rapid growth and increasing energy demand. In Greece, the majority of electricity is generated from nuclear power plants, which do not use coal as a fuel source. Greece has also invested in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Though Greece does have some fossil fuel-powered plants, its reliance on coal is significantly less than that of Turkey. In conclusion, Turkey has a higher coal consumption for electricity generation than Greece, due to its reliance on fossil fuels as the primary energy source, while Greece predominantly uses nuclear power for electricity generation. This reliance on fossil fuels increases Turkey's greenhouse gas emissions and poses environmental challenges, while Greece's investment in nuclear power and renewable energy sources contributes to a lower carbon footprint."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Total synovial membrane cellularity and synovial fluid concentration of C1,2C neoepitope-bearing collagen fragments 14 days after injury were primary end points and were compared between the ACLT, steroid, and intact groups. Cells were differentiated by histologic phenotype and counted, while RNA sequencing was used to quantify transcriptome-wide gene expression and monocyte, macrophage, and lymphocyte markers.', 'In the intact group, total cellularity was 13% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 9-16) and the C1,2C concentration was 0.24 μg/ml (95% CI 0.08-0.39). In the ACLT group, significant increases were observed in total cellularity (to 21% [95% CI 16-27]) and C1,2C concentration (to 0.49 μg/ml [95% CI 0.39-0.59]). Compared to values in the ACLT group, total cellularity in the steroid group was nonsignificantly decreased to 17% (95% CI 15-18) (Pu2009=u20090.26) and C1,2C concentration in the steroid group was significantly decreased to 0.29 μg/ml (95% CI 0.23-0.35) (Pu2009=u20090.04). A total of 255 protein-coding transcripts were differentially expressed between the ACLT group and the intact group. These genes mainly enriched pathways related to cellular immune response, proteolysis, and angiogenesis. Mononuclear leukocytes were the dominant cell type in cell-dense areas. MARCO, SOCS3, CCR1, IL4R, and MMP2 expression was significantly associated with C1,2C levels.

Or they may choose a name just because they like it. A website called Baby Center lists some unusual names given to American babies born last year. Some were named for characters in old stories, such as Hero, Thor and Ulysses. Other people named their babies after kinds of food, like actress Gwyneth Paltrow. She named her daughter Apple. Other people named their babies Banana, Pumpkin and Cookie. Still some babies were named for places. These included Brazil, India and Rome. Some parents used names of famous people from history such as Newton and Hannibal. Other parents named their babies after flowers or the weather. These babies were named Buttercup, Iris, Sunshine and Thunder. Recording artists and movie actors influence some parents' choices of names. Babies were named Beyonce, Charlize, Reda, Pierce, Shajira and Whitney. Movie actors themselves often give their babies unusual names. For example, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt named their baby daughter Shiloh. Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes named their little girl Suri. Some American parents do not want unusual names. They want their baby's name to honor their religious faith. Such names include Abraham for boys or Sarah for girls. And many people give their babies the same name as a family member or good friend.

Movie plot title: The Untouchables Movie plot: During Prohibition in 1930, Al Capone has nearly the whole city of Chicago under his control and supplies illegal liquor. Bureau of Prohibition agent Eliot Ness is assigned to stop Capone, but his first attempt at a liquor raid fails due to corrupt policemen tipping Capone off. He has a chance meeting with Irish-American veteran officer Jimmy Malone, who is fed up with the rampant corruption and offers to help Ness, suggesting that they find a man from the police academy who has not come under Capone's influence. They recruit Italian-American trainee George Stone (aka-Giuseppe Petri) for his superior marksmanship and intelligence. Joined by accountant Oscar Wallace, assigned to Ness from Washington, D.C., they conduct a successful raid on a Capone liquor cache and start to gain positive publicity, with the press dubbing them \\"The Untouchables.\\" Capone later kills the henchman in charge of the cache as a warning to his other men. Wallace discovers that Capone has not filed an income tax return for some years and suggests that the team try to build a tax evasion case against him, since he is well-insulated from his other crimes. An alderman offers Ness a bribe to drop his investigation, but Ness angrily refuses it and throws him out of the office. When Capone gunman Frank Nitti threatens Ness' family, Ness has his wife and daughter moved to a safe house. His team flies to the CanadaâUnited States border to intercept an incoming liquor shipment, aided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, killing several gangsters and capturing George, a Capone bookkeeper. Malone shoots a gangster through the mouth (not revealing the man is already dead) to scare George into agreeing to testify against Capone. Wallace prepares to escort George from the Chicago police station to a safe house, but they are shot and killed by Nitti, who has infiltrated the station. Ness confronts Capone and his men over the deaths, but Malone intervenes to save him from being killed and urges him to persuade the district attorney not to dismiss...

Considering this, Remy might want to take the following steps in order to address their situation and ensure they have enough money for rent: 1. Evaluate their current financial situation: Remy should begin by determining exactly how much money they have left and whether or not it is immediately sufficient to cover their rent. This will help them develop a clearer understanding of the measures they must take to remedy their financial dilemma. 2. Prioritize expenses: In order to avoid exacerbating their financial situation, Remy should prioritize their expenses moving forward. This involves identifying which expenditures are absolutely necessary (like rent, utilities, and food) and which can be postponed or eliminated (like dining out, entertainment, or non-essential purchases). 3. Develop a budget: Remy should create a budget that accounts for their necessary expenditures, including rent, and identifies areas where they can cut back on spending. This will provide them with a structured plan for managing their finances moving forward and help ensure they have enough money for rent. 4. Increase income: If Remy finds that their current income is not enough to cover their rent and other necessary expenses, they may want to consider finding ways to increase their income. This could involve taking on additional work, selling belongings they no longer need, or seeking assistance from friends or family members. 5. Communicate with their landlord: Remy should reach out to their landlord and explain the situation. They can request a temporary extension on their rent deadline or discuss the possibility of a partial payment now, with the remaining balance to be paid later. In many cases, landlords are understanding and willing to work with tenants who are facing financial challenges, as long as they are proactive and honest about their situation. 6. Create a long-term financial plan: To avoid encountering similar financial issues in the future, Remy should develop a solid long-term financial plan. This can involve setting financial goals, establishing an emergency fund, and prioritizing saving and debt repayment. By addressing their financial situation, Remy can work towards a more financially stable future. In conclusion, Remy will likely want to evaluate their current financial situation, prioritize expenses, develop a budget, explore ways to increase income, communicate with their landlord, and create a long-term financial plan.

Article: The sounds you make while chewing have a significant effect on the amount of food you eat, a new study has found. The results suggest that people are likely to consume less if they can hear themselves eating. Researchers at Brigham Young University and Colorado State University have found that your TV, radio, and computer are making you fat. Not by bombarding  you with food ads (though they totally are) but by blocking the sounds of your chewing. In a recent study, they found that the noise your food makes while you're eating can have a significant effect on how much food you eat. \\"Sound is typically labeled as the forgotten food sense,\\" adds Ryan Elder, assistant professor of marketing at BYU's Marriott School of Management. \\"But if people are more focused on the sound the food makes, it could reduce consumption.\\" \\"For the most part, consumers and researchers have overlooked food sound as an important sensory cue  in the eating experience.\\" said study coauthor Gina Mohr, an assistant professor of marketing at CSU. The team carried out three separate experiments to quantify the effects of \\"food sound salience\\" on quantity of food consumed during a meal. In one experiment, participants were given snacks to eat while they wore headphones playing either loud or quiet noises. The ones loud enough to mask the sound of chewing made subjects eat more -- 4 pretzels  compared to 2.75 pretzels for the \\"quiet\\" group. In another of their experiments they found that just having people hear chewing sounds through an advertisement can decrease the amount they eat. Elder and Morh call this the \\"Crunch Effect.\\" The main takeaway of their work should be the idea of mindfulness, they said. Being more mindful of not just the taste and physical appearance of food, but also of the sound it makes can help consumers to eat less. \\"When you mask the sound of consumption, like when you watch TV while eating, you take away one of those senses and it may cause you to eat more than you would normally,\\" Elder said. \\"The effects may not...

The album's next song, \\"Put on a Side\\", has a distinctive bassline and a cramped, repressive feel. Berger wrote that Kim Deal's \\"voice grinds sweetly, weariedly, sloppily inside your brain,\\" as she repeats twelve words over the course of the song: \\"Better I better I stayed up / Better mono, put on a side.\\"An earlier version of \\"Full on Idle\\", Title TK's eighth track, was released on the Amps' Pacer in 1995. In a 1997 interview, Deal expressed an interest in redoing multiple Amps songs, partially because she did not feel Pacer was well recorded. Bryant opined that both versions of \\"Full on Idle\\" sound almost the same, but The Village Voice's Jessica Grose wrote that the Breeders' rendition is noticeably slower. In Cibula's view, this version contains elements of country music, cumbia, and ska. The Guardian's Betty Clarke cited the line \\"Obey your colorist, bleach it all away\\" as an example of Title TK's amusing, off-center lyrics. On \\"Sinister Foxx\\", Deal repeatedly sings \\"Has anyone seen the iguana?\\" She has explained this as being a reference to buying marijuana: \\"Have you ever bought a bag of weed? You walk in, and the pot dealer's got an empty terrarium ... Every time I go to a pot dealer's house, there's no iguana.\\" Another line, \\"I'm in beer class every Thursday night\\", refers to the alcohol awareness classes that Richard Presley attended after being caught driving while drunk. Phares described the song as having a \\"sexy menace\\", and Berger compared the drum part to gunshots and door-knocking.Moores identified in \\"Forced to Drive\\" the \\"quiet-LOUD-quiet\\" dynamic...

The Watch Tower Society provides pre-formatted durable power of attorney documents prohibiting major blood components, in which members can specify which allowable fractions and treatments they will personally accept. Jehovah's Witnesses have established Hospital Liaison Committees as a cooperative arrangement between individual Jehovah's Witnesses and medical professionals and hospitals.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"AB is often considered the \\"universal donor\\" for plasma. The context provided centers around the blood transfusion practices and beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses. They do not accept whole blood transfusions due to their religious teachings but may accept certain blood plasma fractions based on individual discretion. The Watch Tower Society, the organizational body of Jehovah's Witnesses, has created documents that allow members to define their preferences regarding blood fractions and treatments during medical procedures. The mention of blood plasma fractions in this context points towards the broader subject of blood transfusions and the concept of a \\"universal donor.\\" In medical terms, a universal donor refers to a blood or plasma type that can be safely transfused into anyone regardless of their blood type. Blood types are determined by the presence of specific antigens on the surface of red blood cells and antibodies in plasma. For red blood cells, the universal donor is Type O negative blood. This blood type can be safely given to recipients with any blood type because it lacks A, B, and Rh antigens, which reduces the risk of a transfusion reaction. However, when it comes to plasma, being a universal donor means it can be combined with any blood type without conflict. AB plasma is considered the universal donor in this case, because it does not have anti-A or anti-B antibodies. As a result, it can be safely transfused to individuals with any blood type (A, B, AB, or O) without causing a negative immune reaction. Going back to the context of Jehovah's Witnesses, it is important to note that while AB plasma may be the universal donor for plasma transfusions, members of this faith still have the right to specify their preferences and restrictions concerning blood plasma fractions, potentially making even AB plasma ineligible for use in certain cases. In conclusion, AB is considered the universal donor for plasma transfusions, as it does not carry anti-A or anti-B antibodies, making it compatible with all blood types. However, within the context of Jehovah's Witnesses, it is essential to remember that members have the authority to determine their personal acceptance of specific blood plasma fractions and treatments in a medical setting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What part of the eye is enlarged in the animal that are not thought to have a good sense of taste?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The whale ear has specific adaptations to the marine environment. In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The melon size varies between species, the bigger the more dependent they are of it. A beaked whale for example has a small bulge sitting on top of its skull, whereas a sperm whale's head is filled up mainly with the melon.The whale eye is relatively small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, the eyes of a whale are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When belugas surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light, but they have far more rod cells than they do cone cells. Whales do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most whales have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a  tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue.  I am facing a new situation today: After the second world war Germany and France took two different policies in respect to taxation. After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would France have lower or higher labor supply? A:","output":"Using the knowledge acquired from the background article on the Laffer curve, one can infer that since France implemented a tax rate above the critical rate, it would likely have a lower labor supply. This is because, according to the Laffer curve theory, when tax rates are above the critical rate, a decrease in tax rates would lead to an increase in labor supply and ultimately an increase in government revenue. Since France has a higher tax rate in comparison to Germany, it would likely experience a lower labor supply due to the disincentive effect of higher taxes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Even after  Bin Laden's departure from the area, CIA officers hoped he might return, seeing the camp as a magnet that could draw him for as long as it was still set up. The military maintained readiness for another strike opportunity. On March 7, 1999, Clarke called a UAE official to express his concerns about possible associations between Emirati officials and  Bin Laden. Clarke later wrote in a memorandum of this conversation that the call had been approved at an interagency meeting and cleared with the CIA. When the former  Bin Laden unit chief found out about Clarke's call, he questioned CIA officials, who denied having given such a clearance. Imagery confirmed that less than a week after Clarke's phone call the camp was hurriedly dismantled, and the site was deserted. CIA officers, including Deputy Director for Operations Pavitt, were irate.\\" Mike\\" thought the dismantling of the camp erased a possible site for targeting  Bin Laden. The United Arab Emirates was becoming both a valued counterterrorism ally of the United States and a persistent counterterrorism problem. From 1999 through early 2001, the United States, and President Clinton personally, pressed the UAE, one of the Taliban's only travel and financial outlets to the outside world, to break off its ties and enforce sanctions, especially those relating to flights to and from Afghanistan. These efforts achieved little before 9/11. In July 1999, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hamdan bin Zayid threatened to break relations with the Taliban over  Bin Laden. The Taliban did not take him seriously, however. Bin Zayid later told an American diplomat that the UAE valued its relations with the Taliban because the Afghan radicals offered a counterbalance to \\"Iranian dangers\\" in the region, but he also noted that the UAE did not want to upset the United States.

Telltale's 'Game of Thrones' Promises Five Playable Characters, 2014 Start Date Information is starting to trickle out about Telltale’s upcoming game set in the Game of Thrones universe, which is necessary considering one piece of that information is that Telltale is promising a 2014 kick-off for at least the first episode. That’s sooner than many imagined, given that until this point we’ve known nearly nothing at all about the upcoming story game, but now that’s beginning to change just a bit. The latest piece of news is that Telltale is expanding on their “double protagonist” format of Tales from the Borderlands, and their Game of Thrones title will actually have five playable characters, all from the same family. “In Game of Thrones we’re taking that multi-protagonist design even further with five playable characters from the same family whose choices affect everyone in the family,” said senior vice president of publishing Steve Allison to IBTimes UK, “And that adds a whole new layer to things that we’re really excited about.” IGN speculates based on the three teasers for the game so far that it takes place during a relatively current time period on the show, where Stannis Baratheon is trying to quell the Bolton’s takeover of the north. The game will supposedly feature one of the forest clans/families affect by the conflict. This would line the game up just about where the show is right now, if not a little bit after, yet feature entirely new characters not seen in the books or the show. The announcement of five playable characters has led many fans to believe that there will be one playable character for each of the series’ five episodes, and what one does in one episode would affect all the others down the road. And obviously this format of five members of one family echoes the book’s central idea of following half a dozen Starks around in the narrative (until horrible things happen to all of them). The one character per episode idea seems logical, but in practice it would actually not echo the format of the book or the show all that well. To play as one character and then never return to them would be odd, and wouldn’t really allow the player to form a connection with them, unlike say, Lee from The Walking Dead or Bigby from The Wolf Among Us. Similarly, if one two-hour episode is broken up into the perspectives of two or three characters, that could also be a bit jarring given the limited time there is to work with. Perhaps since Telltale’s Game of Thrones license is so valuable, they might expand to either longer episodes or more of them, though we haven’t heard anything to that effect yet. Either way, it will be an interesting challenge working with five leads. Most games that are a lot longer than Telltale’s often have trouble splitting the narrative between even two characters, much less five. They’ll have to have a very tight script for this to work. The end of the year is quickly approaching, so expect more and more information about Telltale’s Game of Thrones to start pouring forth soon, including screenshots and actual video, hopefully. I’m excited to see what they do with the property, and they should be able to shake off the mediocrity of past Game of Thrones video game attempts.

An earthquake kills both men and devastates the city. In the aftermath, Jenny gives birth to a son, whom she names Dan. With financial help from crooked lawyer Steve Dutton, who himself came from the Tenderloin, she sets herself up in the vice trade, providing women on demand.

Kayla was a careless individual..","output":"Jessica gave a very good explanation about the math problem, but Kayla did not because Kayla was a careless individual. In this scenario, we can see that there is a clear difference between Jessica and Kayla's approach towards the math problem. Jessica seems to be more diligent on her explanation, showcasing an understanding of the material and a strong ability to relay that information to others. This likely stems from her dedication to her studies, practicing the material and asking questions when needed. It is also possible that Jessica has a natural intuition for math, allowing her to comprehend the problems quicker and more efficiently than her peers. Additionally, Jessica's communication skills may be on point, making her explanations clear and easy to follow. On the other hand, Kayla is described as a careless individual. This indicates that she lacks the attentiveness necessary to fully comprehend the math problem and provide a helpful explanation. This carelessness could manifest in a variety of ways, such as neglecting to study the material, not paying attention in class, or failing to work through the problem step by step. Consequently, her lack of focus and dedication to the subject results in a subpar understanding of the math problem and an inability to effectively explain it to others. Kayla's carelessness can result from a multitude of factors. It could be due to disinterest in the subject or a lack of self-confidence in her abilities. External factors, like distractions in her personal or home life, could also affect her ability to focus on her studies. It is crucial to address these underlying issues in order to help Kayla improve her attention to detail and overall performance in math. To assist Kayla in becoming less careless, it would be beneficial to establish a study plan that includes practicing math problems, seeking additional resources like tutoring, and participating actively in class discussions. Additionally, improving her organizational and time management skills can help her prioritize her studies and make the most of her study time. Cultivating a healthy relationship with the subject and fostering a growth mindset will also play a vital role in her progress. In conclusion, the sentence highlights a contrast between the approaches of Jessica and Kayla, with the latter's carelessness causing her to falter in effectively explaining the math problem. By addressing the root causes behind Kayla's carelessness and implementing strategies to improve her understanding and dedication to the subject, she can ultimately achieve better results and develop the ability to provide valuable explanations similar to Jessica."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What are the precise differences between the absolute and relative grading systems? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Pick your answer from:  1). no;  2). yes;","output":"2). yes Both questions are inquiring about the same information, which is the difference between absolute grading and relative grading systems in universities. Now, I will provide a detailed and long answer to explain the differences between the absolute and the relative grading systems. Absolute Grading: Absolute grading, also known as criterion-referenced grading, is a system where students are assessed based on a predefined set of standards or criteria. In an absolute grading system, each student's performance is compared against these established criteria rather than the performance of their peers. Grades are assigned based on how well the student meets or exceeds the specified standards. The absolute grading system has the following characteristics:  1. Clear standards: In this system, the university or professor establishes specific, measurable criteria that must be met for each grade level. 2. Individual performance: Students are evaluated individually, and their performance is not influenced by the performance of their classmates. 3. Consistency: The criteria for each grade level remain constant throughout the course or program, providing a consistent measurement of student performance. 4. Mastery: Absolute grading rewards students for mastering predetermined standards or learning objectives. Advantages of Absolute Grading: 1. Fairness: Since students are assessed based on their individual performance and not in comparison to their peers, it is considered fairer for students with diverse skill levels and backgrounds. 2. Clarity: Absolute grading provides clear expectations for students and allows them to understand what they need to achieve to receive a particular grade. 3. Encourages collaboration: Since students are not competing against each other for limited high grades, the absolute grading system fosters a cooperative learning environment, where students can work together and support each other. Relative Grading: Relative grading, also known as norm-referenced grading or curve grading, is a grading system where students are ranked based on their performance relative to their classmates or the entire class. In this system, grades are distributed based on the distribution of students' scores, usually following a bell curve or another predetermined distribution. The relative grading system has the following characteristics: 1. Comparison to peers: In this system, a student's performance is evaluated in comparison to the performance of their classmates, and grades are assigned based on the rank order of students' scores. 2. Flexible criteria: The criteria for each grade level may vary depending on the performance of the entire class, as the goal is to achieve a specific distribution of grades. 3. Competition: Relative grading creates a competitive environment, as students must compete against each other for higher grades. Advantages of Relative Grading: 1. Maintains standards: Relative grading can be used to maintain high academic standards by ensuring that only a certain percentage of students achieve top grades. 2. Adjusts for variation: Because the criteria for assigning grades can be adjusted based on the performance of the entire class, relative grading accommodates variations in the level of difficulty across different courses, instructors, or academic years. 3. Differentiates students: Relative grading enables universities to differentiate between high and low-performing students. This is particularly important in competitive fields or for students applying to graduate programs or jobs where the employers want to identify the top-performing candidates. In summary, the primary difference between absolute and relative grading systems is how student performance is assessed and graded. Absolute grading evaluates students based on their individual performance against predetermined criteria, whereas relative grading ranks students according to their performance in comparison to their peers. Each system has its own advantages and is suited for different educational contexts and purposes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Starring an unknown cast which seem likely to remain that way, this \\"film\\" is yet another cheap slasher flick which amazes me how this was released. I have no problem with horrors and slasher flicks in particular, in fact they are my favourites. But when they are done THIS BAD, it really does take the monkey and its no wonder the genre has such a hard time. The story is as clichéd and without imagination as possible with a bunch of people in a cabin out in the woods being slashed and hacked up by this zombie/ghost guy. Its not the story that sucks the most, its the atrocious acting and dialouge, home made directing quality and an awful soundtrack. Not to mention laughable effects and some incredibly lazy film making - these morons are outside in clear daylight yet we are meant to believe it's night??

Options:  A. demonstration  B. kitchen  C. furniture store  D. hallway  E. apartment The answer is:","output":"C. furniture store In line with common sense, the most appropriate place to get a table is from a furniture store. A furniture store stocks a broad range of furniture, which includes various types of tables. These could be dining tables, coffee tables, bedside tables, study tables, or any other type of table one might need. Here, customers have the freedom to choose from different styles, materials, sizes, and price ranges based on their individual preferences and needs. One might argue that you might find a table in a kitchen, hallway, or apartment, and this is indeed true. However, these are places where you would typically find a table already in use or presented as part of the interior decor. These are not places where tables are conventionally sourced or purchased from, especially when considered from the perspective of the original question which asks where you \\"get\\" a table, indicating the act of acquiring or purchasing. The first option provided, \\"demonstration,\\" is generally not an environment where one procures a table. It is rather an event where products, ideas, concepts, or skills are shown, explained, or put into practice. Though it's conceivable that a table could be exhibited in a demonstration, particularly if it has some novel design or function, it is usually not the primary source from where you could acquire a table. In conclusion, relying on common sense and understanding of where items like tables are usually procured from, the best answer would be a \\"furniture store\\".

Please answer the following question: Article: If you travel to a new exhibition at the San Francisco Conservatory of Flowers, you will have chances to see some meat-eating plants. Take bladderworts, a kind of such plant, for example. They appear so small and grow in a quiet pond. \\"But these are the fastest known killers of the plant kingdom, able to capture a small insect in 1/50 of a second using a trap door!\\" Once the trap door closes on the victim, the enzymes similar to those in the human stomach slowly digest the insert. When dinner is over, the plant opens the trap door and is ready to trap again. Meat-eating plants grow mostly in wet areas with soil that doesn't offer much food nutrition. In such conditions, these amazing plants have developed insect traps to get their nutritional needs over thousands of years. North America has more such plants than any other continents. Generally speaking, the traps may have attractive appearance to fool the eye, like pitcher plants, which get their name because they look like beautiful pitchers full of nectar . Hair-like growths along the pitcher walls ensure that nothing can escape, and the digestive enzymes can get to work. A tiny insect can be digested in a few hours, but a fly takes a couple of days. Some of these pitchers are large enough to hold 7.5 liters. Meat-eating plants only eat people in science fiction movies, but sometimes a bird or other small animals will discover that a pitcher plant isn't a good place to get a drink.

The shooting shook the area around 11 pm, which had been typically bustling with activity - home to shops, restaurants, the 24th Street Mission BART station, and frequented by locals and tourists alike. This unfortunate event reignites the discussions around gun control, public safety, and the role of law enforcement agents in American societies. Eyewitness Accounts According to several eyewitnesses who spoke to local reporters, occupants of two different cars engaged in an argument around the intersection of Mission and 24th. Matters escalated quickly, which eventually led to the gunfire. Those at the scene reported hearing multiple gunshots, with some accounts suggesting around five to six shots fired. Amidst the chaos, pedestrians scrambled to seek safety in various nearby establishments, fueling an atmosphere of panic and distress. The Victims The two victims, a 27-year-old male and a 21-year-old female, were both wounded during the incident. Onlookers provided initial assistance, while the victims were quickly transported to the hospital. The male victim suffered injuries in his arms and torso, and the female received injuries on her legs. While the injuries were non-life-threatening, the shocked victims remain under medical supervision as they recover from the traumatic experience. The families of the victims have asked for privacy while they navigate these difficult times. The Investigation Police officers promptly arrived at the scene and cordoned off the area. Early on, investigators identified bullet casings and shattered glass on the ground. Mission Street remained closed for hours, between 24th and 25th streets, as investigators procured more evidence, conducted interviews, and reviewed surveillance footage. The San Francisco police department is currently on the lookout for suspects and have asked the community to share any information that could lead to their apprehension. Crime Rate in San Francisco's Mission District Although several community-building initiatives and cultural activities have made the Mission District a vibrant neighborhood, violent incidents in the area are not uncommon. The rate of gun violence in the district has been a growing concern in recent years. Such violent incidents have had lasting impacts on the community's sense of security, forcefully reminding residents of the underbelly that exists within their much-beloved neighborhood. The Ongoing Debate This event further fuels the ongoing debate on gun violence in America. Critics of the current gun control legislation argue that it isn't enough to reduce the rates of gun-related incidents across the nation. They say that the lack of effective gun control policies in many American states can directly link to the violence that incessantly plagues many communities' safety. Moving Forward While the nation continues to grapple with the conundrum of gun violence, ensuring the safety and well-being of the Mission District community remains a priority. It is crucial to combine efforts from both citizens and the administrative bodies to bring forth a safer and more peaceful environment for everyone. In the days to come, the Mission District must move forward together in addressing the roots of gun-related crimes and pushing for stronger and more effective gun control reforms. Until such systemic changes are made, the residents of Mission Street and 24th, like many other communities, must continue to cope with the uncertainty of their safety in their own neighborhoods."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This phrase suggests that something (likely a story, plan, or project) has become stuck or stranded due to its confusing or overly complicated nature. The use of words like \\"aground,\\" \\"snared,\\" and \\"tangled\\" evoke a sense of frustration, confusion, and disappointment. These negative connotations imply that the subject in question has failed to move forward or succeed because of its own inherent complexity or disorganization.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis? OPT:  (A). yes  (B). it is not possible to tell  (C). no","output":"(C). no The premise does not entail the hypothesis. In the field of logic and reasoning, entailment is a term that refers to a relationship between two statements or propositions where if the first statement or proposition (the premise) is true, then the second one (the hypothesis) must also be true, regardless of the situation at hand. Looking at the given premise and hypothesis, Premise: \\"He _told_ you to do that.\\" Hypothesis: \\"He'd never tell you to do something like that.\\" If we accept the premise, which is \\"He _told_ you to do that\\", it directly states that \\"he\\" issued a directive or instruction for you to do something. This in regard signals that he has at some point impelled you to do something, whatever that might be. Now comparing this to the hypothesis: \\"He'd never tell you to do something like that.\\" This statement suggests the absolute non-existence of a situation where \\"he\\" would instruct you to do \\"something like that\\". It's presenting an absolute declaration that \\"he\\" hasn't and wouldn't instruct or order you to do a certain thing. If we assume that the premise is true, the hypothesis, under this circumstance, cannot be true. This is simply because if \\"He _told_ you to do that\\" is true, it directly contradicts the statement \\"He'd never tell you to do something like that\\". This contradiction signals that the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, which means that the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  Therefore, the answer is (C). no, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who married Montagu's daughter by his first marriage?  Hugh Hare (1606–1667) had inherited a large amount of money from his great-uncle Sir Nicholas Hare, Master of the Rolls. On the death of his father, his mother had remarried Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester, allowing the young Hugh Hare to rise rapidly in Court and social circles. He married Montagu's daughter by his first marriage and purchased the manor of Tottenham, including the Lordship House, in 1625, and was ennobled as Baron Coleraine shortly thereafter.As he was closely associated with the court of Charles I, Hare's fortunes went into decline during the English Civil War. His castle at Longford and his house in Totteridge were seized by Parliamentary forces, and returned upon the Restoration in a severe state of disrepair. Records of Tottenham from the period are now lost, and the ownership and condition of the Lordship House during the Commonwealth of England are unknown. Hugh Hare died at his home in Totteridge in 1667, having choked to death on a bone eating turkey while laughing and drinking, and was succeeded by his son Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was forced to turn down a song since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single? ?  Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it. It's a good vehicle, it saves having to go to a psychiatrist.\\"The opening theme is repeated throughout. The... The answer to this question is:","output":"Jones.

Claimed they removed the bombs fearing children would play with them.","output":"Title: Two Dorset Beachgoers Unveil Cold War Remnants, Carry Unexploded Bombs to Safety In a remarkable sequence of events captured on camera, Alan Barlow and Jason Kelly uncovered a piece of Cold War history on a tranquil Dorset beach and selflessly chose to remove potentially life-threatening unexploded shells, slung haphazardly across their shoulders. The shells believed to have been fired from a Chieftain tank, a prominent and powerful military vehicle during the Cold War, had remained dormant and hidden on the Dorset beach for decades. The reasons behind the tank firing exercises on the beach are unclear, but it highlights the extensive military activity that took place during that tumultuous time in our global history. Upon making this startling discovery, Barlow and Kelly took a moment to weigh the potential consequences of their find. Their unfathomable concern for the safety of others around them led them to the decision of carrying away the unexploded bombs by themselves, despite the evident risk involved. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) was quick to take action following the revelation, charging Barlow and Kelly with possession of a projectile. As law-abiding citizens, both individuals pleaded guilty to the charges brought against them. In a show of leniency, the court recognized their actions as well-intentioned and handed them a conditional discharge. In their defense, Barlow and Kelly claimed they removed the bombs out of fear that unsuspecting children could stumble upon the relics while playing on the beach, unaware of the inherent danger they possess. The decision to handle the treacherous devices themselves was driven by urgency and an earnest desire to protect the public. The incident has not only brought attention to the potential threats lurking in seemingly innocent and peaceful locations but also underscored the need for heightened public awareness and a more robust clearance strategy for unexploded ordnance. This episode serves as a crucial reminder of the importance of promptly informing the authorities when confronted with an emergency situation, rather than taking matters into one's own hands - no matter the courage and good intentions involved. In the face of life-altering consequences, Alan Barlow and Jason Kelly's selfless actions have saved an untold number of beachgoers from potential harm. Their story highlights the presence of historical remnants contaminating our environment, as well as the bravery of ordinary individuals who, when put to the test, take extraordinary measures to keep their communities safe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

All the \\"b\\" terms can be added: 39*b + 46*b + 173*b = (39 + 46 + 173) * b = 258 * b So, the equation can now be written as: 258*b -18312 = -3090 Step 2: Isolate the variable, b. To do this, we should add 18312 to both sides of the equation to move the constant term to the right side: 258*b = -3090 + 18312 Step 3: Calculate the value of the right side of the equation: -3090 + 18312 = 15222 So, our equation now becomes: 258*b = 15222 Step 4: Solve for b. To find the value of b, we will divide both sides of the equation by 258: b = 15222 / 258 Step 5: Calculate the value of b: b ≈ 58.992248 The solution for the equation 39*b + 46*b + 173*b - 18312 = -3090 is b ≈ 58.992248."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours.

The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak.

Primarily known for her work in Hindi films, she has also appeared in Tamil, Telugu, Bengali and English language films. One of the most popular and highest-paid actresses in India, Basu is the recipient of numerous accolades, including one Filmfare Award, among six nominations. Particularly known for her work in the thriller and horror film genres, she is frequently cited in the media as a sex symbol. Bipasha Basu was born on 7 January 1979 to a Bengali family in Delhi. Her father, Hirak, is a civil engineer, and her mother, Mamta, is a homemaker. She has one elder sister, Bidisha, and one younger sister, Vijayeta. According to Basu, her name means \\"dark deep desire\\", and is also a river's name. She added \\"Due to my dusky skin, I was considered ugly in my younger years.\\"  In Delhi, Basu lived at Pamposh Enclave, Nehru Place, till the age of eight and studied at Apeejay High School. Her family then shifted to Kolkata, where she attended Bhavan's Gangabux Kanoria Vidyamandir, located in Bidhannagar. In her school, Basu was appointed as the head girl and was fondly called 'Lady Goonda' due to her short and commanding personality. She remarked \\"As a child, I was a tomboy and I was pampered a lot, due to which I became very naughty. I used to keep a stick in my hand and straighten out all the colony boys if they acted smart. I used to be very short as a child and I was the monitor in school. When the tall boys would be up to mischief, I'd jump on their back during breaks and pull their hair and beat them up\\". Basu was enrolled in medical science studies until twelfth standard, but switched to commerce thereafter.  In 1996, Basu was spotted at a hotel in Kolkata by the model Mehr Jesia Rampal, who suggested she take up modelling. That year, she participated in and eventually won the Godrej Cinthol Supermodel Contest (organised by Ford), thereby representing India at Ford Models Supermodel of the World contest in Miami. She later appeared in the Calida commercial with her then-boyfriend Dino Morea, which was controversial for picturing them sultrily; she had some protesters outside her house after that.

Midwestern groups such as Pere Ubu and Devo drew inspiration from the region's derelict industrial environments, employing conceptual art techniques, musique concrète and unconventional verbal styles that would presage the post-punk movement by several years. A variety of subsequent groups, including New York-based Talking Heads and Boston-based Mission of Burma, combined elements of punk with art school sensibilities. In 1978, the former band began a series of collaborations with British ambient pioneer and ex-Roxy Music member Brian Eno, experimenting with Dada-influenced lyrical techniques, dance music, and African polyrhythms. San Francisco's vibrant post-punk scene was centered around such groups as Chrome, the Residents and Tuxedomoon, who incorporated multimedia experimentation, film and ideas from Antonin Artaud's Theater of Cruelty.

Fact 2: An ecosystem includes the organisms and their habitat.  Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"what does energy enter in the form of sunlight or chemical compounds?\\" with the following options:  - Generating heat  - volume  - colors of the spectrum  - organisms and their habitat  - density  - Transfers energy  - gravity  - it helps plants in growing The answer is:","output":"Transfers energy and it helps plants in growing.  Energy enters ecosystems in the form of sunlight or chemical compounds. Sunlight, which consists of various colors of the spectrum, is absorbed by plants through a process known as photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, a sugar that the plants can then use for energy and growth. This process generates oxygen as a byproduct and is essential to life on Earth. In addition to sunlight, some ecosystems also rely on chemical compounds as an energy source. For example, in deep-sea hydrothermal vents, specialized bacteria and other microorganisms can convert chemicals such as hydrogen sulfide into usable energy through a process called chemosynthesis. These microorganisms serve as the base of the food chain in these unique ecosystems, providing energy to a variety of other organisms. In both cases, the energy that enters the ecosystem in the form of sunlight or chemical compounds is transferred through the food web as organisms consume other organisms. This transfer of energy ultimately helps to sustain the life and growth of the various organisms within their habitat, which makes up the ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information:  - The River Severn (Welsh: \\"Afon Hafren\\", Latin: \\"Sabrina\\") is the longest river in the United Kingdom, at about . It rises at an altitude of on Plynlimon, close to the Ceredigion/Powys border near Llanidloes, in the Cambrian Mountains of mid Wales. It then flows through Shropshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire, with the county towns of Shrewsbury, Worcester and Gloucester on its banks. With an average discharge of at Apperley, Gloucestershire, the Severn is the greatest river in terms of water flow in England and Wales.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Abergavenny (archaically \\"Abergafenni\\" meaning \\"Mouth of the River Gavenny\\") is a market town in Monmouthshire, Wales. It is located west of Monmouth on the A40 and A465 roads, from the English border. Originally the site of a Roman fort, Gobannium, it became a medieval walled town within the Welsh marches. The town contains the remains of a medieval stone castle built soon after the Norman conquest of Wales. The town hosted the 2016 National Eisteddfod of Wales.  - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.  - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity.  - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean.  - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"-  arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\"  pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands.  - The tidal range is the vertical difference between the high tide and the succeeding low tide. Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effects of the gravitational forces exerted by the Moon and the Sun and the rotation of the Earth. The tidal range is not constant, but changes depending on where the sun and the moon are.  - Pen y Fan is the highest peak in south Wales, situated in the Brecon Beacons National Park. At above sea-level, it is also the highest British peak south of Cadair Idris in Snowdonia. The twin summits of Pen y Fan and Corn Du at 873 m (2,864 ft) were formerly referred to as Cadair Arthur or 'Arthur's Seat'.  - A high water mark is a point that represents the maximum rise of a body of water over land. Such a mark is often the result of a flood, but high water marks may reflect an all-time high, an annual high (highest level to which water rose that year) or the high point for some other division of time. Knowledge of the high water mark for an area is useful in managing the development of that area, particularly in making preparations for flood surges. High water marks from floods have been measured for planning purposes since at least as far back as the civilizations of ancient Egypt. It is a common practice to create a physical marker indicating one or more of the highest water marks for an area, usually with a line at the level to which the water rose, and a notation of the date on which this high water mark was set. This may be a free-standing flood level sign or other marker, or it may be affixed to a building or other structure that was standing at the time of the flood that set the mark.  - Yr Wyddfa commonly known as Snowdon in English, is the highest mountain in Wales, at an elevation of above sea level, and the highest point in the British Isles south of the Scottish Highlands. It is located in Snowdonia National Park (\\") in Gwynedd, and has been described as \\"probably the busiest mountain in Britain\\". It is designated as a national nature reserve for its rare flora and fauna.  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - Monmouthshire is a county in south east Wales. The name derives from the historic county of Monmouthshire of which it covers the eastern 60%. The largest town is Abergavenny. Other towns and large villages are Caldicot, Chepstow, Monmouth, Magor and Usk.  - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea.  - Egypt (; ', , \\"Kimi\\"), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation.  - The Severn Estuary is the estuary of the River Severn, the longest river in Great Britain. It is at the mouth of four major rivers, being the Severn, Wye, Usk and Avon, and other smaller rivers. Its high tidal range of about means that it has been at the centre of discussions in the UK regarding renewable energy.  - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around .  - Monmouth (; Welsh: \\"Trefynwy\\" meaning \\"town on the Monnow\\") is a traditional county town in Monmouthshire, Wales. It is situated where the River Monnow meets the River Wye, within of the border with England. The town is northeast of Cardiff, and west of London. It is within the Monmouthshire local authority, and the parliamentary constituency of Monmouth. According to the 2001 census, its population was 8,877, increasing to 10,508 at the 2011 census.  - South Wales is the region of Wales bordered by England and the Bristol Channel to the east and south, and Mid Wales and West Wales to the north and west. The most densely populated region in the southwest of the United Kingdom, it is home to around 2.2 million people. The region contains almost three-quarters of the population of Wales, including the capital city of Cardiff (population approximately 350,000), as well as Swansea and Newport, with populations approximately 240,000 and 150,000 respectively. The Brecon Beacons national park covers about a third of South Wales, containing Pen y Fan, the highest mountain south of Snowdonia.  - Cardiff is the capital and largest city in Wales and the eleventh-largest city in the United Kingdom. The city is the country's chief commercial centre, the base for most national cultural and sporting institutions, the Welsh national media, and the seat of the National Assembly for Wales. The unitary authority area's mid-2011 population was estimated to be 346,100, while the population of the Larger Urban Zone was estimated at 861,400 in 2009. The Cardiff metropolitan area makes up over a third of the total population of Wales, with a mid-2011 population estimate of about 1,100,000 people. Cardiff is a significant tourist centre and the most popular visitor destination in Wales with 18.3 million visitors in 2010. In 2011, Cardiff was ranked sixth in the world in National Geographic's alternative tourist destinations.  - The Brecon Beacons is a mountain range in South Wales. In a narrow sense, the name refers to the range of Old Red Sandstone peaks which lie to the south of Brecon. Sometimes referred to as \\"the central Beacons\\" they include South Wales' highest mountain, Pen y Fan. The range forms the central section of the Brecon Beacons National Park (\\"Parc Cenedlaethol Bannau Brycheiniog\\"), a designation which also encompasses ranges both to the east and the west of \\"the central Beacons\\". This much wider area is also commonly referred to as \\"the Brecon Beacons\\", and it includes the Black Mountains to the east as well as the similarly named but quite distinct Black Mountain to the west. The highest peaks include Fan Brycheiniog to the west and Pen y Fan in the central part. They share the same basic geology as the central range, and so exhibit many similar features, such the north-facing escarpment and glacial features such as lakes and cwms below the escarpment. They all fall within the border of the national park.  - West Wales is the western region of Wales.  Some definitions of West Wales include only Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire, which historically comprised the Welsh principality of \\"Deheubarth\\" and was called \\"South West Wales\\" in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS). Other definitions include Swansea and Neath Port Talbot but exclude Ceredigion. The \\"West Wales and the Valleys\\" NUTS area includes more westerly parts of North Wales. The preserved county of Dyfed covers what is generally considered to be West Wales, which, between 1974 and 1996, was also a county, with a county council and six district councils.  - Brecon, archaically known as Brecknock, is a market town and community in Powys, Mid Wales, with a population in 2001 of 7,901, increasing to 8,250 at the 2011 census. Historically it was the county town of Brecknockshire; although its role as such was eclipsed with the formation of the County of Powys, it remains an important local centre. Brecon is the third-largest town in Powys, after Newtown and Ystradgynlais. It lies north of the Brecon Beacons mountain range, but is just within the Brecon Beacons National Park.  - Denny Island ( grid reference ST459810 ) is a small rocky island of 0.24 hectares ( 0.6 acres ) , with scrub vegetation , in the Severn Estuary . Its rocky southern foreshore marks the boundary between England and Wales . Above high water mark , the island is reckoned administratively to Monmouthshire , South Wales . The island also marks the north - western limit of the City of Bristol 's water boundary in the Severn estuary . It is located approximately three miles north of Portishead , midway between Redwick in Wales and Avonmouth in England . It is surrounded by sandbanks known as the Welsh Grounds . Its foreshore area changes dramatically according to the state of the tide , because tides in the estuary and Bristol Channel are the second highest in the world , reaching 13.7 m ( 45 ft ) at the spring equinox . It is known as a nesting - place for gulls , cormorants and other seabirds , which are regularly seen and ringed there .  - Mid Wales (or simply \\"Y Canolbarth\\" \\"The Midlands\\") is the name given to the central region of Wales. The Mid Wales Regional Committee of the National Assembly for Wales covered the counties of Ceredigion and Powys and the area of Gwynedd that had previously been the district of Meirionydd. A similar definition is used by the BBC. The Wales Spatial Plan defines a region known as \\"Central Wales\\" which covers Ceredigion and Powys. If Mid Wales is classed as Ceredigion and Powys, the area would be 6,962 square kilometres (about the size of Cumbria).  - Chepstow is a town in Monmouthshire, Wales, adjoining the border with Gloucestershire, England. It is located on the River Wye, about above its confluence with the River Severn, and adjoining the western end of the Severn Bridge. It is east of Newport, north-west of Bristol and west of London.  - The Bristol Channel is a major inlet in the island of Great Britain, separating South Wales from Devon and Somerset in South West England.

The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - Lake Island is an island on the coast of the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is located between Mathieson Channel and Lady Trutch Passage, and is flanked by Dowager Island (to the northwest), Lady Douglas Island (to the west), and a long finger shaped peninsula of the Canadian mainland to the east. Ironically, Lake Island is not a lake island, as it is in an inlet of the Pacific Ocean, and lies only some 6 kilometres from the open sea.  - Continental Europe, also referred to as mainland Europe, or, by Europeans, simply the Continent, is the continuous continent of Europe, excluding surrounding islands.  - Usk is a small town in Monmouthshire, south-east Wales, situated northeast of Newport.  - Swansea, officially known as the City and County of Swansea (\\"\\"), is a coastal city and county in Wales. It is the second largest city in Wales after Cardiff, and the twenty-fifth largest city in the UK. Swansea lies within the historic county boundaries of Glamorgan and the ancient Welsh commote of Gyr. Situated on the sandy South West Wales coast, the county area includes the Gower Peninsula and the Lliw uplands. According to its local council, the City and County of Swansea had a population of 241,300 in 2014. The last official census stated that the city, metropolitan and urban areas combined concluded to be a total of 462,000 in 2011, making it the second most populous local authority area in Wales after Cardiff. During its 19th-century industrial heyday, Swansea was a key centre of the copper industry, earning the nickname 'Copperopolis'. Since 2011, Swansea has started to expand into a larger region known as the Swansea Bay City Region. After combining with other councils, it now includes Tenby and other parts of West Wales, its population including these areas an estimated 685,051. The chairman of the new region is Sir Terry Matthews.  - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City, both part of Metro Manila. Bounded by the South China Sea on the west, the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest, the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Vietnam to the west, Palau to the east and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south.  - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - Snowdonia is a mountainous region in north Wales and a national park of in area. It was the first to be designated of the three national parks in Wales, in 1951.  - The Isles of Scilly (or \\"\\") are an archipelago off the south western tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain. It is the southernmost location in England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most westerly in England.  - A cay (or ), also spelled caye or key, is a small, low-elevation, sandy island on the surface of a coral reef. Cays occur in tropical environments throughout the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans (including in the Caribbean and on the Great Barrier Reef and Belize Barrier Reef).  - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany.

Article: Avoid taking sides in any confrontations between your parents and your fiancé. This not only will make one side feel betrayed, but may make the situation even worse. The best thing you can do to diffuse the situation is to remain neutral and let both sides know that you care about them and respect their feelings.  You might say something like, “I know that there are difficult feelings on both sides. Let’s just all calm down and take a step back.” Don’t let yourself get dragged into an “It’s them or me” ultimatum; keep saying “I love each of you deeply and I know we can work this out, or at least learn to tolerate one another.” You may be tempted to give your fiancé the impression that your parents really like them. You might not want to let your parents even know that you’re engaged. The best thing to do when your parents dislike your fiancé is to be honest with everyone about what’s going on.  For example, you might have to tell your fiancé, “I know you really like my parents, but they don’t care for you very much. I hope that will change some as they get to know you.” Or, you might need to tell your parents,  “I know you don't like my fiancé, but we are in love and are planning to get married. I don't want this to come between us.” The truth will come out eventually, so it’s best to stay ahead of things and address problems before they fester. Your parents and your fiancé may never see completely eye-to-eye. However, they can reach a compromise that all of you can cope with. Sit down with your parents and your fiancé and try to work out a plan for how you all can interact and be a family together without any negativity.  For example, you might tell your parents, “I know you may never fully embrace Jamie.  But we’re going to all be a family soon no matter what, so we need to sit down and work out a way to manage our problems together.” In some cases, letting your parents get to know your fiancé better might help; in others, it may be best to limit contact to necessary, defined situations.

Write an article based on this \\"China's computer and smartphone giant, Lenovo, has reported a net loss of 714m (Â£469m) after being hit by restructuring costs.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Lenovo Reports 714m Net Loss Amidst Restructuring Costs: Impact and Future Outlook Introduction: China's computer and smartphone giant, Lenovo, has reported a net loss of 714m (£469m) after being hit by restructuring costs. This staggering sum indicates a significant challenge for the company as it grapples with increasing competition, a shifting market landscape, and the need to reinforce its position as one of the leading tech companies worldwide. In this article, we will take a closer look at what led to this mammoth loss, the impact this setback might have on the company, its stakeholders, and its future prospects, and how Lenovo plans to bounce back from this troubling financial report. Key Factors Leading to the Loss: 1. Higher Restructuring Costs: The primary factor driving this loss was the higher-than-anticipated restructuring costs. Lenovo has been in the process of revamping its business model, organizational structure, and supply chain management to better serve its evolving customer base and mitigate emerging market challenges. However, despite the anticipated benefits of such restructuring, the costs incurred so far have exceeded projections and placed a significant burden on Lenovo's financial health. 2. Sluggish Market Performance: Beyond restructuring costs, another factor that contributed to Lenovo's loss is the slowdown in the PC and smartphone markets. With competition intensifying and customers increasingly opting for other cutting-edge devices (such as tablets and wearables), Lenovo has struggled to keep pace with changing market dynamics and has seen its sales plummet. 3. Currency Fluctuations: The ongoing economic uncertainty and the fluctuations in global currency exchange rates have also taken a toll on Lenovo's financial performance. As a multinational company with a significant portion of its revenue generated from international markets, Lenovo is highly susceptible to currency-related swings. The current volatile global economic climate has only added to the company's woes, compounding its losses. Consequences of the Loss 1. Share Price Decline: As a direct result of this financial setback, Lenovo's share price has nosedived. This is a significant concern for the company's shareholders and could potentially deter future investors from putting their money behind the tech giant. 2. Loss of Market Confidence: Lenovo's slide into the red is bound to affect the market's confidence in the company. This could, in turn, impact Lenovo's ability to secure deals, build strategic partnerships, and attract talent - all crucial components to succeed in the competitive tech arena. 3. Resource Allocation: With reduced financial resources at its disposal, Lenovo might have to make tough choices when it comes to funding research and development initiatives, marketing campaigns, and other operational activities that help maintain its market position and drive growth. Lenovo's Future Outlook and Recovery Plan Despite the significant net loss and the associated challenges, Lenovo has a robust recovery plan in place. The company remains committed to its restructuring strategy, which it believes will yield long-term benefits. 1. Focus on High-Growth Areas: Lenovo plans to concentrate its efforts on high-growth areas, particularly in the mobile and data center markets. The company believes that doubling down on these sectors will help offset the slowdown in the PC and smartphone markets and position it for future success. 2. Streamlined Operations and Supply Chain: Lenovo's restructuring endeavors also include a renewed focus on streamlining operations and optimizing its supply chain. These efforts are aimed at improving productivity, reducing costs, and enhancing the company's capacity to better serve its customers. 3. Innovation and Diversification: To stay ahead in a competitive market, Lenovo is investing heavily in research and development to bring forth innovative products and technology solutions. Additionally, the company plans to diversify its product and services portfolio to cater to a broader customer base and mitigate business risks. Conclusion: Lenovo's 714m net loss is undoubtedly a significant setback for the company. The substantial restructuring costs, sluggish market performance, and currency fluctuations have all contributed to this downturn for the tech giant. However, Lenovo's recovery plan, which focuses on high-growth areas, streamlined operations, and product innovation, holds promise for the company's future. To regain its position as a leading computer and smartphone manufacturer, Lenovo will need to demonstrate resilience and agility in navigating the complex challenges it currently faces. The coming months and years will be pivotal in determining the company's trajectory, as it seeks to bounce back from this substantial financial loss and regain the confidence of its stakeholders."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article: In large first-year classes, there might not be anyone taking attendance, which means that you won’t get in trouble the same way you may have in high school. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t go to class, though, and some teachers will have an attendance policy. More importantly, skipping class means missing out on valuable learning. Don’t make your life more difficult by forcing yourself to cram come exam time. College is also expensive, and not going to class means that you are wasting a lot of your and/or your parents’ money—anywhere from 50 to 150 per one hour of class.  Do the readings, taking notes as you do so. You’ll retain much more if you read actively, and your notes will help you out a ton when exam time rolls around.  Participate if the class calls for it. Many college students hate or are afraid of speaking in front of groups, but you will get so much more out of your classes—and will enjoy them so much more—if you can get past this. Don’t be afraid of being wrong—your professor just wants you to try, and probably wasn’t asking a question with a “right” or “wrong” answer to being with. You should spend the same amount of time on your schoolwork as you would on a full-time job—at least forty hours a week. Bank on spending an average of two hours outside of class for every hour you spend in class. The balance will vary by subject (labs, for instance, will tilt more toward in-class time), but your library or dorm room is where a lot of the really hard work will take place. Some people plagiarize because they think they can get away with it; others do so because they honestly don’t know what it means. Either way, you are responsible, and you will get caught. Many schools have very harsh penalties for this behavior, including automatically failing the class and/or including a special note on your transcript.  Obvious plagiarism includes copying someone else's work and presenting it as your own and using someone else's words or ideas without citing her. Not using quotation marks around quotations is also plagiarism, as is giving inaccurate or incorrect information about a source. (It's especially bad if you fabricate a source.)  Bad paraphrasing is also plagiarism. A paraphrase condenses the \\"gist\\" of an idea into your own words. However, you may be plagiarizing if you retain most of the original's words, especially if you use the same basic sentence structure or the passages are substantially similar in length or style.  Academic dishonesty more generally can include asking people to help you when you have been told to do all your own work, working together on a project if collaboration hasn't been assigned, and paying others to do work for you. Dirty little secret: many professors sit at their desks during office hours, waiting and hoping for someone, anyone to stop by. They will appreciate you so much if you are that person. If you have a question, this is a great way to ask it because it will help your professor put a name to your face. But consider stopping by early in the semester just to say hi and introduce yourself. Be reasonable about your expectations. Your professors won't proofread papers for you or give you essay topics. However, they're usually very happy to talk about your ideas with you to help you figure them out. For many college students, texting comes more naturally than emailing, but you can't expect your professors to give you their cell phone numbers. If you want to stay on top of your academics, you will need to check your email regularly. This is where you will see announcements from your teachers, department, etc. If your courses use online course management, such as Blackboard, check these regularly too. Often, assignments and grades will only be posted here--if you don't check them regularly, you miss out. This goes for both the physical location and online databases. Your professors will assign a lot of these, especially at the beginning, but you will also need to learn how to do research on your own. Consider scheduling an orientation with a librarian, especially if you have never used a brick-and-mortar library before. You are sure not to be the only one, so don’t be embarrassed. Most libraries have reference librarians for specific areas, such as hard sciences, music, or English. If you have a big project, it's a good idea to ask for a consultation with the reference librarian in your subject. She stays up to date with all the latest research and can guide you to the best sources. No matter who you are, you will probably read things that you don’t agree with. This is intentional—your professors aim to assign readings from many different perspectives, so they are assigning things that they don’t agree with, either. You don’t have to agree with the writers who challenge your beliefs, but do try to figure out where they are coming from and what makes them tick—that’s probably part of why they were assigned, anyway. Colleges and universities will require that you fulfill a certain number of credits in several different areas: general education (possibly broken down by subject matter), classes for your major, and electives. Meet with your advisor regularly to make sure you are staying on track—otherwise you might find yourself having to pay for a summer session or an extra semester that you weren’t planning on. If you are an engineering major, take a literature course. Poets, try biology. (These are just examples.) Either way, you will be exposed to new people, new ideas, and perhaps a new subject that you didn’t know you were interested in. Employers are often more interested in candidates who can do a wide range of things, such as write a coherent sentence and analyze formulas, rather than people whose focus was so specialized that they can't handle the wide-ranging demands of the modern job market.","output":"This article highlights the importance of attending and actively participating in college classes as skipping classes can lead to missed learning opportunities and wasted money. Students should aim to spend around 40 hours a week on schoolwork and engage in active reading and note-taking to retain information better. It is crucial to avoid plagiarism and academic dishonesty, as strict penalties may apply. Building relationships with professors, checking emails, and learning how to navigate libraries make a significant difference in a student's college experience. Exposure to different perspectives through assigned readings helps expand their knowledge. Meeting with advisors regularly ensures students stay on track for graduation and exploring various subjects outside their major can provide a well-rounded education that may impress future employers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ten cars rigged with explosives blew up in predominantly Shiite Muslim areas in Baghdad on Sunday, killing dozens, police said.      Oct. 27, 2013 A crane lifts a burned car while residents inspect the site of a car bomb attack in the Sha’ab neighborhood of Baghdad. Ten cars rigged with explosives blew up in predominantly Shiite Muslim areas in Baghdad on Sunday, killing dozens, police said. Karim Kadim/AP      Nearly two years after the U.S. troop withdrawal, Iraq is in the midst of a deepening security crisis as an al-Qaeda affiliate wages a relentless campaign of attacks, sending the death toll soaring to its highest level since 2008.      In the latest violence, nine car bombs tore through markets and police checkpoints in Baghdad on Sunday, killing dozens of people.      The bloody campaign has virtually erased the security gains made in the past five years. More than 5,300 Iraqis have been killed this year.      Sunday’s attacks occurred just three days before Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki is scheduled to arrive in Washington, where he will take part in meetings at the White House and on Capitol Hill. At the top of his agenda is a request for more U.S. help in the fight against the al-Qaeda affiliate, whose scope has grown to encompass neighboring Syria as well.      “We need to increase the depth and width of our cooperation, to be more agile and reflect the seriousness of the situation in Iraq,” Iraq’s ambassador to Washington, Lukman Faily, said in a telephone interview. “In our discussions, we will highlight the urgent need for the approval and quick delivery of military sales.”      View Graphic A single month's death toll from violence in Iraq.      At least 40 people died Sunday in attacks on mostly Shiite neighborhoods in Baghdad, according to an Interior Ministry official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name. In addition, a suicide bomber plowed his car into a group of soldiers in the northern city of Mosul, killing 14, according to a local police official.      More than 600 people have been killed in Iraq this month, after extraordinary bloodshed left 880 dead in September.      The surge in violence is largely, though not exclusively, due to attacks by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, an outgrowth of al-Qaeda in Iraq. The group is trying to undermine the Iraqi state through a relentless campaign of car bombings, assaults on security forces and assassinations. ISIS has also carried out several jailbreaks, freeing militants whom American and Iraqi forces worked for years to capture.      Shattering of calm      Iraq once looked as though it could be stabilizing. After a horrific sectarian war engulfed the country in 2006 and 2007, the United States sent a surge of troops and began enlisting Sunni fighters to turn against al-Qaeda. When the U.S. military withdrew at the end of 2011, militant groups were on their heels and monthly civilian death tolls were in the dozens rather than the hundreds.      That period of relative safety lasted into 2012, but it began to unravel as Syria’s anti-government protest movement developed into a civil war fought along sectarian lines.      Many radical Sunni fighters in Iraq and Syria have now united under the banner of ISIS. The militants consider the two nations to be different fronts in a single war with an ambitious goal.      “They want a caliphate,” said Jessica Lewis, research director at the Institute for the Study of War, who has investigated the resurgence of al-Qaeda in Iraq. She was referring to the Islamic political system that ruled most Muslims after the death of the prophet Muhammad.      One of the group’s most important victories came in September 2012, when militants freed about 100 inmates from a prison in Tikrit. The infusion of manpower helped the organization intensify operations this past spring, Lewis said.      ISIS launched an even more devastating attack on the notorious Abu Ghraib prison on July 21, freeing more than 500 convicts who could bolster the group’s capabilities further in the coming months.      “My best estimate based on [the Tikrit] example is that we’re going to see another huge growth step in operational capability in the new year,” Lewis said.      Sectarian mistrust      The rise of ISIS has coincided with political dysfunction in Baghdad. During Iraq’s recent years of relative calm, Maliki has consolidated power in a way that has left many Sunnis feeling disenfranchised under the Shiite-­led government. Sunni leaders complain bitterly that he has used his control of Iraq’s security forces to sideline political opponents under the pretense of combating terrorism.      In the vast deserts of Anbar province in western Iraq, the government has deployed thousands of troops to patrol its nearly 400-mile-long boundary with Syria.      But the border has become largely theoretical, and militants have moved across it with ease. In the atmosphere of sectarian mistrust that pervades Iraq, the Shiite-­majority federal forces have not coordinated well with the province’s mainly Sunni tribes and local police, according to Anbar’s governor, Ahmed Khalaf al-Dulaimi.      Anbar has suffered at least seven major attacks in the past week, including assassinations of local political leaders, the siege of a government electricity office and assaults on checkpoints.      The largest operation was an Oct. 20 attempt to storm a police compound in the city of Fallujah that includes a prison. The assault by 25 men armed with guns and mortars was ultimately repulsed, according to a police official involved in the response, but the battle lasted five hours and left four police officers dead.      On the other side of the sectarian divide, Iraq’s various Shiite militias, some of which receive funding and strategic direction from Iran, appear to be stepping up operations. Public funerals throughout southern Iraq memorialize militia members who have died fighting for the regime in Syria, and there are growing signs that some militias are bringing the fight back to Iraq.      In the southern Shiite-      majority provinces of Basra and Dhi Qar, at least 12 members of the Sunni Sadoon tribe have been killed in recent weeks, according to a senior Basra police official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Dozens more members of the tribe in Dhi Qar have reported receiving death threats, and at least eight families have fled their homes, according to Haider Salman, a municipal council leader.      In Basra, the threats against Sunnis are so serious that Sheik Abdul Kareem al-Khazraji, who heads the government authority that administers Sunni religious sites, ordered mosques to close their doors because of the risk of attacks on large gatherings of worshipers.      “We are directing people to pray at home, to protect their lives,” Khazraji said.      To the north, militias have been active in Shiite-dominated pockets of Diyala province. Six Sunnis were killed in Muqdadiyah, according to a tribal leader in the area who identified himself as Sheik Abu Muhammad.      Such incidents are haunting for Iraqis who recall the violence of the last decade. The killing rose exponentially in 2006 when attacks on Shiite religious sites prompted militias to retaliate with campaigns of sectarian killing and intimidation.      The bloodshed this year has not reached those terrible peaks. But al-Qaeda’s leaders in Iraq again seem determined to use horrific violence to provoke retaliation by the government and Shiite militias. Sunday’s attacks targeted predominantly Shiite areas in Baghdad. In recent weeks, car bombs in Baghdad have targeted not only day laborers and markets, but also funerals and even a playground full of children.      As the death toll mounts, Iraq is approaching national elections in April. In past years, militants have typically stepped up attacks before elections in an attempt to intimidate voters and create an atmosphere of fear. The result has been beneficial for campaigns defined by sectarian and ethnic politics.      “Imagine Iraq as a ship in the middle of a storm,” Maliki said in a televised interview in early October, “and some of the cabin crew ask the captain to control the movement of the ship. How can he do this with all of the high waves?” ||||| A series of attacks including car bombings in Baghdad, an explosion at a market and a suicide assault in a northern city killed at least 66 people Sunday across Iraq, officials said, the latest in a wave of violence washing over the country.

Insurgents on Sunday unleashed a new... (Associated Press)      Coordinated bombings hit Iraq multiple times each month, feeding a spike in bloodshed that has killed more than 5,000 people since April. The local branch of al-Qaida often takes responsibility for the assaults, although there was no immediate claim for Sunday's blasts.      Sunday's attacks were the deadliest single-day series of assaults since Oct. 5, when 75 people were killed in violence.      Police officers said that the bombs in the capital, placed in parked cars and detonated over a half-hour period, targeted commercial areas and parking lots, killing 42 people.      The deadliest blasts struck in the southeastern Nahrwan district, where two car bombs exploded simultaneously, killing seven and wounding 15, authorities said. Two other explosions hit the northern Shaab and southern Abu Dashir neighborhoods, each killing six people, officials said. Other blasts hit the neighborhoods of Mashtal, Baladiyat and Ur in eastern Baghdad, the southwestern Bayaa district and the northern Sab al-Bor and Hurriyah districts.      Meanwhile, in the northern city of Mosul, a suicide bomber drove his explosives-laden car into a group of soldiers as they were sealing off a street leading to a bank where troops were receiving salaries, killing 14, a police officer said. At least 30 people were wounded, the officer said. Also in Mosul, police said gunmen shot dead two off-duty soldiers in a drive-by shooting.      The former insurgent stronghold of Mosul is located about 360 kilometers (225 miles) northwest of Baghdad.      In the afternoon, a bomb blast killed four people and wounded 11 inside an outdoor market in the Sunni town of Tarmiyah, 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Baghdad, authorities said.      Sunday night, police said mortar shells landed on homes in a Shiite district of Madain, a town just south of Baghdad, killing four people and wounding nine, officials said.      Such coordinated attacks are a favorite tactic of al-Qaida's local branch. It frequently targets civilians in markets, cafes and commercial streets in Shiite areas in an attempt to undermine confidence in the government, as well as members of the security forces. All of the car bombings Sunday in Baghdad struck Shiite neighborhoods.      In Mashtal in Baghdad, police and army forces sealed off the scene as ambulances rushed to pick up the wounded. Pools of blood covered the pavement. The force of the explosion damaged number of cars and shops. At one restaurant, the blast overturned wooden benches and left broken eggs scattered on the ground. In Shaab, a crane lifted away at least 12 charred cars as cleaners swept away debris.      Medical officials confirmed the casualty figures for all attacks. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to publicly release the information.      Violence has spiked in Iraq since April, when the pace of killing reached levels unseen since 2008. Today's attacks bring the death toll across the country this month to 545, according to an Associated Press count.      ___      Associated Press writer Sameer N.

Please answer the following question: Question: what is the function of the hard palate I found the following answer on Google: Also on the anterior portion of the roof of the hard palate is the Rugae which are the irregular ridges in the mucous membrane that help facilitate the movement of food backwards towards the pharynx. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is partially correct, as it mentions the role of the Rugae in the hard palate. However, the hard palate has other functions as well. The hard palate is the bony, anterior part of the roof of the mouth, which serves several purposes: 1. Separation: It separates the oral and nasal cavities, which allows you to breathe while eating and speaking. This is important for preventing food and liquids from entering the nasal cavity, which could cause choking or infection. 2. Speech: The hard palate plays an essential role in speech production, as it provides an immovable surface against which the tongue can press to help create certain sounds, such as \\"t\\" and \\"d.\\" 3. Mastication: The hard palate supports the upper teeth and helps in the process of chewing and breaking down food. The Rugae, the irregular ridges in the mucous membrane, also facilitate the movement of food towards the back of the mouth, as stated in the answer you found. In summary, the hard palate serves multiple functions in separating the oral and nasal cavities, enabling speech production, and aiding in the process of mastication."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Moralia (\\"Ethika\\"; loosely translated as \\"Morals\\" or \\"Matters relating to customs and mores\\") of the 1st-century Greek scholar Plutarch of Chaeronea is an eclectic collection of 78 essays and transcribed speeches. They provide insights into Roman and Greek life, but often are also timeless observations in their own right. Many generations of Europeans have read or imitated them, including Michel de Montaigne and the Renaissance Humanists and Enlightenment philosophers.  - The Alcmaeonidae or Alcmaeonids were a powerful noble family of ancient Athens, a branch of the Neleides who claimed descent from the mythological Alcmaeon, the great-grandson of Nestor.   - Alcibiades, son of Cleinias, from the deme of Scambonidae (Greek: , transliterated \\"Alkibiáds Kleiníou Skambníds\\"; c. 450  404 BC), was a prominent Athenian statesman, orator, and general. He was the last famous member of his mother's aristocratic family, the Alcmaeonidae, which fell from prominence after the Peloponnesian War. He played a major role in the second half of that conflict as a strategic advisor, military commander, and politician.  - Attica (or ; or ) is a historical region that encompasses the city of Athens, the capital of Greece. The historical region is centered on the Attic peninsula, which projects into the Aegean Sea. The modern administrative region of Attica is more extensive than the historical region and includes the Saronic Islands, Cythera, and the municipality of Troizinia on the Peloponnesian mainland. The history of Attica is tightly linked with that of Athens, which, from the classical period, was one of the most important cities in the ancient world.  - Nicias ( \\"Nikias\\"; c. 470 BC  413 BC), was an Athenian politician and general during the period of the Peloponnesian War. Nicias was a member of the Athenian aristocracy and had inherited a large fortune from his father, which was invested in the silver mines around Attica's Mt. Laurium. Following the death of Pericles in 429 BC, he became the principal rival of Cleon and the democrats in the struggle for the political leadership of the Athenian state. He was a moderate in his political views and opposed the aggressive imperialism of the democrats. His principal aim was to conclude a peace with Sparta as soon as it could be obtained on terms favourable to Athens.  - Phaeax ( Greek :  ) was an Athenian orator and statesman . The son of Erasistratus , his date of his birth is not known , but he was a contemporary of Nicias and Alcibiades . Plutarch ( Alcib . 13 ) says , that he and Nicias were the only rivals whom Alcibiades feared when he entered upon public life . In 422 BC , Phaeax , with two others , was sent as an ambassador to Italy and Sicily , to endeavor to persuade the Magna Graecian allies of the Athenians and the other Siceliotes to aid the Leontines against the Syracusans . He succeeded with Camarina and Agrigentum , but his failure at Gela led him to abandon the attempt as hopeless . On his way back he assisted the Athenian cause among the states of Italy . ( Thucyd . v. 4 , 5 . ) According to Theophrastus ( ap. Plut . ) it was Phaeax , and not Nicias , with whom Alcibiades united for the purpose of ostracizing Hyperbolus . Most authorities , however , are of the view that it was Nicias . ( Plut . l.c . Nic . 11 , Aristid . 7 . ) In the \`\` Lives of the Ten Orators '' ( Andoc . ) there is mention of a contest between Phaeax and Andocides , and a defence of the latter against the former . It is difficult to say exactly when this content took place . Andocides did not come into notice until after the affair of the mutilation of the Hermae . Phaeax was an engaging personality , but had no great abilities as a speaker . According to Eupolis ( ap. Plut . Alcib . 13 ) he was a fluent talker , but quite unable to speak . ( Comp . A. Gellius , N. A. i. 15 . ) Aristophanes gives a description of his style of speaking ( Equit . 1377 , etc. ) , from which it would seem that , on one occasion , he was brought to trial for some capital offence and acquitted . There has been a good deal of controversy regarding the speech against Alcibiades , commonly attributed to Andocides , which Taylor maintained to be prepared by Phaeax . Plutarch ( Alcib . 13 ) , according to the opinion of most editors , speaks of an oration against Alcibiades , as prepared by Phaeax . It seems...  - Plato (Greek: \\"Plátn\\", in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423  348/347 BCE) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire \\"œuvre\\" is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years.  - Plutarch (\\"Ploútarkhos\\", ; later named, upon becoming a Roman citizen, Lucius Mestrius Plutarchus; c. AD 46  AD 120) was a Greek biographer and essayist, known primarily for his \\"Parallel Lives\\" and \\"Moralia\\". He is classified as a Middle Platonist. Plutarch's surviving works were written in Greek, but intended for both Greek and Roman readers.  - Cleon (\\"Kleon\\", ; died 422 BCE) was an Athenian general during the Peloponnesian War. He was the first prominent representative of the commercial class in Athenian politics, although he was an aristocrat himself. His contemporaries Thucydides and Aristophanes represented him as a warmongering demagogue.  - The Peloponnesian War (431404 BC) was an ancient Greek war fought by Athens and its empire against the Peloponnesian League led by Sparta. Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases. In the first phase, the Archidamian War, Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica, while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire. This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC, with the signing of the Peace of Nicias. That treaty, however, was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese. In 415 BC, Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily; the attack failed disastrously, with the destruction of the entire force, in 413 BC. This ushered in the final phase of the war, generally referred to either as the Decelean War, or the Ionian War. In this phase, Sparta, now receiving support from Persia, supported rebellions in Athens' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia, undermining Athens' empire, and, eventually, depriving the city of naval supremacy. The destruction of Athens' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war, and Athens surrendered in the following year. Corinth and Thebes demanded that Athens should be destroyed and all its citizens should be enslaved, but Sparta refused.  - Laurium or Lavrio or Lavrion (before early 11th century BC:  \\"Thorikos\\"; from Middle Ages until 1908:  - \\"Ergastiria\\") is a town in southeastern part of Attica, Greece. It is the seat of the municipality of Lavreotiki. Laurium was famous in Classical antiquity for its silver mines, which was one of the chief sources of revenue of the Athenian state. The metallic silver was mainly used for coinage. The Archaeological Museum of Lavrion shows much of the story of these mines.   - In Ancient Greece, a deme or demos was a suburb of Athens or a subdivision of Attica, the region of Greece surrounding Athens. Demes as simple subdivisions of land in the countryside seem to have existed in the 6th century BC and earlier, but did not acquire particular significance until the reforms of Cleisthenes in 508 BC. In those reforms, enrollment in the citizen-lists of a deme became the requirement for citizenship; prior to that time, citizenship had been based on membership in a phratry, or family group. At this same time, demes were established in the city of Athens itself, where they had not previously existed; in all, at the end of Cleisthenes' reforms, Attica was divided into 139 demes to which one should add Berenikidai, established in 224/223 BC, Apollonieis (201/200 BC) and Antinoeis (126/127). The establishment of demes as the fundamental units of the state weakened the gene, or aristocratic family groups, that had dominated the phratries.  - Sparta (Doric Greek: ; Attic Greek: ) was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece. In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon, while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece.  - An essay is, generally, a piece of writing that gives the author's own argument  but the definition is vague, overlapping with those of an article, a pamphlet, and a short story. Essays have traditionally been sub-classified as formal and informal. Formal essays are characterized by \\"serious purpose, dignity, logical organization, length,\\" whereas the informal essay is characterized by \\"the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes and experiences, confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure, unconventionality or novelty of theme,\\" etc.  - Pericles (\\"Perikls\\", in Classical Attic; c. 495  429 BC) was a prominent and influential Greek statesman, orator and general of Athens during the Golden Agespecifically the time between the Persian and Peloponnesian wars. He was descended, through his mother, from the powerful and historically influential Alcmaeonid family.  - Cleinias, father of Alcibiades, brother of Axiochus, and member of the Alcmaeonidae family, was an Athenian who married Deinomache, the daughter of Megacles, and became the father of the famous Alcibiades. Plutarch tells us that he traced his family line back to Eurysaces, the son of Telamonian Ajax. He greatly distinguished himself in the Battle of Artemisium in 480 BC. Cleinias died at the Battle of Coronea in 447 BC.  - Plutarch's Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans, commonly called Parallel Lives or Plutarch's Lives, is a series of biographies of famous men, arranged in tandem to illuminate their common moral virtues or failings, probably written at the beginning of the second century AD. The surviving \\"Parallel Lives\\" (Greek:  , \\"Bíoi Parállloi\\") comprises twenty-three pairs of biographies, each pair consisting of one Greek and one Roman, as well as four unpaired, single lives. It is a work of considerable importance, not only as a source of information about the individuals described, but also about the times in which they lived.

Article:Spar, hosted by journalists Anton Berg and Martin Johnson and released via podcast platform Acast, has been examining the imprisonment of Kaj Linna for the last two years. Mr Linna was initially sentenced to life in prison in 2004 for murder and robbery. Robert Lindberg was killed in an attack in northern Sweden which also left his brother Sune injured. But a witness who had been involved in the initial trial appeared to undermine his own testimony while being interviewed for the podcast. After the episode was released, Mr Linna used the audio as part of his appeal, and a retrial was granted in December. The audio was also used in court proceedings during the retrial, which concluded at the end of May and found there had been insufficient evidence to convict Mr Linna. Mr Linna has now been released from prison and reunited with his family. In a statement, the Swedish Court of Appeal president Margareta Bergstrom said: \\"Our conclusion is that the evidence presented at trial is insufficient and therefore can not lead to a conviction.\\" \\"We're very happy and relieved. We are frankly impressed that a podcast could have this kind of impact,\\" Berg told the BBC. Acast co-founder Karl Rosander added: \\"It means so much because Kaj Linna has been in jail for 13 years. We actually helped free an innocent man, it's so amazing, and I'm happy for the journalists who wanted to look at the story.\\" The series looking at Mr Linna's case has released eight episodes so far, with each one attracting around 300,000 listeners, according to Berg. \\"We released the podcast in May 2015, and the retrial was granted by the Supreme Court in December 2016, so that process alone took a year and a half,\\" he explained. The retrial was granted partly due to the audio which had been gathered by Berg and Johnson during the production of the podcast. \\"We met with a man who was the main witness, and he came up with a different story to the one he put forward in the trial,\\" Berg said. \\"We had two different microphones in that interview, I was doing the main recording and Martin was sitting next to me and he had a stereo microphone which was there to record atmosphere. \\"The witness asked us to switch off the microphone at one point, which I did, and he started giving us details which he had not put forward in the trial. \\"When we got home, we found out that Martin's microphone had been on all the time. Then I called the man and said we had it, but strangely he said that he was fine with that and we could use the audio.\\" Mr Linna's fight for a retrial has been covered widely in the Swedish media since the audio came to light. \\"The Supreme Court listened to the interview with the witness, and when they did they made quite a fuss about this decision and they granted the retrial. They said that it was crucial, because there were things that the courts hadn't been told before,\\" Berg said. \\"The case had been built on the testimony of the man we spoke to, and after we interviewed him, he started giving us a new version of events. He was clearly not trustworthy or reliable.\\" He added: \\"I hope the police will now further investigate this crime, because it's a terrible thing that's happened. It's a murder and robbery, and now it's unsolved again.\\" It is the longest-served sentence to be followed by a retrial in Sweden's legal history.

His wife, Mrs. Sarah Reed, and their three children (John, Eliza and Georgiana) neglect and abuse Jane, for they resent Mr. Reed's preference for the little orphan in their midst.

Jane is blamed for the ensuing fight, and Mrs. Reed has two of the servants drag her off and lock her up in the red-room, the unused chamber where Mr. Reed had died. Still locked in that night, Jane sees a light and panics, thinking that her uncle's ghost has come. Her scream rouses the house, but Mrs. Reed just locks up Jane for longer.

The narrator is going to be traveling to France .","output":"Based on the given passage, the narrator mentions that their next adventure will take them across the Atlantic to the land of royalty and football. Considering the clues provided, such as crossing the Atlantic Ocean and mentioning royalty and football, let's analyze the given options: [A]. The United Kingdom: The narrator could be traveling to the United Kingdom as it is known for its royal family and football (soccer) culture. The UK is located across the Atlantic Ocean from North America, which aligns with the information provided in the passage. [B]. South Korea: Although South Korea has a football culture, it is not known for royalty and is not located across the Atlantic Ocean. Instead, it is in Asia, which makes this option less likely than [A]. [C]. Japan: Japan does have a royal family, but its football culture is not as well-known as that of other countries. Moreover, Japan is located in Asia, not across the Atlantic Ocean. Consequently, this option doesn't seem to match the details provided in the passage as well as [A]. [D]. France: France is known for its football culture and royal history. However, the country is situated across the English Channel from the UK and not across the Atlantic Ocean from North America. Although France could be a possibility, the clues provided in the passage align more closely with the United Kingdom than with France. Considering all the options and the information given in the passage, the most likely answer is: [A]. The narrator is going to be traveling to the United Kingdom."},{"instruction":"Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: Where would you find bleachers inside? Possible A: soccer, sporting event, pharmacy, gymnasium, seat with view  Why is \\"gymnasium\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","output":"\\"Bleachers\\" are typically associated with sports events as they are often used for additional seating for spectators. Inside a building, a gymnasium is a common place where sports events happen hence it is a sensible place to find bleachers. In contrast, places like a pharmacy or an abstract concept like a \\"seat with view\\" do not typically have bleachers, making \\"gymnasium\\" the answer aligned with human common sense."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There was not a single funny joke or line throughout. The slapstick wasn't even mildly funny. I mean really, an out of control vacuum sucking pipe? Why has the National Lampoon's name been attached to this movie? Even Christmas Vacation was better than this (I actually thought that film was very funny). AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!","output":"The sentiment expressed in this review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer provides several reasons for this unfavorable sentiment and does not mention any redeeming qualities of the movie. This suggests that they met their viewing experience with a significant amount of dissatisfaction and disappointment. The reviewer states, \\"Why did I waste my time with this movie?\\" This question exhibits frustration and regret, indicating that they feel their time would have been better spent doing something other than watching this movie. This line alone sets a very negative tone for the rest of the review.  The next part of the review states, \\"There was not a single funny joke or line throughout.\\" The reviewer is highlighting a key element of the film that they found disappointing. Since many movies, particularly those associated with the National Lampoon's brand, are largely dependent on humor, such a strong rejection of the comedic elements in the film further emphasizes the reviewer's negative sentiment. In the sentence, \\"The slapstick wasn't even mildly funny,\\" the reviewer further emphasizes their dissatisfaction with the humor in the film. They specify that even the slapstick - a common form of physical humor which usually provides at least some comedic relief - failed to amuse them. The phrase, \\"I mean really, an out of control vacuum sucking pipe?\\" comes across as sarcastic and disillusioned. The reviewer is mocking a specific scene, suggesting that they viewed it as a poor attempt at humor and a fail on the part of the filmmakers. They question the association of the movie with the National Lampoon's brand, insinuating that this film does not live up to the expectations set by other films under the same banner. By stating that even \\"Christmas Vacation,\\" — which they thought was a very funny film — was better, they further establish a comparison standard that this movie failed to meet. The verdict, \\"AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!\\" further solidifies and underlines the negative sentiment. This strong phrase indicates an extremely aversive reaction to the film, warning potential viewers to stay well away from it. Overall, the sentiment analysis of this review indicates a high degree of dissatisfaction and negativity towards the movie. The reviewer does not mention any positive aspects, expressing only disappointment, disillusion, and advising others to avoid the film entirely. This is a clear indication that the viewer perceived the movie as a poor piece of work that failed to entertain or amuse."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - Jazz fusion (also known as jazz-rock) is a musical genre that developed in the late 1960s when musicians combined aspects of jazz harmony and improvisation with styles such as funk, rock, rhythm and blues, and Latin jazz. During this time many jazz musicians began experimenting with electric instruments and amplified sound for the first time, as well as electronic effects and synthesizers. Many of the developments during the late 1960s and early 1970s have since become established elements of jazz fusion musical practice.  - Wazoo is a live album by Frank Zappa , posthumously released on October 30 , 2007 . It is a 2 - CD set consisting of the complete concert given by \`\` The Mothers of Invention / Hot Rats / Grand Wazoo '' 20 - piece big band on September 24 , 1972 at the Music Hall , Boston , Massachusetts , United States . It is the last concert of a brief series of shows that marked Zappa 's return to the stage after his forced temporary retirement from the touring scene due to the injuries he suffered from an assault during a concert at the Rainbow Theater in London on December 10 , 1971 . The material showcases Zappa 's endeavors into jazz - based music , and many of the compositions were featured on the 1972 studio albums The Grand Wazoo and Waka / Jawaka and on the 1978 studio album Studio Tan . Rehearsals leading to these albums and concerts are documented on Joe 's Domage ( 2004 ) , while Imaginary Diseases ( 2006 ) presents live recordings with a stripped - down version of the big band named \`\` Petite Wazoo . '' Wazoo is the third installment on the Vaulternative Records label that is dedicated to the posthumous release of complete Zappa concerts , following the releases of FZ : OZ ( 2002 ) and Buffalo ( 2007 ) . This is Official Release # 82 .  - An orchestra is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which features string instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass, as well as brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments, grouped in sections. Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, electronic instruments.  - Frank Vincent Zappa (December 21, 1940  December 4, 1993) was an American musician, composer, songwriter, producer, guitarist, actor, and filmmaker whose work is characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity, and satire of American culture. In a career spanning more than 30 years, Zappa composed rock, pop, jazz, jazz fusion, orchestral and \\"musique concrète\\" works, and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers. He is considered one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse rock musicians of his generation.  - The Mothers of Invention were an American rock band from California that served as the backing musicians for Frank Zappa. Their work is marked by the use of sonic experimentation, innovative album art, and elaborate live shows.  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - Musique concrète (meaning \\"concrete music\\") is a form of musique expérimentale (experimental music) that exploits acousmatic listening, meaning sound identities can often be intentionally obscured or appear unconnected to their source cause. It can feature sounds derived from recordings of musical instruments, the human voice, and the natural environment as well as those created using synthesizers and computer-based digital signal processing. Compositions in this idiom are not restricted to the normal musical rules of melody, harmony, rhythm, metre, and so on. Originally contrasted with \\"pure\\" \\"elektronische Musik\\" (based solely on the production and manipulation of electronically produced sounds rather than recorded sounds), the theoretical basis of \\"musique concrète\\" as a compositional practice was developed by Pierre Schaeffer, beginning in the early 1940s. From the late 1960s onward, and particularity in France, the term acousmatic music (musique acousmatique) started to used in reference to fixed media compositions that utilized both musique concrète based techniques and live sound spatialisation.

King Arthur is a legendary British leader who, according to medieval histories and romances, led the defence of Britain against Saxon invaders in the late 5th and early 6th centuries. The details of Arthur's story are mainly composed of folklore and literary invention, and his historical existence is debated and disputed by modern historians.

His character's role has been portrayed in various texts, including Geoffrey of Monmouth's \\"Historia Regum Britanniae\\" (History of the Kings of Britain) written in 1136. Step 2: Evaluate the role of Merlin in Arthurian legend. Merlin has been portrayed as a counselor, prophet, magician, and an advisor to King Arthur and other rulers in various works of literature and historical accounts. His magical powers, wisdom, and ability to foretell the future made him an invaluable and trusted figure in the court. Step 3: Identify Merlin's position in King Arthur's court.

Although he did not develop a real theory of temporal propositions, he did study the relationship between temporalis and the implication. Avicenna's work was further developed by Najm al-Dīn al-Qazwīnī al-Kātibī and became the dominant system of Islamic logic until modern times.

The hypothesis states that Tatyana Tolstaya is admonishing (criticizing or reprimanding) David Remnick for his writing style. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis. Based on the information provided in the premise, Tatyana Tolstaya is actually praising David Remnick for his writing style, not criticizing him. This directly contradicts the hypothesis.  Conclusion: It is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The premise indicates that Tolstaya appreciates Remnick's writing style, while the hypothesis claims that she admonishes him for it. These positions are incompatible and contradictory."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

He arrives at his new home, Heavenly Haven, which is embroiled in a vicious \\"block\\" war. Gangsters have set up their command post in his new apartment and have opened fire on their rivals in another building and on the street, 40 stories below.

Which entity is this text about? Gautam Gambhir ( pronunciation ; born 14 October 1981) is an Indian cricketer, who played all formats of the game. He is a left-handed opening batsman who plays domestic cricket for Delhi, and captained Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He made his One Day International (ODI) debut against Bangladesh in 2003, and played his first Test the following year against Australia. He captained the Indian team in six ODIs from late-2010 to late-2011 with India winning all six matches. Gambhir scored two successive double-hundreds in 2002 (one of them against the visiting Zimbabweans) made him a strong contender for India's opening slot in all three forms of the game. He made his ODI debut against Bangladesh in the TVS Cup in 2003. In his third match, he scored 71 and was named Man of the Match. His maiden century (103 off 97 balls) came against Sri Lanka in 2005. In 2004, he made his Test debut against Australia in the fourth and last Test match of the Border Gavaskar Trophy but did himself no favours by getting out for 3 and 1. He made amends in his second Test, however, scoring 96 against the South Africans. His maiden Test century came against Bangladesh in December 2004. Gambhir then made a number of starts in the home series against Pakistan in 2005, but was able to make only one half-century in six innings. He made 97 in Zimbabwe later that year, but failed to reach 30 against Sri Lanka at home, repeatedly struggling against Chaminda Vaas, and was subsequently dropped from the Test team. He was replaced in Tests by Wasim Jaffer, who made a double hundred and a hundred in seven Tests.  While Gambhir was out of the Test team, he played a number of One Day Internationals for India between 2005 and 2007. However, he was not selected for the 2007 World Cup as the selectors opted for a top-order of Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, and Sachin Tendulkar. It affected him badly and Gambhir later said that \\"When I got dropped for the World Cup, there were times I didn't want to play anymore. I didn't want to practise. I couldn't motivate myself.\\" With no other career options, Gambhir stuck with cricket. After India's first-round exit from the tournament, Gambhir was selected for the One Day International on India's 2007 tour of Bangladesh. Believing the series could be his last chance, Gambhir scored his second century on that tour and was subsequently selected for the One Day International on India's tour to Ireland in 2007. He scored an unbeaten 80 against Ireland in the first game of that tour and was awarded the man of the match award for that effort. In the post-match interview, he indicated that performing more consistently was a top priority for his career as he had done so in the past.  Gambhir was selected in India's squad for the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, which India went on to win in South Africa, beating Pakistan in the final. Gambhir performed well in the shortest form of the game, ending the tournament as India's top run scorer, with 227 at an average of 37.83, including three half-centuries which included a crucial 75 runs off 54 balls against Pakistan in the final.

Jacob says that he finds it amusing she is farsighted because he himself is nearsighted. They both laugh at the opposite nature of their eye condition, and then both look at the menu on the other side of the room to decide what drinks to order next.  Which person will not have convex lenses in their glasses? Answer:","output":"Jacob will not have convex lenses in his glasses.  Kathy is farsighted, which means she has difficulty focusing on nearby objects but can see distant objects clearly. This condition is also known as hyperopia. Convex lenses are used to correct farsightedness by bending the light that enters the eye in such a way that it focuses correctly on the retina. On the other hand, Jacob is nearsighted, which means he can see nearby objects clearly but has difficulty focusing on distant objects. This condition is also known as myopia. Concave lenses are used to correct nearsightedness by diverging the light before it enters the eye, helping it to focus appropriately on the retina.

They brought the female around to breathing, while I cried, thinking that she was dead. The twins were rushed to the NICU, too tiny to breast feed except with pumped milk through a feeding tube. Both were watched closely by doctors and nurses as they were not passing waste properly. The day it was decided that the male needed surgery, the female was discharged to home. The male was transferred to another very good hospital for surgery for a temporary colostomy. He was discharged to home after a week. What broke my heart was that I was allowed to visit him in the hospital but his older brother and twin sister were not allowed. Prior to his discharge, the staff instructed me in changing and maintaining his colostomy bag on a daily basis.

Dealership mechanic Shep Proudfoot (Steve Reevis), an ex-convict, refers him to an old partner in crime, Gaear Grimsrud (Stormare). Jerry travels to Fargo, North Dakota, where he hires Gaear and Carl Showalter (Buscemi) to kidnap his wife, Jean (Kristin RudrÃ¼d), and extort a ransom from his wealthy father-in-law and boss, Wade Gustafson (Presnell). He gives the men a new car from his dealership's lot, and promises to split the 80,000 ransom with them.

Having brought home to Athens the Olympic victor's laurel crown, Phillippides becomes commander of the Sacred Guard, which is expected to defend the city-state's liberty, a year after the expulsion of the tyrant Hippias. Athenian supporters of Hippias conspire, hoping to sideline Phillippides with a marriage to Theocrites' expensive servant Charis, and thus neutralize the guard.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a news article: Mr. Vidal loved conspiracy theories of all sorts, especially the ones he imagined himself at the center of, and he was a famous feuder; he engaged in celebrated on-screen wrangles with Mailer, Capote and William F. Buckley Jr. Mr. Vidal did not lightly suffer fools — a category that for him comprised a vast swath of humanity, elected officials particularly — and he was not a sentimentalist or a romantic. “Love is not my bag,” he said.      By the time he was 25, he had already had more than 1,000 sexual encounters with both men and women, he boasted in his memoir “Palimpsest.” Mr. Vidal tended toward what he called “same-sex sex,” but frequently declared that human beings were inherently bisexual, and that labels like gay (a term he disliked) or straight were arbitrary and unhelpful. For 53 years, he had a live-in companion, Howard Austen, a former advertising executive, but the secret of their relationship, he often said, was that they did not sleep together.      Mr. Vidal sometimes claimed to be a populist — in theory, anyway — but he was not convincing as one. Both by temperament and by birth he was an aristocrat.      A Child on the Senate Floor      Eugene Luther Gore Vidal Jr. was born on Oct. 3, 1925, at the United States Military Academy at West Point, where his father, Eugene, had been an All-American football player and a track star and had returned as a flying instructor and assistant football coach. An aviation pioneer, Eugene Vidal Sr. went on to found three airlines, including one that became T.W.A. He was director of the Bureau of Air Commerce under President Franklin D. Roosevelt . Mr. Vidal’s mother, Nina, was an actress and socialite and the daughter of Thomas Pryor Gore, a Democratic senator from Oklahoma .      Mr. Vidal, who once said he had grown up in “the House of Atreus,” detested his mother, whom he frequently described as a bullying, self-pitying alcoholic. She and Mr. Vidal’s father divorced in 1935, and she married Hugh D. Auchincloss, the stepfather of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis — a connection that Mr. Vidal never tired of bringing up.      After her remarriage, Mr. Vidal lived with his mother at Merrywood, the Auchincloss family estate in Virginia , but his fondest memories were of the years the family spent at his maternal grandfather’s sprawling home in the Rock Creek Park neighborhood of Washington. He loved to read to his grandfather, who was blind, and sometimes accompanied him onto the Senate floor. Mr. Vidal’s lifelong interest in politics began to stir back then, and from his grandfather, an America Firster, he probably also inherited his unwavering isolationist beliefs.      Mr. Vidal attended St. Albans School in Washington, where he lopped off his Christian names and became simply Gore Vidal, which he considered more literary-sounding. Though he shunned sports himself, he formed an intense romantic and sexual friendship — the most important of his life, he later said — with Jimmie Trimble, one of the school’s best athletes.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Trimble was his “ideal brother,” his “other half,” Mr. Vidal said, the only person with whom he ever felt wholeness. Jimmie’s premature death at Iwo Jima in World War II at once sealed off their relationship in a glow of A. E. Housman-like early perfection, and seemingly made it impossible for Mr. Vidal ever to feel the same way about anyone else.      After leaving St. Albans in 1939, Mr. Vidal spent a year at the Los Alamos Ranch School in New Mexico before enrolling at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire . He contributed stories and poems to the Exeter literary magazine, but he was an indifferent student who excelled mostly at debating. A classmate, the writer John Knowles, later used him as the model for Brinker Hadley, the know-it-all conspiracy theorist in “A Separate Peace,” his Exeter-based novel.      Mr. Vidal graduated from Exeter at 17 — only by cheating on virtually every math exam, he later admitted — and enlisted in the Army, becoming first mate on a freight supply ship in the Aleutian Islands. He began work on “Williwaw,” a novel set on a troopship and published in 1946, while he was an associate editor at the publishing company E. P. Dutton, a job he soon gave up. Written in a pared-down, Hemingway-like style, “Williwaw” (the title is a meteorological term for a sudden wind out of the mountains) won some admiring reviews but gave little clue to the kind of writer Mr. Vidal would become. Neither did his second book, “In a Yellow Wood” (1947), about a brokerage clerk and his wartime Italian mistress. Mr. Vidal later said it was so bad, he couldn’t bear to reread it. He nevertheless became a glamorous young literary figure, pursued by Anaïs Nin and courted by Christopher Isherwood and Tennessee Williams .      In 1948 Mr. Vidal published “ The City and the Pillar,” which was dedicated to J. T. (Jimmie Trimble). It is what would now be called a coming-out story, about a handsome, athletic young Virginia man who gradually discovers that he is homosexual. By today’s standards it is tame and discreet, but at the time it caused a scandal and was denounced as corrupt and pornographic. Mr. Vidal later claimed that the literary and critical establishment, The New York Times especially, had blacklisted him because of the book, and he may have been right. He had such trouble getting subsequent novels reviewed that he turned to writing mysteries under the pseudonym Edgar Box and then, for a time, gave up novel-writing altogether. To make a living he concentrated on writing for television, then for the stage and the movies.      Politics Onstage, and for Real      Work was plentiful. He wrote for most of the shows that presented hourlong original dramas in the 1950s, including “Studio One,” “Philco Television Playhouse” and “Goodyear Playhouse.” He became so adept, he could knock off an adaptation in a weekend and an original play in a week or two. He turned “Visit to a Small Planet,” his 1955 television drama about an alien who comes to earth to study the art of war, into a Broadway play. His most successful play was “The Best Man,” about two contenders for the presidential nomination. It ran for 520 performances on Broadway before it, too, became a well-received film, in 1964, with a cast headed by Henry Fonda and a screenplay by Mr. Vidal. It was revived on Broadway in 2000 and is now being revived there again as “Gore Vidal’s The Best Man.”      Photo      Mr. Vidal’s reputation as a script doctor was such that in 1956 MGM hired him as a contract writer; among other projects he helped rewrite the screenplay of “Ben-Hur,” though he was denied an official credit . He also wrote the screenplay for the movie adaptation of his friend Tennessee Williams’s play “Suddenly, Last Summer.”      By the end of the ’50s, though, Mr. Vidal, at last financially secure, had wearied of Hollywood and turned to politics. He had purchased Edgewater, a Greek Revival mansion in Dutchess County , N.Y., and it became his headquarters for his 1960 run for Congress. He was encouraged by Eleanor Roosevelt , a neighbor who had become a friend and adviser.      The 29th Congressional District was a Republican stronghold, and though Mr. Vidal, running as Eugene Gore on a platform that included taxing the wealthy, lost, he received more votes in running for the seat than any Democrat in 50 years. And he never tired of pointing out he did better in the district than the Democratic presidential candidate that year, John F. Kennedy .

Mr. Vidal also returned to writing novels in the ’60s and published three books in fairly quick succession: “Julian” (1964), “Washington, D.C.” (1967) and “Myra Breckinridge” (1968). “Julian,” which some critics still consider Mr. Vidal’s best, was a painstakingly researched historical novel about the fourth-century Roman emperor who tried to convert Christians back to paganism. (Mr. Vidal himself never had much use for religion, Christianity especially, which he once called “intrinsically funny.”) “Washington, D.C.” was a political novel set in the 1940s. “Myra Breckinridge,” Mr. Vidal’s own favorite among his books, was a campy black comedy about a male homosexual who has sexual reassignment surgery. (A 1970 film version, with Raquel Welch and Mae West , proved to be a disaster.)      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Perhaps without intending it, Mr. Vidal had set a pattern. In the years to come he found his greatest successes with historical novels, notably what became known as his American Chronicles: “Washington, D.C.,” “Burr” (1973), “1876” (1976), “Lincoln” (1984), “Empire” (1987), “Hollywood” (1990) and “The Golden Age” (2000).      He turned out to have a gift for this kind of writing. These novels were learned and scrupulously based on fact, but also witty and contemporary-feeling, full of gossip and shrewd asides. Harold Bloom wrote that Mr. Vidal’s imagination of American politics “is so powerful as to compel awe.” Writing in The Times, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said, “Mr. Vidal gives us an interpretation of our early history that says in effect that all the old verities were never much to begin with.”      But Mr. Vidal also persisted in writing books like “Myron” (1974), a sequel to “Myra,” and “Live From Golgotha: The Gospel According to Gore Vidal” (1992), which were clearly meant as provocations. “Live From Golgotha,” for example, rewrites the Gospels, with Saint Paul as a huckster and pederast and Jesus a buffoon. John Rechy said of it in The Los Angeles Times Book Review, “If God exists and Jesus is his son, then Gore Vidal is going to hell.”      In the opinion of many critics, though, Mr. Vidal’s ultimate reputation is apt to rest less on his novels than on his essays, many of them written for The New York Review of Books. His collection “The Second American Revolution” won the National Book Critics Circle Award for criticism in 1982. About a later collection, “ United States : Essays 1952-1992,” R. W. B. Lewis wrote in The New York Times Book Review that Vidal the essayist was “so good that we cannot do without him,” adding, “He is a treasure of state.”      Mr. Vidal’s essays were literary, resurrecting the works of forgotten writers like Dawn Powell and William Dean Howells, and also political, taking on issues like sexuality and cultural mores. The form suited him ideally: he could be learned, funny, stylish, show-offy and incisive all at once. Even Jason Epstein, Mr. Vidal’s longtime editor at Random House , once admitted that he preferred the essays to the novels, calling Mr. Vidal “an American version of Montaigne.”      “I always thought about Gore that he was not really a novelist,” Mr. Epstein wrote, “that he had too much ego to be a writer of fiction because he couldn’t subordinate himself to other people the way you have to as a novelist.”      Vidal vs. Buckley (and Mailer)      Success did not mellow Mr. Vidal. In 1968, while covering the Democratic National Convention on television, he called William F. Buckley a “crypto-Nazi.” Buckley responded by calling Mr. Vidal a “queer,” and the two were in court for years. In a 1971 essay he compared Norman Mailer to Charles Manson , and a few months later Mailer head-butted him in the green room while the two were waiting to appear on the Dick Cavett show. They then took their quarrel on the air in a memorable exchange that ended with Mr. Cavett’s telling Mailer to take a piece of paper on the table in front of them and “fold it five ways and put it where the moon don’t shine.” In 1975 he sued Truman Capote for libel after Capote wrote that Mr. Vidal had been thrown out of the Kennedy White House. Mr. Vidal won a grudging apology.      Some of his political positions were similarly quarrelsome and provocative. Mr. Vidal was an outspoken critic of Israel ’s treatment of the Palestinians , and once called Norman Podhoretz , the editor of Commentary, and his wife, the journalist Midge Decter, “Israeli fifth columnists.” In the 1990s he wrote sympathetically about Timothy McVeigh , who was executed for the Oklahoma City bombing. And after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, he wrote an essay for Vanity Fair arguing that America had brought the attacks upon itself by maintaining imperialist foreign policies. In another essay, for The Independent, he compared the attacks to the Japanese raid on Pearl Harbor, arguing that both Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and George W. Bush knew of them in advance and exploited them to advance their agendas.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      As for literature, it was more or less over, he declared more than once, and he had reached a point where he no longer much cared. He became a sort of connoisseur of decline, in fact. America is “rotting away at a funereal pace,” he told The Times of London in 2009. “We’ll have a military dictatorship pretty soon, on the basis that nobody else can hold everything together.”      In 2003 Mr. Vidal and his companion, Mr. Austen, who was ill, left their cliffside Italian villa La Rondinaia (the Swallow’s Nest) on the Gulf of Salerno and moved to the Hollywood Hills to be closer to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Mr. Austen died that year, and in “Point to Point Navigation,” his second volume of memoirs, Mr. Vidal recalled that Mr. Austen asked from his deathbed, “Didn’t it go by awfully fast?”      “Of course it had,” Mr. Vidal wrote. “We had been too happy and the gods cannot bear the happiness of mortals.” Mr. Austen was buried in Washington in a plot Mr. Vidal had purchased in Rock Creek Cemetery. The gravestone was already inscribed with their names side by side.      Besides his nephew, Burr Steers, Mr. Vidal’s survivors include his sister, Nina Gore Auchincloss Straight.      After Mr. Austen’s death, Mr. Vidal lived alone in declining health himself. He was increasingly troubled by a knee injury he suffered in the war, and used a wheelchair to get around.      In November 2009 he made a rare public appearance to attend the National Book Awards in New York, where he was given a lifetime achievement award. He had evidently not prepared any remarks, and instead delivered a meandering impromptu speech that was sometimes funny and sometimes a little hard to follow. At one point he even seemed to speak fondly of Buckley, his old nemesis. It sounded like a summing up.      “Such fun, such fun,” he said. ||||| Celebrated American author, playwright, politician and commentator Gore Vidal has died, aged 86, at his home in the Hollywood Hills.      Gore Vidal wrote 25 novels, including the bestselling Burr and Myra Breckenridge, more than 200 essays and several plays. He also ran for political office twice and was a well-known commentator.      Held in high regard for his independent thoughts, Vidal was better known for opposing wars including Vietnam and Iraq, and mocking of religion and prudery.      On word of his death this morning, Channel 4 news reporter Krishnan Guru-Murthy said: \\"I imagine Gore Vidal will get to heaven and find it terribly bland. I hope he somehow sends us back a review.\\"      Comedian Ricky Gervais tweeted one of Vidal's many famous quotes: \\" ... to rid one's self of this consciousness ... nothing wrong with that..\\" Gore Vidal RIP.      \\"The writer Gore Vidal was thoughtful, ideologically consistent, extremely committed and an American isolationist,\\" said Australia's Foreign Minister Bob Carr.      Actress Joan Collins paid tribute, saying, \\"So sad my friend the brilliant Gore Vidal has died, he was a total original & genius.\\"      Actor James Urbaniak tweeted: \\"Aw, Gore Vidal. RIP. Who will carry on the mid-Atlantic accent? It's up to me and Kelsey Grammer now.\\"      Exiled writer Taslima Nasreen paid tributes, quoting Vidal, \\"Democracy is supposed to give you the feeling of choice, like Painkiller X and Painkiller Y. But they're both just aspirin.\\"      Congratulating Vidal in 2009 at the National Book Awards ceremony, writer, editor and publisher Dave Eggers said: \\"He meant everything to me when I was learning how to write and learning how to read.\\"      \\"His words, his intellect, his activism, his ability and willingness to always speak up and hold his government accountable, especially has been so inspiring to me I can't articulate it.\\"      Scissor Sister Jake Shears tweeted, “’Camp is nothing but another word for someone who hasn’t got any talent.’ RIP Gore Vidal. A truly great American original. What a legacy.”      Courtney Love paid tribute, “Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say and not giving a damn.’ Quoted by Gore Vidal… you will be missed, rest in peace Gore.”      Michael Moore tweeted one of Vidal’s famous quotations, “Half of the American people have never read a newspaper. Half never voted for President. One hopes it is the same half.\\"      British actor Nicholas Pegg shared a personal favourite, \\"Norman Mailer punched Gore Vidal at a party after a bad review. Still on the floor, Vidal declared: 'Once again, words fail Norman Mailer.'\\"      David Niose, president of the American Humanist Association, spoke of Vidal’s contribution as honorary president: “The progressive and humanist values Gore Vidal repeatedly espoused moved the culture in a positive direction…He spent his life pointing out the places in society that needed the most attention without worrying who might be embarrassed or upset by his opinions.”      American actor and writer Frank Conniff tweeted, “Gore Vidal dreaded the idea of an afterlife, because it would mean he'd have to see Norman Mailer again. Rest In Peace.” ||||| Gore Vidal, a celebrated writer, cul­tural gadfly and occasional political candidate, died July 31 at his home in Hollywood Hills, Calif., at 86. He had complications from pneumonia, his nephew, the actor, director and screenwriter Burr Steers, told the Associated Press.      Known for his urbanity and wit — “Every time a friend succeeds, I die a little”; “A narcissist is someone better looking than you are” — Mr. Vidal enjoyed a literary career that spanned more than 60 years, and he once said that he hoped to be remembered as “the person who wrote the best sentences of his time.”      Mr. Vidal was an astonishingly versatile man of letters and nearly the last major writer of the modern era to have served in World War II. Having resolved at age 20 to live by his pen, he wrote plays for television and Broadway, including the classic political drama “The Best Man”; helped script such movies as “Ben-Hur,” the 1959 epic starring Charlton Heston; and gained notoriety for the campy 1968 novel “Myra Breckinridge,” about a transsexual film enthusiast.      Mr. Vidal also won plaudits from scholars, critics and ordinary readers for historical novels such as the best-selling “Julian” (1964), “Burr” (1973) and “Lincoln” (1984). “United States,” which gathers Mr. Vidal’s essays on art, politics and himself, received the 1993 National Book Award.      In print or on television — he was a frequent talk-show guest — the worldly Mr. Vidal provoked controversy with his laissez-faire attitude toward every sort of sexuality, his well-reasoned disgust with what he called American imperialism and his sophisticated cynicism about love, religion, patriotism and other sacred cows.      He took an acerbic view of American leadership. “Today’s public figures can no longer write their own speeches or books,” he once quipped, “and there is some evidence they cannot read them either.”      As a boy, a thirst for learning      Mr. Vidal was born Oct. 3, 1925, at West Point, N.Y., where his father, Eugene Vidal, was teaching aeronautics at the military academy. His mother, Nina, was the socialite daughter of Sen. T.P. Gore of Oklahoma. Christened Eugene Luther Gore Vidal, the future writer later lopped off the first two names “for political as well as for aesthetic reasons.”      Young Gore spent much of his childhood in Washington and was particularly attached to his grandfather. The senator was blind, so the boy passed many hours reading to him aloud, thus inaugurating his own lifelong passion for learning and books. “The first grown-up book that I read on my own was a nineteenth-century edition of ‘Tales from Livy’ that I’d found in my grandfather’s library,” he once wrote. By 14, he added, “I wanted to know the entire history of the entire world.”      Mr. Vidal attended the private St. Albans School in Washington, where he fell in love with a fellow student named Jimmie Trimble, who was killed in combat on Iwo Jima during World War II. In his memoirs “Palimpsest” (1995) and “Point to Point Navigation” (2006), Mr. Vidal makes clear that this youthful passion marked his entire life: He never truly loved anyone again, although he would enjoy hundreds of sexual encounters, many of them with anonymous strangers, in which he took pleasure but, as he repeatedly insisted, never gave any except inadvertently.      Although Mr. Vidal maintained a more than 50-year partnership with his companion, Howard Austen, he constantly underscored that the secret of its longevity was “no sex.” Austen died in 2003.      As a teenager, Mr. Vidal was sent to boarding school at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, from which he graduated in 1943. Rather than go on to Harvard, he enlisted in the Army, serving as first mate on a small supply ship in the Aleutians. That experience inspired his widely praised first novel, “Williwaw,” which appeared in 1946, when the author was 20.      Influence on stage and screen      After his discharge, Mr. Vidal decided to bag college and live in New York as a full-time writer. Before long, he became an intimate confidant of diarist Anais Nin and a friend of playwright Tennessee Williams. He also brought out two more novels, including “The City and the Pillar” (1948), an account of two all-American boys and what was — at that time — “the love that dare not speak its name.”      Although that book is now viewed as a pioneering work of gay literature, its casual acceptance of homosexual impulses offended some contemporary critics — and Mr. Vidal’s subsequent seven novels went unnoticed by Time magazine, Newsweek and the New York Times.      Because most of his fiction of the 1950s — even now admired works such as “Messiah” (1954), the study of a religious cult — proved commercially lackluster, Mr. Vidal decided to earn his living by writing TV dramas, Broadway plays and movie scripts. He also cranked out three mysteries under the pen name Edgar Box.      With the money from his commercial writing, Mr. Vidal paid the mortgage on a grandly pillared Greek Revival manse called Edgewater, located on the banks of the Hudson River near Rhinecliff, N.Y. There, he threw parties attended by rising literary notables such as Saul Bellow and Norman Mailer, critics Lionel and Diana Trilling, and movie stars Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman (who became his close friends).      Although Mr. Vidal enjoyed a varied social and sexual life, he nonetheless worked hard. On Broadway he hit pay dirt with “Visit to a Small Planet” (1957), in which an alien named Kreton lands on Earth and announces that human beings are his hobby. It deftly skewers contemporary mores and Cold War anxieties.      The even more highly regarded political drama “The Best Man” (1960), which was nominated for a Tony Award as best play, presented a behind-the-scenes look at the wheeling and dealing between two men competing for the Democratic presidential nomination. Both plays became films and have periodically been revived on stage.      As a screenwriter in the 1950s and occasionally afterward, Mr. Vidal contributed to many films, often without screen credit. He wrote a teleplay that inspired “The Left-Handed Gun”(with Newman as Billy the Kid); he was called in to doctor “Ben-Hur”(and tweaked the script to suggest a homosexual subtext to explain the relationship between the epic’s hero and his enemy Messala); and he worked with Williams on the hothouse melodrama “Suddenly, Last Summer.”      In his later years, Mr. Vidal appeared with some frequency in films, notably as himself in Federico Fellini’s “Roma” (1972) and as a U.S. senator in Tim Robbins’s “Bob Roberts” (1992).      By the early 1960s, the not-yet-40-year-old Mr. Vidal had achieved his goal of financial independence. For the next three decades, he spent much of his life in Italy, his villa a lodestone for literati and glitterati. There he carefully researched his novel “Julian” — about the apostate Roman emperor — and its success relaunched his moribund career as a fiction writer.      In general, the older Mr. Vidal published three kinds of fiction: historical novels set in the ancient world, such as “Julian” and 1981’s “Creation” (which features Socrates, Zoroaster, the Buddha and Confucius); campy fantasies that mock American prejudices and conventionalities, the most famous of which is “Myra Breckinridge”; and the so-called American Chronicle, a series of seven novels — the best known are “Burr” and “Lincoln” — detailing the secret political history of the United States.      In these years, Mr. Vidal also grew more prominent as a pundit, on TV and in the pages of the New York Review of Books and other periodicals. Although he had published essays and reviews since the 1950s, Mr. Vidal increasingly cast himself as a modern-day Voltaire, commenting on the nation’s follies with waspish asperity and wit.      “There is no human problem which could not be solved if people would simply do as I advise,” he said. He insisted that everyone is really bisexual: “There is no such thing as a homosexual or a heterosexual person. There are only homo- or heterosexual acts. Most people are a mixture of impulses if not practices.” Political elections, he observed, were “held at great cost without issues and with interchangeable candidates.”      Most famously, during the heated days of the national conventions of 1968, Mr. Vidal squared off on the issue of freedom of speech with conservative pundit William F. Buckley Jr. The pair ended up trading insults: “Crypto-Nazi,” Mr. Vidal said. “You queer,” Buckley shot back.      Mr. Vidal collected the best of his discursive prose in “United States” (1993), a mammoth volume of literary essays, political polemics and autobiographical reminiscences for which he received the National Book Award. Although it included a scandalously frank account of the Kennedys entitled “The Holy Family,” Mr. Vidal’s finest pieces were not his attacks but his appreciations.      He produced exemplary reappraisals — composed in ballpoint pen on yellow legal pads — of his favorite childhood authors (notably L. Frank Baum, creator of the “Oz” books) and of many once-undervalued figures, such as Dawn Powell, Italo Calvino, William Dean Howells, Thomas Love Peacock and Logan Pearsall Smith.      That some of these writers continued to be neglected only supports Mr. Vidal’s frequent lament: The age of the reader is passing, and we are living through its twilight’s last gleaming.      The occasional politician      Although Mr. Vidal found success as a writer and intellectual, he failed in his attempts to win political office. He twice ran unsuccessfully in elections, campaigning for Congress in 1960 and then for the Senate in 1982. While politics was in his view always corrupt, he also felt it had grown more so since World War II.      “I date the end of the old republic and the birth of the empire to the invention, in the late thirties, of air conditioning,” he said. Before air conditioning, “the politicians would abandon Washington in the summer; now they stay around all through the year, making mischief.”      In his later years, Mr. Vidal grew less witty and increasingly vehement in his political views, speaking out against American policy after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and denouncing the 2003 invasion of Iraq.      Mr. Vidal once pointed out that his literary genealogy included “Petronius, Juvenal, Apuleius — then Shakespeare — then Peacock, Meredith, James, Proust.” Like those cultivated and polished writers, Mr. Vidal cast a cold eye on the society of his time and resolutely upheld the values of urbanity and pleasure against the onslaughts of the barbarian, the puritan and the philistine.      “Always a godfather, never a god,” he once remarked at a christening.      style@washpost.com      Dirda reviews books each Thursday in Style and conducts a book discussion for The Post at wapo.st/reading-room. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Gore Vidal was a very talented and famous American writer.

War work again brought local prosperity during World War II, this time centered on Boeing aircraft. The war dispersed the city's numerous Japanese-American businessmen due to the Japanese American internment. After the war, the local economy dipped. It rose again with Boeing's growing dominance in the commercial airliner market. Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when Boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises, loss of Government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the Boeing 747. Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading \\"Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights.\\"Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities; the headquarters were moved to Chicago.

Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican authorities have bolstered their search for a missing U.S. citizen and the government rejects assertions that security forces aren't doing enough to find him, the foreign ministry said Friday. David Michael Hartley has been missing since a reported pirate attack September 30 on a lake bisected by the U.S.-Mexico border. Hartley's wife, Tiffany, told authorities her husband was shot and killed by pirates on Falcon Lake during a sightseeing trip. His body has yet to be found, leading to questions about the accuracy of her statements. The ministry said the federal attorney general's office opened an investigation based on testimony Tiffany Hartley gave to Mexican authorities at the consulate in McAllen, Texas. The government also has been in close touch with several U.S. authorities. Hartley was on several CNN shows Thursday recounting what happened last week on","output":"Falcon Lake. She said that they were approached by armed men on boats, who opened fire on them while they were on their jet skis. David was shot in the head, and she had to leave him behind in order to escape and get help. Tiffany has been advocating for more action to be taken to find her husband and bring his body home. The Mexican government has emphasized its commitment to the search, stating that they have deployed additional personnel, boats, and helicopters to comb the area surrounding Falcon Lake. Authorities from both the United States and Mexico are working together in this joint effort, sharing intelligence and resources. In response to the incident, local and federal officials on both sides of the border have issued warnings to boaters and tourists to stay vigilant and avoid venturing into the lake's remote areas. This incident has also reignited concerns over the increase in criminal activity around the border region, particularly due to its ties to drug trafficking. Authorities are urging anyone with information regarding the whereabouts of David Michael Hartley or the details of the incident to come forward. The investigation is ongoing, and both the U.S. and Mexican officials have vowed to work tirelessly to bring closure to this tragic event."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the new building that has helped to transform the surrounding area? is inside the article: Construction of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway began in 1845. The line was opened in October 1849, with  services from Manchester London Road via Sale to Altrincham. In 1931 it became one of Great Britain's first electrified railway lines, with a 1,500 V DC overhead line. At the same time a new Altrincham station was opened on the same line, at Navigation Road, serving housing developments in the area. By 1937, 130 train services ran daily between Manchester and Altrincham. The line was renovated in the early 1990s to form part of the Manchester Metrolink light rail system. Broadheath railway station served the northern part of Altrincham between 1853 and 1962, on the line from Manchester, via Lymm to Warrington.Altrincham Interchange is one of the Metrolink's termini. The interchange was refurbished (2015–16), and now includes a brand new footbridge, with 3 lifts to cope with increased passenger demands, a larger scale ticket office, and modern bus interchange. The new Interchange is a modern design building that looks fantastic and is helping to regenerate Altrincham city centre as the new building has helped to transform the surrounding area. The Interchange connects the town to several locations in Greater Manchester, such as Sale and Bury. The service also includes Navigation Road station. Metrolink services leave around every six minutes, between 07:15 and 19:30 on weekdays, and less frequently at other times. National Rail services link the Altrincham and Navigation Road stations with Chester via Northwich, and with Manchester via Stockport. Altrincham Interchange, next to the railway station, is a hub for local bus routes. Manchester Airport, the largest in the UK outside London, is 5 miles (8 km) to the southeast of the town, and is connected via the Manchester Picadilly – Crewe line. There are plans in the future to create a new link between Manchester Airport and the Mid Cheshire Line, which Altrincham Interchange is a station on. Recently the Metrolink completed connections..., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"Altrincham Interchange"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:The greater the objects mass, the greater the force of gravitational attraction.  Will weighed himself on a scale. He weighs less than last year. His force of gravitational attraction increased or decreased? A:","output":"When considering the force of gravitational attraction, we are referring to the force with which the Earth pulls on an object. This force is often experienced as weight and can be described by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation as: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 Where F is the force of gravitational attraction, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects being attracted (in this case, Will and the Earth), and r is the distance between the centers of the two objects. In Will's case, since he weighs less than last year, it means his mass (m1) has decreased. The mass of the Earth (m2) remains virtually constant, and the distance between Will and the center of the Earth (r) does not change significantly. As a result, if we plug these changes into the equation, we find that the force of gravitational attraction (F) will have decreased. To break it down, the equation can be simplified as: F = G * m1 * m2 Since G and m2 are constant, we can see that the force of gravitational attraction (F) is directly proportional to Will's mass (m1). Therefore, when Will's mass decreases, the force of gravitational attraction between him and Earth will also decrease. In conclusion, since Will weighs less than last year, his force of gravitational attraction has decreased. This means he experiences a lower pull towards the Earth, and the scale he used to measure his weight also detected this decrease."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To me, Amitabh was a better villain here than in some of his most famous movies. He was a die-hard villain, a no-apologies villain. To me it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role where his villainy isn't sort of undercut in some way. The kid who played Aryan was probably over his head with this cast. There I think maybe the director could have done better. But, to be honest, the very best part of this movie was Shernaz Patel. She is an unsung heroine, a true veteran thespian who is overqualified for every role she is offered. But I must say I appreciated her contribution greatly as she played Virendra Sahi's wife. She may be given little to do, but she does everything with total conviction. I'm sure she sailed right over the heads of most of the audience. So if you are in a habit for settling for Bollywood average, you won't get much out of this movie. But if you constantly search for something more, then this might give you some of what you've been missing. Now, what is this review like? Available options: a). negative; b). positive;","output":"This review is a mix of both positive and negative aspects. The reviewer praised Amitabh Bachchan's performance as a villain, stating that it was refreshing to see him in a role where his villainy isn't undercut in any way. They also expressed great admiration for Shernaz Patel's acting skills. On the other hand, the reviewer expressed disappointment with the choice of the young actor who played Aryan, suggesting that he was overshadowed by the more experienced cast members. In the last paragraph, the reviewer addressed the target audience of the film, saying that it might not appeal to those who generally enjoy mainstream Bollywood films but might be appreciated by those who seek something unconventional.

In Las Vegas , federal agents stormed two clubs - Cheetah 's and Jaguars - along with Galardi Enterprises , an office atop a bar in downtown .","output":"While the two sentences convey a similar situation, they are not exactly the same in terms of meaning and nuance. Here is a comparison and breakdown of the sentences to highlight the differences: 1. In Las Vegas, agents entered two clubs — Cheetah's and Jaguars — along with Galardi Enterprises, an office atop a bar and pool hall in downtown Las Vegas. 2. In Las Vegas, federal agents stormed two clubs - Cheetah's and Jaguars - along with Galardi Enterprises, an office atop a bar in downtown. There are three notable differences between the sentences: 1. Agents vs. federal agents: In the first sentence, the reference is to \\"agents\\", which is ambiguous and could mean any representatives or employees. In the second sentence, it specifies \\"federal agents,\\" which makes it clear that the agents are from a government agency. This difference in descriptions changes the perception of the events taking place in the sentences. 2. Entered vs. stormed: The first sentence uses the term \\"entered,\\" which generally suggests a more casual or calm way of gaining access to the clubs and the office. In contrast, the second sentence uses the term \\"stormed,\\" which suggests forceful entry or aggressive action on the part of the agents. This difference in action words gives a much stronger and more dramatic tone to the second sentence as compared to the first sentence. 3. Bar and pool hall vs. bar: In the first sentence, the location of Galardi Enterprises is described as an \\"office atop a bar and pool hall,\\" while the second sentence only mentions \\"an office atop a bar.\\" This difference in description leaves out the detail about the pool hall, making the location somewhat less specific in the second sentence than in the first one. In conclusion, while both sentences seem to describe the same situation, they convey slightly different meanings and tones due to the variations in the descriptions of the agents, the manner of entering the locations, and the specific location of the Galardi Enterprises office. The first sentence appears to be more neutral and descriptive, while the second sentence seems to emphasize a more dramatic and forceful action by the federal agents."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Here is an article: Throughout the course of the 20th Century, swimming pools have been associated with a certain lifestyle. The Bright Young Things ‘Bath and Bottle Party’ of June 1928, held at St George’s Swimming Baths in London; Terry O’Neill’s 1977 photograph of Faye Dunaway with Oscar in hand by the pool of the Beverly Hills Hotel; even the opening scene of Jonathan Glazer’s Sexy Beast (2000) in which Ray Winstone plays a retired gangster baking in the sun by the side of his pool – the venue and context may change, but one thing remains constant: swimming pools signify luxury, leisure, and above all, glamour. Symbolically though, there’s no better metaphor for repressed desires and clandestine activities. By their very nature pools suggest duality. There’s the world above, and the world below the waterline; a psychological connection between water and the workings of our subconscious. In a world where dreams are manufactured, water is of paramount importance - Thomas AP van Leeuwen A pool, especially a beautifully designed one – think of Gatsby’s ornate marble beauty or newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst’s Neptune Pool at Hearst Castle – is a status symbol. In Billy Wilder’s 1950 film Sunset Boulevard, the ageing silent movie star Norma Desmond’s pool plays a central role, and not simply because the film opens with the discovery of unsuccessful screenwriter Joe Gillis’s body floating face down in it. Like Desmond herself, it stands for the extravagance and excess of Old Hollywood in the “crazy ’20s” when she was at the height of her career. Nothing sums up Desmond’s descent into oblivion and neglect like the image of the empty, leaf-strewn pool; and then with her revitalisation, the pool is also brought back to life. “Poor dope,” says the narrator at the beginning of the film, “he always wanted a pool. Well, in the end he got himself a pool, only the price turned out to be a little high.” Gillis was eager for fame and fortune – everything the pool represented –but he’s also no different from every middle class Tom, Dick and Harry who wants a pool in his own backyard, an increasingly attainable dream in the United States from the ’50s and ’60s onwards. The swimming pool as a suburban status symbol is loaded with many of the same ideals as the grand pools of the wealthy: prosperity, of course, but also a sense of freedom and escape from the daily grind. In Chris Smith’s India-set film The Pool (2007), a young hotel worker becomes obsessed with the swimming pool in the garden of a middle-class villa. He is determined to use it under invitation only, an ambition completely at odds with his existence. His simple aspiration to swim in the pool symbolises his larger life goals such as education and economic advancement. These, of course, are all objectives fundamental to the American Dream – and the suburban aspiration to own a backyard watering hole is particularly evident in California. Southern California, in particular, has long been synonymous with swimming pools, summed up perhaps in David Hockney’s pool-focused paintings from the ’60s and ’70s, the most famous of which is A Bigger Splash (1967), an image that features no figures, just the foamy aftermath of a dive into the otherwise tranquil water. There’s clearly something highly attractive about the domestication of water as a leisure time luxury in the very middle of what is otherwise an arid wilderness. In The Springboard in the Pond: An Intimate History of the Swimming Pool,Thomas AP van Leeuwen suggests a connection between water and dreams, arguing, “in a world where dreams are manufactured, water is of paramount importance. Thus in Hollywood, a place as dry as the nearby desert, the element appears as a dream living in concrete or plastic containers called private swimming pools.” It’s surely no coincidence then that in Mike Nichols’s The Graduate (1967), the friendly career advice a family friend offers Benjamin Braddock, home from college and spending his days “drifting” aimlessly around his parents’ backyard pool on an inflatable sun lounger, is “plastics”. “I just want to say one word to you. Just one word,” the man begins. “Are you listening? Plastics. There’s a great future in plastics. Think about it.” All the while behind them the surface of the pool in its own “plastic container” glistens and ripples in the darkness – a representation of Benjamin’s disaffection and listlessness. Writing in 1977, Joan Didion admits that “the symbolic content of swimming pools has always been interesting,” but, she continues, “a pool is misapprehended as a trapping of affluence, real or pretended, and of a kind of hedonistic attention to the body. Actually a pool is, for many of us in the West, a symbol not of affluence but of order, of control over the uncontrollable. A pool is water, made available and useful, and is, as such, infinitely soothing to the western eye.” In Frank Perry and Sydney Pollack’s Connecticut-set film The Swimmer (1968), based on John Cheever’s 1964 short story of the same name, Ned Merrill, a middle-aged man, decides to “swim home”, pool by pool across his neighbours’ estates. “He seemed to see, with a cartographer’s eye, that string of swimming pools, that quasi-subterranean stream that curved across the county,” writes Cheever. But what begins as an innocent feat of endurance to prove Merrill’s athleticism actually turns out to be an increasingly troubled swim down a river of forgetfulness. We learn – from the snippets of conversation he engages in with the friends he meets along the way – that Merrill’s had some kind of serious mental breakdown and the idyllic domestic set-up he’s swimming home to no longer exists. Not only does Merrill lack his own pool – a notable absence amongst this veritable excess of backyard oases, and thus a sure sign of his inability to exert order over his life – but with each watery immersion the uncontrollable becomes ever more apparent as the picture of a man in serious mental distress is slowly patched together. In at the deep end If America has the monopoly on images of the private pool, across the pond in Europe the municipal version is more often the focus of swimming-related stories, something that’s a necessity of circumstance more than anything else given the absence of a consistently sunny climate like that of California. In Rose Tremain’s novel The Swimming Pool Season (1985), her central characters are a husband and wife who relocate from the UK to the Dordogne after his outdoor swimming pool business has failed. But again, regardless of the difference in size and number of swimmers, images of the public pool in popular culture function with a similar effect to private pools. Films set in public pools such as Jerzy Skolimowski’s Deep End (1970) and Céline Sciamma’s Water Lilies (2007) play with the voyeuristic opportunities of the setting, revealing the pool to be a steamy hotbed of desire, not to mention the actual site of seduction. Water Lilies is a tale of teenage obsession and burgeoning adolescent desire amongst the members of a provincial synchronised swimming team in a suburb outside of Paris, that equates water and sexuality; while the grimy but elegant London-set old Victorian baths in Deep End is a maze of intrigue, illicit longing and sexual encounters. Ultimately sex and death combine and the pool is also an instrument of murder. This same motif can be found in François Ozon’s Swimming Pool (2003). Sarah Morton, a middle-aged English author suffering from writer’s block seeks solitude and contemplation at her publisher’s idyllic holiday home in rural France. Inspired by the events that subsequently transpire, she writes a story of sex and murder, though whether the action we see play out by the side of the pool is actually happening or merely the creation of Sarah’s imagination, we’re never quite sure. The holiday villa pool lies somewhere in between the private backyard version and the larger municipal variety. The most interesting vacations tend to involve a group of people not necessarily intimately related to one another. And as in Swimming Pool, one of the themes most often associated with holiday pools is sexual availability; just think of either Martin Amis’s The Pregnant Widow (2010), set in a Tuscan castle, complete with pool surrounded by bathing beauties for the protagonistto feast his eyes on; or Deborah Levy’s Swimming Home (2011) in which Joe and Isabel Jacobs’ holiday with their daughter and another couple is interrupted by the appearance of a young woman with her sights set on Joe. It’s rare to find something so immediately recognisable the world over as a prized commodity that stands for both the owner’s economic success and firmly demands some sort of symbolic reading. Swimming pools are uncommon hybrids of meaning, something to think about while you lounge by the side of one – private, municipal, or a holiday rental – this summer.

La Strada (lit. \\"The Road\\") is a 1954 Italian drama film directed by Federico Fellini from his own screenplay co-written with Tullio Pinelli and Ennio Flaiano. The film portrays a naive young woman (Giulietta Masina) bought from her mother by a brutish strongman (Anthony Quinn) who takes her with him on the road. Fellini has called La Strada \\"a complete catalogue of my entire mythological world, a dangerous representation of my identity that was undertaken with no precedent whatsoever.\\" Fellini secured financing through the producers Dino De Laurentiis and Carlo Ponti, who wanted to cast Silvana Mangano (De Laurentiis' wife) as Gelsomina and Burt Lancaster as Zampano, but Fellini refused these choices. Giulietta Masina had been the inspiration for the entire project, so Fellini was determined never to accept an alternative to her. For Zampano, Fellini had hoped to cast a nonprofessional and, to that end, he tested a number of circus strongmen, to no avail. He also had trouble finding the right person for the role of Il Matto. His first choice was the actor Moraldo Rossi, who was a member of Fellini's social circle and had the right type of personality and athletic physique, but Rossi wanted to be the assistant director, not a performer. Alberto Sordi, the star of Fellini's earlier films The White Sheik and I Vitelloni, was eager to take the role, and was bitterly disappointed when Fellini rejected him after a tryout in costume.  Ultimately, Fellini drew his three leading players from people associated with the 1954 film Donne Proibite (Angels of Darkness), directed by Giuseppe Amato, in which Masina played the very different role of a madam. Anthony Quinn was also acting in the film, while Richard Basehart was often on the set visiting his wife, actress Valentina Cortese. When Masina introduced Quinn to her husband, the actor was disconcerted by Fellini's insistence that the director had found his Zampano, later remembering: \\"I thought he was a little bit crazy, and I told him I wasn't interested in the picture, but he kept hounding me for days.\\" Not long afterwards, Quinn spent the evening with Roberto Rossellini and Ingrid Bergman, and after dinner they watched Fellini's 1953 Italian comedy-drama I Vitelloni. According to Quinn: \\"I was thunderstruck by it. I told them the film was a masterpiece, and that the same director was the man who had been chasing me for weeks.\\"  Fellini was particularly taken with Basehart, who reminded the director of Charlie Chaplin. Upon being introduced to Basehart by Cortese, Fellini invited the actor to lunch, at which he was offered the role of Il Matto. When asked why by the surprised Basehart, who had never before played the part of a clown, Fellini responded: \\"Because, if you did what you did in Fourteen Hours you can do anything.\\" A great success in Italy, the 1951 Hollywood drama starred Basehart as a would-be suicide on a hotel balcony. Basehart, too, had been greatly impressed by I Vitelloni, and agreed to take the role for much less than his usual salary, in part because he was very attracted by Fellini's personality, saying: \\"It was his zest for living, and his humor.\\"Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Who else did he like?","output":"In the given passage, it is mentioned that Fellini was particularly taken with Richard Basehart, who reminded the director of Charlie Chaplin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Zipoetes I was a king of Bithynia who ruled from around 326 BCE to 278 BCE. To provide more context on Bithynia's history during and after Alexander's conquests, it is essential to mention Bas, the father of Zipoetes I. Bas was the founder of the Bithynian Kingdom and managed to assert and maintain Bithynia's independence despite the expansionist campaign led by Alexander the Great. Bas ruled Bithynia from around 376 to 326 BCE. In the mentioned statement, the battle between Bas and Calas, one of Alexander's generals, indeed demonstrates the intensity of the situation and the subsequent establishment of Bithynia's independence. However, it does not offer the exact time frame of when Zipoetes I assumed the role of king. After Bas' death in or around 326 BCE, his son, Zipoetes I, took over the throne. Zipoetes I further consolidated Bithynia's position as an independent kingdom by expanding its territories during his reign. His rule lasted until his death in 278 BCE, after which his son Nicomedes I succeeded him as the king of Bithynia. In conclusion, the statement regarding Bas defeating Calas to maintain Bithynia's independence provides essential historical context but does not directly answer the question about when Zipoetes I assumed the role of king. Zipoetes I succeeded his father, Bas, and became the king of Bithynia around 326 BCE."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write an article with the title: \\"U.S. Weighs Pursuit of Death Penalty for Suspect in Boston Bombing\\"","output":"Title: U.S. Weighs Pursuit of Death Penalty for Suspect in Boston Bombing Introduction The United States has been grappling with the question of whether to pursue the death penalty for the surviving suspect of the tragic Boston Marathon bombings of 2013. The suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, along with his brother Tamerlan, are held responsible for the attack, which left three people dead and injured hundreds more. While the topic of the death penalty remains heavily debated within American society, the case has raised important questions about whether seeking capital punishment in this instance serves the interests of justice and the nation. Background On April 15, 2013, two pressure cooker bombs were detonated near the finish line of the annual Boston Marathon, resulting in one of the most brutal acts of terrorism on U.S. soil since the 9/11 attacks. The explosions claimed the lives of three innocent people, including an 8-year-old boy, and caused injuries to more than 260 others. In the subsequent manhunt, the suspects were identified as brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Tamerlan was killed in a police shootout, while Dzhokhar was captured several days later. In January 2014, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was indicted on 30 charges, including the use of weapons of mass destruction resulting in death, and the federal government announced its intention to seek the death penalty. In May 2015, a jury sentenced Tsarnaev to death, but his conviction was overturned on appeal in July 2020. The U.S. Supreme Court is set to review this decision during its upcoming term, thus reigniting the debate on the appropriateness of capital punishment in this case. Arguments in Favor of Pursuing the Death Penalty 1. Deterrence: Proponents of the death penalty argue that capital punishment serves as a deterrent to would-be criminals and terrorists. The prospect of facing the death penalty may act as a strong incentive for individuals to reconsider undertaking terrorist activities within the United States. Thus, seeking the death penalty for Tsarnaev's crimes might deter future acts of terror. 2. Justice for Victims: Many of those directly affected by the bombings believe that seeking the death penalty is an appropriate way to honor the memory of those who lost their lives in this heinous attack. By imposing the harshest penalty available, the prosecution aims to send a strong message about the severity of the crime committed and the suffering inflicted upon innocent victims. 3. Retribution: The retributive nature of the death penalty is another argument raised in favor of pursuing it. In this view, capital punishment offers a sense of closure and justice to the victims and their families by acknowledging the magnitude of the crime and handing down a punishment that matches the severity of the offense. Arguments Against Pursuing the Death Penalty 1. Risk of Execution Errors: Critics of the death penalty argue that the risk of executing an innocent person is too high. While Tsarnaev's guilt may seem clear-cut in this case, concerns about the accuracy of the U.S. criminal justice system persist. Some argue that it would be more humane to pursue a life sentence instead, avoiding the risk of an irreversible mistake. 2. Cost: The financial cost of seeking the death penalty is considerably higher than that of other sentences. Lengthy legal processes and appeals, often spanning years or even decades, can present a significant burden on taxpayers. Critics maintain that it would be better to allocate these resources towards reform and rehabilitation of convicted criminals or to support the victims and their families. 3. International Relations: Pursuing the death penalty for Tsarnaev, a naturalized U.S. citizen of Chechen origin, may have diplomatic implications for the United States. While capital punishment is a legal option in the U.S., many nations have abolished it, viewing it as a violation of human rights. As such, pursuing the death penalty in high-profile cases could potentially strain international relations and hinder cooperation in counter-terrorism efforts. Conclusion The debate over whether to pursue the death penalty for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev represents a microcosm of the larger conversation about capital punishment within the United States. Regardless of the outcome, this case underscores the need for a thoughtful and conscientious approach to the application of the death penalty. Ultimately, the decision will have lasting implications for the American justice system, domestic and international counter-terrorism efforts, and the nation's ongoing struggle to reconcile the demands of justice and humanity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Question: what was muhammad's vision? Would \\"In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina .\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","output":"To answer this question, it is important to first understand the context of Muhammad's vision. Muhammad, the founder of Islam, had a series of revelations from the angel Gabriel that formed the basis for the Islamic faith. His vision was primarily about spreading the message of Islam, which emphasized the worship of one God, social justice, and moral and spiritual values. Now, to address the statement \\"In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina,\\" it can be considered a reasonable answer in the sense that it represents one aspect of the broader vision of Muhammad. The Constitution of Medina was indeed a significant achievement during the early years of Islam, where he managed to bring different tribes together and establish a unified community that followed the tenets of Islam. However, this specific accomplishment, while important, does not fully capture the entirety of Muhammad's vision. His vision also included the global spread of Islam, promoting moral values, and striving for a just society. So, while the Constitution of Medina is a significant part of Muhammad's vision, it should be expanded upon to provide a more comprehensive understanding of his aspirations for the Islamic faith."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hence, an electron with an increased energy level will have higher energy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: -  The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs - The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth.  What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process, involving the respiratory system and the circulation of oxygen throughout the body, begins with inhalation. Inhalation, also known as inspiration, is the process by which air is drawn into the lungs, allowing the oxygen to pass through the bronchial tubes and subsequently enter the pulmonary system. During inhalation, the diaphragm, a large, dome-shaped muscle located at the base of the lungs, contracts and moves downward. This movement increases the volume of the thoracic cavity, creating a negative pressure within the lungs relative to the atmospheric pressure outside the body. As a result, air rushes into the airways, leading to the expansion of the rib cage. The inhaled air enters the body through the nose and mouth, with the nose being the primary entry for air due to its function in filtering, warming, and humidifying the air. Additionally, the nose contains tiny hairs called cilia and a mucus layer that traps particles such as dust and pollen, preventing them from reaching the lungs. From the nose, the air moves through the nasal cavities and into the pharynx, a funnel-shaped passageway that connects the nasal cavity and mouth to the esophagus and larynx. The air then travels down the larynx, or voice box, and passes through the vocal cords. The larynx acts as a protective barrier to prevent food particles from entering the airways during swallowing. Below the larynx, the air reaches the trachea, or windpipe, a tube composed of rings of cartilage that reinforce its structure and prevent collapse. The trachea then divides into two bronchi, which in turn branch into a system of bronchial tubes that extend into the lungs. As the bronchial tubes branch further, they become smaller and eventually transition into bronchioles. Finally, the oxygen in the inhaled air reaches the alveoli, tiny air sacs surrounded by networks of capillaries. It is within the thin walls of the alveoli that the crucial exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air and blood takes place. In conclusion, the first step of the process involves inhalation, during which air containing oxygen is drawn into the body through the nose or mouth and travels through the intricate respiratory system, eventually reaching the alveoli in the lungs. From here, the oxygen can pass into the bloodstream, where it can be transported and utilized by cells throughout the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Apple introduced an emulator during the transition from PowerPC chips (called Rosetta), much as it did during the transition from Motorola 68000 architecture a decade earlier. The Macintosh is the only mainstream computer platform to have successfully transitioned to a new CPU architecture, and has done so twice. All current Mac models ship with at least 8 GB of RAM as standard other than the 1.4 GHz Mac Mini, MacBook Pro (without Retina Display), and MacBook Air. Current Mac computers use ATI Radeon or nVidia GeForce graphics cards as well as Intel graphics built into the main CPU. All current Macs (except for the MacBook Pro without Retina Display) do not ship with an optical media drive that includes a dual-function DVD/CD burner. Apple refers to this as a SuperDrive. Current Macs include two standard data transfer ports: USB and Thunderbolt (except for the MacBook (2015 version), which only has a USB-C port and headphone port). MacBook Pro, iMac, MacBook Air, and Mac Mini computers now also feature the \\"Thunderbolt\\" port, which Apple says can transfer data at speeds up to 10 gigabits per second. USB was introduced in the 1998 iMac G3 and is ubiquitous today, while FireWire is mainly reserved for high-performance devices such as hard drives or video cameras. Starting with the then-new iMac G5, released in October 2005, Apple started to include built-in iSight cameras on appropriate models, and a media center interface called Front Row that can be operated by an Apple Remote or keyboard for accessing media stored on the computer. Front Row has been discontinued as of 2011, however, and the Apple Remote is no longer bundled with new Macs.

Question: suppose there is no residual noise in the area happens, how will it affect a SMALLER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"B: less If there is no residual noise in the area, it means that the surroundings are extremely quiet and calm. Although noise pollution does not directly affect oxygen delivery to the bloodstream, a completely noise-free environment can have indirect effects. In a serene environment, the body's parasympathetic nervous system becomes more active, leading to a decrease in heart rate and a more relaxed state. This state of relaxation can, in turn, lead to slower and shallower breathing. When our breathing rate decreases, the lungs take in a smaller volume of air, reducing the amount of oxygen that enters the alveoli. The alveoli play a crucial role in gas exchange; oxygen from the air diffuses across the alveoli walls into the surrounding blood vessels while carbon dioxide diffuses out from the blood vessels to the alveoli and is expelled when we exhale. When less oxygen is available in the alveoli due to slower and shallower breathing, the blood vessels surrounding them receive a smaller amount of oxygen, and therefore deliver less oxygen to the body's cells. It's important to note that this effect would most likely be subtle, and the body has mechanisms in place to regulate breathing and ensure adequate oxygen delivery even in quiet environments. However, the reduced noise level could indirectly contribute to a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream."},{"instruction":"Teacher:The task is to generate the correct answer for a given math problem.

I do love her, as I have not loved any other - except Diane. Under his fur-lined mantle he was sweating, despite the bone-deep chill of the January night. Was my pledge to Nicolette a lie? No, not now that Diane has vowed herself to God. He had always believed that a man or a woman could love but one person. For all the years he had loved Diane, he had accepted that as a sacred law of Love. It was the way things should be. But it was not the way they were. Not for him. What if I had known, that day I saw Nicolette at Chinon, that Diane was still alive? I would have wanted Nicolette just as much, but would not have begun this. There would have been no messages, no song in her garden. But I was sure Diane was dead. There was nothing but a memory of a younger time to check my feelings for Nicolette. And then, when I found Diane again, I could not have her. I had lost her forever. So at last I wrote again to Nicolette.

It could prove to be a pivotal moment in the Italian Serie A title race -- Juventus escaped with a 1-1 draw at AC Milan on Saturday after Sulley Muntari's first-half goal was controversially disallowed despite clearly crossing the line. With champions and league leaders Milan leading 1-0 at the time, Juve keeper Gianluigi Buffon desperately clawed back the Ghana midfielder's header from a corner -- and the referee waved play on to the dismay of the home players and their fans. \\"That incident that certainly falsified the result. Either the line was drawn wrong and was a bit too big,\\" Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri told reporters. \\"There is no need to see the replays. It was pretty obvious from all around the stadium.\\" The visitors also had a goal disallowed in the second half as Alessandro Matri was deemed to be offside in a very marginal decision, but the substitute leveled in the 83rd minute with his 10th goal this season to maintain Juve's unbeaten record after 24 matches. Antonio Conte's team were reduced to 10 men five minutes later when Arturo Vidal was sent off for a cynical foul on Mark van Bommel, but held on to stay one point behind Milan with a game in hand. The Rossoneri had taken the lead after 14 minutes when Antonio Nocerino fired in a deflected shot against his former club, whose defender Leonardo Bonucci gave the ball away to Robinho with a careless pass. January loan signing Muntari thought he had added to midfielder Nocerino's eighth league goal this season, but the linesman did not flag for the goal despite replays showing the ball went well over the Juve line before Buffon intervened. Third-placed Udinese and Lazio both trail Juve by eight points, but can cut the deficit on Sunday with victories against Bologna and Fiorentina respectively. In Saturday's other match, mid-table Genoa snatched a 2-2 draw against Parma thanks to two late goals from striker Rodrigo Palacio. The Argentine striker followed up his saved penalty to pull one back in the 78th minute, then took his tally to 14 for this season deep into time added on. Parma led in the sixth minute through defender Massimo Gobbi, then striker Sergio Floccari made it 2-0 eight minutes after the break against his former team. In Spain, Levante moved up into the fourth and last Champions League qualification place after snatching a 2-1 win at European rivals Espanyol in Saturday's late match. Substitute Ruben Suarez smashed in a freekick off the defensive wall in the 89th minute to seal the points after it had looked like the Barcelona-based hosts had earned a draw thanks to a 75th-minute header from Nigeria striker Kala Uche, who came on as a substitute. It was Valencia-based Levante's first win in nine La Liga matches. Malaga had temporaily taken fourth after thrashing bottom club Real Zaragoza 5-1, but ended the day in fifth -- one point above Espanyol.

There's no more room to bury the dead, they can't be cremated  and laws forbid a new cemetery. So the mayor has proposed a strange solution: outlaw death.

A chicken escapes, and an armed gang chases after it in a favela called the Cidade de Deus (\\"City of God\\"). The chicken stops between the gang and a young man named Rocket (BuscapÃ©), who believes the gang wants to kill him. A flashback traces Rocket, the narrator, back to the late 1960s. In the 1960s, the favela is a newly built housing project far from the centre of Rio de Janeiro, with little access to electricity and water. Three impoverished, amateur thieves known as the \\"Tender Trio\\" â Shaggy, Clipper, and Goose â rob and loot business owners; Goose is Rocket's brother. The thieves split part of the loot with the citizens of the City and are protected by them in return. Several younger boys idolize the trio, and one, Li'l Dice (Dadinho), convinces them to hold up a motel and rob its occupants. The gang resolves not to kill anyone and tells Li'l Dice to serve as lookout. They give him a gun and tell him to fire a warning shot if the police arrive, but an unsatisfied Li'l Dice fires a warning shot mid-robbery and guns down the motel inhabitants once the gang have run off.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: what faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress? Context: Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \\"affirmative action\\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 which prevented discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts. In 1967, the order was amended to include sex as well. The Reagan administration was opposed to the affirmative action requirements of Executive Order 11246, but these contemplated changes[which?] faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress. Answer:","output":"The contemplated changes to the affirmative action requirements of Executive Order 11246 faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sadly, the last member of this group has passed away at the age of 94. But don't worry, we will remember him and celebrate his life by learning more about the Pitman painters and the wonderful pictures they made. Back in the old days, there were lots of people called \\"pitmen\\" who worked in coal mines. It was a tough job, but it was important because coal helped to keep the lights on and our homes warm. However, some pitmen were also very talented artists, and they would paint pictures when they weren't working in the mines. They became known as the \\"Pitman painters.\\" These painters showed us what life was like for them and their families. They painted pictures of people working, children playing, and families spending time together.

Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - Horace Leonard \\"H. L.\\" Gold (April 26, 1914  February 21, 1996) was an American science fiction writer and editor. Born in Canada, Gold moved to the United States at the age of two. He was most noted for bringing an innovative and fresh approach to science fiction while he was the editor of \\"Galaxy Science Fiction\\", and also wrote briefly for DC Comics.  - Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful.  - Technology (\\"science of craft\\", from Greek , \\"techne\\", \\"art, skill, cunning of hand\\"; and , \\"-logia\\") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings.  - Innovation can be defined simply as a \\"new idea, device, or method\\". However, innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs. This is accomplished through more-effective products, processes, services, technologies, or business models that are readily available to markets, governments and society. The term \\"innovation\\" can be defined as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that \\"breaks into\\" the market or society. It is related to, but not the same as, invention. Innovation is often manifested via the engineering process. The exnovation is the opposite of innovation.  - A science fiction magazine is a publication that offers primarily science fiction, either in a hard copy periodical format or on the Internet.  - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.  - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\")   - All About the Future is a 1953 anthology of science fiction short stories edited by Martin Greenberg . The stories originally appeared in the magazines Astounding , Galaxy Science Fiction and the Boston University Graduate Journal .  - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature.  - Extraterrestrial life, also called alien life (or, if it is a sentient or relatively complex individual, an \\"extraterrestrial\\" or \\"alien\\"), is life that does not originate from Earth. These as-yet-hypothetical life forms may range from simple single-celled organisms to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. Although many scientists expect extraterrestrial life to exist, there is no unambiguous evidence for its existence so far. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as exobiology.  - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\".  - Martin Greenberg (28 June 1918-20 October 2013) Is an American book publisher and editor of science fiction anthologies.  - Galaxy Science Fiction was an American digest-size science fiction magazine, published from 1950 to 1980. It was founded by an Italian company, World Editions, which was looking to break into the American market. World Editions hired as editor H. L. Gold, who rapidly made \\"Galaxy\\" the leading science fiction (sf) magazine of its time, focusing on stories about social issues rather than technology.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.    Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'instance of'.

Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?","output":"This product review most certainly conveys a negative sentiment. There are various cues present within the text which suggest dissatisfaction and an unfavorable opinion of the subject— in this case, a made-for-TV production. Let's take a closer look at these cues: 1. Title: The title includes the phrase \\"Wow......Did that suck!!!!\\", which signifies a strong reaction of disappointment. The author not only used strong language, but also used multiple exclamation points to emphasize the intensity of the dissatisfaction. 2. Description as \\"made for TV shlock\\": The use of the word \\"shlock\\" refers to something that is worthless, inferior, or has low quality. By describing the production as such, the reviewer is expressing their opinion that it lacked value, and thus reinforces a negative sentiment. 3. Comparison to watching flies procreate: This statement serves as a metaphor that highlights the level of dissatisfaction with the content. Comparing something as undesirable as watching flies procreate signifies the author's way of saying they found the subject utterly unappealing and less-than-mediocre. Overall, the combination of the language used, the metaphors, and the highly disappointed tone makes it abundantly clear that this product review conveys a negative sentiment about the made-for-TV production."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness. I was a trained therapist, and in this situation, I was unable to do anything, and was rendered powerless.

It’s explicitly stated that Kevin Byrne serves as the Assembly member for the 94th District of the New York State Assembly, which includes portions of Putnam and Westchester counties in the Hudson Valley.  We do not have any information to suggest that he has any association with the 92nd District. Any such conclusion would be speculative and unsupported by the facts at hand. To elaborate further, Districts in the New York State Assembly are political boundaries that dictate which constituents an Assembly member represents. Each Assembly member represents one District. Given that, it is highly unusual for an Assembly member to switch Districts. In fact, an Assembly member's District can only change through redistricting, which is a process that typically occurs every ten years after the US census data is updated, or if the Assembly member runs for and is elected to represent a different District.  Unless there is clear evidence that any of these circumstances have taken place, the most accurate and reliable course is to assume that Kevin Byrne still represents the 94th District as specified. Switching districts would involve a comprehensive process and would generally be highly publicized, especially when it involves a change from one region to another (like from the 94th to the 92nd district).

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a large earthquake happened recently happens, how will it affect the rocks crack less.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of a large earthquake happening recently can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of rock cracking and the development of future earthquakes. Direct effects: 1. The large earthquake may relieve some of the pressure built up within the Earth's crust, causing a temporary decrease in the stress on the rocks surrounding the cracks. This could lead to less cracking and movement in the short term. 2. The energy released during the large earthquake could cause existing cracks to widen or new cracks to form, changing the configuration of the rock formations and potentially reducing the likelihood of another significant earthquake in the near future. Indirect effects: 1. The seismic waves produced by the large earthquake can cause changes in the Earth's crust, such as rearrangements of rock layers or alterations in the properties of the rocks themselves. These changes could influence the overall stability of the crust and potentially reduce the likelihood of another significant earthquake. 2. Large earthquakes can trigger secondary effects, such as landslides and ground subsidence, which may alter the pressure distribution within the Earth's crust and influence the development of future rock cracking and earthquake potential. Overall, a large earthquake happening recently could affect the rocks' cracking processes and the likelihood of future earthquakes by relieving pressure, causing changes in rock configurations, and triggering secondary effects that alter stress distribution within the Earth's crust. However, it is essential to note that these effects may vary depending on the specific location, the magnitude and characteristics of the large earthquake, and the geological context of the area."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You may also see signs of gnawing on your furniture or rodent tracks in dusty spaces. Can we draw the following conclusion? Tracks in dusty spaces mean your house is rodent infested.","output":"To draw a conclusion, let's analyze the information provided and break it down step by step: 1. Recognize signs of an infestation: The first step is to look for signs of rodent presence in your house. This includes small pellets of rodent droppings or gnawing marks on furniture. 2. Look for rodent tracks in dusty spaces: Another sign of rodent presence is their tracks in dusty areas in your house. Now, let's form the conclusion. Based on this information, we can say that if you find rodent tracks in dusty spaces, it is *possible* that your house has a rodent infestation. However, it is important to note that finding tracks alone may not be a definitive sign of infestation, as they could potentially be from a single rodent that entered your home. To make a more accurate conclusion, look for additional evidence, such as droppings, gnawing marks, or sightings of rodents themselves."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"Considering the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence, \\"They are special,\\" requires analyzing several aspects such as grammar, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Here's a detailed breakdown of each aspect: 1. Grammar: The sentence follows the basic structure of subject-verb-object, in this case: \\"They(subject) - are(verb) - special(object).\\" This structure is grammatically correct because the verb agrees with the subject, and it follows the standard format for English sentences. Therefore, the sentence maintains its grammatical integrity. 2. Syntax: Syntax is the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences. The syntax in this sentence is simple and straightforward, as it follows the standard order (subject-verb-object) without any complex structures or subordination. It is a simple statement that can be easily understood by any English speaker, maintaining its syntactic integrity. 3. Semantics: Semantics deals with the meaning of individual words and phrases and how they contribute to the overall meaning of the sentence. In this sentence, the individual words have clear and concise meanings:    a. \\"They\\" - A plural pronoun referring to more than one person or object.    b. \\"are\\" - A form of the verb \\"to be,\\" which denotes existence or identity.    c. \\"special\\" - An adjective describing a unique or exceptional quality or characteristic. When combined, these words create a sentence with a clear meaning - that the people or objects being referred to possess unique or exceptional qualities. The semantic integrity of the sentence is preserved. 4. Pragmatics: Pragmatics evaluates how language is used within a particular context. In this case, the context of the sentence is not given. However, given the simplicity and clarity of the sentence, it can be inferred that the speaker or writer is expressing an opinion or observation about the subject (the people or objects referred to as \\"they\\") being noteworthy or exceptional in some manner. When considering the context, it's crucial to note that the indexicality of the pronoun \\"they\\" might be a source of ambiguity. Without any context, \\"they\\" could refer to any group of individuals or objects, which may pose difficulties in understanding and interpretation. Despite this potential issue, the sentence maintains its pragmatic integrity as long as the context is clear to both speaker/writer and listener/reader. In summary, the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"They are special\\" is preserved when closely examining grammar, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. The sentence is simple, clear, and easy to understand when given sufficient context, effectively conveying its intended message."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The winter wind hurried down Columbus Avenue and the hem of his coat flapped around his knees letting little pockets of cold waft up to invade the warmth his body had spent so much time preparing and storing around his torso. With a bitter squeeze of his hands, his knuckles now getting cold, Morzeny bowed his square shoulders to the wind and continued walking. At sixty-seven years old the New York winters bothered Morzeny more than he cared to admit. And, although no doctor would admit it to him, he was positive that the first faint hints of arthritis tweaking through his hands were made worse by the cold. At every cross street the setting sun flashed through to the avenue in shades of crisp pink and red. Morzeny didn't want to be working right now. But these outings were the price he paid for having a hybrid job, owning buildings and brokering as many of his own leases as possible. When he had first come to the city he had been told that he needed a job, not for income, his providers took care of that, but for his own sanity. Something to keep him going. He had asked for something in real estate and had never bothered to wonder what other paths he might have taken. He had always been able to focus to the point of blindness. It helped him in every aspect of his work. He arrived at the brownstone building housing the apartment he was to show tonight. His building was tucked into a short row of buildings that squatted over the street, their steps reaching towards the curb like stunted growths. More to prove to himself that he could do it than anything else, Morzeny took the front steps two at a time.

Faerun is well-known among D&D players.","output":"Yes, the next sentence, \\"Faerun is well-known among D&D players\\" does follow and is coherent given the information provided in the preceding text. The text preceding the statement provides a comprehensive understanding of Faerûn and its significance within the \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\" universe, specifically the \\"Forgotten Realms\\" campaign setting. The text offers information about the source material that details Faerûn's lore, including the \\"Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting\\" (2001) and various associated campaign setting books. This provides evidence to the reader that Faerûn is deeply intertwined with \\"D&D\\" content, both in terms of tabletop gameplay resources and in novels and video games inspired by the setting. As there are numerous source books and multimedia content explicitly focusing on Faerûn, it is reasonable to infer that D&D players would be quite familiar with or, at the very least, aware of the Faerûn setting. The text also implies that Faerûn is used quite extensively within the D&D community, as it is referenced in multiple formats and creations that cater to the players of the game. Furthermore, both the \\"D&D\\" community and players are known to be highly engaged in various campaign settings, eagerly exploring and appreciating the diverse, intricate worlds created for playing. This reinforces the assumption that Faerûn is indeed well-known among D&D players. In summary, given the strong connection between the Faerûn subcontinent and \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\" in the provided text, combined with the D&D community's interest in campaign settings and the extensive amount of source material available, it is appropriate and coherent to conclude that Faerûn is well-known among D&D players."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Combine the terms involving 'a' on the right-hand side of the equation: -20*a = -23*a - 107*a + 2310 -20*a = (-23 - 107)*a + 2310 -20*a = -130*a + 2310 2.

To do this, we'll add 130*a to both sides of the equation: -20*a + 130*a = -130*a + 130*a + 2310 (130-20)*a = 2310 110*a = 2310 3.

Hometown of Mayor Dan Reed looks forward to each year with enthusiasm to all the events, friends and family that fill this special season. Together with his brother Greg, they dedicate time away from their adventure tour company to drape the town is Christmas cheer. When Dan's old high school rival Mitch Bright, a mean-spirited and embittered militant atheist returns home after 20 years, Dan is immediately suspicious. Mitch is a highly successful big city lawyer who has never wanted anything to do with Trapper Falls. The rivalry re-ignites when the frustrated Mitch takes offense to what he sees as the town's violation of his rights. Mitch wants the Nativity scene removed from the front of City hall and the word Christmas switched to Happy Holidays on all signs. Fifty years of tradition are now challenged not by an outsider, but a former member of the community. As the conflict escalates, it goes beyond one person's opinion but magnifies into an entire town problem when Mitch enters into the mayoral race to have Dan replaced. In the heat of the legal battle and facing certain defeat, Dan's wife Kristen and their daughter Makayla, wanting to show what she believes to be the true meaning of Christmas, are inspired to launch a \\"Christmas with a Capital C\\" campaign as an effort to keep the town together. In doing so they discover the secret behind Mitch's return: he is looking for love and acceptance, but can't find it in the world of high-flown success., what would be the answer ?

For a long time, I thought it was me. I thought maybe it was my age. After reading every book and article I could find on sex, relationships, and marriage, I started to wonder if maybe it wasn’t me. Maybe it was my marriage, maybe it was my husband. I never wanted to be “that woman“. The one that screwed around on her husband. But, I had an affair about six or seven years ago. It didn’t last long. But, that’s when I knew my marriage was over. It wasn’t a lack of sexual desire, it was a lack of desire for my husband. I didn’t want him or the marriage. There was nothing wrong with my sex drive. I told my husband that I’d had an affair. He changed for about a month or so. He was very loving and attentive. But it didn’t last. He loves differently than I need to be loved and it’s just not in him to love me that way. A few months after I ended the affair, I got involved with someone else. I know. I shouldn’t have. I’ve experienced things with this other man that I never thought possible. Felt things I thought were only possible in movies. He’s a romantic. Not flowers or candy or jewellery, but he talks and listens. He hears me. He tries to understand me and give me what I need. Deep, intimate conversations. Looking into one another’s eyes. Soft caresses. Words of adoration. These things he gives me almost daily. I never knew I needed romance because I’d never had it. This is how I need to be loved. After having felt this way, I can’t stay in my marriage. It’s not fair to either of us. I’m not sure what happened. Did we grow apart? Did one or both of us change?

Twenty-four hours of silence (vacuum, remember); was I hallucinating noises now? I heard it again. It was a fine bell, reminiscent of ancient stone churches and the towering cathedrals I'd seen in documentaries. And accompanying the bell, I saw a light. Now, there were two things here that made ridiculously small amounts of sense. First, the whole in-a-vacuum why's-there-a-bell thing. Second, I was floating in the dark remnants of my broken ship, and any conceivable light sources were not within view; starlight is a distinctly different color and significantly less bright. These signals were the heralds of my saviors. The first words they said to me meant nothing. I wasn't listening; I didn't care; I was going to live; I was going to keep breathing. Next to those, nothing else mattered. The recycled air tasted sweet in my mouth, and all thoughts that crossed my mind were cheap metaphors about life-giving substances and how breathing was like sex, only better. (I reserved the right to revise this opinion later.) When I was done mentally exclaiming over my impossible rescue, I looked around. The ship, it was odd and old, either so outdated or so heavily modified that I couldn't tell what make it was, and somehow, the crew standing around me fit the same description, a singularly atypical amalgamation of folk. And me, I guess I was one more piece in their puzzle. I was one more scrap to weld onto the rest, one more stranded survivor who was found. I was now one of them.

First, let's simplify the equation: -6*x + 0*x is the same as -6x because when you multiply 0 with x, it equals 0, and when you add 0 to anything, it doesn't change. So now we have -6x - 6 = 0. Now let's solve for x: Step 1: Add 6 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the -6. -6x - 6 + 6 = 0 + 6, which is -6x = 6. Step 2: Now let's get rid of the -6 in front of the x by dividing both sides of the equation by -6. (-6x) / (-6) = 6 / (-6). This gives us x = -1.

He has received a manuscript of a play called Deathtrap written by one of his students, Clifford Anderson, that he considers near perfection.

Myra tries desperately over the course of an evening to convince Sidney to work with Clifford as equal partners, but to no avail; Sidney attacks Clifford, strangling him with a chain. Sidney removes the body but still has to convince Myra to conspire with him. She reveals nothing when they receive an unexpected visit from the psychic Helga Ten Dorp (Irene Worth), a minor celebrity who is staying with the Bruhls' neighbors. Helga senses pain and death in the house; before she leaves she warns Sidney about a man in boots who will attack him. As she prepares for bed, Myra is beginning to come to terms with what Sidney has done. All is calm until Clifford bursts through the bedroom window and beats Sidney with a log.

Question: I can use this background: The refraction of waves across boundaries operates similarly to the method by which tanks are steered. Tanks do not have a steering wheel. Instead, they have an accelerator to produce forward motion and separate brakes on each tread. The operator uses brakes on both treads at the same time in order to stop, but brakes on only one tread to turn the tank. By braking one side, the operator causes that side to slow down or stop while the other side continues at the previous speed, causing the tank to turn towards the slower tread.  Now, I have a new situation: Benjamin is taking an Army training class and is learning to operate a tank. Today, he is in a tank with an instructor on a training course. Benjamin drives the tank forward and comes to a large dirt mound blocking his path. He needs to decide whether to break the left tread or right tread.

This process often involves physical motions with objects, such as moving them, arranging them in a certain way, mixing them, shaking them, etc.  Problem:How can I clean my shoes Solution:","output":"1. Gather Your Materials: Start the process by gathering your shoe cleaning materials. You'll at least need a brush (soft bristle for delicate materials, medium or hard bristle for more resistant footwear), a shoe cleaning solution, a towel, and water. If the shoes are very stained, you might also need baking soda or toothpaste.  2. Remove the Laces: To ensure you're able to clean every part of the shoe effectively, it's best to remove the shoelaces. This allows you to clean the tongue of the shoe and the area beneath the laces thoroughly. You can clean the laces separately using soap and water, or replace them if they're old and frayed. 3. Brush off Excess Dirt: Brush the shoes gently to remove any dry, loose dirt. This step helps prevent you from rubbing grit into the shoes as you clean. It's just a surface level cleaning to prepare the shoes for washing.  4. Apply Your Cleaning Solution: Create a cleaning mixture with your shoe cleaning solution and water following the instructions on the product package. If you're using household products, a combination of warm water and a small amount of dish detergent can work as well. Once created, dip your brush into the solution. 5. Begin Scrubbing: Use the brush to gently scrub the surface of the shoes. Start at the soles and work your way up. Pay particular attention to stains and scuffs, you might need to scrub harder at those spots. 6. Wipe and Rinailse: After making sure you've scrubbed the entire surface of your shoes, use a damp cloth or sponge to wipe off the soapy solution. If necessary, rinse the shoes under a gentle stream of cold water. Be sure not to soak them, as this could damage some types of shoes. 7. Dry the Shoes: Pat the shoes dry with a towel to remove excess moisture. Then, leave them in a well-ventilated area to air dry. Avoid leaving them in direct sunlight or near a heat source, which could distort the shape and cause damage. You can stuff the shoes with newspaper or a dry towel to help them retain their shape as they dry. 8. Replace the Laces: Once the shoes are dry, replace the laces if you've also cleaned and dried them or if you've bought new ones. Justifying each step, the process is laid out in such a manner that it allows you to gather all necessary materials before beginning to prevent interruption. Removing the laces ensures that the entire material of the shoe can be cleaned and not just the visible parts. Brushing off excess dirt ensures that the cleaning solution can work directly on the stains rather than on surface grime. Rinsing and drying properly prevent water marks and damage to the shoes, round off the process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

His main focus is the long-suspected connections between macabre rituals and unexplained phenomena in the town. The townsfolk are wary of outsiders, but Dr. Harris is determined to uncover their secretive past. One day, while examining artifacts in the dense woods surrounding Willowbrook, Dr. Harris comes across a gruesome sight: Sydney Campbell's severed arm, dangling from a tree. Sydney, a young and curious journalist, had arrived in Willowbrook weeks earlier to investigate the same mysteries. The news of her disappearance had shaken the town, and the police had given up searching when they found no leads. The discovery of her severed arm, however, reopens the case. Dr. Harris teams up with Lila Dawson, the local librarian, who believes that there is more to the town than meets the eye. They delve deeper into Willowbrook's history, discovering a clandestine sect that practices ancient rituals in an attempt to remain in control. The sect's members are willing to go to any lengths to keep their activities secret, including silencing individuals that come too close to uncovering the truth. After a series of tragic incidents, it becomes clear that their followers are deeply entrenched in the community, which forces Dr. Harris and Lila into a dangerous game of deception and intrigue as they risk it all to expose the truth. In a heart-stopping climax, Dr. Harris and Lila enter the hidden lair of the sect, where they find evidence of their involvement in Sydney's murder and the unexplained phenomena in Willowbrook. With the help of local authorities, they manage to dismantle the organization, putting an end to the reign of terror that had gripped the town. As the town slowly recovers, Dr. Harris leaves Willowbrook with newfound knowledge and a deep understanding of the darkness that human beings can summon. He publishes his findings, bringing closure to Sydney's family and inspiring other researchers to delve into the unexplored parts of human history. \\"The Lurking Shadows\\" is a gripping tale of mystery, ancient rituals, and humanity's thirst for power.

Question: what is feedback mechanism in plants during respiration I found the following answer on Google: This difference is because it occurs in many separate steps. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"No, the answer you found on Google does not correctly explain the feedback mechanism in plants during respiration. Let me provide you with a more detailed and comprehensive answer. Respiration is the process by which plants produce energy by breaking down glucose molecules in the presence of oxygen, resulting in the formation of carbon dioxide, water, and usable energy (ATP). A feedback mechanism in the context of respiration refers to a regulatory system that monitors and maintains the balance between the processes of respiration and photosynthesis. Plant respiration is tightly regulated by various feedback mechanisms that involve sensors, signaling pathways, and regulatory molecules. The main feedback mechanism during plant respiration is based on concentrations of cellular components and gases like oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Here's an overview of the feedback mechanism that occurs during plant respiration: 1. Oxygen (O2) Concentration: Respiration depends on the availability of oxygen. A decrease in oxygen concentration signals the plant to lower its respiration rate, saving energy and preventing the production of harmful reactive oxygen species. Conversely, increased oxygen concentrations encourage higher respiration rates, supporting active growth and metabolism. 2. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Concentration: Plants monitor the concentration of CO2 in their cells, as it is a key component in photosynthesis and a byproduct of respiration. If the concentration of CO2 increases due to higher-than-normal respiration rates, the plant adjusts its processes to avoid excess CO2 buildup. This may involve altering the balance between photosynthesis and respiration rates or opening stomatal pores to release excess CO2. 3. Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) Concentrations: The primary purpose of respiration is to produce ATP, which serves as an energy currency for the plant's cellular processes. Plant cells sense the relative concentration of ATP and ADP molecules. When ATP levels are high, respiration may slow down to conserve energy and resources. Conversely, if ATP levels are low, and ADP levels are high, the plant may increase its respiration rate to generate more ATP for energy-demanding processes. 4. Allosteric Regulation of Enzymes: In addition to sensing the concentration of gases and energy molecules, plants also regulate respiration by modulating the activity of enzymes involved in the process. Key enzymes, like cytochrome c oxidase and pyruvate dehydrogenase, are sensitive to feedback inhibition or activation, allowing the plant to fine-tune its respiration rate according to its needs. For example, high concentrations of ATP may inhibit specific enzymes in the respiratory pathway, thereby slowing down the production of ATP and conserving energy. In summary, the feedback mechanism in plants during respiration is a complex regulatory system that involves monitoring and adjusting the respiration rate based on the concentration of oxygen, carbon dioxide, ATP, and ADP, as well as the allosteric regulation of enzymes. This ensures that plants maintain a balance between respiration and photosynthesis, optimizing growth, and functioning under changing environmental conditions. The answer you found on Google does not accurately describe this intricate feedback process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Information:  - A BMX bike is an off-road sport bicycle used for racing and stunt riding. BMX means bicycle motocross.  - Raymon van der Biezen ( born January 14 , 1987 in Heesch ) is a Dutch BMX racer . Van der Biezen reached the semi final of the 2008 World Championship in Taiyuan , China . He qualified himself for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing .  - BMX racing is a type of off-road bicycle racing. The format of BMX was derived from motocross racing. BMX bicycle races are sprint races on purpose-built off-road single-lap race tracks. The track usually consists of a starting gate for up to eight racers, a groomed, serpentine, dirt race course made of various jumps and rollers and a finish line. The course is usually flat, about wide and has large banked corners that help the riders maintain speed.  The sport of BMX racing is facilitated by a number of regional and international sanctioning bodies. They provide rules for sanctioning the conduct of the flying, specify age group and skill-level classifications among the racers, and maintain some kind of points-accumulation system over the racing season. The sport is very family oriented and largely participant-driven, with riders ranging in age from 2 to 70, and over. Professional ranks exist for both men and women, where the age ranges from 18 to 40 years old.  - Motocross is a form of off-road motorcycle racing held on enclosed off-road circuits. The sport evolved from motorcycle trials competitions held in the United Kingdom.  - BMX, an abbreviation for bicycle motocross, is a cycle sport performed on BMX bikes, either in competitive BMX racing or freestyle BMX, or else in general on- or off-road recreation. BMX began when young cyclists appropriated motocross tracks for fun, racing and stunts, eventually evolving specialized BMX bikes and competitions.  - Freestyle BMX is bicycle motocross stunt riding on BMX bikes. It is an extreme sport descended from BMX racing that consists of five disciplines: street, park, vert, trails, and flatland.  - Cycle sport is competitive physical activity using bicycles. There are several categories of bicycle racing including road bicycle racing, time trialling, cyclo-cross, mountain bike racing, track cycling, BMX, and cycle speedway. Non-racing cycling sports include artistic cycling, cycle polo, freestyle BMX and mountain bike trials. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) is the world governing body for cycling and international competitive cycling events. The International Human Powered Vehicle Association is the governing body for human-powered vehicles that imposes far fewer restrictions on their design than does the UCI. The UltraMarathon Cycling Association is the governing body for many ultra-distance cycling races.    'raymon van der biezen' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'sport'?

Article: The status of the town was changed by a later charter of Charles I by at once the formal separation from Portsmouth and the recognition of Southampton as a county, In the charter dated 27 June 1640 the formal title of the town became 'The Town and County of the Town of Southampton'. These charters and Royal Grants, of which there were many, also set out the governance and regulation of the town and port which remained the 'constitution' of the town until the local government organisation of the later Victorian period which from about 1888 saw the setting up of County Councils across England and Wales and including Hampshire County Council who now took on some of the function of Government in Southampton Town. In this regime, The Town and County of the Town of Southampton also became a county borough with shared responsibility for aspects of local government.

Process: - Owls hunt around their hunting territory away from where they roost during the day - They sit still on a perch, like a stump of branch, and wait for prey - They use their highly sensitive hearing to locate prey that cannot be seen - They use their very keen vision to see prey in the dark - They fly silently, without flapping their wings, in order to surprise the prey - The owl silently glides or drops on its prey, grabbing it with its talons and beak - The owl eats the prey, or carries it back to its perch -   Question: suppose more heavy exercising happens, how will it affect Owls will become more sickened.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"The question seems to be asking about the impact of increased heavy exercise on owls and how it might affect their ability to become sickened as well as the potential impact on their hunting process, specifically the second effect mentioned - sitting still on a perch and waiting for prey.  First, it's essential to understand that owls are wild animals with specific hunting and survival strategies. They naturally engage in a level of physical activity best suited to their survival. If the situation requires, owls might indulge in more aggressive hunting behavior and increased physical activity to meet their energy and nutritional needs. However, imposing artificial heavy exercise on owls could potentially have negative consequences on their overall health and behavior. Increased heavy exercise could lead to higher energy expenditure, potentially causing owls to require additional food intake to meet the increased caloric needs. This increased need for food could place greater pressure on the owl to hunt more frequently and possibly deviate from their typical hunting strategies. As the question addresses the influence of the perturbation on the second effect mentioned (sitting still on a perch and waiting for prey), we can assume increased heavy exercise might cause the owl to become more restless or less patient while waiting for prey. This could potentially lead to less effective hunting due to an inability to remain still and inconspicuous or a reduction in the amount of time spent waiting for prey to approach. Now, let's address how this exercise-induced change in hunting behavior could influence the owl's susceptibility to becoming sickened. If the owl cannot hunt effectively due to the inability to sit still or wait patiently on a perch, it may consume less food, leading to malnutrition, decreased immune system function, and an increased risk of disease or illness. Moreover, excessive physical activity could also cause stress, further impacting the owl's immune function. Therefore, based on the potential challenges and changes in hunting behavior caused by increased heavy exercise, it is reasonable to assume that the owls' risk of becoming sickened would be affected in a \\"more\\" way – implying a higher probability of illness or disease. In conclusion, imposing unnatural heavy exercise on owls could potentially disrupt their hunting habits, most notably, their ability to sit still on a perch and wait for prey. This disruption could negatively influence their overall health and make them more susceptible to sickness. The supposed perturbation would likely have a \\"more\\" effect on the owls' risk of becoming sickened."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Which entity is this text about? Steven David \\"Steve\\" Levitt (born May 29, 1967) is an American economist known for his work in the field of crime, in particular on the link between legalized abortion and crime rates. Winner of the 2003 John Bates Clark Medal, he is currently the William B. Ogden Distinguished Service Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago, director of the Becker Center on Chicago Price Theory at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. He was co-editor of the Journal of Political Economy published by the University of Chicago Press until December 2007. With journalist Stephen J. Dubner, he co-authored the best-selling book Freakonomics (2005) and its sequels SuperFreakonomics (2009) See The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime for a detailed discussion of the issue.  Revisiting a question first studied empirically in the 1960s, Donohue and Levitt argued that the legalization of abortion can account for almost half of the reduction in crime witnessed in the 1990s. This paper has sparked much controversy, to which Levitt has said  \\"The numbers we're talking about, in terms of crime, are absolutely trivial when you compare it to the broader debate on abortion. From a pro-life view of the world: If abortion is murder then we have a million murders a year through abortion. And the few thousand homicides that will be prevented according to our analysis are just nothing--they are a pebble in the ocean relative to the tragedy that is abortion. So, my own view, when we [did] the study and it hasn't changed is that: our study shouldn't change anybody's opinion about whether abortion should be legal and easily available or not. It's really a study about crime, not abortion.\\"  In 2003, Theodore Joyce argued that legalized abortion had little impact on crime, contradicting Donohue and Levitt's results (\\"Did Legalized Abortion Lower Crime?\\" Journal of Human Resources, 2003, 38(1), pp. 1 -37.). In 2004, the authors published a response, in which they claimed Joyce's argument was flawed due to omitted-variable bias.  In November 2005, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston economist Christopher Foote and his research assistant Christopher Goetz, published a working paper, in which they argued that the results in Donohue and Levitt's abortion and crime paper were due to statistical errors made by the authors: the omission of state-year interactions and the use of the total number of arrests instead of the arrest rate in explaining changes in the murder rate. When the corrections were made, Foote and Goetz argued that abortion actually increased violent crime instead of decreasing it and did not affect property crime. They even concluded that the majority of women who had abortions in the 1970s were middle class whites rather than low income minorities as Levitt stated; this was, they stated, because white middle class women had the financial means for an abortion. The Economist remarked on the news of the errors that \\"for someone of Mr Levitt's iconoclasm and ingenuity, technical ineptitude is a much graver charge than moral turpitude. To be politically incorrect is one thing; to be simply incorrect quite another.\\" In January 2006, Donohue and Levitt published a response, in which they admitted the errors in their original paper but also pointed out Foote and Goetz's correction was flawed due to heavy attenuation bias. The authors argued that, after making necessary changes to fix the original errors, the corrected link between abortion and crime was now weaker but still statistically significant, contrary to Foote and Goetz's claims. Foote and Goetz, however, soon produced a rebuttal of their own and showed that even after analyzing the data using the methods that Levitt and Donohue recommend, the data does not show a positive correlation between abortion rates and crime rates. They are quick to point out that this does not necessarily disprove Levitt's thesis, however, and emphasize that with data this messy and incomplete, it is in all likelihood not even possible to prove or disprove Donohue and Levitt's conclusion.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Muscat in the sunny Sultanate is a well-kept secret “THE Sultan is close friends with the Queen,” says my local guide, Batir. We Brits are very popular in Oman, even if most of us have barely heard of the place. Exploring this safe, smart and friendly corner of the Middle East feels like stumbling across a closely-kept secret — an old Arabia I had thought was all but lost. But apparently the royals have been escaping to the mysterious sunny sultanate for decades, with the most recent visit from Prince Charles and Camilla in October. It’s the ideal destination for a winter warmer, with some of the best beaches on the Arabian Peninsula bathed in constant sunshine and served by a handful of world-class hotels. And with Oman Air and now British Airways offering direct daily flights from Heathrow to the capital, Muscat, it’s just seven hours to summery sun, glistening sea and lots of sand. Like most people visiting Oman, I made my jumping-off point Muscat, a city of neat neighbourhoods spread over a wide coastal area with a skyline pierced by domes and minarets. As I pulled back the curtains at the Crowne Plaza Muscat on my first day, green parakeets and blue Indian rollers flitted across Al Qurum Bay, welcoming me to the subtropics. Oman Tours picked me up for sightseeing trip, heading straight for the nearby Royal Opera House. It’s an oddity in the Middle East, where such temples to music are forbidden under Islam. This one only exists thanks to the Sultan’s love of music. Muscat’s main attraction is the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque, with a Swarovski crystal chandelier and the world’s second-largest Persian rug. The small Bait Al Zubair Museum gives tourists a good grounding in all l things Omani. On the old Muscat waterfront we visited the atmospheric Muttrah Souk, packed with produce including burning frankincense wafting through the labyrinth of lanes. Nearby, I sampled home-cooked Omani cuisine at Bait Al Luban restaurant, hidden in an antique house. The Shangri-La Barr Al Jissah, which combines three hotels in one resort, occupies one of the prettiest spots along Muscat’s coastline. I spent the day wandering through the arches and fountain-filled courtyards of the Arabian palace-style Al Hisn hotel, perched on sea cliffs. Below, the Sea of Oman is a vibrant underwater world, with dolphins, rays, turtles, whale sharks and little reef fish such as blue tangs and puffers. On a dive and snorkelling trip with Oman Sail I was in luck, as a huge pod of playful dolphins arrived to perform tricks in our wake. Oman Sail’s world-class dive centre is based at the Millennium Al Mussanah Resort, about an hour’s drive north of Muscat. From here dive guide Richard led us to the underwater Eden of the Daymaniyat Islands. Diving into the Unesco-protected marine reserve felt like plunging into an aquarium, with great clouds of fish. Back on dry land, Oman’s dashing dunes are another natural highlight. I went quad biking and dune-bashing in the rolling sands, and cycled along the winding paths, enjoying the breeze and Martian-like scenery. In Oman’s cultural centre, Nizwa, I visited the morning cattle market, part of one of Arabia’s oldest souks, where you can buy anything from meat and fruit to incense and coffee pots. Childhood dream Towering over the souk, Nizwa’s fortress is a fine example of an Arabian castle, honey-coloured and round, with a wonderful warren within. Oman has castles in spades. I visited a cluster of them in the historic Al Batinah region, near Muscat. Al Hazm fort was a childhood dream of hidden rooms, staircases and dark passages. At nearby Rustaq fort, bats stirred in the darkness as I descended the stone steps into the bowels of the castle. After exploring ruins in white heat, a trip to the oasis of Ain Thowarah put spring back in my step. But my favourite Omani oasis, just east of Nizwa, was Birkat Al Mawz, an ancient plantation of date palms, banana and mango trees watered by stone aqueducts. Oman is roughly the size of the UK and I only glimpsed a fraction of the country in my week-long trip, but I managed to have an epic sand-and-sandals adventure — all within an hour-and-a-half’s drive from Muscat.

Only the genre's most popular jukebox selections were tabulated, with the chart titled \\"Most Played Juke Box Folk Records\\". The chart length was not standardized; a given week had anywhere from two to eight positions.  For approximately ten years, from 1948 to 1958, \\"Billboard\\" used three charts to measure the popularity of a given song. In addition to the jukebox chart, these charts included:  The names of each chart changed slightly during each chart's life. The \\"jukebox\\" chart – which by 1956 was known as \\"Most Played C&W in Juke Boxes\\" – ended on June 17, 1957. The \\"best sellers\\" and \\"jockeys\\" charts continued until October 13, 1958.  Starting with the October 20, 1958 issue, \\"Billboard\\" began combining sales and radio airplay in figuring a song's overall popularity, counting them in one single chart called \\"Hot C&W Sides\\". The chart began with a standard length of 30 positions each week. The name of the chart, and the number of positions varied through the years: Its name was switched to \\"Hot Country Singles\\" on November 3, 1962; it was expanded to 50 slots on January 11, 1964; then 75 on October 15, 1966; and finally 100 beginning July 14, 1973. 1. what is the number one song on the Hot Country Songs chart in this article? 2. as of what date? 3. how many positions are on that chart? 4. does it include streaming data too? 5. who publishes it? 6. is that a tv show? 7. what is it? 8. when did they start tracking the popularity of country songs? 9. what three charts did they use to measure a songs popularity? 10. how long did they use those for? 11. what years did it span? 12. when did the jukebox chart end? 13. did the other charts end at the same time? 14. when did they end? 15. how many positions did the new C&W chart have? 16. when did they start that? 17. did they ever expand the position count? 18. to what? 19. what was the chart named in 1962?

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Teacher:In this task, you are given an input list. A list contains several comma-separated items written within brackets. You need to return the count of all the numerical elements in the given list. Return 0 if no numerical element in the list. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: ['9697', '2213', '1925', 'Y', 's', 'L', 'A', '2703', '6801', '7431', 'L', 'U', '1893', 'c', 'c', 'Y', 'c', 'u', '5603', 'W', 'M', '1863', 'A', '9285', '3613', '7277'] Student:","output":"Alright, let's start by understanding the problem. We have a list of comma-separated items, and the task is to return the count of numerical elements in the list. Here is how I think we can solve this problem step by step: Step 1: Initialize a counter variable \`num_count\` to 0.  Step 2: Traverse the list. For each item in the list, check if it is numerical.  Step 3: In Python, we can do this by using the \`isnumeric()\` string method, which returns True if all the characters are numbers, False otherwise. We will use it in the if condition to increase the count of \`num_count\`. Step 4: After the traversal is complete, return the value of \`num_count\`, which holds the total count of numerical elements in the list. Here is the Python code for these steps: \`\`\`python def count_numerical(list):     num_count = 0          for item in list:         if item.isnumeric():             num_count += 1                  return num_count input_list = ['9697', '2213', '1925', 'Y', 's', 'L', 'A', '2703', '6801', '7431', 'L', 'U', '1893', 'c', 'c', 'Y', 'c', 'u', '5603', 'W', 'M', '1863', 'A', '9285', '3613', '7277'] print(count_numerical(input_list)) \`\`\` The function count_numerical() receives a list, iterates over every element and checks if the current element is numeric. If it is, then it increments the counter, and at the end, it returns the count of numeric elements.  This solution works because each item in the list is string. Even the numbers are represented as strings, therefore we can use the isnumeric() method to check if a certain string represents a number.  The time complexity of this code is O(n). It traverses the list only once, where n is the size of the list. The isnumeric() method also works in constant time, so the time complexity doesn't increase.  The space complexity is O(1). Only a single extra variable is used, so the space complexity is constant.  This code should solve the task. Let's run this code and get the answer.  In the given list, there are 13 items which are numerical. So the answer should be 13."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Summarize the following: Look within yourself to decide how comfortable you feel opening up to someone. You may feel more vulnerable at some times than you do at others, and it's okay to guard yourself when you don't feel comfortable. Identify what you are comfortable with, as well as what makes you uncomfortable.  Each time you're with someone, take small steps to push yourself to get closer to them while still honoring your comfort level. You might start by offering a nice comment to a coworker. On another encounter, you might offer them a small token of friendship, such as a donut or coffee. When you feel ready, you could invite them to do something. Smile and greet people when you see them. If someone makes small talk with you, participate in the conversation instead of giving them one-word replies. When you see someone you know, take a minute to say hello and ask how they are. If you’re shy, you might be used to minding your own business in public, so start slowly. Work on making eye contact and smiling. When you feel more comfortable, start chatting with people more often. Be willing to meet new people and expand your social horizons. See the good side of your friends and acquaintances, and take an optimistic view of your relationships. If any new opportunities or invitations come your way, accept them. For instance, if your classmate asks you to study with her later, say yes, even if you aren’t sure you’ll like it. Give her (and yourself) a chance. Build connections with other people by being interested in them. Try to find out more about your acquaintances’ goals, families, likes, and dislikes. When you’re with your friends, ask them about any projects they’ve been working on or issues they’ve been dealing with lately.  For instance, you could ask something like, “Why did you decide to major in architecture?” or “How are you liking your new apartment?” Of course, you don’t want to ask anything too personal, like “Why are you getting divorced?” unless you know the person well and get the sense that they want to talk about it with you. To maintain a friendship, asking questions isn’t enough – you’ve got to talk about yourself, too. As you get to know people, share more of your thoughts and personality quirks. Opening up to others will make them feel like you’re invested in the relationship.  For instance, if your closest pals are sharing their dreams, it might be nice to share your own. You might say, \\"You know I've always secretly dreamed of spending a year traveling the world.\\" Consider telling your close friends that you’re trying to stop pushing others away. That will help your friends understand you better. They may even be able to help you, if you let them. Once you’ve connected with someone, do your best to keep them in your life. Don’t cancel social plans you’ve made, even if you feel anxious. Respond to your friends promptly when they reach out to you, and if you don’t hear from someone for a while, call or text them yourself.  Keeping in touch with people can be hard work, especially if you’re used to ducking out of relationships when you get uncomfortable. However, if you want to keep people around, you’ve got to stay on their radar. If you’re really not feeling up to talking, don’t leave your friends hanging. Say something like, “I can’t meet up today, but I’d love to see you soon. How about Thursday?” If you’ve let things lapse with someone you care about, call them up or email them. Explain why you pushed them away, and apologize for any hurt you caused them. If they’re willing to revive the relationship, promise to treat them better in the future.  If a former friend doesn’t want to revive the friendship, accept their answer and leave them alone, but let them know they can contact you if they change their mind. Keep in mind that apologizing won’t fix a broken relationship overnight. To make things right in the long term, you’ll have to be a better friend from here on out.","output":"To build and maintain healthy social connections, start by assessing your comfort level with opening up to others. Understand that it is normal to feel vulnerable at times and protect yourself when you don't feel at ease. Gradually push yourself to get closer to others by offering compliments, small tokens of friendship, and participating in conversations when you are comfortable doing so. Remember to smile and greet people. Work on making eye contact and engaging in small talk. As you gain confidence, be open to meeting new people, expanding your social circle, and being optimistic about your relationships. Accept new opportunities and invitations to strengthen connections. Show genuine interest in others by asking about their goals, families, likes, and dislikes, but avoid asking questions that are too personal unless they seem willing to discuss them with you. In addition to asking questions, share more about yourself as you get to know people, which will help build trust and investment in the relationship. Inform your close friends about any personal struggles you may have, like pushing people away, so they can better understand you and possibly offer support. Once you have connected with someone, make efforts to stay in touch and keep them in your life. Respond to your friends promptly when they reach out, and initiate contact when you haven't heard from them in a while. Avoid canceling social plans due to anxiety and always offer an alternative if you can't make it. Consistently maintaining connections may be challenging, but it's crucial for keeping people around. If you have previously pushed people away, consider reaching out to them, apologizing for any hurt caused, and explaining your actions. Be prepared for the possibility that they might not be willing to revive the relationship. However, if they are, commit to being a better friend moving forward.

The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.  Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Sri Maharajah, swapped allegiance to the Islam after marrying into the faith\\" correctly answer the question \\"Who was responsible for a swap in all in allegiance and by what means?\\"?

The response \\"Sri Maharajah, swapped allegiance to the Islam after marrying into the faith\\" correctly answers the question \\"Who was responsible for a swap in all in allegiance and by what means?\\" because the paragraph states that the new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. This means that he changed his loyalty to Islam after his marriage connected him to the Muslim faith.

Please answer this question: What American city produces most of the egg rolls sold in grocery stores in the United States?","output":"The American city that produces most of the egg rolls sold in grocery stores in the United States is Houston, Texas. An important reason for this is the existence of a massive food manufacturing company named Windsor Foods, which is a leading producer of frozen specialty foods, including various types of Asian appetizers like egg rolls. The company operates several manufacturing facilities throughout the United States, but their largest facility that produces egg rolls is located in Houston. Windsor Foods, now a part of Ajinomoto Foods North America, has been dedicated to producing quality, frozen Asian cuisine, including egg rolls, potstickers, and wontons, for both consumers and foodservice industries. Though their Houston facility specializes in producing egg rolls, they have a wide range of products that cater to different tastes and regions. Houston has become a major hub for such production due to its strategic location, well-established infrastructure, diverse workforce, and easy access to raw materials and logistics networks. The city's proximity to major transportation routes, such as ports and highways, allows for seamless distribution of goods across the country and even to international markets. Additionally, Houston's diverse population and cultural melting pot provide a rich source of skilled labor and expertise in various types of cuisine, including Asian food. Thus, the Houston-based facility of Windsor Foods plays a significant role in producing and supplying egg rolls to grocery stores all over the United States. The company's long-standing commitment to quality and innovation, coupled with the advantages of the city's strategic location and infrastructure, has led Houston to play this crucial role in the American grocery supply chain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: He told the Welsh Tories in Llangollen that Wales' future depended on voters making the \\"right choices\\" in the assembly election and EU referendum. The prime minister stressed the value of the EU to farmers in particular. Ex-Welsh Secretary David Jones said he was \\"disappointed\\" Mr Cameron used his platform to promote the EU cause when the party was supposed to be neutral. Addressing party members on Friday, the prime minister said: \\"Let us remember - this isn't some abstract question. \\"These are actually people's jobs, people's livelihoods, people's life chances, people's families we're talking about. \\"I say don't put them at risk - don't take this leap in the dark.\\" Mr Cameron added that he \\"loved Britain, not Brussels\\", but felt it was in the national interest to stay in the EU. Clwyd West MP Mr Jones - who intends to vote to leave the EU in June - said: \\"The party announced last September that it would remain neutral in the referendum campaign. \\"It is therefore very disappointing that the prime minister should use a Conservative conference to promote the Remain cause, particularly when no other speakers are being allowed to speak in favour of Brexit. \\"It is important that everyone in this debate from the leader down should play by the rules if party unity is to be maintained.\\" Two other senior Welsh Conservatives expressed \\"concern\\" and \\"surprise\\" to BBC Wales that the prime minister's speech focused on the EU rather than the assembly campaign and Welsh Tory leader Andrew RT Davies. Earlier on Friday, Mr Davies - who wants the UK to leave the EU - made no reference to the June referendum in his own address to the conference. Instead, he made his bid to win the assembly election in May, saying Welsh Labour was a \\"lazy, complacent\\" government which had \\"run out of steam\\" after 17 years in power. Aside from his comments on Europe, Mr Cameron called on voters to give the Conservatives a chance of power in Cardiff Bay, to deliver \\"real change\\" and create a Welsh \\"powerhouse\\".

Wright until 2009 ) was a chain of about 129 American retail / outlet stores established in 1998 and owned by TJX Companies . Like its sister company T.J. Maxx , AJWright sold clothing , domestics , giftware , footwear , accessories , and fragrances at prices between twenty and seventy percent below regular prices . AJWright differed from other TJX chains by refreshing its merchandise on a regular basis . For most stores , new shipments arrived every weekday . In early 2011 , TJX closed the chain 's remaining stores and converted some stores to other TJX brands . Although AJWright 's primary target market was moderate - income families , its recent expansion drew additional consumer groups . The company 's community service strategy centered on monetary donations to the Boys and Girls Club of America and other affiliates .  - Zayre was a chain of discount stores that operated in the eastern half of the United States from 1956 to 1990. The company's headquarters was in Framingham, Massachusetts. In October 1988, Zayre's parent company, Zayre Corp., sold the stores to the competing Ames Department Stores, Inc. chain, and in June 1989, Zayre Corp. merged with one of its subsidiaries, The TJX Companies, parent company of T.J. Maxx. A number of stores retained the Zayre name until 1990, by which time all stores were either closed or converted into Ames stores. (The TJX Companies, which also owns Marshalls, HomeGoods, and Sierra Trading Post, is still in operation as of 2016.)  - A department store or magazine is a retail establishment offering a wide range of consumer goods in different product categories known as \\"departments\\". In modern major cities, the department store made a dramatic appearance in the middle of the 19th century, and permanently reshaped shopping habits, and the definition of service and luxury. Similar developments were under way in London (with Whiteleys), in Paris (\\"Le Bon Marché\\" in 1852) and in New York (with Stewart's).  - Framingham is a town in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 68,318 as of the United States 2010 Census, making it the 14th most populous municipality in Massachusetts.

Problem:Paragraph: Viruses evolve extremely quickly, so reliable methods for viral host prediction are necessary to safeguard biosecurity and biosafety alike. Novel human-infecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows. Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next-generation sequencing reads. We show that deep neural architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard, homology-based algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training. We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision. Nucleotide-resolution maps of the learned associations between pathogen genomes and the infectious phenotype can be used to detect virulencerelated genes in novel agents, as we show here for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, unknown before it caused a COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

He talks to you and plays with you. He can even think for himself and figure out what you need. It may feel as if you have a considerate new brother who keeps you company all the time. But come to think of it, can you really trust him? Ever since the first robot was created decades ago, scientists have kept thinking about the task of making robots more like humans. However, as they have gotten closer to that goal, doubts have grown. According to the BBC, Japanese robot designer Masahiro Mori argues that the more lifelike robots become, the more humans feel a connection to them. But once they become too similar to humans, people begin to feel uncomfortable. This theory is what led to the creation of a brand new robot in Switzerland earlier this month. Roboy, as the new machine is called, has various human-like abilities such as hand-shaking and bicycle-riding, but instead of a skin-like covering, Roboy is wrapped in shiny white armor   that clearly shows its robot status. \\"As long as people can clearly see that the robot is a machine, even if they project their feelings into it, then they feel comfortable,\\" Rolf Pfeifer, the creator of Roboy from the University of Zurich, Switzerland, told the BBC. But the problem that people have with robots is not just with the way they look. It also has to do with the roles that they play in our lives. A survey last year of European Union countries showed that 88 percent of those interviewed agreed that robots are \\"necessary as they can do jobs that are too hard or dangerous for people\\", such as space exploration and war fighting. But when it comes to taking care of children, 60 percent said that robots should not be allowed to participate, because as robots become more advanced and complicated, parents may tend to hand over too much responsibility to them. No matter what, robots will soon enter our homes, Pfeifer said. What is not yet clear is whether they will act more like... Question: What is the purpose of the text?

Chrismansyah Rahadi ([xrisˈmanʃah raˈhadi]; 16 September 1949 – 30 March 2007), born Christian Rahadi but better known by his stage name of Chrisye ([xəˈriʃə]), was an Indonesian progressive pop singer and songwriter. In his 40-year career he won many awards and accolades; in 2011 Rolling Stone Indonesia declared him the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time. Born in Jakarta of mixed Chinese-Indonesian descent, Chrisye became interested in music at an early age. At high school he played bass guitar in a band he formed with his brother, Joris. In the late 1960s he joined Sabda Nada (later Gipsy), a band led by his neighbours, the Nasutions. In 1973, after a short hiatus, he rejoined the band to play in New York for a year. He briefly returned to Indonesia and then went back to New York with another band, the Pro's. After once again returning to Indonesia, he collaborated with Gipsy and Guruh Sukarnoputra to record the 1976 indie album Guruh Gipsy. Following the success of Guruh Gipsy, in 1977 Chrisye recorded two of his most critically acclaimed works: \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" by James F. Sundah, which eventually became his signature song, and the soundtrack album Badai Pasti Berlalu. Their success landed him a recording contract with Musica Studios, with whom he released his first solo album, Sabda Alam, in 1978. Over his almost 25-year career with Musica he recorded a further eighteen albums, and in 1980 acted in a film, Seindah Rembulan. Chrisye died in his Jakarta home on 30 March 2007 after a long battle with lung cancer. Known for his stiff stage persona and smooth vocals, Chrisye was critically acclaimed in Indonesia.

Lithuanian forces from Panevėžys, commanded by Jonas Variakojis, and from Kėdainiai numbered only about 200 men.

On February 8, during the course of a reconnaissance mission, Povilas Lukšys became the first Lithuanian soldier to die in the war.

Article: In prefix = st1 /America, drivers' education is part of regular high school curriculum. Every student in his or her second year of high school is required to take a class in driver's education. However, unlike other courses, it is not given during the regular school year. Instead, it is a summer course. The course is divided up into two parts: class time for learning laws and regulations and driving time to practise driving. Class time is not unlike any other class. The students have a text from which they study the basic laws they must know to pass the written driving test that is given to anyone wanting to get a driver's license. Driving time is a chance for the students to get behind the wheel (steering wheel) and practise starting steering, backing up, parking, switching lanes, turning corners, and all the other maneuvers required to drive a car. Each student is required to drive a total of six hours. The students are divided up into groups of four. The students and the instructor go out driving for two-hour blocks of time. Thus, each student gets half an hour driving time per outing. The instructor and \\"driver\\" sit in the front seats and the other three students sit in the back. Drivers Ed cars are unlike other cars in which they have two sets of brakes, one on the driver's side and one on the other side where the instructor sits. Thus, if the student driver should run into difficulties the instructor can take over. The car also has another special feature. On the top of the car is a sign that reads: STUDENT DRIVER. That lets nearby drivers know that they should use extra caution because the student driver is a beginning driver, not very experienced and prone to driving slowly. After the student has passed the driver's education course and reached the appropriate age to drive (this age differs in every state but in most cases the person must be 16 years old), they can go to a designated state office to take their driver's test, which is made up of an eye examination, a written test, and a road test.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Milan 0-1 Atlético Madrid Atlético Madrid must have wondered how they escaped back to the Vicente Calderón with an unlikely victory after Milan dominated possession without making the vital breakthrough. Diego Costa grabbed the only goal seven minutes from time during a rare foray into enemy territory by the visitors but Milan will look back on a first half in which they could have been home and dry by the interval. Twice they hit the woodwork, first with Kaká. Adel Taarabt teed up the Brazilian who unleashed a shot that was heading for the far top corner until Thibaut Courtois flung himself across goal to tip the ball on to the bar. In the 18th minute it was the post's turn to intervene. Taarabt was involved again, sweeping in a cross which Andrea Poli met perfectly, glancing his header down to the far bottom corner only for Milan to be denied again by the fingertips of Courtois, who got just enough on the ball to deflect it on to the post. Atlético were doing their best to disrupt Milan's rhythm with a succession of petty fouls, Emiliano Insúa seeing yellow for hacking down Mattia De Sciglio, but on the half-hour Kaká was again testing their defence. Mario Balotelli wrongfooted the visitors with a sly backheel and Kaká saw his shot whistle just over the bar. If anything, Atlético stepped up their fouling in the second half, with Balotelli their principal target, but Milan resolutely wasted every free-kick they were given. Balotelli departed after 77 minutes clutching his shoulder after another hefty challenge and was replaced by Giampaolo Pazzini. The substitution coincided with a spell of increased ambition from Atlético, who at last began to get players into the opposition half with some regularity. They almost scored in the 79th minute when Raúl García blazed over from around the penalty spot. In the 83rd minute they did make what may be the tie's decisive breakthrough. Gabi's corner from the right skimmed off the top of Ignazio Abate and Diego Costa crashed his header past the helpless Christian Abbiati.","output":"Despite dominating possession, Milan were unable to score against Atlético Madrid, who emerged victorious with a 1-0 win. Diego Costa scored the only goal seven minutes from the end. Milan hit the woodwork twice in the first half but failed to make a vital breakthrough.

Assisting Zionist causes Einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which opened in 1925, and was among its first Board of Governors. Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university. He also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs. Among those, he advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land. That should be followed, he suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which he called an \\"evil\\" that was undermining a third of the country's development. Establishing an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic, for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments, was also important. Chaim Weizmann later became Israel's first president. Upon his death while in office in November 1952 and at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion offered Einstein the position of President of Israel, a mostly ceremonial post. The offer was presented by Israel's ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who explained that the offer \\"embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons\\". Einstein declined, and wrote in his response that he was \\"deeply moved\\", and \\"at once saddened and ashamed\\" that he could not accept it.

Write highlights for this article: Andy Carroll hopes to help Sam Allardyce's rejuvenated West Ham challenge European qualification on his return to fitness. The England striker is yet to feature this term due to an ankle injury he suffered in the summer, but is now back in training. In his absence, the Hammers have beaten Liverpool and Manchester City - Premier League runners-up and winners in 2013-14 - and are fourth in the standings after nine games. Andy Carroll takes part in a West Ham training session last Friday at Chadwell Heath training ground. Carroll sprints during training as he prepares to return to action following an ankle injury. Carroll celebrates after scoring for West Ham against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light back in March. 'I think we can push right on for Europe,' Carroll told whufc.com. 'I don't see why not - I think all the lads are positive about that and I know the gaffer is too. 'We're playing fantastically. The gaffer has signed some great players and we're showing the quality we've got with the goals we're scoring. That's why we are where we are in the league.' Allardyce has often been criticised for a direct approach, with targetman Carroll key, but the likes of Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho have given the Hammers an added dimension. Diafra Sakho (left) celebrates with Aaron Cresswell after scoring for West Ham against Manchester City. Morgan Amalfitano and Enner Valencia end up in the crowd after West Ham took the lead against City. Carroll has also been keenly watching Aaron Cresswell's performances at left-back and is relishing the chance to work with a player who has delivered accurate crosses time and again this term. The 25-year-old former Newcastle and Liverpool striker added: 'We scored three headers at Burnley, and another on Saturday (against City) with Cresswell crossing the ball in. He whips them in and puts them on a plate. 'The service that everyone is putting in the box to create chances has been great. That's what I thrive on. I can't wait to be involved with that.'","output":"England striker Andy Carroll is excited to return to action after recovering from an ankle injury. He is eager to help Sam Allardyce's West Ham United secure a European qualification spot. Throughout Carroll's absence due to injury, the Hammers have impressively defeated Premier League powerhouses, such as Liverpool and Manchester City, propelling them to fourth place after just nine games. Carroll has expressed optimism about the team's European prospects on whufc.com, stating, \\"I think we can push right on for Europe. I don't see why not - I think all the lads are positive about that and I know the gaffer is too.\\"  Allardyce's strategic approach, which focuses on signing high-quality players, has paid huge dividends so far. For instance, the signings of Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho have given West Ham a significant boost. These additions, coupled with their winning performance thus far, have demonstrated the genuine talent on the roster.  Furthermore, Carroll is looking forward to playing alongside Aaron Cresswell, a left-back who has consistently provided accurate crosses throughout the season. Commenting on Cresswell's ability, Carroll states, \\"He whips them in and puts them on a plate. The service that everyone is putting in the box to create chances has been great. That's what I thrive on. I can't wait to be involved with that.\\" With Carroll eager to return and contribute to West Ham's success, the team's quest for a European qualification spot seems more achievable than ever."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Her roommates dislike her, and she spends her time visiting Birdmann (Ewen Leslie), who is attracted to her, but very respectful. Although she does not appear to return his affection, she appears to be happier when with him. Lucy responds to an ad and is invited to meet Clara (Rachael Blake), who offers her a job: freelance silver service in lingerie. Lucy agrees, and Clara tells her that she will never be penetrated during these encounters. Clara and Thomas inspect her body. Clara says she will call Lucy by the name Sarah. Lucy gets beauty treatments before arriving for the event. She is the only girl dressed in white lingerie; the other women seem to be much older, wear severe makeup, and have black lingerie designed to reveal much more than to conceal. The event is a formal dinner party at an elegant home. Lucy serves drinks for the party and goes home with the money she made from it. After one other session as a serving girl, Lucy gets a call from Clara's assistant Thomas (Eden Falk) for a different request. Lucy is driven to a country mansion, where Clara offers Lucy a new role with the clients, wherein she will drink some tea and then fall into a deep sleep. Lucy is seen lying in a large bed, sedated, as Clara leads in the man who hosted the first dinner party. After Clara reminds the man of the no-penetration rule, he tells Clara about a book his brother gave him on his thirtieth birthday, and she leaves.

Question: If your trouser fly is unfastened what should you do? - do up - tie up - zip up - pick up - button up  The best answer is Answer:","output":"The best answer is \\"zip up\\" or \\"button up,\\" depending on the type of fastening mechanism your trouser fly has.  If the fly of your trousers features a zipper, then the most appropriate course of action is to \\"zip up\\". To do this, you should follow these steps: 1. Locate the zipper tab, which is typically found at the base of the fly opening. 2. Hold the waistband of your trousers with one hand to ensure that both sides of the fly opening are properly aligned. 3. With your other hand, grasp the zipper tab firmly. 4. Slowly and carefully, pull the zipper tab upwards along the track, making sure not to snag any fabric. 5. Once the zipper is fully zipped, double-check to ensure it is secure and there are no gaps or snags in the fabric. On the other hand, if your trouser fly features buttons, the correct action to take is to \\"button up\\". In this case, you should follow these steps: 1. Ensure both sides of the fly are properly aligned. The buttonholes should be directly across from the buttons. 2. Start from the bottom button, taking it between your fingers and carefully pushing it through the corresponding buttonhole. Make sure not to force the button too hard, as this can cause the button or fabric to tear. 3. Repeat this process for each button along the fly, working your way up. Be patient, as buttoning the fly might require more dexterity due to the close proximity of buttons and fabric layers. 4.

Grind the beans until they're medium-fine which is about the size of coarse sugar. Burr grinders will give you more control over the grind and will make more uniform grounds than blade grinders will. Measure 3 tablespoons (about 30 g) of coffee grounds into the moistened filter. Shake the brewer a little so the coffee grounds are at an even level. Level grounds will make the coffee extract evenly. Then place the carafe with the brewer on a digital scale and set it to zero. You'll need to keep track of how much water you're pouring over the grounds, so the scale comes in handy.

Q:Process:  - They expand to take the air in  - The cells of the lung hold the air - They take in the air and remove the Oxygen - They inflate and all the bad air leaves through the mouth - They do it all over again.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose air is converted into oxygen in the lung happens, how will it affect lung continuously expands to make more oxygen.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis raises an interesting scenario. To analyze its effect, we need to first understand the normal processes involved in respiration. In general terms, respiration comprises of two main stages: inhalation and exhalation. During inhalation, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract, expanding the chest cavity and allowing the lungs to take in air. This air then travels down the trachea and into the bronchial tubes, which branch out into smaller bronchioles. Ultimately, the air reaches the tiny alveoli, which are small air sacs surrounded by blood vessels called capillaries. Here, gas exchange occurs as the oxygen in the air diffuses across the thin walls of the alveoli and capillaries, entering the bloodstream. At the same time, carbon dioxide (a waste product) diffuses out of the blood and into the alveoli to be exhaled. Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis: suppose the air is converted into oxygen in the lung, leading the lung to continuously expand to make more oxygen. There are several factors to consider when evaluating the possible effects of this scenario: 1. Increasing lung volume: If the lungs constantly expand to produce more oxygen, it may lead to an increase in lung volume. This could put additional pressure on the surrounding organs, and create difficulties in maintaining the structural integrity and functioning of the respiratory system. Disruption of normal diaphragm movement and problems within the chest cavity could arise. 2. Oxygen overproduction: If the lungs constantly convert air into oxygen, the oxygen concentration in the bloodstream could reach extreme levels. While oxygen is vital for our cells to function, having too much oxygen in the blood could cause oxygen toxicity and lead to various complications, such as cell damage, respiratory problems, and even seizures. 3. Disrupted gas exchange: In the perturbation hypothesis, it is unclear how carbon dioxide would be removed from the bloodstream if air is being directly converted into oxygen within the lungs. The normal process of gas exchange in the alveoli could be disrupted in this scenario, which might lead to an accumulation of carbon dioxide in the body. This could result in respiratory acidosis, a condition where blood pH drops due to increased levels of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream. 4. Energy expenditure: The continuous expansion of lungs to create more oxygen may also require an increase in the body's energy expenditure. This could impact the body's overall energy balance and may lead to a variety of effects on other physiological systems, such as an increased demand for nutrients and a need to allocate more resources for lung functioning and maintenance. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation, wherein air is converted into oxygen within the lungs, could have several direct and indirect effects on the respiratory process. The continuous expansion of the lungs to create more oxygen may result in increased lung volume and pressure on neighboring organs, disrupted gas exchange, oxygen overproduction, and an escalation in energy expenditure. Such physiological changes could significantly impact the body's normal functioning, leading to various complications and health conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"Ca'daan took a deep breath.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Ca'daan was short on breath.\\" true?","output":"Based on the premise \\"Ca'daan took a deep breath,\\" it is not possible to determine with certainty whether the hypothesis \\"Ca'daan was short on breath\\" is true. Various scenarios could lead to Ca'daan taking a deep breath, and not all of them necessarily involve being short of breath. To provide a comprehensive analysis, let's explore different situations in which Ca'daan might take a deep breath. 1. Ca'daan might be short on breath: In this case, the hypothesis would be true. Ca'daan could have been doing some physical activity or been in a tense situation, leading to shallow and rapid breathing. In a situation like this, taking a deep breath is a natural response to replenish the body's oxygen levels. 2. Ca'daan might be trying to calm down: The premise could also suggest that Ca'daan is taking a deep breath to calm down or gather their thoughts in a moment of stress, anxiety, or impatience. In this case, the hypothesis would be false as taking a deep breath is a practiced technique to help reduce stress levels and regulate emotions. 3. Ca'daan might be preparing for an action: Ca'daan might take a deep breath to prepare for some activity or event that requires them to hold their breath momentarily, such as diving underwater or playing a wind instrument. Here, the hypothesis would be false because Ca'daan is not short on breath; instead, they are consciously taking a deep breath in anticipation of an action. 4. Ca'daan might be practicing mindfulness or meditation: Deep breaths are commonly associated with mindfulness exercises or meditation practices. In this scenario, taking a deep breath would be part of the practice and not an indication that Ca'daan is short of breath. The hypothesis would be false in this case. 5. Ca'daan might be reacting to a strong smell: Another reason to take a deep breath could be that Ca'daan is experiencing a strong or pleasant smell. In this case, the hypothesis would be false because Ca'daan is not short on breath; they are merely reacting to their environment. Overall, as can be seen from these different scenarios, it is not possible to conclude whether the hypothesis \\"Ca'daan was short on breath\\" is true based solely on the premise \\"Ca'daan took a deep breath.\\" Additional context or information about the situation would be necessary to draw a definite conclusion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The event began in 1872, with interruptions only for the two World Wars. Since 1921, the game has been played at Twickenham Stadium, London. It is normally played in early December.  - The University of Oxford (informally Oxford University or simply Oxford) is a collegiate research university located in Oxford, England, United Kingdom. While having no known date of foundation, there is evidence of teaching as far back as 1096, making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation. It grew rapidly from 1167 when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris. After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled northeast to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge. The two \\"ancient universities\\" are frequently jointly referred to as \\"Oxbridge\\".  - The University of Paris, metonymically known as the Sorbonne (its historical house), was a university in Paris, France. Appearing around 1150 as a corporation associated with the Notre Dame de Paris cathedral school, it was the second-oldest modern university in Europe. Chartered in 1200 by King Philip II (Philippe-Auguste) of France and recognised in 1215 by Pope Innocent III, it was often nicknamed after its theology collegiate institution, College of Sorbonne, founded about 1257 by Robert de Sorbon.  - The Oxford University Rugby Football Club ( Oxford University RFC or OURFC ) is the rugby union club of the University of Oxford . The club contests The Varsity Match every year against Cambridge University at Twickenham .  - Rugby is a type of football developed at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, one of many versions of football played at English public schools in the 19th century. The two main types of rugby are rugby league and rugby union. Although rugby league initially used rugby union rules, they are now wholly separate sports.  - Approximately 330 to 360 million people speak English as their first language. More than half of these (231 million) live in the United States, followed by some 55 million in England, the first place where English was spoken.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - A team sport includes any sport which involves two or more players working together towards a shared objective. A team sport is an activity in which individuals are organized into opposing teams which compete to win. Examples are basketball, volleyball, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football and hockey.  - Oxford is a city in the South East region of England and the county town of Oxfordshire. With a population of 159,994 it is the 52nd largest city in the United Kingdom, and one of the fastest growing and most ethnically diverse. The city is situated from London, from Bristol, from both Southampton and Birmingham and from Reading.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Cambridge is a university city and the county town of Cambridgeshire, England, on the River Cam about north of London. At the United Kingdom Census 2011, its population was 123,867, including 24,488 students.  - Twickenham Stadium (usually known as Twickenham or Twickers) is a rugby union stadium in Twickenham, south west London, England. Owned by the governing body of rugby union in England, the Rugby Football Union (the RFU), the stadium hosts home test matches for the England national rugby union team. Other rugby union games played at the stadium include the Middlesex Sevens, the Aviva Premiership final, the LV Cup, the Varsity Match between the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and European Rugby Champions Cup matches. The RFU headquarters are based in the stadium.   - A try is a way of scoring points in rugby union and rugby league football. A try is scored by grounding the ball (the ball must be touching the player when coming into contact with the ground) in the opposition's in-goal area (on or behind the goal line). Rugby union and league differ slightly in defining 'grounding the ball' and the 'in-goal' area.  - Rugby union, or simply rugby, is a contact team sport which originated in England in the first half of the 19th century. One of the two codes of rugby football, it is based on running with the ball in hand. In its most common form, a game is between two teams of 15 players using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field with H-shaped goalposts on each try line.  - Oxbridge is a portmanteau (blend word) of the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. The term is used to refer to them collectively in contrast to other British universities and more broadly to describe characteristics reminiscent of them, often with implications of superior social or intellectual status.  - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking.

We have considered various alternatives: A joint committee on the old model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one. A single committee in each house of Congress, combining authorizing and appropriating authorities, is another. The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the House and Senate. We have already recommended that the total level of funding for intelligence be made public, and that the national intelligence program be appropriated to the National Intelligence Director, not to the secretary of defense. We also recommend that the intelligence committee should have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the budget. The resolution creating the new intelligence committee structure should grant subpoena authority to the committee or committees. The majority party's representation on this committee should never exceed the minority's representation by more than one. Four of the members appointed to this committee or committees should be a member who also serves on each of the following additional committees: Armed Services, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, and the Defense Appropriations subcommittee. In this way the other major congressional interests can be brought together in the new committee's work. Members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees, without set terms, thereby letting them accumulate expertise. The committees should be smaller-perhaps seven or nine members in each house-so that each member feels a greater sense of responsibility, and accountability, for the quality of the committee's work. The leaders of the Department of Homeland Security now appear before 88 committees and subcommittees of Congress. One expert witness (not a member of the administration) told us that this is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding the department's successful development. The one attempt to consolidate such committee authority, the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, may be eliminated. The Senate does not have even this.

This is because resistance in a wire is directly proportional to its length.

When a person consumes alcohol, it affects their central nervous system, causing disorientation as well as impairing cognitive and motor functions. Drinking alcohol can lead to the following effects that contribute to car crashes: 1. Slowed reaction time: Alcohol slows down a person's reaction time, making it more challenging to respond quickly to potential hazards on the road. 2. Impaired judgment: Alcohol impairs a person's ability to make sensible decisions which can result in risky behavior, such as speeding, tailgating, or not using seatbelts. 3. Decreased coordination: Alcohol can affect a person's coordination, which is essential for proper control of the vehicle. 4. Blurry or double vision: Alcohol can impair a person's vision, making it difficult to see and judge distances accurately. 5. Drowsiness or passing out: Alcohol consumption can make a person drowsy, increasing the risk of falling asleep at the wheel or experiencing a momentary lapse of attention, leading to a crash. While having sex, snapchatting, sickness, and throwing up can also contribute to car crashes in certain situations, disorientation is the most relevant choice as it directly relates to the impairments caused by alcohol consumption. Alcohol-induced disorientation can have various negative consequences on driving ability, making it more likely for a person to be involved in a car accident."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A well-rounded diet was more important to Joel than William, since","output":"Joel really cared about eating healthy foods, while William didn't worry about it as much. Eating a well-rounded diet means eating different kinds of foods to make sure you get all the nutrients your body needs to grow strong and stay healthy. One day, Joel and William decided to visit the magical land of Nutritionville. In this land, the food was bright, colorful, and made sure everyone had the right energy to play and have fun. The clouds in the sky were made of fluffy cotton candy, and the flowers were made of crunchy vegetables that grew bigger every time it rained. In Nutritionville, Joel liked to spend his time at the fruit playground, playing on the slides that were made of big banana peels and swinging on the apple swings. It was important for him to get vitamins and minerals from the fruits to help keep his eyes shiny and his skin glowing. William, on the other hand, preferred hanging out at the Candy Castle, where everything was made of sweet treats like chocolate and gummy bears. Although yummy, too many sweets are not very good for your body; they can make your teeth hurt and your tummy ache. Soon, Joel noticed that William was starting to feel tired and sluggish from all the candy. Joel knew that he had to help his friend understand the importance of a well-rounded diet. So he took William to the magical balanced meal buffet, where they found plates full of colorful fruits, tasty vegetables, crunchy grains, and yummy proteins like chicken and fish. As they ate, Joel explained to William that having a mix of these healthy foods would help them both stay strong, feel good, and have more energy for playing and exploring. After trying a little bit of everything, William started feeling much better, and he agreed that a well-rounded diet was important. From that day on, William and Joel made sure to eat a variety of foods in Nutritionville. They enjoyed balanced meals together and continued having fun adventures, knowing that their well-rounded diets were helping them grow strong and healthy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what can infect and destroy helper T cells?\\" is \\"cooking\\", given that  viruses can infect and destroy helper T cells? The answer is:","output":"No, the right answer to the question \\"what can infect and destroy helper T cells?\\" is not \\"cooking.\\" The correct answer in this context is \\"viruses,\\" specifically the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Helper T cells, also known as CD4+ T cells, play a crucial role in the human immune system. They are a type of white blood cell that helps coordinate the overall immune response. Their main function is to identify pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses, and to stimulate other immune cells, such as cytotoxic T cells and B cells, to attack these pathogens. Viruses, in general, can potentially infect any cell within a host, depending on the specific virus and its affinity for a particular type of cell. HIV, a type of lentivirus, targets and infects helper T cells. HIV does this by binding to specific receptors, such as the CD4 receptor, found on the surface of helper T cells. Once the virus gains entry into the helper T cell, it integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, effectively hijacking the cell's machinery to produce more copies of the virus. Eventually, the infected helper T cell is destroyed as new virus particles are continually produced, leading to a decline in the number of functional helper T cells in the body. The destruction of helper T cells by HIV weakens the immune system by interfering with its ability to coordinate an effective immune response. This can lead to the development of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which is characterized by a severely compromised immune system, making the individual vulnerable to opportunistic infections and certain types of cancer. In contrast, \\"cooking\\" refers to the process of preparing food using various techniques, such as heating, baking, frying, or boiling, which can potentially kill some microorganisms that might be present in raw food. However, cooking has no direct effect on helper T cells or their susceptibility to infection by viruses like HIV. Therefore, the right answer to the question \\"what can infect and destroy helper T cells?\\" is \\"viruses,\\" not \\"cooking.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An angry supporter of the 'Bersih' (Clean) electoral reform coalition reacts as he recovers after police fired tear gas during clashes in downtown Kuala Lumpur July 9, 2011.      KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian police fired repeated rounds of tear gas and detained over 1,400 people in the capital on Saturday as thousands of activists evaded roadblocks and barbed wire to hold a street protest against Prime Minister Najib Razak's government.      At least a dozen people were hurt in the demonstration for electoral reform in downtown Kuala Lumpur. There were no reports of serious injuries but some analysts said the police action was excessive and would dent Najib's image.      \\"We are not criminals, we are just asking for free and fair elections,\\" opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim's daughter, Nurul Izzah Anwar, told reporters after her father was knocked down and hurt in a melee when he and his supporters were tear gassed.      \\"Many innocent people were injured. We condemn this act of cruelty by UMNO and Barisan Nasional,\\" she said, referring to Najib's party and the ruling coalition.      Street protests are rare in this Southeast Asian nation, but foreign investors are worried that any groundswell of anti-government sentiment could delay economic reforms seen as essential to draw investment.      If he is put under popular pressure, Najib may reconsider plans for a snap election and hold back on reforms such as cutting fuel subsidies or unwinding an affirmative action program for the country's Malay majority.      Polls are not due until 2013 but analysts have said Najib could seek an early mandate after economic growth accelerated to a 10-year high in 2010.      \\"From Najib's perspective, holding elections anytime soon would be a mistake because of the damage that has been done today,\\" said Bridget Welsh, Malaysia specialist at Singapore Management University.      \\"The fact that such a large crowd turned up despite a crackdown shows that voter anger is deep and this is going to push a lot of people who are in the middle toward the opposition.\\"      Reuters witnesses saw tear gas shells lobbed repeatedly at groups of protesters in downtown Kuala Lumpur as the crowds chanted \\"Long Live the People\\" and \\"Reformasi, reformasi,\\" the Malay word for reform.      Several people were seen bleeding after the tear gas was fired, but police gave no details of any injuries. Crowds around the city's main bus station were also sprayed with water cannon.      Malaysia's inspector-general of police, Ismail Omar, said 1,401 people were taken into custody, but many will be released after questioning. At least three senior opposition leaders were among those detained, other officials said.      \\"We have made our point that we want free and fair elections,\\" said Chan Mei Yin, a 32-year old accountant who joined the protest.      \\"The police are just showing that they are brutal to Malaysians. I will not vote for this government.\\"      NOT THAILAND      While Malaysia is far from being divided by political strife like its northern neighbor Thailand, the opposition has been steadily growing more vocal.      Tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets at a November 2007 rally, which analysts said galvanized support for the opposition ahead of record gains in a 2008 general election.      Analysts said the turnout of protesters on Saturday was more than 10,000, around the same as in 2007. Police, however, put the number at 5,000-6,000, while protest organizers claimed 50,000 attended.      \\"Malaysian civil society is showing the government that intimidation will not work,\\" said Ooi Kee Beng, a political analyst at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies of Singapore.      \\"We're seeing a lack of will on the part of the government to try to negotiate and to defuse the situation. It's all going to look very bad outside Malaysia.\\"      After Malaysia's constitutional monarch tried to defuse the situation, the government initially offered Bersih (Clean), the group that called the protest, the use of a stadium to hold its demonstration.      But it baulked at allowing the group to use the main stadium in downtown Kuala Lumpur, at which point Bersih said it would defy the ban.      From midnight, police locked down the central shopping district of the city of 1.6 million people, setting up roadblocks and barring taxis and buses from the area. Suburban trains, however, continued to operate and other areas of the city were not affected.      Bersih has vowed to bring together tens of thousands of supporters to the protest but it fell short. Still, some analysts said the government faced a problem.      \\"Just looking at the crowd there were many 'first timers', young people from the Facebook generation who just wanted to have a peaceful life,\\" said Ibrahim Suffian, director of the independent opinion polling outfit Merdeka Center.      \\"This is trouble for Najib as it will polarize traditionally non-political segments of society like the young even further away from him.\\"      Najib took power in 2009, and inherited a divided ruling coalition which had been weakened by historic losses in the 2008 polls. He has promised to restructure government and economy and introduced an inclusive brand of politics aimed at uniting the country's different races.      Najib's approval ratings have risen from 45 percent to 69 percent in February, according to independent polling outfit Merdeka Center. But analysts said recent ethnic and religious differences have undermined his popularity.

(Associated Press)      At least 20,000 Malaysians defied government warnings by marching for electoral reforms Saturday, as police fired tear gas and detained more than 1,600 in the country's biggest political rally in four years.      The crackdown on the opposition-backed demonstration in Malaysia's main city, Kuala Lumpur, triggered criticism that Prime Minister Najib Razak's long-ruling coalition was unwilling to allow public dissent or make election laws fairer ahead of national polls widely expected by mid-2012.      Najib's administration declared the rally illegal and warned people repeatedly over the past month to avoid it. Officials insisted it was simply an opposition scheme to spark chaos and stir anti-government sentiment, while activists accused authorities of being afraid of a protest that could undermine their authority.      Authorities blocked roads, shut rail stations and deployed trucks with water cannons near the Independence Stadium in downtown Kuala Lumpur where activists sought to gather. More than 200 activists had been arrested over the past two weeks for promoting the rally.      The large number of demonstrators who showed up despite the threat of arrests and the disruptions in transport links bolstered claims by activists that the government had misjudged public opinion by not allowing what they insisted would have been a peaceful rally.      The crackdown \\"stirred a sense of outrage against the exhibition of raw power by our government,\\" said Ambiga Sreenavasan, head of the Bersih coalition of civic groups that organized the rally.      \\"What is the necessity for a show of might against right? No matter what, right will always prevail,\\" she said.      Police said in a statement that they detained 1,667 people Saturday in a clampdown called \\"Operation Erase Bersih.\\" Those arrested included several senior opposition officials. Some were released after several hours, with police indicating that most would not be held overnight.      Thousands tried to reach the stadium from various parts of Kuala Lumpur, chanting \\"Long live the people\\" and carrying yellow balloons and flowers as they marched.      Police fired numerous rounds of tear gas and chemical-laced water in repeated attempts to disperse the crowds, causing demonstrators to scatter into nearby buildings and alleys before they regrouped. Police helicopters flew overhead as a brief downpour failed to deter the protesters.      Witnesses said riot police armed with batons charged at some protesters and dragged them into trucks. Some were seen bleeding, but police could not confirm any injuries.      Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's top opposition figure, was being treated at a hospital for a \\"minor injury\\" he said he received when his group was hit by tear gas. The Malaysiakini news website said he had a knee injury.      \\"We were attacked from both corners but what was horrifying is that the police shot directly at the protesters, some of them clearly aimed at me personally, so my security assistants had to cover me and one was badly injured because the canister was shot direct, he is badly injured,\\" Anwar told Associated Press Television News. \\"This is a simple portrayal of the extent of desperation of brutal action approved by the Prime Minister Najib.\\"      The demonstrators dispersed after a five-hour standoff with police. Only several hundred reached the stadium.      Prime Minister Najib insisted Saturday the protesters only represent a minority, and that most Malaysians support his administration.      \\"If there are people who want to hold the illegal rally, there are even more who are against their plan,\\" the prime minister was quoted as saying by the national news agency, Bernama.      Organizers said 50,000 took part in the rally, but police claimed there were only up to 6,000. Other observers and participants said the total was between 20,000 and 30,000, noting that it was highly unlikely that police could have arrested a quarter of the demonstrators. An accurate count was impossible because they were scattered in various areas.      The rally has galvanized the opposition and has been credited for a surge in political awareness among the public in recent weeks.      Opposition leaders accuse Najib's National Front coalition of relying on fraud to preserve its 54-year grip on power, which has been eroded in recent years amid mounting complaints about corruption and racial discrimination. The government insists the current electoral policies are evenhanded.      The activists' demands include an overhaul of voter registration lists, tougher measures to curb fraud and fairer opportunities for opposition politicians to campaign in government-linked media. The National Front's mandate expires in mid-2013 but many analysts expect elections to be called by next year.      Supporters of the Bersih coalition were also planning solidarity marches over the weekend in foreign cities, including in Australia, Britain, France, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand and the United States.      In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the U.S. has been communicating to Malaysia the importance of respecting human rights, including freedom of expression and assembly.      \\"We consider it incumbent on all sides to refrain from violence,\\" she told a news conference Friday.      ___      Associated Press writer Matthew Pennington in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","output":"On July 9, 2011, Malaysian police fired multiple rounds of tear gas and detained over 1,400 people amid a large-scale street demonstration against Prime Minister Najib Razak's government. The protest was organised by the 'Bersih' electoral reform coalition, and despite police roadblocks and security measures, thousands of activists took to the streets in Kuala Lumpur demanding free and fair elections. Authorities' response deemed 'excessive' by some has hurt Najib's image. Street protests are uncommon in Malaysia, but any significant anti-government sentiment could potentially impact economic reforms crucial for investment. Given the demonstration, Najib may reconsider his reform plans and possible early elections. The protestors' defiance against governmental intimidation signifies public outrage and could look negative for the Malaysian government internationally. Many of the demonstrators were young first-time protesters, which could signify growing unrest among traditionally non-political demographics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: What character does Michael Byrne play? Major Schroeder Answer:","output":"Step 1: Establish the movie's genre and setting. As Major Schroeder is a military rank, we can assume that the movie will likely be a war or military-inspired genre. To create a unique setting, we could place the movie in an alternative history timeline, where World War II occurred differently than in reality. Step 2: Create the protagonist and their goals. Our protagonist, Captain John Falcon, is an American soldier tasked with a top-secret mission to infiltrate enemy lines and recover stolen military blueprints. His ultimate goal is to prevent the enemy from developing a devastating new weapon that could turn the tide of the war in their favor. Step 3: Develop the supporting cast and antagonist. Michael Byrne plays Major Schroeder, a cunning and determined German officer stationed in a heavily fortified castle that houses the stolen blueprints. As the antagonist, Major Schroeder stands in the way of Captain Falcon's mission and is dedicated to stopping him at all costs. Additionally, Captain Falcon is supported by a diverse team of soldiers, each with unique skills, to help him navigate the dangers of enemy territory. Among them are a talented sniper, an explosives expert, and a cunning linguist who helps the team blend in with local civilians. Step 4: Establish the main conflict and stakes. The main conflict of the movie stems from the opposition between Captain Falcon's team and Major Schroeder. Both parties are racing against the clock, with the fate of the war at stake. If Captain Falcon fails to recover the blueprints and destroy the enemy's weapon, it could spell disaster for the Allied forces. Step 5: Develop the movie's key scenes and climax. Throughout the movie, Captain Falcon's team faces numerous challenges as they infiltrate enemy lines, with Major Schroeder hot on their trail. Action-packed scenes include intense firefights, narrow escapes, and gripping moments of espionage. The climax takes place in Major Schroeder's heavily fortified castle, where brief quiet moments of suspense lead to an explosive showdown between Captain Falcon and Major Schroeder. Step 6: Wrap up the movie with a resolution. In the end, Captain Falcon's team manages to recover the stolen blueprints, destroy the enemy's weapon, and eliminate Major Schroeder, ensuring that the Allied forces emerge victorious in the war. As they return home to their friends and family, the soldiers' bond is strengthened by their shared experiences. In conclusion, Michael Byrne plays Major Schroeder, a German officer whose devious tactics and military prowess challenge the protagonist, Captain John Falcon, in a thrilling and suspenseful war film set in an alternate World War II timeline."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Second question: How do I calculate steel reinforcement and its quantity in slab, beams, columns and footing for given dimensions? Are these two questions asking the same thing? (a). no; (b). yes;","output":"(b). Yes, both questions are essentially asking how to calculate steel quantity in different structural elements of a building such as footings, beams, columns, and slabs. They are both related to the calculation of steel reinforcement for these elements using given dimensions.  To answer these questions, I will explain how to calculate steel quantity for each of these elements in construction. 1. Footings: To calculate steel quantity in footings, first, determine the type of footing being used, for example, isolated, combined or strip footing. Calculate the required reinforcement area using the given dimensions, including the width, depth, and length of the footing. Once the area is determined, use the following formula: Steel Quantity = (Reinforcement Area x Length of Footing) / Weight of Steel per Unit Length 2. Beams: For a beam, you need to determine the size of the beam, which includes width (b), depth (d), and length (L). Then, for reinforcement, determine the number and size of rebars required. Calculating the steel quantity can be done using the following formula: Steel Quantity = (Total number of rebars x Length of Beam x Weight of Rebar per Unit Length) / Weight of Steel per Unit Length 3. Columns: To calculate steel quantity in columns, you have to start by determining the dimensions such as the height, width, and length of the column. Also, calculate the number and size of rebars needed for proper reinforcement. Use the following formula: Steel Quantity = (Total number of rebars x Length of Column x Weight of Rebar per Unit Length) / Weight of Steel per Unit Length  4. Slabs: For slabs, start by determining their dimensions, thickness and reinforcement requirements by using the given slab dimensions. Based on the required reinforcement, calculate the area of reinforcement. Use the following formula to calculate steel quantity: Steel Quantity = (Reinforcement Area x Length of Slab) / Weight of Steel per Unit Length. It is important to note that the weight of steel per unit length depends on the type and size of the steel bars used. Usually, steel reinforcement bars (rebars) come in different diameters (mm) and weights (kg/m). So, you should know the size and weight of the rebars being used to calculate the accurate steel quantity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets. Given that these planets have no names, the explorers decide to name them after themselves. The planet of Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift. Many of the continents on the planet are currently breaking apart and moving. Timon, however, has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite awhile now.  Hint: At the end of the Proterozoic, the supercontinent Pannotia had broken apart into the smaller continents Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana. Answer:","output":"The volcanic crust on Sarahn is hotter. This conclusion is based on the information given in the paragraph that Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift with many continents breaking apart and moving. According to the given hint, during periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. This young volcanic crust is relatively hotter than old oceanic crust. On the other hand, Timon has been a stable planet with no such continental movements, thus implying it has older, cooler volcanic crust."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Why Google Takes Indian Rockets Into Space The cheapest flight to Mars may leave from a tiny barrier island in southeastern India. Sriharikota, the nation’s Cape Canaveral, is the launchpad for an ambitious space program that has shot more than 120 satellites into orbit -- including for the U.S., Israel and Germany.

Kiran Kumar, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation, said at its Bengaluru headquarters. “Why are people coming to us? Because they are looking for the most cost-effective, short turnaround-time launches.” India competes for commercial launches with space agencies in Europe and Japan, and with private players such as Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin LLC. The nation has launched 37 satellites this year, almost double last year’s total, with more planned, according to Kumar’s organization. Most trips departing from India use the workhorse Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, or PSLV, which can take a microsatellite into space for about 30 million, according to U.K.-based researcher Seradata Ltd. The tab is split if multiple satellites are hauled. That’s about half the price charged by SpaceX for rides on its Falcon 9 rockets, though the Hawthorne, California-based company says its payloads are bigger. It’s also cheaper than the prices charged by the U.S. for its Minotaur rocket and Arianespace SA for its Vega, according to Seradata.

Its last failure was in the 1990s. “It has reached the ‘Nirvana’ stage in a modern launch vehicle’s experience,” Todd said. “It has settled into having a long series of perfect flights with no failures.” The agreement with Google-owned Terra Bella, a satellite imagery company, took seven years to negotiate, said Susmita Mohanty, co-founder and chief executive officer of Bengaluru-based Earth2Orbit, which brokered the deal. That’s because the U.S. in 2005 started discouraging domestic companies from hiring the Indian Space Research Organisation and its affiliate, Antrix Corp., for commercial launches after the Indian government wouldn’t sign a pact setting quotas and minimum prices. As India held out, the market came around. The burgeoning need among phone companies, electronics makers and broadcasters for rockets prompted the U.S. government to issue waivers on an individual basis. Global satellite industry revenue -- including services, manufacturing and launching -- almost doubled to 208 billion in the decade through 2015, according to the Washington-based Satellite Industry Association. Terra Bella uses images taken from space to analyze port traffic, help disaster-response teams, and track changes in mining pits, according to its website. India’s space agency launched its 110-kilogram (243-pound) SkySat microsatellite in June -- one of 20 atop a single rocket. ISRO plans to launch more than 80 at once -- the most ever -- early next year. Terra Bella wouldn’t comment except to refer to a blog post showing one of its first images: Chicago’s Soldier Field. The ISRO Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle stands on the launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on Sept. 23, 2016, in Sriharikota, India. Source: ISRO “Our launch agreement was pioneering,” said Mohanty, whose father was a space scientist in India during the 1970s. “We have opened the door and left it ajar for other satellite makers to access India’s frequent and affordable launches.” The nation’s most famous liftoff occurred in 2013, when a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle carried the Mars Orbiter Spacecraft from Sriharikota. The craft, called Mangalyaan in Sanskrit, made India the fourth nation to reach the fourth planet from the sun. Mangalyaan’s objectives include looking for methane and carbon dioxide in Mars’ atmosphere to determine whether life ever existed on our neighboring planet. It cost about 74 million, or about 11 percent of the price tag for NASA’s Maven probe. By comparison, 20th Century Fox spent an estimated 108 million making “The Martian,” according to Box Office Mojo.

Rakesh Sharma spent almost eight days aboard the orbiting Salyut 7 station conducting experiments. Cost efficiency is imperative in a country where about 21 percent of its population lived on less than 1.90 a day in 2011, according to the World Bank. That poverty makes relevancy even more significant, Kumar said. “In most other places, generally, the space program started as a strategic or a military program,” said Kumar, who joined the space organization in 1975 and took over last year after working on the Mars orbiter. “In our program, right from the beginning, what has been looked at is how this space technology can be used for societal benefits.” An image of a regional dust storm over the northern hemisphere of Mars taken by the Mars Colour Camera (MCC) on board India’s Mars Orbiter Spacecraft. Source: ISRO The Mars mission kick-started efforts by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to use the space program to lift the standard of living. India operates about 35 satellites for broadcasting, navigation, scientific research and weather monitoring, and Kumar said the nation needs to double that. One key area is disaster management since 60 percent of the land mass is prone to earthquakes and about 70 percent of its cultivable area is susceptible to drought. The nation also suffers devastating tropical cyclones. India plans to launch a satellite to look for potential risks and then provide information for mitigation, response and recovery, Modi said. The machine will scan all of South Asia. “India is ready to make its space capabilities available to any country for purposes of disaster risk management,” Modi told a Nov. 3 conference in New Delhi. The government also is putting a mining surveillance system in space, hoping to curb illegal digging through remote sensing detection technology. Currently, the nation depends on eyewitness accounts. But the Indian Space Research Organisation’s 1.09 billion budget is also about boosting the space industry.

Question: How are Barbara and Johnnie related? Movie plot title: Night of the Living Dead Movie plot: Siblings Barbara and Johnnie visit their mother's grave in a remote Pennsylvania cemetery. During their visit, Barbara is attacked by a zombie. Her brother comes to her defense but is killed. Barbara flees the cemetery and discovers what at first seems to be an abandoned farmhouse. She seeks shelter there, only to find another pack of zombies. Shortly after, a man named Ben arrives, and the two clear the house of the dead and begin the process of barricading the doors and windows. They discover other survivors who have been hiding in the cellar of the house: Harry Cooper, a loud and argumentative husband; his wife Helen; their daughter Sarah, who was bitten by a zombie and has fallen seriously ill; teenager Tom Bitner and his girlfriend Judy Rose Larson. The group is divided over what their next course of action should be. Harry believes everyone should retreat to the cellar and barricade the door to wait for the authorities. Ben thinks the cellar is a \\"death trap\\" and that they would be better served fortifying the house, which at least has alternate escape routes, and Barbara suggests that the group should simply leave the house on foot after she notices the zombies' limited mobility. An argument between Ben and Harry leaves the Coopers in the basement to tend to their ailing daughter, and the remaining members remain upstairs to continue their work reinforcing the doors and windows. The loud construction attracts even more zombies to the farmhouse, soon collecting a large mob. The group devises a plan to escape using Ben's truck, which is out of fuel, by refueling at a locked gas pump a couple hundred yards away. A search of the corpse who lived in the farmhouse produces an unknown set of keys. Judy Rose, Tom, and Ben proceed up the hill toward the gas pump, but their plan begins to unravel when Ben falls from the bed of the truck and is left to defend himself.

People visiting the area always stop in Berg village and feel great, but they feel bad and winded once they get to Steep village.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which village has a lower oxygen content in the air?  Hint: Regions on the Earth's surface (or in its atmosphere) that are high above mean sea level are referred to as high altitude. High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) above sea level.[5][6][7]  At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.[8] The answer is:","output":"Steep village has a lower oxygen content in the air. The two villages, Berg and Steep, are situated at different altitudes, with Berg village at 3000 ft and Steep village at 8500 ft. As mentioned in the hint, high altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) above sea level. Steep village, which is located at 8500 ft, falls into this category of high altitude. At high altitudes, atmospheric pressure is lower than at sea level due to the competing effects of gravity and the heat content of the air. Gravity pulls the air closer to the ground, while the heat content causes air molecules to bounce off each other and expand. As a result, the air becomes thinner and contains less oxygen at high altitudes compared to lower altitudes. Since Steep village is located at a higher altitude than Berg village (8500 ft compared to 3000 ft), the atmospheric pressure is lower in Steep village. This lower pressure results in less available oxygen in the air. Therefore, Steep village has a lower oxygen content in the air compared to Berg village. This is why people visiting the area feel great in Berg village, but feel winded and unwell once they reach Steep village, as their bodies are adjusting to the lower oxygen content in the air at the higher altitude."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the mother of the girl that the professor of French Literature is attracted to?  In 1947, Humbert Humbert, a middle-aged European professor of French literature, travels to the United States to take a teaching position in New Hampshire. He rents a room in the home of widow Charlotte Haze, largely because he is romantically attracted to her adolescent daughter Dolores, also called \\"Lo\\", who he sees while touring the house. Obsessed from boyhood with girls of approximately her age (whom he calls \\"nymphets\\"), Humbert is immediately smitten with Lo and gets married to Charlotte only just to be near her daughter. Charlotte finds Humbert's secret diary and discovers his preference for her daughter. Furious, Charlotte runs out of the house, when she is struck by a car and killed.  Her death frees Humbert to pursue a romantic and sexual relationship with Lo, whom he nicknames \\"Lolita\\". Humbert and Lo then travel the country, staying in various motels before eventually settling in the college town of Beardsley, where Humbert takes a teaching job and Lo begins attending an all-girls Catholic school. However, Lo's increasing boredom with Humbert, combined with her growing desire for independence, fuels a constant tension that lead to a fight between them. Humbert's affection for Lo is also rivaled by another man, playwright Clare Quilty, who has been pursuing Lo since the beginning of the pair's travels. Lo eventually escapes with Quilty, and Humbert's search for them is unsuccessful, especially as he doesn't know Quilty's name. Three years later, Humbert receives a letter from Lo asking for money. Humbert visits Lo, who is now married and pregnant. Humbert asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. He relents and gives her a substantial amount of money. Lo also reveals to Humbert how Quilty actually tracked young girls and took them to Pavor Manor, his home in Parkington, to exploit them for child pornography. Quilty abandoned her after she refused to be in one of his films.

I read this background article the other day: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]  I am facing a new situation today: Dan decided to preserve some fruit and roots to see how long they last before they spoil. He also bought other fruit that he plans to eat fresh. He candied plums, pears, ginger and quince, and he ate fresh apples, oranges and mango.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which fruit have a lower sugar content candied plums or fresh oranges? A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article, candied fruits are made through a preservation process that involves soaking them in heated sugar syrup for an extended period of time. This process causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, resulting in a higher sugar content. Fresh fruits, on the other hand, do not undergo this preservation process and retain their natural sugar content. Considering the new situation where Dan has candied plums and fresh oranges, it is logical to deduce that the fresh oranges have a lower sugar content compared to the candied plums. This is because the candied plums have undergone the sugar preservation process mentioned in the background article, whereas the fresh oranges have not experienced any such sugary treatment and retain their natural sugar levels. It is important to note that while fresh fruits generally have a lower sugar content compared to their candied counterparts, the actual sugar content in different types of fruits may vary. However, in this specific comparison between candied plums and fresh oranges, the fresh oranges are expected to have a lower sugar content."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer this question: Asked 'Can you see anything'? who replied 'Yes, wonderful things'?","output":"The famous reply \\"Yes, wonderful things\\" was given by British archaeologist and Egyptologist Howard Carter when asked \\"Can you see anything?\\" by his patron and financial backer Lord Carnarvon. This significant moment in history happened on November 26, 1922, when Carter discovered the long-lost tomb of the Egyptian Pharaoh Tutankhamun, often referred to as King Tut, in the Valley of the Kings, Egypt. The discovery had a lasting impact on archaeology, Egyptology, and our understanding of ancient Egyptian history. In modern Western popular culture, ancient Egypt has long captivated the imagination, due in large part to the architectural marvels like the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx, as well as the mysterious culture and the complex religious pantheon. Therefore, when the entirely intact tomb of a young pharaoh was unearthed in the 1920s, it fueled a fascination with ancient Egypt, leading to a surge in interest called \\"Egyptomania.\\" Lord Carnarvon, an English nobleman with a passion for archaeology, had been financing Carter's expeditions in Egypt since 1907. Prior to the discovery of King Tut's tomb, Carter had worked for over 30 years in Egypt as an archaeologist, artist, and excavation overseer. His knowledge of archeology and attention to detail played a significant role in locating the tomb. Following the discovery, a meticulous process of excavating and documenting the tomb's contents took a decade to complete. Upon entering the tomb, Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon first discovered an antechamber filled with various artifacts, such as statues, pottery, and chariots. This was followed by the opening of the sealed door that led to the burial chamber, where the sarcophagus and the beautifully detailed golden death mask of Tutankhamun were found. The discovery not only provided a wealth of information about Egyptian burial practices and the era when Tutankhamun ruled (around 1332-1323 BC) but also offered valuable historical context on his reign and life, significantly enriching the understanding of ancient Egyptian history. Additionally, the discovery of the tomb raised public interest and increased tourism in Egypt, inspiring people to learn more about ancient Egypt and visit its monuments. It also influenced art, fashion, and design, leaving a lasting impact on various aspects of modern culture. While the allure of ancient Egypt extends far beyond the tomb of Tutankhamun, the famous exchange between Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon remains a symbol of human curiosity, persistence, and fascination for the unknown."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question. In architecture, what is the name for an ornamental vertical groove in a column?","output":"In architecture, the term for an ornamental vertical groove in a column is called \\"fluting\\". Fluting refers to the shallow grooves or channels which run vertically along the length of the column, adding both visual appeal and structural integrity to the design. The use of fluting can be seen extensively throughout various architectural styles, particularly in classical architecture, including ancient Greek and Roman architecture. Fluting is commonly associated with three classical orders of architecture, namely the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders, each of which has its own distinctive column style. The primary purpose of fluting in these classical orders is to create an aesthetically pleasing appearance while minimizing the weight of the column and enhancing its structural strength. In each of the three classical orders, fluting varies in terms of the number of grooves and their shape: 1. Doric Order: This is the earliest and simplest of the classical orders, typically featuring 20 flutes on a column. The flutes in Doric columns are straight, deep, and have a slightly concave shape with a sharp edge, called arris, separating the flutes. The shallow curves, also known as fillets, give a sense of depth and help guide the viewer's eye upward, enhancing the column's verticality. 2. Ionic Order: Columns in the Ionic order usually have 24 flutes. These flutes are more slender and less prominently separated compared to the Doric order. Additionally, the flutes in Ionic columns are not as deeply carved and have a rounded appearance, giving the column a more graceful and delicate look. 3. Corinthian Order: Corinthian columns, the most elaborate of the three orders, also feature 24 flutes similar to the Ionic order. However, these flutes tend to be even more slender and shallow, contributing to the refined and sophisticated appearance of Corinthian columns. The overall appearance of the fluted Corinthian column is focused on ornate decoration and intricate detailing. It is important to note that not all columns in classical architecture are fluted. Some variations of these orders, as well as other architectural styles, incorporate smooth columns or columns adorned with different patterns or relief work. However, fluting remains a hallmark of classical architecture and continues to be utilized in various architectural styles and forms today, maintaining its status as an important decorative and structural element in columns."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

From 2000 to 2012, consumption of cigars more than doubled in the United States, from slightly over 6.1 billion in 2000 to more than 13.7 billion in 2012. Cigar use is most common among young people. In the 2012 National Youth Tobacco Survey data, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that 12.6% of high school students had smoked at least one cigar in the past 30 days. After cigarettes, cigars were the second most commonly used tobacco product in youths and the most commonly used tobacco product among African American high school students. From the CDC’s national Adult Tobacco Survey for 2009-2015, data suggest that prevalence among adults was highest among 18-24 years (15.9%) followed by 25-44 years old (7.2%). From the same survey, prevalence among men (10.4%) was significantly higher than women (3.1%) and likewise among LGBT (12.2%) and heterosexual (6.5%) respondents.

Question: which  is controlled by two or more pilots, who are mentally linked via a process called \\"drifting\\" to share the mental stress of piloting the machine? Movie title: Pacific Rim Movie plot: The film begins in 2013. Deep beneath the Pacific Ocean, a fissure opens up, that leads to another dimension. Through the fissure, a giant monster appears, and destroys portions of San Francisco. After many days and countless lives, the creature is defeated by human military forces.However, what seemed to be an isolated attack builds, as more creatures begin to come through the fissure, attacking coastal cities around the Pacific. The World unites to stop the invaders, and build The Jaeger Program: a series of giant mechanical 'monsters,' intended to stop the creatures.Original tests to have one pilot per Jaeger prove unsuccessful, as the test subjects were not able to handle the stress and strain of controlling such a huge robot by themselves. It was then decided that each Jaeger would be piloted by two pilots, their memories linked together in The Drift, synchronizing their movements to maneuver the massive machines.As the Jaegers go to work, they begin to turn the tides, and take down the creatures (known as Kaiju). Pretty soon, the world is enthralled by the Jaegers and their pilots. They become celebrities, and even have merchandise made. As well, the dead Kaiju are soon seen as a black-market commodity, their parts sold off for various collections and medicinal purposes.But just as the war seems to be turning in humanity's favor, the Kaiju's attacks become more frequent and more brutal.In 2020, seven years after the fissure opened, one of the more famous Jaeger duos, Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Hunnam), and his older brother, Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) have become heroes with an impeccable record of defeating Kaijus.

Answer the following question: Process:  - Limestone is located under the soil - Rain picks up carbon dioxide as it falls to earth - The rain falls on the soil over the limestone - The carbon dioxide in the rain washes through the soil - The carbon dioxide turns into acid - The acid in the rain gets to the limestone below the soil - The acid dissolves the limestone - Acid continues to erode the limestone with more rain over time - The eroded limestone sometimes forms caves.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less / smaller caverns happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER caverns.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If less or smaller caverns are formed due to the perturbation hypothesis, it will affect the formation and size of the caverns, potentially resulting in fewer or less extensive cave systems. This could be caused by factors such as reduced rainfall, lower concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, or changes in the soil composition that may limit the acidification process. The supposed perturbation does have an indirect effect on the process. If there are fewer or smaller caverns as a result, it may imply that the processes leading to their formation, such as the dissolution of limestone by rainwater with carbon dioxide turned into acid, are not as effective or as frequent as in cases where larger or more extensive caverns are formed. This could lead to a better understanding of the geological conditions, climate, and atmospheric factors that contribute to the formation of caverns and guide further research or conservation efforts to preserve these unique geological formations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir.

Answer a question about this article: Some researchers are now focusing on learning about how adolescents view their own relationships and sexuality; they want to move away from a research point of view that focuses on the problems associated with adolescent sexuality.[why?] College Professor Lucia O'Sullivan and her colleagues found that there weren't any significant gender differences in the relationship events adolescent boys and girls from grades 7-12 reported. Most teens said they had kissed their partners, held hands with them, thought of themselves as being a couple and told people they were in a relationship. This means that private thoughts about the relationship as well as public recognition of the relationship were both important to the adolescents in the sample. Sexual events (such as sexual touching, sexual intercourse) were less common than romantic events (holding hands) and social events (being with one's partner in a group setting). The researchers state that these results are important because the results focus on the more positive aspects of adolescents and their social and romantic interactions rather than focusing on sexual behavior and its consequences.

In this case, the main setting is the animal kingdom in Africa, and the two main characters are Kiara (a young lioness and princess) and Simba (her father, the Lion King). Step 2: Introduce the Outsiders Next, we need to introduce the outsiders who pose a threat to the kingdom. These outsiders can be a group of renegade animals, led by a cunning and manipulative hyena named Zarkon, who wants to take over Simba's territory. Step 3: Develop Kiara's Curiosity As the plot progresses, Kiara is shown to be adventurous and curious about the world beyond the boundaries of her father's kingdom. Despite the warnings from her father and the other animals in the kingdom, she strays too close to the outsider territory, where she meets Lee, a young and charismatic member of the outsider group. Step 4: Develop Friendship and Conflict  Kiara secretly develops a friendship with Lee, who shows her the world beyond her father's kingdom's borders, which seems wonderful and exciting. Her growing connection with Lee causes her to question her father's beliefs and rules about the outsiders, leading to a conflict between Kiara, Simba, and the rest of the kingdom. Step 5: Lecture on the Dangers of Outsiders As Kiara's relationship with Lee deepens, Simba discovers her secret friendship and confronts her. He lectures her about the danger posed by the outsiders, revealing the past incidents involving the kingdom and the outsiders that led to the loss of many lives. Simba's intense concern stems from the pain of losing his father to a similar situation caused by the actions of the hyena clan long time ago. Step 6: Proving Simba's Concerns Just as Kiara starts to see her father's point of view, Zarkon uses Lee to manipulate her and set a trap for Simba, planning to overthrow him and take control of the kingdom. Kiara will ultimately discover Lee's involvement and be heartbroken by his betrayal. Step 7: Climax and Resolution Kiara, filled with determination to right her wrongs, will work with her father, her friends, and the kingdom's animals to foil Zarkon's plans. During the battle, Lee returns to help Kiara and the kingdom, redeeming himself and proving his true loyalty. In the end, the kingdom is saved, and Simba realizes that not all outsiders are dangerous. Kiara learns important lessons about trust and the value of her father's wisdom, and the kingdom becomes a safer and more united place as they embrace the positive outsiders into their territory."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

By Joel Christie Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger was joined by up to 70 close family and friends yesterday as he celebrated the life of his late partner L'Wren Scott. The family attended the famed Hollywood Forever Funeral Home, in Los Angeles, at about 12.30pm yesterday before moving on to a reception at Sunset Tower Hotel, where they were seen arriving in a black mini-van and a limousine. Traditional folk song Will The Circle Be Unbroken was sung by longtime Rolling Stones backing vocalist Bernard Fowler and three generations of Jaggers gave speeches at the fashion designer's funeral. However it was the memories that a devastated Mick Jagger shared with mourners of his late partner that was said to have provided the most poignant part of the service. Covered arrivals: The OPTIONS: - Bernard Fowler arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Bryan Adams arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Ellen Barkin arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Hollywood Forever Funeral Home arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Jagger arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Jaggers arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Joel Christie arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Keith Urban arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - L'Wren Scott arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Los Angeles arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Mick Jagger arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - New York arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Nicole Kidman arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Rolling Stones arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Sunset Tower Hotel arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Will The Circle Be Unbroken arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral","output":"- Hollywood Forever Funeral Home arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral The other options are incorrect because they are individuals or non-related entities that would not have the authority or responsibility to arrange such a thing.

Kyle took their flask to the concert, while Kenneth left his flask at home, because  Select from: -Kyle wanted to stay sober.; -Kenneth wanted to stay sober.;","output":"-Kenneth wanted to stay sober. Reflecting on the situation revealed an interesting contrast between Kyle and Kenneth and how they approached their enjoyment of the concert. Kenneth, a more conservative individual, had learned from a myriad of past experiences that feasting too heavily on liquor, particularly in such enthusiastic environments as a concert, could drastically affect his ability to entirely savor the music, the ambiance, and the overall event experience. He opted for a lucid mind to soak up and remember every vivid detail of the concert, every pulsating rhythm that vibrated the air around them, the luminescence of the stage lights painting a panorama of colors in the enveloping darkness, and ultimately the raw talent displayed by the musicians that commanded their admiration. Therefore, Kenneth, an epitome of prudence and tranquility, made the conscious decision to leave his flask at home, aiming to engage in the concert's festivities without the alluring veil of alcohol-induced euphoria clouding his judgment or hindering, to any extent, the pleasure he derived from the music itself. His appreciation for the symphony of sound that concerts provided went beyond the mere surface-level indulgence; he perceived these musical spectacles as a union of hearts resonating to the same beat. On the other hand, Kyle, making a drinking flask accompany him, approached the concert with a different perspective. His thrill lied more in the combination of the musical extravaganza with the exuberance that came with a slight intoxication, thus aiming for a distinctive kind of ecstasy. For Kyle, spiking up his senses with his favorite beverage from the flask somehow amplified the enjoyment, a practice that rendered the beats to touch his soul, letting him release his joy and excitement in a more uninhibited manner. While Kenneth originated his joy from purity, Kyle derived it from pleasure, infusing a slightly risky but amplified approach to enjoying his night at the concert. The difference in their choices spoke volumes about their personalities. Where Kenneth fit the mold of the sober, discerning, individual variety, passionate about harnessing every sensory detail woven into the fabric of the concert, Kyle served as an example to the risk-takers, the thrill-seekers who dared to venture into edging their experiences with a spike of something that heightened their senses. In a rich tapestry of life's experiences, this concert was yet another thread sewn in by Kyle and Kenneth, in their unique and characteristic styles, further spiced up by their decisions revolving around a simple flask."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have a math problem with the letter \\"i\\" in it, so we're going to solve for \\"i\\". Here's the problem: 196*i - 13956 - 10275 = -571*i - 1988 First, we're going to move all the terms with \\"i\\" to one side, and all the numbers without \\"i\\" to the other side.  To do that, we will add 571*i to both sides (that will cancel out the -571*i on the right side) and add 13956 + 10275 to the right side (that'll cancel out the numbers on the left side).  When we do that, our equation will look like this: 196*i + 571*i = -1988 + 13956 + 10275 Now, let's add the numbers with \\"i\\" together on the left side: 767*i = -1988 + 13956 + 10275 Next, we will add the numbers on the right side: 767*i = -1988 + 13956 + 10275 = 8243 Now, we want to find what number \\"i\\" stands for. To do that, we're going to divide both sides by 767 (since 767*i means 767 multiplied by i).

In this sentence, the focus is on the movement and location of the train. 2. Tunnel: This word helps to describe the environment through which the train is traveling. A tunnel is an underground passage or enclosed space that allows transportation systems like trains, cars, or pedestrians to pass through obstacles such as mountains or beneath bodies of water. The mention of the tunnel helps us visualize the train emerging from a dark, enclosed space and approaching a destination. 3. Coming out: These words describe the action of the subject in the sentence – the \\"train.\\" The phrase \\"coming out\\" signifies the emergence of the train from the tunnel, highlighting its movement and implying that the train has successfully navigated through the tunnel. 4. Station: This word refers to the destination of the train and where this particular action is occurring. A train station is a location where trains stop to load or unload passengers and cargo, which often serves as a central hub for local transportation services. In the sentence, \\"station\\" specifies where the train is headed, providing context to the action and offering a sense of arrival or completion of the train's journey from the tunnel.

(CNN) -- Whether you're a domestic company or an international business, failure to comply with China's strict Internet regulations risks having your online presence curtailed or shut down completely. This means being subjected to the so-called \\"Great Firewall of China,\\" where websites, from newspaper portals to micro-blogging services, come under intense scrutiny from government censors who prohibit topics deemed unsuitable. \\"Bottom line is that there's a list of topics that domestic and international media based in China doesn't allow discussions on,\\" said Doug Young, journalism professor at Fudan University in Shanghai and author of \\"The Party Line: How The Media Dictates Public Opinion in Modern China.\\"  OPTIONS: - CNN, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - China, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - Chinese, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - Doug Young, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - Facebook, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - Fudan University, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - Google, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - Great Firewall, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - Hong Kong, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - Modern China, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - Shanghai, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - The Media Dictates Public Opinion, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - The Party Line, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - YouTube, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009.","output":"The Great Firewall of China is a stringent Internet censorship system that monitors and restricts various websites and online platforms in the country. As Doug Young, a journalism professor at Fudan University in Shanghai and the author of \\"The Party Line: How The Media Dictates Public Opinion in Modern China,\\" points out, both domestic and international media companies must avoid discussing certain topics in China, or else they risk being blocked or shut down entirely. One of the most notable instances of this censorship occurred in 2009 when Google-owned platforms such as YouTube and even Google itself were blocked in mainland China. The decision to block YouTube was due to the presence of politically sensitive content, while Google's search engine was targeted after it encountered issues with the Chinese government over Internet censorship and a cyber attack that targeted the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. This incident highlights the challenges that international companies, including tech giants like Google, face while operating in China. It’s critical for businesses to adapt to China's strict regulations and ensure compliance in order to maintain their online presence. Non-compliance could lead to penalties, and ultimately, being blocked by the Great Firewall, which could severely impact their access to the vast and lucrative Chinese market. It's important to note that Google doesn't own several of the options listed, such as Facebook, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. Facebook is an independent entity, while Hong Kong and Shanghai are cities and not owned by any corporation. Navigating the Chinese Internet landscape is difficult for both domestic and international companies, as they have to strike a delicate balance between abiding by the Chinese government's demands and maintaining their freedom of expression. The consequences of non-compliance are severe, potentially derailing a business's chances of thriving in one of the world's most important economies. For this reason, it's crucial for companies to remain vigilant and adaptable when doing business in China, recognizing the role that the Great Firewall of China plays in controlling public opinion and shaping the online environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A). no. B). yes.","output":"B). Yes. Both questions essentially ask the same thing - can a state of reality occur wherein an animal, specifically dogs, can communicate with humans in a linguistically comprehensible manner akin to human speech. Trying to dissect these questions in more detail, we find: The question \\"Will dogs one day be able to talk?\\" directly presents the notion of whether dogs can develop the capacity to 'talk' or, in more precise terms, utilize human language for communication. This directly goes into musings about the evolutionary potential of that specific species (canis lupus familiaris) and whether it could develop such complex cognitive abilities.  On the other hand, \\"Will animals like dogs ever be able to talk?\\" broadens the scope initially by mentioning 'animals' in general, but then narrows down to a similar context by specifying 'like dogs'. So, we are still focusing on domestic animals similar to dogs in their potential to convey information through human language.  Considering these interpretations, we can confidently denote that both questions touch on the same central theme, hence having the same meaning. However, it's worth pointing out, that the future possibility of animals communicating through human language is currently a speculative conjecture at best. It would require significant cognitive and physiological changes, seeing as the vocal apparatus and brain structures needed for verbal language are complex and specific. To date, dogs and other animals communicate with humans and each other using a blend of vocal sounds, body language, and other nonverbal cues.  Certain intelligent animals like apes and parrots have been trained to use simple forms of sign language or mimic human speech, but this does not equate to a full understanding or utilization of human language. These behaviors are learned through rigorous training and do not represent a natural development of such abilities in these species.  So, overall, while it's an interesting theory to ponder, the prospect of dogs or similar animals talking as humans do, using abstract concepts and organized grammar, based on our current knowledge and understanding of animal cognition and language capacity, remains in the realm of science fiction and fantasy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A stalactite is a mineral formation that hangs from the ceiling of limestone caves, and it is formed over long periods of time through the process of deposition. Deposition is a geological process wherein dissolved minerals are carried through groundwater and then deposited as solid material. In the case of stalactites, this process involves the gradual accumulation of minerals like calcite over thousands of years, which ultimately forms the beautiful and majestic structures we see in caves today. Given the choices provided, a stalactite is the only viable option that could develop through the consistent deposition of materials in a dark, cavernous area. Let's analyze the other options: (a). Apple juice: Apple juice cannot develop in a cave through the deposition process. It is a liquid produced by pressing apples, and it is not related to the geological or mineral processes that occur in cavernous areas. (c). Road rash: Road rash is a term used to describe an injury sustained from sliding across a hard surface, typically after falling off a moving vehicle like a bicycle or a motorcycle. This type of injury has no connection to the deposition process or the formation of stalactites in caves. (d). Blue jeans: Blue jeans are a type of clothing made from denim fabric. They are manufactured by humans and are unrelated to natural geological processes or the formation of stalactites in cavernous areas. In summary, if things are deposited consistently in dark, cavernous areas, a stalactite (option b) is the most plausible structure that could develop because it is formed by the deposition of minerals carried by groundwater, which is a common occurrence in caves. The other options are unrelated to the geological processes that occur in such environments and are therefore not reasonable answers to the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you love family guy, you need to own this movie. I have seen it about four or five times now and as always, I recognize things I didn't the first few times.

For 15 dollars, this movie is worth it to any family guy lover :) A:","output":"Reading this review, it would most likely increase the chances of you buying the product. Let's break down the reasoning step by step: 1. The review title is extremely positive, indicating that the product may be better than expected.  2. The reviewer makes it clear that they highly recommend this product, specifically to fans of Family Guy. If the potential buyer is a fan of Family Guy, it reassures them that the product is a good fit for their interests. 3. The reviewer has watched the movie multiple times, this shows they consider it rewatchable and hints towards high entertainment value. 4. The mention of humour that could even \\"make grandma laugh\\" is a positive point, as it suggests the product has broad appeal. 5. The reviewer admits that people who aren't regular viewers of Family Guy might not get all the jokes, but this is a minor caveat that just targets the product more specifically towards fans. 6. The reviewer concludes that the movie is worth its price for any Family Guy fan, this reassures the potential buyer of its value for money. In summary, this review is more likely to increase the chances of someone, especially a Family Guy fan, buying the product.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Holst had formed the Purcell Singers, a small semi-professional choir, in October 1952, largely at the instigation of Pears. From 1954 the choir became regular performers at the Aldeburgh Festival, with programmes ranging from rarely heard medieval music to 20th-century works. Among choir members who later achieved individual distinction were the bass-baritone John Shirley-Quirk, the tenors Robert Tear and Philip Langridge, and the founder and conductor of the Heinrich Schütz Choir, Roger Norrington. Langridge remembered with particular pleasure a performance in Orford church of Thomas Tallis's forty-part motet Spem in alium, on 2 July 1963.   When she gave up the conductorship of the choir in 1967, much of its musical mission, in particular its commitment to early music, was assumed by other groups, such as Norrington's Schütz Choir and the Purcell Consort formed by the ex-Purcell Singers chorister Grayston Burgess.On 2 June 1967 Holst shared the podium with Britten in the concert inaugurating the Aldeburgh Festival's new home at the Snape Maltings. From 1972 Holst was involved with the development of educational classes at the Maltings, which began with weekend singing classes and developed into the Britten-Pears School for Advanced Musical Studies, with its own training orchestra. By this time Imogen's performances at the festival had become increasingly rare, but in 1975 she conducted a concert of Gustav Holst's brass band music, held outdoors at Framlingham Castle. A report of the event described an evening of \\"persistent drizzle ... until a diminutive figure in a special scarlet dress took the conductor's baton. The band was transformed, and played Holst's Suite as it has never been played before\\".Britten had been in poor health since undergoing heart surgery in 1973, and on 4 December 1976 he died. Holst was unsure that she could maintain a working relationship with Pears alone, and on reaching the age of 70 in 1977, decided she would retire as artistic director after that year's festival.

In this device a Y 3Al 5O 12:Ce (known as \\"YAG\\") phosphor coating on the emitter absorbs some of the blue emission and produces yellow light through fluorescence.

The number of white children being born in Washington D.C. has risen by 34 per cent, showing the capital is going through a baby boom. New figures released by the US Census Bureau suggested the number of infants and toddlers under the age of five has grown in the district by five per cent up to 39,000. The statistics also highlighted the number of children aged between five and 13 had risen by seven per cent, but teenagers older than 14 were declining. Baby boom: The number of white infants and toddlers being born in Washington D.C. has risen by 34 per cent. The rise among white infants and toddlers is being attributed to new parents in their 30s and early 40s. Demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution told the Washington Post a similar phenomenon is occurring in urban centres such as Manhattan, where young white professionals have settled and established lives before marriage and children. He said: 'They came for the bright lights of the city, and started dating and mating.' The drop in teenagers was blamed on families leaving the city before their sons or daughters started high school. The District’s baby boom is spiking not only in neighborhoods that have long attracted families, such as the suburban-like Upper Northwest or family-friendly Capitol Hill. Babies and toddlers are often seen on city streets near downtown neighborhoods such as Logan and Dupont circles. Places like Mount Pleasant and Columbia Heights are predominantly filled with young, single adults and have been responsible for most of the capital's growth over the past decade.","output":"The capital city of the United States, Washington D.C., is experiencing a baby boom, with the number of white children born in the city rising by 34 percent.

Write a title for this article: They did not stir as artillery shells passed high overhead to slam into Sarja, the village they had fled, even as each distant rumble told of an explosion that might have killed them had they remained at home. “There are eight families here,” said Jaber Zein Aldin, 72, who watched from the school door as red tracers arced through the night sky. “Forty people, escaping the shelling and the aircraft.” In northern Syria, the fighters seeking the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad have created zones in which they and local revolutionary councils are the interim governing force. They have organized basic services, including field hospitals, policing, courts and rubble cleanup. In at least one town, they publish a small newspaper. And here they move openly and prepare for the next fight. But even in this de facto safe area, the Syrian government retains a lethal reach. Unable to pursue the rebels on the ground through the farmland and mountains of Idlib and Aleppo Provinces, Mr. Assad’s forces drop bombs from aircraft and shell villages where rebels are active, endangering civilians. It has also cut off water from much of the countryside and switches electricity on and off, punishing some towns with longer blackouts than others depending on residents’ suspected sentiments. The two sides have entered a duet of attrition, turning life in the Idlib countryside into a wearying grind punctuated, in flashes and roars, by moments of spectacular and often indiscriminate violence. With cooler weather approaching, many crops at risk and fuel in short supply, Syrians assessing the prospects for the second winter since the uprising began say the outlook is grim. “We are afraid of the winter,” said Moyad, a pharmacist and a member of the governing revolutionary council in Kafr Takharim, a city of about 25,000 people. Moyad asked that his surname be withheld to protect his relatives from retaliation. “During these last months we have received fuel only twice, and we have not much flour for bread. This winter will be cruel.” On a strictly military level, the rebellion’s tactical successes have been undeniable. At the start of this year, they were all but in hiding, and government troops moved freely over the ground. Since then the rebels’ campaign of ambushes and roadside bombs has cleared swaths of territory and forced army and militia convoys to avoid most roads. Even the M5 highway, an asphalt ribbon linking many of Syria’s largest cities, has long stretches that are in rebel hands. The rebels’ flag flies over their own border crossings to Turkey, at Bab al-Hawa and at the Syrian side of Kilis, beckoning to areas of the country the rebels call free. Yet Syria’s military and the loyalist militias are far from defeated. They have concentrated forces in cities and retained part of the archipelago of outposts that they occupied in the countryside when the crackdown intensified last year. And they have unleashed an air campaign, dropping free-fall bombs or firing rockets onto rebel territory, an indiscriminate practice documented this month in field research by Amnesty International. Often the ordnance strikes homes. In Ablin — the hometown of Lt. Col. Hussein Harmoush, the first public defector from the Syrian Army — an airstrike destroyed the medical center. With no end to the violence near, Mr. Aldin and his family, sleeping in the classrooms of Ruweiha, have become a drop in a human tide. Some families have crowded into others’ homes, where women and children huddle, sometimes with wounded fighters, listening for the next blasts and wondering where to go. In Kafr Takharim, for instance, Moyad said families had taken in as many as 6,000 civilians displaced by the fighting in Aleppo, where a battle has raged since midsummer. Kawkab Darweesh, who has been displaced for months, said she and her family had been uprooted, forced to survive off the hospitality of friends. She was from the mountain town of Rama, where government troops remain. Both sides are expecting a battle for the town, she said, and she does not know if her home still stands. “We are afraid to go back,” she said. “We don’t know what happened there. They are destroying houses over the owners’ heads.” Other families have moved into the olive groves, where they camp in pump houses, small agricultural buildings or even in archaeological ruins. Many have fled over the nearest border, to Turkey. On one recent night, just short of the border near the Turkish city of Reyhanli, Syrian families mingled with smugglers in the fields, waiting for gaps between the Turkish border patrols and then dashing for the barbed wire and to life as refugees. More than 90,000 Syrians who have fled the fighting are registered in 13 temporary refugee camps along Turkey’s 550-mile-long border with Syria, according to figures released Friday by the Turkish government. Many more have crossed the border illegally and are not in the official tallies. One local Turkish official, who asked not to be named because of his diplomatic status, estimated that at least 60,000 Syrian refugees were living unregistered in Turkey. Aside from the camps, Turkey has set up a temporary shelter by the border gate in Kilis, where another 8,000 Syrians stay and receive daily supplies, the official said. “We see a surge in numbers on days of heavy shelling by the regime around Aleppo and Idlib, but try to contain daily entries around 500,” he said. “There are still thousands of people who have left their homes and live in the fields.” Many people here said they felt abandoned by the world. The rebels are short of weapons, the civilians short of safe shelter and the necessities of life. Jamal Marouf, a prominent rebel commander in the highlands of Jebel al-Zawiya, where much of the army has been driven away, said the rebels were trying to restore services that ended with the withdrawal of the government, but they lacked the means to be fully effective. “All of the institutions are not working any more,” he said.

It literally took me forever to get through it. I read the first 10 pages of this book, then set it down on my bookshelf. That was 3 years ago. I decided to finally finish reading the book this summer (2004). I haven't had to force myself to read a book like that in such a long time. She uses a lot of characters in this novel, so much so that she created a family tree in the inside cover just to keep the readers (and herself) from getting so confused. The story line itself is not as rich as her other plots. I'm a big fan of McMillan and have read all of her novels. However, this book just does not do her writing or story-telling skills any justice. She should have written a caveat emptor in her prologue that read \\"Buyer beware. You'll be disappointed right down to the very last sentence of this novel.\\" I hope McMillan redeems authorship in more current novels.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: The park had a refuse and littering problem, so they added another what? Possible A: tip, park officer, incinerator, dump, wastebasket  Why is \\"wastebasket\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Wastebasket\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense primarily because it directly addresses the issue of refuse and littering in a manner that is both practical and commonly used in public spaces such as parks. In order to delve into the reasoning behind this choice, let's analyze each of the given options: 1. Tip: A tip usually refers to a landfill or waste disposal site. While it technically serves the purpose of waste management, it is not feasible to place a landfill within a park frequently visited by people. It would be counterproductive, unhygienic, and detrimental to the park's overall aesthetics, which in turn may discourage visitors. 2. Park officer: A park officer can help enforce the littering rules and regulations in the park. While this may lead to a decrease in the amount of refuse, it does not directly provide a means for disposing of waste. Visitors would still require a means to dispose of their waste, and park officers may not always be available or able to manage the littering problem across the entire park area. 3. Incinerator: Although incinerators play a role in waste management, they might not be the most appropriate choice for a park. Incinerators typically involve burning waste, which can cause air pollution and release toxic fumes. This would be hazardous to the health of park visitors and the environment. Additionally, building and operating an incinerator in a public park might not be feasible due to its size, cost, and regulatory requirements. 4. Dump: Similar to a tip, a dump refers to a location where waste is disposed of, often in an uncontrolled manner. Placing a dump within a park would be unsightly, unhygienic, and against the purpose of maintaining a clean and pleasant environment for park visitors. Like with the option of a tip, it does not align with human common sense when it comes to solving littering problems in parks. 5. Wastebasket: A wastebasket, or trash can, is a receptacle designed to hold and collect waste. Adding more wastebaskets in a park with a littering problem directly addresses the issue by providing designated areas for visitors to dispose of their waste. Wastebaskets are practical, commonly used solutions in public spaces that aim to maintain cleanliness and orderliness. They are also easily accessible to park visitors and encourage responsible waste disposal without compromising the park's appearance and atmosphere. Therefore, \\"wastebasket\\" is the answer that aligns with human common sense because it is a practical, efficient, and commonly used solution to address the littering problem in parks without causing any additional harm to the environment, visitors' health, or the park's aesthetic value."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Muhammad Ali (; born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr.; January 17, 1942 - June 3, 2016) was an American professional boxer and activist. He is widely regarded as one of the most significant and celebrated sports figures of the 20th century. From early in his career, Ali was known as an inspiring, controversial, and polarizing figure both inside and outside the ring. Cassius Clay was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, and began training as an amateur boxer when he was 12 years old. Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. () was born on January 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky. He had a sister and four brothers. He was named for his father, Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr. (1912-1990), who himself was named in honor of the 19th-century Republican politician and staunch abolitionist, Cassius Marcellus Clay, also from the state of Kentucky. Clay's father's paternal grandparents were John Clay and Sallie Anne Clay; Clay's sister Eva claimed that Sallie was a native of Madagascar. He was a descendant of slaves of the antebellum South, and was predominantly of African descent, with smaller amounts of Irish and English heritage. His father painted billboards and signs, and his mother, Odessa O'Grady Clay (1917-1994), was a domestic helper. Although Cassius Sr. was a Methodist, he allowed Odessa to bring up both Cassius Jr. and his younger brother Rudolph \\"Rudy\\" Clay (later renamed Rahman Ali) as Baptists. Cassius Jr. attended Central High School in Louisville.  Clay grew up amid racial segregation. His mother recalled one occasion when he was denied a drink of water at a store--\\"They wouldn't give him one because of his color. That really affected him.\\" He was also affected by the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, which led to young Clay and a friend's taking out their frustration by vandalizing a local railyard.  Clay was first directed toward boxing by Louisville police officer and boxing coach Joe E. Martin, who encountered the 12-year-old fuming over a thief's having taken his bicycle. He told the officer he was going to \\"whup\\" the thief. The officer told Clay he had better learn how to box first. Initially, Clay did not take up Martin's offer, but after seeing amateur boxers on a local television boxing program called Tomorrow's Champions, Clay was interested in the prospect of fighting. He then began to work with trainer Fred Stoner, whom he credits with giving him the \\"real training\\", eventually moulding \\"my style, my stamina and my system\\". For the last four years of Clay's amateur career he was trained by boxing cutman Chuck Bodak.  Clay made his amateur boxing debut in 1954 against local amateur boxer Ronnie O'Keefe. He won by split decision. He went on to win six Kentucky Golden Gloves titles, two national Golden Gloves titles, an Amateur Athletic Union national title, and the Light Heavyweight gold medal in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. Clay's amateur record was 100 wins with five losses. Ali said in his 1975 autobiography that shortly after his return from the Rome Olympics, he threw his gold medal into the Ohio River after he and a friend were refused service at a \\"whites-only\\" restaurant and fought with a white gang. The story was later disputed, and several of Ali's friends, including Bundini Brown and photographer Howard Bingham, denied it. Brown told Sports Illustrated writer Mark Kram, \\"Honkies sure bought into that one!\\" Thomas Hauser's biography of Ali stated that Ali was refused service at the diner but that he lost his medal a year after he won it. Ali received a replacement medal at a basketball intermission during the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, where he lit the torch to start the games. where was he  born","output":"Muhammad Ali was born in Louisville, Kentucky, on January 17, 1942."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - Dream Theater is an American progressive metal band formed in 1985 under the name Majesty by John Petrucci, John Myung, and Mike Portnoy while they attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. They subsequently dropped out of their studies to concentrate further on the band that would ultimately become Dream Theater. Though a number of lineup changes followed, the three original members remained together along with James LaBrie and Jordan Rudess until September 8, 2010, when Portnoy left the band. In October 2010, the band held auditions for a drummer to replace Portnoy. Mike Mangini was announced as the new permanent drummer on April 29, 2011.  - Satan (\\"satan\\", meaning \\"enemy\\" or \\"adversary\\"; \\"shaitan\\", meaning; \\"astray\\", \\"distant\\", or sometimes \\"devil\\") is a figure appearing in the texts of the Abrahamic religions who brings evil and temptation, and is known as the deceiver who leads humanity astray. Some religious groups teach that he originated as an angel, or something of the like, who used to possess great piety and beauty, but fell because of hubris, seducing humanity into the ways of falsehood and sin, and has power in the fallen world. In the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, Satan is primarily an accuser and adversary, a decidedly malevolent entity, also called the devil, who possesses abhorrent qualities. Although Satan is generally viewed as having negative characteristics, some groups have very different beliefs. In Theistic Satanism, Satan is considered a deity who is either worshipped or revered. In LaVeyan Satanism, \\"Satan\\" is a symbol of virtuous characteristics and liberty.  - Reign in Blood is the third studio album and the major-label debut by American thrash metal band Slayer. It was released on October 7, 1986, by Def Jam Recordings. The album was the band's first collaboration with record producer Rick Rubin, whose input helped the band's sound evolve. \\"Reign in Blood\\" was well received by both critics and fans, and was responsible for bringing Slayer to the attention of a mainstream metal audience. \\"Kerrang!\\" magazine described the record as \\"the heaviest album of all\\". Alongside Anthrax's \\"Among the Living\\", Megadeth's \\"Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?\\" and Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\", \\"Reign in Blood\\" helped define the sound of the emerging US thrash metal scene in the mid-1980s, and has remained influential since then.  - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information.  - Cannibal Corpse is an American death metal band from Buffalo, New York. Formed in December 1988, the band has released thirteen studio albums, two box sets, four video albums and two live albums. The band has had little radio or television exposure throughout its career, although a cult following began to build after the release of the 1991 album \\"Butchered at Birth\\", and 1992 album \\"Tomb of the Mutilated\\". As of 2015, they had achieved worldwide sales of two million units for combined sales of all their albums, making them the top-selling death metal band of all time.  - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.  - RED Distribution, LLC (formerly Relativity Entertainment Distribution) is a Sony Music Entertainment-owned sales and marketing division that handles releases for more than sixty independent record labels. It is also home to 'stache media, a marketing and brand partnership agency based in New York City.  - \\"Eyes of the Insane\\" is a 2006 single by the American thrash metal band Slayer, taken from their 2006 album \\"Christ Illusion\\". The lyrics explore an American soldier's mental anguish following his return home from the second Gulf War, and are based on an article entitled \\"Casualty of War\\" in \\"Texas Monthly\\" magazine. \\"Eyes of the Insane\\" was written by vocalist Tom Araya during pre-production for the album. The song was generally well received by critics, and also peaked #15 on the Danish singles charts.  - Lars Ulrich ( born December 26, 1963) is a Danish musician, songwriter, actor, and record producer. He is best known as the drummer and co-founder of the American heavy metal band Metallica. The son of tennis player Torben Ulrich and grandson of tennis player Einer Ulrich, he also played tennis in his youth and moved to Los Angeles at age 16 to train professionally.

Cult media are often associated with underground culture, and are considered too eccentric or subversive to be appreciated by the general public or to be a commercial success. Many cult fans express a certain irony about their devotion. Sometimes, these cult followings cross the border to camp followings.

For Dafoe and his wife it must have been fun working together in a film for the first time, without taking into consideration that people might actually watch it. I felt like it was 90mins wasted as I waited anxiously for a plot to develop, or even begin. Try to fit this film into a genre and you won't, because it lacks a beginning, middle or ending. I've seen 'arty' movies before and this doesn't even come close to being arty, abstract or original, it just seems to me to be completely pointless. I think it speaks for itself when the only persons that rated this film a 10 were the under 18 age group. No doubt for the constant pointless erotic scenes that the film was insistent on throwing at us. That is if you can call it erotic. It certainly didn't have taste. What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment with the film, stating that it feels more like a filming exercise rather than a film meant for public viewing. They mention that it must have been fun for the actors involved, but not for the audience who may watch it, as it was perceived as a waste of 90 minutes. The reviewer also criticizes the film's structure, explaining that it lacks a clear beginning, middle, or end and cannot fit into any specific genre. They argue that the film fails to achieve any sense of artistry or originality, making it seem entirely pointless. Additionally, the reviewer points out that the only audience who seemed to enjoy the film were the under-18 age group, likely due to the numerous and seemingly unnecessary erotic scenes. The reviewer does not find these scenes tasteful or appealing, further emphasizing their negative perception of the film. Ultimately, the sentiment of this review indicates a strong dissatisfaction with the film, arguing that it lacks substance, structure, and taste, ultimately deeming it a waste of time for viewers."},{"instruction":"Q:Not as a nurse, but as a patient. I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no “hard feelings.” Question: How long did it take the author to fully recover from the surgical mishap?

The president of the National Union of Students Toni Pearce said: \\"The suggestion that tuition fees should be charged at this level shows just how astonishingly out of touch some university vice-presidents can be.\\" Prof. Petford argued there will be a change in how universities view home students - suggesting they will be treated more like international students. \\"If you look at international students, that's been a market not well-governed since we've been recruiting (tix) overseas students. Universities have always been used to this sort of behaviour.\\" He said. \\"The big step change now is thinking about home students in this way.\\" Presently there is no cap on fees that universities can charge international students. The president of Universities UK, Christopher Snowden, said that his report showed universities needed more money to maintain their current standards. \\"The rise in tuition fees in England did not give all universities extra money - it replaced the cuts in direct government funding  , \\" he said. Question: Winat can be inferred from Christopher Snowdon's words? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Tuition fees in England had been raised before.\\"? Answer:","output":"From Christopher Snowdon's words, it can be inferred that the rise in tuition fees in England served as a replacement for the cuts in direct government funding, rather than providing universities with extra money. This suggests that the decision to increase tuition fees was made in response to financial pressures on universities stemming from decreased government support. As for the answer to the question \\"Tuition fees in England had been raised before\\" - the information provided in the passage indicates that yes, tuition fees have indeed been raised before, as they were increased to £9,000 for British students. Christopher Snowden's statement highlights the context for this increase, explaining that it served to offset the reduction in direct government funding that higher education institutions faced, rather than providing an overall financial gain for universities. Therefore, it can be concluded that tuition fees in England have been raised previously."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I know that the answer to the question \\"The Barbier reaction is used to produce what organometallic compound?\\" is in \\"There are many important organozinc compounds. Organozinc chemistry is the science of organozinc compounds describing their physical properties, synthesis and reactions. Among important applications is the Frankland-Duppa Reaction in which an oxalate ester(ROCOCOOR) reacts with an alkyl halide R'X, zinc and hydrochloric acid to the α-hydroxycarboxylic esters RR'COHCOOR, the Reformatskii reaction which converts α-halo-esters and aldehydes to β-hydroxy-esters, the Simmons–Smith reaction in which the carbenoid (iodomethyl)zinc iodide reacts with alkene(or alkyne) and converts them to cyclopropane, the Addition reaction of organozinc compounds to carbonyl compounds. The Barbier reaction (1899) is the zinc equivalent of the magnesium Grignard reaction and is better of the two. In presence of just about any water the formation of the organomagnesium halide will fail, whereas the Barbier reaction can even take place in water. On the downside organozincs are much less nucleophilic than Grignards, are expensive and difficult to handle. Commercially available diorganozinc compounds are dimethylzinc, diethylzinc and diphenylzinc. In one study the active organozinc compound is obtained from much cheaper organobromine precursors:\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"The organometallic compound produced in the Barbier reaction is an organozinc compound. The Barbier reaction is the zinc equivalent of the magnesium Grignard reaction, with the major advantage being that it can even take place in water. The reaction involves a nucleophilic addition of an organozinc compound to a carbonyl compound. Like the Grignard reaction, the Barbier reaction results in the formation of an alkoxide ion, which can subsequently be protonated to produce the corresponding alcohol. In summary, the Barbier reaction is used to produce organozinc compounds, which can further react with carbonyl compounds to generate alkoxide ions and ultimately alcohols upon protonation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is used to assist in the growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of landscapes, and revegetation of disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of inadequate rainfall. Additionally, irrigation also has a few other uses in crop production, which include protecting plants against frost, suppressing weed growth in grain fields and preventing soil consolidation. In contrast, agriculture that relies only on direct rainfall is referred to as rain-fed or dry land farming.  - New South Wales (abbreviated as NSW) is a state on the east coast of :Australia. It borders Queensland to the north, Victoria to the south, and South Australia to the west. It has a coast line with the Tasman Sea on its east side.

Inhabitants of New South Wales are referred to as \\"New South Welshmen\\".  - In geography, a plain is a flat area. Plains occur as lowlands along the bottoms of valleys, coastal plains and as plateaus or uplands at high elevations. In a valley, a plain is enclosed on two sides but in other cases a plain may be delineated by a complete or partial ring of hills, by mountains or cliffs. Where a geological region contains more than one plain, they may be connected by a pass (sometime termed a gap). Plains may have been formed from flowing lava, deposited by water, ice, wind, or formed by erosion by these agents from hills and mountains.  - The Riverina  is an agricultural region of south-western New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The Riverina is distinguished from other Australian regions by the combination of flat plains, warm to hot climate and an ample supply of water for irrigation. This combination has allowed the Riverina to develop into one of the most productive and agriculturally diverse areas of Australia. Bordered on the south by the state of Victoria and on the east by the Great Dividing Range, the Riverina covers those areas of New South Wales in the Murray and Murrumbidgee drainage zones to their confluence in the west.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands.

The answer is:","output":"The supposed perturbation of a person having a panic attack does not have a direct effect on the process of fossil formation. The process of fossil formation, as described in the question, relies on natural geological occurrences, such as decomposition and sedimentation, which are not directly influenced by an individual's panic attack. However, if we were to consider an indirect effect, a person experiencing a panic attack could potentially influence human activities that might impact the environment. For example, if their panic attack led to increased awareness about environmental issues and they decided to take action, such as advocating for the protection of natural habitats or reducing pollution, then this could have a ripple effect that might eventually result in better-preserved environments conducive to fossil formation.

This decision was based upon the teacher's observation of the students and their work habits throughout the course of their classes. In contrast to Robert, who always seemed to have his papers and assignments well-organized and easily accessible, Ian often struggled to find important documents and notes in his cluttered notebook. The teacher, noticing this distinct difference in organization skills, felt that it was necessary to address the issue with Ian instead of posing the question to both students. It was not that the teacher dismissed Robert's organization skills or did not value his efforts in keeping his notebook neatly arranged; rather, it was because the teacher recognized that Ian may need some additional guidance and encouragement in this area. This was an important aspect of learning for both students, as being able to maintain an organized notebook played a crucial role in helping them keep track of important information and concepts, ultimately making them more efficient and effective learners. In asking the question specifically to Ian, the teacher hoped to instill a sense of responsibility in him for the organization of his own learning materials. By bringing attention to this issue, the teacher aimed to motivate Ian to be more mindful of his notebook's contents and to be more proactive in maintaining a structured system for his coursework. This approach was intended to be a subtle yet powerful reminder for Ian, who may not have been fully aware of the consequences of his disorganization on his learning process. Additionally, by focusing on Ian's organization skills, the teacher subtly indicated to Robert that his efforts were recognized and appreciated. This affirmation could serve to reinforce his current habits, ensuring that he continued to prioritize keeping his learning materials in order. Furthermore, this situation might also serve as a learning opportunity for Robert, as he could potentially take note of the feedback given to Ian and apply it not just to his own organization skills, but also in offering support and mentorship to his classmates. Ultimately, the teacher's choice to ask Ian but not Robert if they were going to organize their notebook because Ian was orderly, showcased their attentiveness to each individual student's needs and strengths. By addressing what may have appeared to be a minor issue in notebook organization, the teacher was teaching valuable lessons on self-awareness, accountability, and the importance of effective study habits that played a significant role in the students' academic success and personal growth."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". Capitalisation in English, in terms of the general orthographic rules independent of context (e.g. title vs. heading vs. text), is universally standardized for formal writing. (Informal communication, such as texting, instant messaging or a handwritten sticky note, may not bother, but that is because its users usually do not expect it to be formal.) In English, capital letters are used as the first letter of a sentence, a proper noun, or a proper adjective. There are a few pairs of words of different meanings whose only difference is capitalisation of the first letter. The names of the days of the week and the names of the months are also capitalised, as are the first-person pronoun \\"I\\" and the interjection \\"O\\" (although the latter is uncommon in modern usage, with \\"oh\\" being preferred). Other words normally start with a lower-case letter. There are, however, situations where further capitalisation may be used to give added emphasis, for example in headings and titles (see below). In some traditional forms of poetry, capitalisation has conventionally been used as a marker to indicate the beginning of a line of verse independent of any grammatical feature.

A bobby pin is a small hair accessory that is used to hold hair in place. It is made of a thin, metal wire that is bent in half and designed to be slipped into the hair to keep it neat and tidy. Option a). to clip socks in place is incorrect because bobby pins are not designed for holding socks together. They are too small and weak for that purpose, and other tools like laundry clips or sock clips are better suited for keeping socks in place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In this task you are expected to fix an SQL query based on feedback. You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

The Brown Eyed Girls (Hangul: beuraun aideu geolseu, Japanese: buraunaidogaruzu), often abbreviated as B.E.G., BG or beuageol (beu-ah-geol) is a South Korean girl group managed by Mystic Entertainment. The group consists of four members: JeA, Miryo, Narsha, and Gain. They debuted as an R&B/Ballad vocal group with \\"Come Closer (dagawaseo)\\" in 2006 and have since challenged themselves with a notable variety of different music genres. They rose to popularity in 2008 with \\"L.O.V.E\\" and their retro-dance number \\"How Come,\\" and cemented their position in the K-pop world in 2009 with \\"Abracadabra\\", with its electronica-based genre, pioneering (albeit controversial) concept, along with its iconic and now globally recognized dance entitled 'The Arrogant Dance (sigeonbangcum)'--successfully ingraining themselves into modern popular culture. The group's leader, Jea, was the one responsible of the group's creation and was actively involved in the selection of the other members, picking out Miryo, who was known as a great female rapper from the hip-hop community having previously worked with other fellow rappers, such as Gil Seong-joon from Leessang, and the main female rapper in well-known hip-hop group Honey Family. Narsha was chosen when Jea remembered her as a \\"talented singer\\" from her high school days, and Ga-in was selected by the three members after she was eliminated from \\"Battle Shin Hwa.\\" According to Ga-in, she was crying in the bathroom after failing the audition, was found by composer Ahn Jung Hoon, and then was chosen through the audition in Brown Eyed Girls' company. Singer Yoari trained with the group until 2006, when it was decided she would be the lead singer for Sprinkler. The four members held several small size concerts, and was actually known as \\"Crescendo\\" before officially debuting as \\"Brown Eyed Girls.\\"  After more than 3 years of training in singing and holding several small size concerts, the Brown Eyed Girls released their debut album Your Story in South Korea on March 2, 2006, with the ballad track, \\"Come Closer\\" as their single. Debuting as a \\"faceless group\\" they did not appear on any visual media and chose to not even appear in their own music video. The album was well received by critics but did not do as well as expected commercially. The album was later re-released to include \\"Hold The Line\\" (which samples \\"Push The Button\\" by British girl band Sugababes and \\"Technologic\\" by Daft Punk). This song became a hit, further boosting the band's popularity. \\"Hold the Line\\" was disclosed across the world because it was included in the list of songs from the game Pump it Up.  After a short break, the group went back into the studio to work on their second album Leave Ms. Kim (ddeonara miseugim), which included their R&B title track \\"You Got Me Fooled\\" (neoege sogassda). Subsequent singles were \\"Oasis\\" (oasiseu) featuring Lee Jae Hoon and \\"It's Mine\\" (naeggeoya), a collaboration with fellow group SeeYa.  During the break between their debut and second albums, the Brown Eyed Girls released their first digital single entitled \\"I Am a Summer\\" (naega yeoreumida), which was later included in their second LP.  The first two albums contained typical R&B ballads which had been very popular in the K-pop scene. However, the commercial success was relatively higher in two singles between the first and second albums. Moreover, the second album containing \\"You Got Me Fooled\\" (neoege sogassda) was released at nearly the same time as Wonder Girls' \\"Tell Me\\" which received a nationwide success in Korea. Therefore, their second album was once again a commercial disappointment. At the same time, the general K-pop scene was changing from R&B ballads to dance music. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: did Leave Ms. Kim have any singles released?","output":"Yes, Leave Ms. Kim had singles released.

Lyric Dogs, if she was not mistaken, was an alternative band known for their unique blend of heavy metal and poetic lyrics. It wasn't surprising that she wouldn't follow them closely, as their music could be quite unusual and not catered to everyone's taste. But the song she heard on the radio, with just the singer and one guitar, intrigued her as it seemed to deviate from the band's regular sound. The idea of an acoustic version of their songs could be a fascinating prospect. Stripping down the music to its core and focusing on the lyrics might offer a new perspective on their artistry and could potentially help her appreciate the band in a different light. The absence of heavy metal accompaniment could reveal previously unnoticed nuances in the melody and vocal delivery, making the listening experience fresh and engaging. If Lyric Dogs had indeed released an acoustic album, she should consider giving it a listen with an open mind. Sometimes, bands and artists explore various creative avenues to experiment with their sound, showcase their versatility, or express their emotions in a different way. This often leads to fresh and captivating renditions of familiar songs that could be enjoyable for both long-time fans and casual listeners. To get a hold of the acoustic album, she could start by doing some online research. She could follow the band on their official social media accounts and check major music streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, or Amazon Music. These platforms often provide extensive album collections and feature both popular and lesser-known releases from various artists. Moreover, she could try joining some fan forums or online communities dedicated to Lyric Dogs and similar music genres. Fans in these communities are usually very knowledgeable and willing to help others discover new music or find specific releases. Alternatively, she could visit local music stores or check online retailers such as Amazon or eBay for physical copies of the album. If the band had released a limited edition or a special collector's version of the acoustic album, she might be able to find unique designs, exclusive bonus tracks, or other exclusive extras that accompany these premium releases. In conclusion, the acoustic version she heard on the radio might be a part of Lyric Dogs' experiment with a different sound or a special release meant for a niche audience. Whatever the case, it has sparked her interest in the band and their music, and she should definitely explore this newly discovered territory. By seeking out the acoustic album and giving it a thorough listen, she can expand her musical horizons, get to know the artistic side of the band, and maybe even become a fan of Lyric Dogs in the process."}]`),Y={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],D={key:0},R={key:1};function E(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
