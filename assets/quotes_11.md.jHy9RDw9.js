What is the final step of the following process: -  Human beings burn fossil fuels (oil, gas, etc.) - Carbon dioxide from the burning fossil fuels enter the atmosphere - The make-up of the atmosphere changes - Some energy from the sun cannot escape back through the changed atmosphere - The earth begins to heat because of the extra trapped energy - Human beings cut down trees - Human beings do not re-plant the trees - Trees cannot help take the extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - The extra trapped energy starts to change the earth&#x27;s short term weather A:","output":"The final step of the aforementioned process is the alteration of the Earth's climate system, leading to long-term irreversible consequences for ecosystems, economies, and communities. This phenomenon is known as anthropogenic climate change, or more commonly, global warming. The build-up of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere traps heat, causing an overall warming effect. This effect is further exacerbated by deforestation, as humans cut down trees but do not replace them, leading to fewer trees available to absorb the excess carbon dioxide. The short-term changes in weather caused by the excess trapped energy gradually become more persistent and widespread, resulting in significant shifts in climate patterns. As the Earth's climate continues to change, several consequences emerge, including: 1. Rising global temperatures: The average surface temperature of the Earth increases, causing more frequent and severe heatwaves. This can have detrimental impacts on agriculture, human health, and the survival of various plant and animal species. 2. Melting polar ice caps and glaciers: As temperatures rise, ice caps and glaciers start to melt, contributing to rising sea levels. This poses a significant threat to low-lying coastal regions, which can experience flooding, coastal erosion, and damage to infrastructure. 3. Ocean acidification: As the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, more of it gets absorbed by the ocean, resulting in a decrease in the water's pH level. This acidity can disrupt the ability of marine life, such as shellfish and coral reefs, to build and maintain their shells or skeletons, leading to a decline in these essential ecosystems. 4. Changes in precipitation patterns: Altered atmospheric conditions due to climate change can lead to changes in precipitation levels and distribution, with some regions experiencing more droughts or floods. This can affect water availability, agriculture, and ecosystems in different parts of the world. 5. More extreme weather events: Instances of hurricanes, typhoons, storms, and other extreme weather events may potentially increase in frequency and intensity due to the warming of the Earth. This can result in more significant damage to human settlements, infrastructure, and the environment. 6. Extinction of species and loss of biodiversity: As the Earth's ecosystems undergo rapid shifts due to climate change, many plant and animal species struggle to adapt and may face extinction. This loss of biodiversity can have cascading effects on the environment, leading to further imbalance and damage. 7. Adverse impacts on human health, economy, and society: Climate change can have dire consequences on human health, with heatwaves, floods, droughts, and other extreme events causing death, injury, and disease. Additionally, these changes can disrupt economies, challenge agricultural systems, and increase the possibility of political and social conflicts due to resource scarcity and forced migration. In conclusion, the final step of the process that begins with burning fossil fuels and deforestation is the pervasive and profound alteration of the Earth's climate. This leads to long-term consequences for the planet's ecosystems, economies, and communities, often exacerbating existing challenges and necessitating urgent adaptation and mitigation measures."},{"instruction":"Big Maria Mountains -  The Big Maria Mountains are located in the southeastern part of the U.S. state of California near the Colorado River and Arizona.

Q:Information:  - Ann Hart Coulter (born December 8, 1961) is an American conservative social and political commentator, writer, syndicated columnist, and lawyer. She frequently appears on television, radio, and as a speaker at public and private events.  - Roger Joseph Ebert (June 18, 1942  April 4, 2013) was an American film critic and historian, journalist, screenwriter, and author. He was a film critic for the \\"Chicago Sun-Times\\" from 1967 until his death in 2013. In 1975, Ebert became the first film critic to win the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism.  - Structural engineering is mainly a sub-division of civil engineering where structural engineers are trained to understand, predict, and calculate the stability, strength and rigidity of built structures for buildings and non-building structures, to develop designs and integrate their design with that of other designers, and to supervise construction of projects on site. They can also be involved in the design of machinery, medical equipment, vehicles etc. where structural integrity affects functioning and safety.  - An arch is a curved structure that spans a space and may or may not support weight above it. Arch may be synonymous with vault, but a vault may be distinguished as a continuous arch forming a roof. Arches appeared as early as the 2nd millennium BC in Mesopotamian brick architecture, and their systematic use started with the Ancient Romans who were the first to apply the technique to a wide range of structures.  - News of the Weird is a syndicated newspaper column edited by Chuck Shepherd that collects bizarre news stories. It was created in 1988. , it is syndicated by Universal Press Syndicate and published in more than 250 newspapers in the United States and Canada. As of July 2008, the daily internet column has merged with two other \\"weird\\" websites to form Weird Universe.  - Earthquake engineering is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering that designs and analyzes structures, such as buildings and bridges, with earthquakes in mind. Its overall goal is to make such structures more resistant to earthquakes. An earthquake (or seismic) engineer aims to construct structures that will not be damaged in minor shaking and will avoid serious damage or collapse in a major earthquake. Earthquake engineering is the scientific field concerned with protecting society, the natural environment, and the man-made environment from earthquakes by limiting the seismic risk to socio-economically acceptable levels. Traditionally, it has been narrowly defined as the study of the behavior of structures and geo-structures subject to seismic loading; it is considered as a subset of structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, applied physics, etc. However, the tremendous costs experienced in recent earthquakes have led to an expansion of its scope to encompass disciplines from the wider field of civil engineering, mechanical engineering and from the social sciences, especially sociology, political science, economics and finance.  - In the United States, same-sex marriage has been legal in all states, Washington, D.C., as well as all U.S. territories except American Samoa, but not on Indian lands, since June 26, 2015, when the United States Supreme Court ruled in \\"Obergefell v. Hodges\\" that state-level bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional. The court ruled that the denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples and the refusal to recognize those marriages performed in other jurisdictions violates the Due Process and the Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The ruling overturned a precedent, \\"Baker v. Nelson\\".  - Compression members are structural elements that are pushed together or carry a load, more technically they are subjected only to axial compressive forces. That is, the loads are applied on the longitudinal axis through the centroid of the member cross section, and the load over the cross sectional area gives the stress on the compressed member. In buildings posts and columns are almost always compression members as are the \\"top chord\\" of trusses.  - Uclick LLC was an American corporation (a division of Andrews McMeel Universal) selling \\"digital entertainment content\\" for the desktop, the web and mobile phones. The company owns and operates several consumer websites, including the comic strip and editorial cartoon site GoComics and the puzzle and casual game sites ThePuzzleSociety.com and UclickGames.com.  - GoComics is a website launched in 2005 by the digital entertainment provider Uclick. It was originally created as a distribution portal for comic strips on mobile phones, but in 2006, the site was redesigned and expanded to include online strips and cartoons. GoComics publishes editorial cartoons, mobile content and daily comics; thus its subtitle toon in daily.  - Margaret Gallagher Srivastav ( born September 14 , 1960 ) , better known by her working name Maggie Gallagher , is an American writer and socially conservative commentator . She wrote a syndicated column for Universal Press Syndicate from 1995 to 2013 and has written books . She serves as president of the Institute for Marriage and Public Policy , a nonprofit organization which lobbies on issues of marriage law . She is an executive committee member , former president and former chairman of the board of the National Organization for Marriage , which opposes same - sex marriage and other legal recognition of same - sex partnerships .  - Same-sex marriage, also known as gay marriage, is marriage between people of the same sex, either as a secular civil ceremony or in a religious setting.  - Universal Press Syndicate, a subsidiary of Andrews McMeel Universal, was an independent press syndicate. It distributed lifestyle and opinion columns, comic strips and other content. Popular columns include Dear Abby, Ann Coulter, Roger Ebert and News of the Weird. Founded in 1970, it was merged in July 2009 with Uclick (which published its comics on GoComics) to form Universal Uclick.  - A column or pillar in architecture and structural engineering is a structural element that transmits, through compression, the weight of the structure above to other structural elements below. In other words, a column is a compression member. The term column applies especially to a large round support (the \\"shaft\\" of the column) with a capital and a \\"base\\" or pedestal and made of stone, or appearing to be so. A small wooden or metal support is typically called a post, and supports with a rectangular or other non-round section are usually called piers. For the purpose of wind or earthquake engineering, columns may be designed to resist lateral forces. Other compression members are often termed \\"columns\\" because of the similar stress conditions. Columns are frequently used to support beams or arches on which the upper parts of walls or ceilings rest. In architecture, \\"column\\" refers to such a structural element that also has certain proportional and decorative features. A column might also be a decorative element not needed for structural purposes; many columns are \\"engaged\\", that is to say form part of a wall.  - Architecture (Latin \\"architectura\\", from the Greek  \\"arkhitekton\\" \\"architect\\", from - \\"chief\\" and  \\"builder\\") is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings and other physical structures. Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements.  - The National Organization for Marriage (NOM) is an American non-profit political organization established in 2007 to work against the legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States. It was formed in 2007 specifically to pass California Proposition 8 prohibiting same-sex marriage in California.

Everyone's hard at work, with only the clangs of the sharp knives of the meat slicers to break up the monotony. It is a scene straight out of a futuristic film: dozens of men, in pristine white lab coats and hats, on a production line, hacking away at massive chunks of raw meat hanging in front of them. Some of the workers here have been on this factory floor for close to two decades - fathers and sons, generations of families who have worked here. The factory has become an integral part of this town's life. For Scott Grossman, it's more than just a job. It's a lifeline. He's a slicer on the factory floor, and spent 14 years of his life here. But three years ago he left this job for an oil rig. When oil prices were high, his salary doubled. But just before Christmas he lost that job because oil prices crashed, and now he's back. \\"I was made redundant because of the downturn,\\" Scott told me in between slicing of parts of beef. \\"It came as a shock actually. We all knew that resources were slowing down, but I thought I would be safe. No one is safe.\\" When Scott returned to Oakey exports, he noticed a dramatic difference in the direction of the company's business. \\"It's a lot faster in the boning room to what it was when I left. Everyone has higher production targets now,\\" he said. \\"From what I've seen we seem to be doing a lot less domestic and a lot more export.\\" Asian demand That's the picture across the country. Asia has become a major buyer of Australian agricultural products. Australia sold a record 600m of beef to China in 2015, and that growth shows no signs of slowing, with China's appetite for beef expected to soar to 2.2 million tonnes by 2025. The push into agriculture couldn't come soon enough. Recent reports forecast a worrying economic future for Australia, despite it having had 25 years of consecutive growth. The Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) says Australia is facing hazards it hasn't seen in its economy in more than 20 years. The end of the mining boom, and a dependence on China are both reasons why Australia is suffering, which is why the government is so keen to keep agricultural exports to Asia growing. \\"I think the growing middle classes in Asia are here to stay, and I think those opportunities are real,\\" said Josh Frydenberg, Australia's minister for resources, energy and Northern Australia. \\"We have seen the opportunity from the middle class in Asia. Some 3 billion people in the coming decades will be in the Asian middle classes. \\"Rapid rates of urbanisation and continued population growth will lead to a demand for all sorts of services ranging from medical, to education, to high quality agricultural products, and high calorie products like beef. It's an opportunity for Australian exporters.\\" But Australia's agricultural exports are only worth a third of what coal and iron bring to the economy. Even if Australia tried to be the food bowl of Asia, it only produces food enough to feed its own country and another 80 million people. That's not enough to feed neighbouring Indonesia, let alone the whole of Asia. Australian producers say though that they're not trying to satisfy the entire region's needs - it's just the 1% or 2% at the top who they want to sell their premium products to. Anne Story is the woman in charge at Story Fresh Farms in Toowoomba. She is hoping that the rise of the upper middle classes in Asia will keep her business growing. \\"As a producer from an Australian perspective, our limitation has been that we have a small population,\\" she told me as we walked around her lettuce fields. \\"We have a lot of producers but a small market. Even if Asia slows down, there are still so many people who can select what they want to buy, who are able to pay for it now because they're in the right socio-economic class. So even though they're retracting, it's still a massive market from a business perspective.\\" That may be far too optimistic a view, given that Australia's been burned before by hitching its fortunes to Asia, and in particular to China. First Australia sold coal and iron to the Chinese, now its trying to sell lettuce and beef. But as Asia slows down, that could hurt farms and feedlots here in the future. This article was about:","output":"This article discusses the shift in Australia's focus from mining to agriculture, particularly in meat production, in light of decreasing demand from China. The country has seen a significant increase in agricultural exports to Asia, selling a record 600 million of beef to China in 2015, and this growth is expected to continue. The Australian government aims to capitalize on the growing middle class in Asia, including their increasing demand for high-quality agricultural products. However, Australia's agricultural exports are worth only a third of what coal and iron bring to the economy, and some are concerned that relying on Asian markets may prove to be too optimistic."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

However, the big brand version costs three times more at £2.40 versus just 80p. Bang out of order: Sainsbury's Basics sausages for 80p contain the same amount of meat as Richmond thick sausages, which is three times as expensive at £2.40. Which? also found that a shopper prepared to pay £2.99 for a pack of Sainsbury’ s premium range pork sausages – 59p more than the Richmond brand - would get 97per cent meat. Researchers also found a similar pattern with burgers, which are particularly popular as the country enters the barbecue season. Meat feast: Sainsbury's premium range sausages for £2.99 contain 97 per cent meat at only 59p more than the big brand. For example, Birds Eye Original beef burgers cost £8.30 per kg yet only contain 77per cent meat, while Tesco’s quarter pound beef burgers are 90per cent beef and cost £6.12 per kg.

New Orleans would get off to a fast start in the first quarter as quarterback Drew Brees completed a 9-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marques Colston and a 39-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Robert Meachem. The Lions would answer with kicker Jason Hanson getting a 47-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Detroit came closer as running back Kevin Smith got a 4-yard touchdown run. The Saints would reply with Brees completing a 1-yard and a 15-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jeremy Shockey. The Lions tried to catch up in the third quarter as quarterback Matthew Stafford got a 1-yard touchdown run, yet New Orleans answered with kicker John Carney making a 39-yard field goal. Detroit would respond with Hanson nailing a 24-yard field goal, while the Saints kept pounding away as Brees completed a 58-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Devery Henderson. The Lions would close out the period with safety Louis Delmas returning a fumble 65 yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, New Orleans closed out the game as Brees completed a 13-yard touchdown pass to fullback Heath Evans. With the win, not only did the Saints begin their season at 1-0, but Brees (26-of-34, 358 yards, 6 TDs, 1 INT) became the very first quarterback to throw 6 TD passes in an opening day game, as well as tying Billy Kilmer's franchise record for touchdown passes in a game. Question: How many total yards did Drew Brees throw for touchdowns in the second half? Answer:","output":"In the second half, Drew Brees threw two touchdown passes: one was a 58-yard pass to Devery Henderson, and the other was a 13-yard pass to Heath Evans. To know the total yards he threw for touchdowns, you just need to add these two numbers. So, 58 yards (for Devery Henderson's touchdown) + 13 yards (for Heath Evans' touchdown) = 71 yards. Drew Brees threw a total of 71 yards for touchdowns in the second half."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

U.S. President Donald Trump is sending a 4.4 trillion budget request to Congress that includes money for a southern border wall and building up the military, but is projected to increase the federal deficit by more than 1 trillion. White House officials all but acknowledged the proposal unveiled Monday has little chance of becoming law — Congress alone controls federal government spending. But the White House insisted the budget proposal still sends an important message about Trump's priorities. \\"This is a messaging document,\\" White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters at a briefing Monday. The Trump budget calls for major cuts to domestic programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps. But the plan would still not balance the federal budget, in part because of reduced federal revenue due to tax cuts passed last year. Democrats widely rejected the plan. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the proposal a \\"brutal collection of broken promises and staggering cuts.\\" The proposal's failure to eliminate debt is also likely to upset some Republicans, who have traditionally opposed budget deficits. \\"It's simply adjusting to the Washington, D.C., we live in,\\" Mulvaney said, stressing that the new budget plan would help \\"turn the tide\\" on national debt. The White House proposal builds on the massive, two-year spending bill passed last week by Congress and signed by the president. That bill includes a major boost for the military, as well as domestic programs. Mulvaney, a former lawmaker and long-time opponent of federal debt, has acknowledged he likely would not have supported the bill were he still in Congress. But he said the new White House proposal does not mean that all of the money approved by Congress must be spent. \\"These are spending caps, these are not spending floors,\\" he said. Under the two-year budget deal reached last week by Congress, the Pentagon will get a record-high 700 billion for 2018 — fulfilling a Trump campaign pledge. \\"We took care of the military like it's never...

Answer the following question: Jordan persuaded the citizens to vote.  They wanted to serve in the city council.  Given the context: What will Jordan want to do next?  Possible answers: wanted to have power, wanted to have influence, convince others Answer:","output":"Given the context provided, it seems that Jordan's primary goal was to encourage the citizens to actively participate in democratic processes, such as voting and serving in the city council. Jordan's actions demonstrate a dedication to fostering an engaged and responsible civic community. Consequently, Jordan will likely want to continue their efforts to inspire citizens' involvement in civic initiatives, rather than simply seeking power or influence for themselves. As a result, Jordan's next steps may involve several different approaches to cementing a well-informed and active community. These actions could include: 1. Organizing community forums and town hall events: By facilitating open and inclusive conversations about key issues facing the city, Jordan could help build trust and understanding among citizens, as well as provide opportunities for the council to take direct feedback from the community in their decision-making processes. 2. Working collaboratively with local organizations and interest groups: Jordan could reach out to partner with existing nonprofits, community-service organizations, business associations, and advocacy groups. These partnerships would not only amplify the reach and impact of their initiatives, but also provide diverse perspectives and resources to inform policy decisions accurately. 3. Encouraging transparency and accessibility in city government: One major factor in civic engagement is how accessible the government is to the general public. Jordan could work to improve transparency, making it easier for citizens to understand how the council operates, access crucial information about city policies, and engage effectively with their elected representatives. 4. Developing civic education and leadership programs: To ensure that citizens are informed about their rights and responsibilities, Jordan could work on creating or supporting civic education programs for various age groups. This would help the community understand the importance of participating in the political process, as well as provide them with the knowledge and tools needed to become effective local leaders themselves. 5. Strengthening voter turnout and election process: Jordan may decide to take further steps to ensure that every citizen has a chance to vote and make their voice heard, like advocating for expanded voting hours or easier access to polls. They might also seek ways to modernize and secure the voting process, guarding against any potential vulnerabilities that could undermine the voters' confidence in the democratic process. In summary, Jordan's next steps will likely involve a continuation of their dedication to civic engagement. By empowering citizens to be active participants in local government, Jordan aims to create a robust and responsive city council that accurately represents the interests and needs of the community. This approach goes beyond simply seeking personal power or influence; it demonstrates a genuine commitment to working together to help create a more vibrant and resilient city for everyone."},{"instruction":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

What is the full name of the symphony that caused a sensation when conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Nielsen is perhaps most closely associated outside Denmark with his six symphonies, written between 1892 and 1925. The works have much in common: they are all just over 30 minutes long, brass instruments are a key component of the orchestration, and they all exhibit unusual changes in tonality, which heighten the dramatic tension. From its opening bars, Symphony No. 1 (Op. 7, 1890–92), while reflecting the influence of Grieg and Brahms, shows Nielsen's individuality. In Symphony No. 2 (Op. 16, 1901–02), Nielsen embarks on the development of human character. Inspiration came from a painting in an inn depicting the four temperaments (choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic, and sanguine).The title of Symphony No. 3, Sinfonia Espansiva (Op. 27, 1910–11), is understood by the English composer Robert Simpson to refer to the \\"outward growth of the mind's scope\\". It fully exploits Nielsen's technique of confronting two keys at the same time and includes a peaceful section with soprano and baritone voices, singing a tune without words. Symphony No. 4, The Inextinguishable (Op. 29, 1914–16), written during World War I, is among the most frequently performed of the symphonies. In the last movement two sets of timpani are placed on opposite sides of the stage undertaking a kind of musical duel. Nielsen described the symphony as \\"the life force, the unquenchable will to live\\".Also frequently performed is the Symphony No. 5 (Op. 50, 1921–22), presenting another battle between the forces of order and chaos. A snare drummer is given the task of interrupting the orchestra, playing ad libitum and out of time, as if to destroy the music. Performed by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, it caused a sensation, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia. In Symphony No. 6 (without opus number), written 1924–25, and subtitled Sinfonia Semplice (Simple Symphony), the tonal language seems similar to that in Nielsen's other symphonies, but the symphony...","output":"The full name of the symphony that caused a sensation when conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia, is Symphony No. 5 (Op. 50, 1921–22)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"The answer is: less effect. If the water does not come into contact with the air, the formation of carbonic acid will be significantly reduced. This is because the air contains carbon dioxide, which is necessary to form carbonic acid when combined with water. With less carbonic acid formation, the iron will not dissolve as much, slowing down the rusting process. Furthermore, with less exposure to air, the water will be less likely to break down into hydrogen and oxygen. The breakdown of water into these elements usually occurs through a process called electrolysis or through direct interaction with atmospheric oxygen. With limited contact with the air, the second effect mentioned (the free oxygen and dissolved iron bonding together to form rust) will be influenced in a way that it has less effect on the overall rusting process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(April 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Sick Girl is the story of Izzy Shea (Leslie Andrews), a girl who wants to protect her younger brother, have sex with her older brother and torture everyone else out in the barn. Izzy is raising her younger brother, Kevin, by herself. Their parents are deceased and her older brother, Rusty, is away in the Marines. When Izzy learns that her little brother is being bullied at school, she does what any unstable, psychopathic, homicidal sister would do.[3] The movie starts out with Izzy waiting for the school bus. In the back are two popular girls who make several snide remarks about her. One of the girl's boyfriend is following the bus route in his car with his friend. The girls drop a pair of panties out the window, and if her boyfriend finds them, he'll be rewarded. After Izzy attacks one of the nuns on the bus for seemingly no reason, she's kicked off and begins to walk back along the road. She runs into the two boys, and lures the friend out of the car. She kills him, and the other boy quickly discovers the scene. Izzy chases him across a field and tackles him. The scene ends, and now we see Izzy cleaning herself up in a bathroom. She is covered in blood and is completely unfazed by this. Clips are shown of Izzy finding a gun in the boys' car, and her holding the school bus hostage, seemingly killing everyone. She chases the two popular girls off the bus, and with the gun and a can of gasoline, she quickly catches one of the girls. The other watches in horror as Izzy kills her friend. Izzy returns home, and we see a flashback sequence of Rusty training Izzy how to fight in their garage. The two share a moment of sibling fondness, but it is cut short by the arrival of Rusty's girlfriend.

Jennifer Tree (Elisha Cuthbert), a young fashion model and cover girl, had captured the attention of photographers and for better or worse, the public at large. On an evening out alone, Jennifer is stalked and drugged. She wakes in a stupor to find herself captive and confined to a cell. A series of metal bins and numbered lockers abruptly swing open in front of her. They contain personal items taken from her apartment. She is forced to view videotapes containing images of the victims who were tortured previous to her captivity, as well as videotaped interviews she had given to the media in the past. Realizing there is no way out, Jennifer pleads and screams to anyone who might hear her. During her confinement, she is subjected to various forms of psychological torture. Jennifer eventually finds she is not alone. A young man, Gary (Daniel Gillies), is being held captive in an adjoining cell. The two make contact and try to find out why they are being held.

Now, James's monthly house notes have dropped from 796 - more than twice her monthly income - to an affordable 247. Some of the people who took advantage of her through a questionable loan program were sent to jail. \\"I don't know what I would have done without Legal Services,\\" said James. \\"They solved a lot of my problems.\\" James is one of more than 3,000 clients served last year by MALS, which provides assistance for civil matters, such as domestic abuse and family-related problems, Social Security and Supplemental Security Income, veterans, housing and consumer fraud cases.

Finnish: Raportin mukaan on mahdollista sovittaa yhteen elintarviketarpeiden tyydyttäminen, kalastusteollisuuden ja kalastusyhteisöjen suojeleminen sekä meriekosysteemien kestävyyden varmistaminen. Tämä tarkoittaa sitä, että näitä kolmea tavoitetta voidaan edistää yhtä aikaa ilman, että ne ovat keskenään ristiriidassa tai vaarantavat toisen toteutumista. Ensinnäkin elintarviketarpeiden täyttäminen voidaan saavuttaa kehittämällä kalastus-ja vesiviljelyaloja vastuullisesti ja innovatiivisesti. Tämä voi sisältää parannettujen kalastusvälineiden käyttöä, uusien kalalajien viljelyä ja vaihtoehtoisten kalanrehun lähteiden hyödyntämistä. Näillä keinoilla voidaan vähentää luonnonvarojen käyttöä, vähentää saaliin heittoa ja parantaa kalanjalostuksen tehokkuutta. Toiseksi kalastusteollisuuden ja kalastusyhteisöjen turvaaminen voidaan taata säilyttämällä kalakannat kohtuullisella tasolla ja ylläpitämällä tervettä meriympäristöä. Tämä voidaan saavuttaa soveltamalla kestävän kehityksen periaatteita kalastuspolitiikassa ja säädöksissä sekä tukemalla koulutusta ja tiedonvaihtoa kalastajien ja muiden alan ammattilaisten keskuudessa. Myös yhteisöpohjaisten ja ekosysteemipohjaisten kalastuksenhoitosuunnitelmien käyttö on merkittävä keino tähän tavoitteeseen pääsemiseksi. Kolmanneksi, meriekosysteemien kestävyyden säilyttäminen voidaan varmistaa monimuotoisten ekosysteemien, kuten rannikkovyöhykkeiden, suojelualueiden ja avomeriympäristöjen, tehokkaalla hallinnalla ja suojelulla. Tämä sisältää myös vieraslajien leviämisen estämisen, kemiallisen saastumisen vähentämisen ja ympäristöä säästävien teknologioiden käyttöön ottamisen kalastuksessa ja vesiviljelyssä. Kaiken kaikkiaan näiden kolmen tavoitteen yhteensovittaminen edellyttää erilaisten sektoreiden välistä yhteistyötä, politiikan ja säädösten johdonmukaisuutta sekä kansainvälisten ja alueellisten sopimusten ja instituutioiden tukemista. Tällä tavoin voidaan turvata ruokaturva, vahvistaa kalastusteollisuutta ja kalastusyhteisöjä sekä säilyttää meren ekosysteemien monimuotoisuus ja kestävyys tuleville sukupolville."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: The writer believes that: Options: - natural shampoos scent does not stay on the hair - chemical shampoos leave hair looking greasy - not enough information - natural shampoo is better for the skin but doesn't clean as well Answer:","output":"- natural shampoo is better for the skin but doesn't clean as well"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - Sturgeon is the common name for the 27 species of fish belonging to the family Acipenseridae. Their evolution dates back to the Triassic some 245 to 208 million years ago. The family is grouped into four genera: \\"Acipenser\\", \\"Huso\\", \\"Scaphirhynchus\\" and \\"Pseudoscaphirhynchus\\". Four species may now be extinct. Two closely related species, \\"Polyodon spathula\\" (paddlefish) and \\"Psephurus gladius\\" (Chinese paddlefish, possibly extinct) are of the same order, Acipenseriformes, but are in the family Polyodontidae and are not considered to be \\"true\\" sturgeons. Both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as \\"primitive fishes\\" because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since the earliest fossil record. Sturgeons are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America.  Sturgeons are long-lived, late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks, and an elongated spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned, scaleless and armored with 5 lateral rows of bony plates called scutes. Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging 712 feet (2-3 m) in length. The largest sturgeon on record was a Beluga female captured in the Volga estuary in 1827, weighing and long. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries. Some species inhabit freshwater environments exclusively while others primarily inhabit marine environments near coastal areas, and are known to venture into open ocean.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - Huso is a genus of large sturgeons from Eurasia . It contains two species , which both are critically endangered : Huso dauricus ( Georgi , 1775 ) ( kaluga ) Huso huso ( Linnaeus , 1758 ) ( beluga ) Recent data indicate a polyphyletic origin of the genus Huso , and it is suggested that the two Huso species should be included in the genus Acipenser .    Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'parent taxon'. The answer to this question is:","output":"The subject entity with the relation of 'parent taxon' is the genus \\"Huso\\" and the object entity is the family \\"Acipenseridae\\". In this context, the term 'parent taxon' refers to the taxonomic category which ranks higher than the genus. In this case, the genus \\"Huso\\" belongs to the family \\"Acipenseridae\\", which contains 27 species of fish commonly known as sturgeons."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

SINGAPORE — Envoys from the United States and North Korea are holding talks to iron out any last-minute differences before Tuesday's historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that veteran diplomat Sung Kim is leading the U.S. delegation in a working group meeting Monday at the city-state's Ritz Carlton hotel. The North Korea side is being led by Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui. Monday's meeting is apparently aimed at narrowing the gap between the U.S. and North Korea over the demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. President Trump expressed confidence about his meeting upon his arrival in Singapore Sunday, telling reporters after stepping down from Air Force One that he his feeling \\"very good\\" about Tuesday's summit. Ahead of his arrival, Trump acknowledged he is heading into “unknown territory” for the meeting Tuesday. In response to a question from VOA News just before heading to Asia from the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said “I really feel confident” about the unprecedented encounter between a sitting American president and a member of the family dynasty which has maintained iron-fist control over one of the world’s most reclusive countries for three generations. Trump added that he believes Kim, half the age of the American president, “wants to do something great for his people.” But Trump cautioned that Kim “won’t have that opportunity again” if the talks do not go well -- describing this opportunity for diplomacy with the United States as a “one-time shot.” Trump and others in his government have said advancement has been made on obtaining a commitment from Kim to give up all his nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. Progress could lead to a peace treaty and formally end a state of war on the Korean peninsula, which has persisted for nearly 70 years.

The next day, December 26, 1991, the Council of Republics, the upper chamber of the Union's Supreme Soviet, issued a formal Declaration recognizing that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist as a state and subject of international law, and voted both itself and the Soviet Union out of existence (the other chamber of the Supreme Soviet, the Council of the Union, had been unable to work since December 12, 1991, when the recall of the Russian deputies left it without a quorum). The following day Yeltsin moved into Gorbachev's former office, though the Russian authorities had taken over the suite two days earlier.

Given the question: Few athletes would disagree that more muscle is an advantage in their sport. And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. After the article, what will sportspeople probably consume? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - Only protein supplements so they can eat whatever they want - not enough information - More foods that are higher in protein - They'll consume less protein and more carbs for energy The answer is:","output":"More foods that are higher in protein"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He hears story pitches from screenwriters and decides which have the potential to be made into films, green-lighting only 12 out of 50,000 submissions every year. His job is threatened when up-and-coming story executive Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher) begins working at the studio. Mill has also been receiving death threat postcards, assumed to be from a screenwriter whose pitch he rejected. Mill surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio). Mill is told by Kahane's girlfriend, June Gudmundsdottir (Greta Scacchi) that Kahane is at a theater in Pasadena. Mill pretends to recognize Kahane in the lobby, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar where Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mill's offer; he calls Mill a liar and continues goading him about his job security at the studio. In the bar's parking lot, the two men fight. Mill goes too far and accidentally drowns Kahane in a shallow pool of water, then stages the crime to make it look like a botched robbery. The next day, after Mill is late for and distracted at a meeting, Studio chief of security Walter Stuckel (Fred Ward) confronts Mill about the murder and says that the police know Mill was the last one to see Kahane alive. At the end of their conversation Mill receives a fax from his stalker. Thus, Mill has killed the wrong man, and the stalker apparently knows this. Mill attends Kahane's funeral and gets into conversation with June. Detectives Avery (Whoopi Goldberg) and DeLongpre (Lyle Lovett) suspect Mill is guilty of murder. Mill receives a postcard from the writer suggesting they meet at a hotel bar. While Mill is waiting, he is cornered by two screenwriters, Tom Oakley (Richard E.

Process:  - Grass and small plants grow in an area - These plants die - The soil gains organic material - The soil becomes more fertile - Larger plants are able to be supported - Trees eventually grow.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more fertile soil happens, how will it affect MORE forest formation.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has both direct and indirect effects on the process of forest formation.  Step-by-step explanation: 1. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if more fertile soil is available in an area, it will accelerate forest formation. 2. Fertile soil provides more nutrients, which directly support the growth of grass, small plants, and eventually larger plants and trees. This accelerates the early stages of forest formation. 3. As more fertile soil is present, a larger amount of organic material from dead plants will accumulate in the soil, further increasing its fertility (indirect effect). 4. With higher fertility in the soil, the carrying capacity of the area increases, allowing for a greater number of plant species and individual plants to coexist and thrive. This leads to increased competition for resources like sunlight, water, and nutrients, which in turn results in the growth of taller and more robust plants, including trees (direct effect). 5. As trees begin to grow in the area, their roots help stabilize the soil, preventing erosion and further maintaining fertility in the ecosystem (indirect effect). 6. Over time, as more trees and plants are established in the area, a fully-formed forest emerges, supported by the fertile soil provided by the perturbation. In conclusion, the perturbation of more fertile soil has both direct and indirect effects on the process of forest formation. The direct effects include an accelerated growth rate of plant species, while indirect effects include a preservation of soil fertility through root systems and organic material decomposition. Both of these factors contribute to a faster and more successful forest formation process."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  In 2001, M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) had worked exclusively in the visual arts. While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine. Having produced rough tracks via trial and error, she honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers.

News article: Cornell drops Brown, becomes first team to clinch NCAA tourney berth PROVIDENCE (AP)  Cornell is back in the NCAA tournament for the third straight year. This time, the brainy bunch plans to hang around for a while. \\"We want to win. We want to advance,\\" coach Steve Donahue said. \\"I think we have the talent to do that.\\" The Big Red became the first team this season to earn an NCAA bid, clinching its third consecutive Ivy League championship by beating Brown 95-76 on Friday night with a record-tying display of three-point shooting. Cornell (26-4, 12-1) made 20 of 30 attempts from three-point range and held Brown to 30% shooting in the second half while cruising to their 24th victory in 26 games. Cornell matched an Ivy League record for 3s in a game and increased its season total to 292, also a conference mark. In doing so, the Big Red wrapped up their fourth Ivy League title — securing the fifth NCAA tournament berth in school history. But they're still looking for their first win in the NCAAs. Cornell has lost in the first round as a No. 14 seed in each of the last two seasons. The Big Red aspire for a stronger showing this year after setting a school record for wins and nearly upsetting then-No. 1 Kansas on the road Jan. 6. \\"We know what to expect going into this tournament,\\" said Ryan Wittman, the school's career scoring leader. \\"But experience alone isn't going to allow us to advance.\\" Donahue said this squad has shown it can compete with the top teams in the country in a way none of his clubs has before. This year's team, he said, is Cornell's deepest and most talented yet. \\"I'm going to try for the rest of my coaching career to get a group like this, and I may never get there,\\" he said. \\"I'm pretty sure I won't.\\" The Big Red will have a chance to tie the conference record for wins in their final game of the regular season Saturday at Yale. Jon Jacques led Cornell with 20 points and seven rebounds. Louis Dale (FSY) added 18 points and eight assists, and Wittman had 16 points, seven rebounds and five assists. All five Big Red starters scored in double figures. \\"Everyone was on at the same time,\\" Wittman said. \\"We just got in a rhythm offensively tonight, and it started going down for us.\\" Peter Sullivan had 23 points on 8-of-13 shooting to lead the Bears (11-19, 5-8). Cornell led 51-47 at halftime, establishing its three-point shooting early in a frenetic first half. The Big Red made 11 of their first 13 attempts from beyond the arc, including eight in a row at one point. \\"We have to practice 3s more than any team in the country,\\" said Jacques, who shot 6 of 8 from three-point range. \\"Practice makes perfect.\\" But Brown found success on the offensive end as well, shooting 59% from the field in the first half to keep the game close. Cornell started the second half on a 14-4 run, however, and Brown never got within single digits again. You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Write the answer: This summer, Arsenal signed Santi Cazorla for £16 million from which Spanish football club?","output":"Santi Cazorla, a renowned Spanish professional footballer, made a move to Arsenal FC in the summer of 2012. Prior to this move, Cazorla was associated with the Spanish football club, Málaga CF. Francisco Román Alarcón Suárez, commonly known as Santi Cazorla, was born on December 13, 1984, in Llanera, Spain. He started his football career with VillaReal CF, where he rose through the ranks quickly due to his shining performances. Versatile and quick, Cazorla is primarily an attacking midfielder but can also play as a winger. His technical skills, such as high-speed dribbling, make him an effective contributor in the final third of the field. Cazorla, before his transfer to Arsenal, spent one season (2011-2012) at Málaga CF after his transfer from Villareal CF. His performances helped Málaga secure fourth place in La Liga and, subsequently, a spot in the following season's UEFA Champions League for the first time in the club's history. Arsenal FC, which is based in Islington, London, recruited Cazorla for £16 million in the summer of 2012. Arsène Wenger, the manager of Arsenal at the time, played a critical role in bringing Santi to the club. Wenger has a well-known penchant for moulding talented young players into international football stars, and it was no different in the case of Cazorla. Soon after his transfer, Cazorla quickly endeared himself to the Arsenal faithful with his impeccable technical skills and vision. Primarily playing as an attacking midfielder, he also often filled in as a central midfielder or winger. Known for his two-footedness, agility, and ability to score from free kicks, he had become an invaluable asset to the team. Cazorla's performances in the Premier League proved crucial in helping Arsenal maintain a consistent presence in the UEFA Champions League slots of the Premier League standings during his time at the club. Cazorla ended up spending six years with Arsenal, in which he secured two FA Cups and two Community Shields. He left the club in 2018 after a severe achilles tendon injury that almost ended his career.  In conclusion, Santi Cazorla was signed by Arsenal FC for £16 million from Málaga CF, a Spanish football club, during the summer of 2012. His performances upon joining Arsenal only added to his reputation as a highly skilled and intelligent footballer. With exceptional skills and leadership qualities, Cazorla holds a position of admiration within the hearts of Arsenal FC fans and is remembered as a key figure in an exciting period for the club."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English English:","output":"Do I have to start the procedure from scratch every time?  This question can be interpreted in different ways depending on the context. If you are talking about a manual procedure or process, the answer could vary.  1. Reiterative tasks: Certain procedures are inherently repetitive and need to be carried out from the start every time. For instance, baking a cake or preparing a meal, performing a scientific experiment, or even starting your computer — these all require going through the same procedure each time. 2. Learning and skill development: In the context of learning or developing skills, you often begin with a base procedure and modify it over time as you become more proficient or as you understand the task better. With learning, the procedure becomes easier and quicker, but you generally still start from the beginning. 3. Software or digital processes: For most digital processes, like running a program or software, or generating an output using a tool, there is usually a way to save your progress or settings. In this case, you wouldn't need to start from the beginning every time, but rather, you could pick up where you left off or use a similar configuration to start the process. 4. Continuous or iterative procedures: Some types of work or projects are iterative, in which the 'beginning' is flexible. For example, in project management, copying existing project plans to similar subsequent projects would save time and allow for continuous improvement. However, without more specific details about the context of the procedure in question, it is difficult to provide a tailored answer. Bear in mind, the whole point of having a procedure is to have a standardized way of doing things to ensure consistency, accuracy, and efficiency.

Available options: [-] negative [-] positive Answer:","output":"The review provided is positive. This is clear based on several factors within the text. Firstly, the author of the review begins with a phrase: \\"Fast and friendly service!\\". This is an endorsement of the quality of service provided. These two adjectives, both 'fast' and 'friendly', connote positivity, and therefore gives the reader the impression that the person left the place of business satisfied. Secondly, the review states \\"50 alignment and they did it fast too!\\". The inclusion of the word 'fast' for the second time indicates the author was pleased with the speed of the service. This reference to speed suggests that the customer's needs were not only met but delivered in a timely manner, a feature that most customers value in a service. The price of the alignment could also be seen as a point of positivity, although it depends on the benchmark for such a service, the tone suggests that it was seen as a good deal by the writer. Finally, the author directly references an employee, Chris, by saying \\"Chris took care of me and got me in and out!\\". The phrasing here, specifically \\"took care of me\\" suggests that the author felt attended to, which is crucial in customer service.

Answer the following question: Information:  - EMI Records was a British record label founded by the music company of the same name in 1972 as its flagship label, and launched in January 1973 as the successor to its Columbia and Parlophone record labels. The label was later launched worldwide.  - The Division Bell is the fourteenth studio album by the English progressive rock band Pink Floyd. It was released in the UK by EMI Records on 28 March 1994, and the US by Columbia Records on 4 April.  - Columbia Records (also known simply as Columbia) is an American record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment (SME), a subsidiary of Sony Corporation of America, Inc., the United States division of Sony Corporation. It was founded in 1887, evolving from an earlier enterprise named the American Graphophone Company, the successor to the Volta Graphophone Company. Columbia is the oldest surviving brand name in the recorded sound business, being the second major record company to produce recorded records. Columbia Records went on to release records by an array of notable singers, instrumentalists, and bands. From 1961 to 1990, its recordings were released outside the U.S. and Canada by the CBS Records label (which was named after the Columbia Broadcasting System) to avoid confusion with the EMI label of the same name, before adopting the Columbia name internationally in 1990. It is one of Sony Music's three flagship record labels alongside RCA Records and Epic Records.  - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.  - \`\` A Great Day for Freedom '' is a song by Pink Floyd from their 1994 album , The Division Bell .  - Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London. They achieved international acclaim with their progressive and psychedelic music. Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, extended compositions and elaborate live shows, they are one of the most commercially successful and influential groups in the history of popular music.

Explanation: From the sentence \\"They are running through the field\\", we only know that two people are running in a field. We don't know if they are young boys, if they are wearing jackets, or if they are frolicking (which means to play or move about in a lively, happy way). So, we cannot tell if the first statement, \\"Two young boys wearing jackets frolic in a large field,\\" is correct or not, just based on the second statement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? What does 'shake' mean as regards to iPhone 4? What does the lock symbol with a circle around it on an iPhone mean?","output":"No, the two questions do not hold the same meaning, as they are inquiring about different features on an iPhone. Let's break down both questions and explain their meanings in detail. 1. What does 'shake' mean as regards to iPhone 4? This question is asking about the 'shake' feature available on the iPhone 4 and later models. The 'shake' feature refers to a motion-based shortcut for certain in-built functionalities, enabled by the internal motion sensor called an accelerometer.  On the iPhone 4, the 'shake' feature can be used to: - Undo/redo typing: When composing a text message or email, if you make a mistake or want to restore deleted text, you can simply shake the device, and it will ask if you would like to undo the action. Similarly, you can redo the typing by shaking the device once again. - Shake-to-shuffle: In the Music app, shaking the iPhone can prompt the app to play a random song from your music library. This feature is useful when you want to shuffle your songs without pressing any buttons. 2. What does the lock symbol with a circle around it on an iPhone mean? This question refers to a specific icon that can be found on the iPhone's status bar, usually at the top of the screen. iPhone has a feature called \\"Orientation Lock\\" or \\"Screen Rotation Lock,\\" which is symbolized by a lock with a circular arrow around it. When this icon is displayed, it signifies that the Orientation Lock is active. When the Orientation Lock is turned on, the device's screen will remain in portrait mode and won't rotate automatically when you rotate the phone. This feature is especially useful when reading while lying down or when using the phone in a situation where you want to keep the screen orientation fixed, regardless of the phone's position. To enable or disable the Orientation Lock, you can follow these steps: - Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (iPhone 8 or older) or swipe down from the top right corner of the screen (iPhone X and later) to access the Control Center. - Look for the Orientation Lock button, which is the icon of a lock with a circular arrow around it. - Tap the Orientation Lock button to enable or disable it. When it's enabled, the icon will be highlighted, and the lock symbol with a circle around it will appear in the status bar. In conclusion, while both questions are related to the iPhone's features, they are fundamentally different in terms of their meanings and the functionalities they represent. The first question focuses on the 'shake' feature, while the second question is concerned with the icon that represents the \\"Orientation Lock\\" feature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Born in Venice, Ohio, Alson spent much of his childhood on a farm in Morning Sun; when he was a teenager, the family moved to Darrtown. Alston attended Milford Township High School in Darrtown, and received the nickname \\"Smokey\\" as a high school pitcher, owing to the speed of his fastball. He graduated from high school in 1929 and married longtime girlfriend Lela Vaughn Alexander the next year. In 1935, Alston graduated with a degree in industrial arts and physical education from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. The team finished 21 games back in seventh place (71-83 (.461)) in 1958, the club's first season in Los Angeles. Criticism of Alston had begun to mount during that season, but he led the Dodgers to a world championship in 1959. Six players on the 1959 team finished with double-digit totals in home runs, while 22-year-old Don Drysdale led the team's pitchers with 17 wins. Several Los Angeles players, including Wally Moon, characterized Alston as indecisive in the late 1950s and 1960s. However, Moon later came to describe Alston as a good manager who had gotten \\"good mileage\\" out of his players.  Managing the NL All-Star Team in 1960, Alston attracted some controversy when he left ]]1960 Milwaukee Braves season|Milwaukee Braves]] pitchers Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette off the roster. An Associated Press report said the omission may have been a snub directed at Dressen, who was the manager in Milwaukee. The 1960 Dodgers finished in fourth place. The following year, the team finished in second place after veteran Duke Snider missed two months with a broken arm. The Dodgers lost the lead in the 1962 NL pennant race and rumors surfaced that Alston and coach Leo Durocher might be fired, but the team retained both for 1963.  The Dodgers swept the World Series in 1963, the first time that the New York Yankees had lost a World Series in four games. Alston's pitchers excelled, as Koufax struck out 23 batters over two games and Drysdale threw a shutout in Game 3. Over the four games, Alston employed only four pitchers: three starters and one reliever. The 1964 team was 80-82, its first losing season in several years. Alston used the team's 1964 performance to motivate them moving forward. In spring training before the 1965 season, he said that he would not let his team forget the difficulties they had in the previous season.  The Dodgers returned to the World Series in 1965 against Minnesota. Alston could not start his number one pitcher, Koufax, in the opening game on October 6 because Koufax was observing Yom Kippur. Instead, Alston turned to Drysdale, who struggled and surrendered seven runs in just 2 2/3  innings. When Alston came to the mound to remove him in the bottom of the third, Drysdale quipped, \\"I bet right now you wish I was Jewish, too.\\" The team recovered from losing that first game and they won the World Series in seven games. Koufax appeared in three games during the series, registering two shutouts.  Alston's Dodgers teams of the 1960s benefited from the strong pitching by Drysdale and Koufax. In 1966, both players held out of spring training and demanded three-year contracts each worth 500,000, which was more money than anyone was making in baseball at the time. The players were eventually signed for lesser amounts. Drysdale struggled that year, but Koufax won 27 games. The Dodgers returned to the World Series, but were swept by the Baltimore Orioles. Koufax retired after the season on the advice of doctors who examined his sore arm. Drysdale retired three years later. Both men had pitched their entire major league careers for Alston.

Please answer the following question: Given the fact that:  Less massive objects also have less gravity than more massive objects.  Answer the question:   Dan's small globe will have this kind of gravity compared to his larger globe: more or less? Answer:","output":"Dan's small globe will have less gravity compared to his larger globe. This is due to the direct relationship between mass and gravity, as stated in your initial fact. According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, the gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, this can be represented as: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 Here, F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between the centers of the objects. With this in mind, it's clear that an increase in mass corresponds to an increase in gravitational force, and vice versa. Therefore, when comparing the gravity of Dan's small globe to that of his larger globe, we can determine that the smaller globe will have less gravity due to its smaller mass. Additionally, the surface gravity of an object (which is the gravitational force experienced by a person or an object on its surface) is also related to its mass and radius. Surface gravity is given by the equation: g = G * (M / r^2) Where g is the surface gravity, M is the mass of the object, and r is its radius. It's important to note that in this equation, the mass of the object affects the surface gravity directly, whereas the radius affects it indirectly. Doubling the mass of an object would double its surface gravity, while halving its radius would quadruple its surface gravity due to the squared term in the denominator. Consequently, a smaller globe, which usually has a smaller mass and radius, would have less gravity than a larger globe. In conclusion, Dan's smaller globe will have less gravity in comparison to his larger globe due to the direct relationship between an object's mass and the strength of its gravitational force. This concept is based on the principles of Newton's law of universal gravitation, as well as the surface gravity equation, which both directly relate mass to gravity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: The Arrival Movie plot: Zane Zaminski (Charlie Sheen), a radio astronomer working for SETI, discovers an extraterrestrial radio signal from Wolf 336, a star 14 light years from Earth. Zane reports this to his supervisor, Phil Gordian (Ron Silver) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, but Phil dismisses the claims. Zane soon finds that he has been fired because of supposed budget cuts, and blacklisted, preventing him from working at other telescopes. Taking a job as a television satellite installer, he creates his own telescope array using his customers' dishes in the neighborhood, operating it secretly from his attic with help of his young next door neighbor, Kiki.Zane relocates the signal, but it is drowned out by a terrestrial signal from a Mexican radio station. Zane attempts to tell his former coworker, Calvin (Richard Schiff), but finds he has just died suspiciously from carbon monoxide poisoning. Zane travels to Mexico and finds the radio station was burnt to the ground. Searching the local area, he comes across a new power plant. There, he helps climatologist Ilana Green (Lindsay Crouse) protect her atmospheric analysis equipment from the plant's overzealous security forces. Ilana explains that the Earth's temperature has recently risen several degrees, melting the polar ice. She is investigating the power plant, one of several recently built, that appears to be the cause of this increase. The two are released, but without Ilana's equipment. Surprisingly, Zane realizes one of the guards could pass as the identical twin of his former boss, Phil, except that he is of Mexican ethnicity (whereas Phil is not). As Zane and Ilana regroup, Phil instructs some agents, posing as gardeners, to release an alien device in Zane's attic that creates a miniature black hole, consuming all of Zane's equipment. Zane leaves Ilana to again investigate the power plant and she is soon killed by a scorpion planted in her room.Zane discovers the plant is a front for an underground alien base.

Francis Albert Sinatra was born on December 12, 1915, in an upstairs tenement at 415 Monroe Street in Hoboken, New Jersey. He was the only child of Italian immigrants Antonino Martino \\"Marty\\" Sinatra and Natalina \\"Dolly\\" Garaventa. Sinatra weighed 13.5 pounds (6.1 kg) at birth and had to be delivered with the aid of forceps, which caused severe scarring to his left cheek, neck, and ear, and perforated his ear drum, damage that remained for life. Due to his injuries at birth, his baptism at St. Francis Church in Hoboken was delayed until April 2, 1916. Sinatra attempted to pursue an acting career in Hollywood in the early 1940s. While films appealed to him, being exceptionally self-confident, he was rarely enthusiastic towards his own acting, once remarking that \\"pictures stink\\". Sinatra made his film debut in 1941, performing in an uncredited sequence in Las Vegas Nights, singing \\"I'll Never Smile Again\\" with Tommy Dorsey's The Pied Pipers. In 1943 he had a cameo role along with Duke Ellington and Count Basie in Charles Barton's Reveille with Beverly, making a brief appearance singing \\"Night and Day\\". The following year he was given his leading roles in Higher and Higher and Step Lively for RKO Pictures.  In 1945, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cast Sinatra opposite Gene Kelly and Kathryn Grayson in the Technicolor musical Anchors Aweigh, in which he played a sailor on leave in Hollywood for four days. A major success, it garnered several Academy Award wins and nominations, and the song \\"I Fall in Love Too Easily\\", sung by Sinatra in the film, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. In 1946, Sinatra briefly appeared at the end of Richard Whorf's commercially successful Till the Clouds Roll By, a Technicolor musical biopic of Jerome Kern, in which he sang \\"Ol' Man River.  In 1949, Sinatra co-starred with Gene Kelly in the Technicolor musical Take Me Out to the Ball Game, a film set in 1908, in which Sinatra and Kelly play baseball players who are part-time vaudevillians. He teamed up with Kelly for a third time in On the Town, playing a sailor on leave in New York City. Today the film is rated very highly by critics, and in 2006 it ranked No. 19 on the American Film Institute's list of best musicals. Both Double Dynamite (1951), an RKO Irving Cummings comedy produced by Howard Hughes, and Joseph Pevney's Meet Danny Wilson (1952) failed to make an impression.

It is a natural substance  produced by the human body, and it helps children's bones and muscles  to grow. Scientists are allowed to make the drug and it is also legal to take HGH in most countries. HGH is considered a wonder drug for children. It helps many children with growth problems every year. However, some athletes are now taking the drug. HGH helps add muscle in adults and recent research by the World Anti-Doping Agency shows that HGH may improve the sportsman's time by 5% when he takes part in short, fast races. Some athletes say that HGH surely makes them stronger. It also helps them to recover  more quickly from injuries. Although it is _ by most professional sports, HGH is almost impossible to test for. The drug is completely natural and it will only show in tests for around 24 hours after taking it. Testing is usually done only during competitions, but athletes use HGH during training, so it is very difficult to know who has used the drug. This makes it very attractive for some athletes. Scientists are developing a new test which will find the drug in the body for up to two weeks. But it isn't going to be easy. Everybody has different levels of natural HGH in their body. For this reason, scientists are warning athletes of the possible problems with the drug. Research shows that HGH increase the risk of cancer. But is this enough to stop athletes from taking it? Scientists don't think so. Some athletes will do all they can to win, and worry about their health later. Which of these statements is WRONG? A) HGH is a natural substance.

Unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory and left me deeply disappointed. To start, we had a reservation for 8:00 PM, and upon arrival, the hostess informed us that our table was not yet available, with no explanation as to why or how long the wait would be. After waiting for 30 minutes, we were finally seated, but the inordinate wait time was already causing frustration amongst our party. Once seated, things did not improve. Our server was inattentive and seemingly disinterested in providing a pleasant dining experience. It took a while for our drink orders to be taken, and even longer for them to arrive. I understand that restaurants can get busy, but it felt as though our server had completely forgotten about us. The food, which I had such high hopes for, was equally disappointing. I ordered the grilled salmon with mango salsa, and it arrived overcooked and dry. The mango salsa, which I expected to be fresh and zesty, seemed to consist mostly of unripe fruit, leaving a very unappealing taste. My partner's dish, the chicken alfredo, was also subpar - the sauce was bland and tasteless, and the pasta was undercooked. Furthermore, the restaurant was very noisy and chaotic, making conversation difficult. It seemed as though the staff was overwhelmed, as we could observe confusion among the servers as they brought dishes to the wrong tables multiple times. Lastly, when it came time for the bill, we noticed that we were charged for an extra appetizer that we hadn't ordered. It took quite a while to flag down our server and have the error corrected, prolonging the already unpleasant experience. In summary, I cannot recommend The Fancy Fork based on my experience. Between the poor service, long wait times, subpar food, and chaotic atmosphere, it fell significantly short of my expectations. It's evident that the restaurant needs some serious improvements both in terms of customer service and food quality to earn my trust back and justify their relatively high prices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

William McKinley (January 29, 1843 - September 14, 1901) was the 25th President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1897 until his assassination in September 1901, six months into his second term. McKinley led the nation to victory in the Spanish-American War, raised protective tariffs to promote American industry, and maintained the nation on the gold standard in a rejection of free silver (effectively, expansionary monetary policy). McKinley was the last president to have served in the American Civil War, and the only one to have started the war as an enlisted soldier, beginning as a private in the Union Army and ending as a brevet major. William McKinley Jr. was born in 1843 in Niles, Ohio, the seventh child of William McKinley Sr. and Nancy (nee Allison) McKinley (1809-1897). The McKinleys were of English and Scots-Irish descent and had settled in western Pennsylvania in the 18th century, tracing back to a David McKinley who was born in Dervock, County Antrim, in present-day Northern Ireland. There, the elder McKinley was born in Pine Township, Mercer County.  The family moved to Ohio when the senior McKinley was a boy, settling in New Lisbon (now Lisbon). He met Nancy Allison there, and married her later. The Allison family was of mostly English descent and among Pennsylvania's earliest settlers. The family trade on both sides was iron-making, and McKinley senior operated foundries throughout Ohio, in New Lisbon, Niles, Poland, and finally Canton. The McKinley household was, like many from Ohio's Western Reserve, steeped in Whiggish and abolitionist sentiment, the latter based on the family's staunch Methodist beliefs. William followed in the Methodist tradition, becoming active in the local Methodist church at the age of sixteen. He was a lifelong pious Methodist.  In 1852, the family moved from Niles to Poland, Ohio so that their children could attend the better schools there. Graduating from Poland Seminary in 1859, he enrolled the following year at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. He remained at Allegheny for only one year, returning home in 1860 after becoming ill and depressed. He also spent time at Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio as a board member. Although his health recovered, family finances declined and McKinley was unable to return to Allegheny, first working as a postal clerk and later taking a job teaching at a school near Poland, Ohio.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: did he have any siblings?","output":"Yes, William McKinley Jr. had siblings.

She stands outside for a few seconds, before going in to the house. Shanks (Bobby Cannavale), the cop escorting her, tells her not to get used to fresh air. He lets her in to the hall, and Shanks tears off the police crime scene tape that had been left there. After they get inside, someone comes to fit her ankle bracelet, and they tell her she cannot move more than 100 feet from the detector in the hallway. Shanks treats Marnie quite badly, telling her she will remain in the house until her sentence is up. He tells her to clean up some blood from the wall, and that she will have lots of time to think about what she did. Marnie argues with him, telling him that if the police had taken her crime reports seriously, her husband would still be alive today. The cynical Shanks leaves with indifference.Later that day, Marnie takes all of her husband's pictures, and belongings, and puts them in her basement, where the detector goes off. She then paints over the blood in the wall. She calls the power company about having her power restored, and they tell her they can't make it until Monday, so she has to light some candles. Later that night, she is in bed, and hears footsteps, but it turns out to be a cat.She continues to hear the footsteps, and goes downstairs, where she finds a homeless man, and threatens to stab him if he doesn't leave. The next day, a local delivery boy, Joey (Ed Westwick) arrives, and brings her shopping over. He tells her he lives in the same street, and compliments her house. She tells him she needs him to come by regularly, and he says he will do it for the tips. Marnie watches him leave, with a look of lust in her eyes.Later that night, she is going upstairs, when the ghost of her husband, Mike Watson (Michael Paré) pushes her down the stairs. As she crawls to the front door, she sets the detector off. She stands up, and Mike lunges at her. Shanks arrives a short time later, and finds her...

Given the context: How would Aubrey feel afterwards? A:","output":"Given the context provided, it would seem that Aubrey could be feeling a mix of emotions and physical sensations after a long and tiring day at work. Here's a detailed and thorough analysis of those emotions and sensations: 1. Exhaustion: After a long day at work, Aubrey is likely feeling physically and mentally tired. This exhaustion might manifest as sore muscles or an aching body, making Aubrey eager to get home, rest, and perhaps take a warm shower or bath to help alleviate some of the discomfort. 2. Relief: Upon arriving home to Alex, Aubrey might experience a feeling of relief at being in a familiar and comfortable environment. Being with a loved one or at a place where one feels safe and secure can help alleviate the stress and tension accumulated during the workday. 3. Gratitude: Aubrey might feel grateful to have a support system in Alex, with whom they can share their experiences or vent their frustrations. Knowing there is someone willing to listen, offer advice, or provide emotional support can be invaluable in helping cope with life's challenges. 4. Happiness: Despite the challenges of the day, Aubrey might feel happiness when returning to Alex, their loved one. The affection, love, and companionship shared between them can contribute to overall happiness even after a tough day at work. 5. Hunger or Thirst: After a long and tiring day, Aubrey might feel the need to replenish their energy through food and drink. They might look forward to a home-cooked meal or a simple snack, as well as a refreshing beverage to rehydrate and regain some stamina. 6. Need for Decompression: It's not unusual for people to need some time to decompress after a stressful day. Aubrey could potentially prefer to engage in a calming activity like reading, watching TV, meditating, or listening to music to help relax and ease into their time at home. 7. Desire for Connection: Work might have left Aubrey feeling disconnected from their personal life or hobbies. As a result, they may wish to set aside time to connect with Alex, participate in a joint activity, or indulge in a favorite pastime to regain a sense of balance. Taking all of these factors into account, it is clear that Aubrey would likely experience a complex mix of emotions and physical sensations after a long and tiring day at work. While exhaustion might be the most immediate and apparent feeling, other emotions like relief, happiness, and gratitude may also arise as they reunite with Alex in the comfort of their home."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Cut the meat against the grain. Article:","output":"Title: Fun Ways to Cook Pork for Tasty Meals Hi little friends! Today we are going to talk about cooking a yummy food called pork. Pork comes from pigs, and there are many fun ways to cook it. Let's learn about five awesome methods to make amazingly tasty pork meals.  1. Searing and Baking Pork:  First, we can make our pork tasty by searing it. Searing means cooking it quickly on high heat to make it brown on the outside. Then, we put it into the oven to bake until it's fully cooked inside. \\"Bake\\" means to cook something using the heat from the oven. This way, our pork will be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside! 2. Braising Pork:  The next fun way to cook our pork is called braising. To braise pork, we first cook it a little on high heat to make it brown. Then, we add some liquid, like water, juice, or broth, and cook the pork more slowly on low heat. This will make the pork very tender and full of flavor from the liquid! 3. Smoking Pork: Another amazing way to cook pork is by smoking it. We cook the pork using a special cooking tool called a smoker, which uses the smoke from wood or other materials to give the pork a unique, smoky flavor. This method takes a bit longer, but it makes the pork taste extra-delicious! 4. Stewing Pork:  Stewing is another fun way to cook our pork. To do this, we chop the pork into smaller pieces and cook it in a big pot with some liquid, like water or broth. We can add other ingredients, like vegetables and seasonings, to make the stew tasty. We simmer the stew, which means cooking it slowly just below boiling point until the pork is tender and the flavors mix together. 5. Slow-Cooking Pork:  Slow-cooking is a super easy way to cook our pork. We put the pork into a special cooking pot called a slow-cooker, add our favorite ingredients, and let the slow-cooker do its magic! It cooks our pork slowly and gently, making it super tender and juicy. Now that our pork is cooked, let's make sure it tastes great. Before we eat it, we should let the pork rest for a few minutes. This helps it stay juicy and tender. When it's time to cut and eat our pork, we cut it against the grain. That means we cut it in the opposite direction of the lines we see on the meat. This will make our pork easier to chew and full of yummy flavors. Happy cooking, little chefs! I hope you have fun trying all these tasty ways to cook pork. Remember to ask an adult to help you with these cooking methods for a fantastic and delicious meal!"},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

(Published Tuesday, Nov. 28, 2017)      A Spring Valley woman was killed, and her husband is missing after the couple went on a river outing on the big island of Hawaii over the weekend.      Police said 62-year-old Gladys Novinger fell into the water Saturday while crossing the Wailuku River above Rainbow Falls.      The Novingers were reportedly in Hawaii to visit family in the area.      The wife was found in the pool below the falls and was airlifted to Hilo Medical Center where she died.      The husband, 61-year-old George Novinger, is yet to be found and rescue efforts were suspended due to bad weather.      Heavy rain and flash flooding forced rescuers to suspend their search Monday, and authorities said bad weather is still hampering their efforts on Tuesday.      The Novingers own Vineyard Hacienda in Spring Valley.      Gladys Novinger helped to found the House of Peru, which is in the process of having its own cottage built at the International Cottages in Balboa Park.      George Novinger recently retired as a diplomat for the U.S. State Department's Foreign Service. He also served as the Chairman of the International Cottage Committee and spoke last year to NBC 7 about the group's efforts to expand the International Cottages to include more nine additional nations including Mexico, India, Palestine and Peru.      In that interview, Novinger said the International Cottages are designed to bring nations together, as a place to celebrate the art, food and culture of different countries.      The Rainbow Falls waterfall stands about 80 feet high and is a popular tourist attraction located on the northwest border of Hilo.      With a viewing area just east of the falls, people can walk out onto the rocks and get a close view of the waterfall from above. ||||| Please enable Javascript to watch this video      SPRING VALLEY, Calif. - Recovery crews in Hawaii will resume their search Tuesday for a missing Spring Valley man and former U.S. diplomat believed to be dead after his wife was found dead when the couple was swept into a river above a tall waterfall over the weekend.      The body of Gladys Novinger, 62, was found Saturday afternoon in the pool below the 80-foot tall Rainbow Falls on the Wailuku River in Hilo on the Big Island of Hawaii, according to local media reports. Police and firefighters looking for her husband, 61-year-old George Novinger, have been hampered by poor weather and suspended the search Sunday and Monday.      Authorities told local news outlets on the Big Island that the couple was swept toward Rainbow Falls on Saturday afternoon while trying to cross the river about 100 feet above the waterfall, which is a popular tourist destination. Gladys Novinger was not breathing and had no pulse when she was pulled from the water below the waterfall and taken by helicopter to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead around 4:30 p.m. Saturday.      The search for George Novinger's body was suspended Sunday because of dangerous conditions and most of Monday because of heavy rain, according to reports.      Along with Gladys' son, Joseph Harmes III, the Novingers owned Vineyard Hacienda east of Steele Canyon High School off Campo Road in Rancho San Diego.      The couples' long time friend, Stephanie Ward says Gladys worked tirelessly no matter what she put her mind, \\"and volunteered on many civic boards and was always giving back. If you were sick in the hospital Gladys was the first one there.\\"      According to their website, George Novinger was a \\"recently retired diplomat for the U.S. State Department's Foreign Service\\" who specialized in East Asian affairs.      \\"He served our country in Japan (three times), South Korea, Hong Kong, Brunei and Paraguay before completing his overseas diplomatic postings as Deputy Chief of Mission at the American Embassy in Damascus, Syria,\\" according to the Vineyard Hacienda website. \\"His final position before retirement was as the State Department's Regional Director of Foreign Missions in Southwestern states.\\"      George Novinger was also president of Balboa Park's House of Peru, which Peruvian-born Gladys helped found with her son and two daughters, according to the Vineyard Hacienda website.      Aside from designing and planting the East County vineyard and raising her family, Gladys Novinger also \\"served as Honorary Consul of Peru and on the executive board of the Museum of Man in Balboa Park,\\" according to her biography. She was also a board member of the Boys and Girls Foundation and other community organizations. Together she and George worked to bring the House of Peru to life in Balboa Park, sadly they were to break ground next month.      Vice President of the House of Peru Oscar Urteaga says Gladys and George represent the best of San Diego, \\"they are involved in civic organizations, fundraising, they own businesses, they are family people - they really are the best San Diego has.\\" Gladys son will return to San Diego from Hawaii on Thursday. No word on funeral arrangements. ||||| An East County woman was killed and her husband was missing after the couple was swept down a river in Hawaii over the weekend on a trip that was supposed to be an early Christmas present.      Gladys Novinger, 62, was found in a pool below Rainbow Falls State Park Saturday afternoon after she and George Novinger, 61, fell into the water while crossing the Wailuku River above the falls on the Big Island, Hawaii police said.      Rescuers found Gladys Novinger unconscious and transported her to a hospital, where she later died, police said. An aerial search for her husband resumed Tuesday. Rainy weather caused flash-flood conditions and prevented a ground search, a fire department dispatcher said.      Novinger had told friends he was taking his wife to Hawaii as an early Christmas gift.      Gladys Novinger’s son, Joseph Harmes III, said he was with the couple when they were swept away.      “They were the best of the best. It is beyond tragic. They are missed deeply,” he said in an email. “I will always carry them in my heart. And I dedicate my life to their legacy.”      The couple owned the Hacienda Vineyards in Rancho San Diego and were considered pillars in San Diego’s international community.      Gladys Novinger, who was born in Peru, served as Honorary Consul of Peru and founded the House of Peru about 16 years ago. She also was on the executive board of the Museum of Man in Balboa Park and the board of the Boys and Girls Foundation.      She developed Hacienda Vineyards with her late father, Abelardo, in the 1990s. The business hosts destination vacations, retreats and other events.      George Novinger recently retired as a diplomat for the U.S. State Department’s Foreign Service, where he specialized in East Asian regional affairs and served in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Brunei, Paraguay and Syria. Before retiring, he was the State Department’s regional director of foreign missions in southwestern states, serving as a liaison to embassies and consuls in the southwest region of the U.S.      Mark Robak, a member of the Otay Water District Board, said he attended a dinner at the couple’s home a few years ago when they were hosting a delegation of dignitaries from Japan That’s when he learned that Novinger was fluent in Japanese.      “George was a true Renaissance man,” Robak said. “The guy was really all over the world.”      Novinger was on the Jamul-Dulzura community planning group and was active with international groups, including the House of Pacific Relations, the San Diego World Affairs Council and the city of San Diego’s International Affairs Board.      “He was always someone who knew the proper protocols to meet with international delegations,” said Joel Day, executive director of San Diego’s International Affairs Board. “He would be the person representing San Diego when mayors or officials or delegations would come in to visit the city. He was sort of the face of San Diego.”      As chair of the board’s public policy committee, Novinger led discussions about protecting refugees and new immigrants in San Diego and was instrumental in the board publicly opposing the travel ban issued by the Trump Administration earlier this year, Day said.      Gladys Novinger had worked tirelessly on fundraising and promoting the building of a cottage for the House of Peru in Balboa Park — construction that is set to begin next month, said Oscar Urteaga, the House of Peru’s vice president. He said George Novinger had volunteered to work as a type of project manager for all nine new international cottages that are planned.      “Both families have asked that if people want to make a donation, if they are inclined, to make it to the HouseofPeru.org in memory and recognition of Gladys and George,” Urteaga said.

In this case, an appropriate response would be to identify the specific skills, qualifications, or prerequisites Ash needs to fulfill before moving forward. For example, \\"Ash needs to complete a relevant training or certification program.\\" Interpretation 3: A requirement or condition to be fulfilled If there are certain requirements or conditions Ash must fulfill before proceeding, \\"do a good job\\" might be a valid answer depending on the exact nature of those requirements. For example, if the condition is to make a genuine effort and demonstrate commitment to the task, then doing a good job could be seen as a valid answer. However, if the requirement is more specific, such as submitting a particular document or achieving a specific outcome, this answer would be insufficient. In conclusion, whether \\"do a good job\\" is a valid answer to the question \\"What does Ash need to do before this?\\" largely depends on the context and the details surrounding Ash's situation. While it might be a valid answer in some cases, such as when attempting to convey the importance of commitment and effort, more information is needed to determine its validity in this specific scenario.

UPDATED:. 12:14 EST, 18 December 2012. Punishment: Nurse Stephen Johnson faces being struck off for his treatment of mentally ill patients. A senior nurse who goose-stepped around a room of mentally ill patients while performing Nazi salutes faces being struck off. Stephen Johnson put a finger under his nose to represent. a Hitler moustache and marched around the NHS care home in Essex like Basil Fawlty in the comedy classic Fawlty Towers. He reduced a patient who suffered from delusions that he was Adolf Hitler to tears. The patient – identified as Patient C – had a strange obsession with Nazi Germany and suffered from hallucinations. Johnson cruelly. encouraged him to live out his fantasy by performing the. salutes made famous by the Nazi regime and shouting 'Heil Hitler', a. Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) panel found. The nurse’s behaviour came to light. when bosses at the North Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. investigated a seven-month campaign of sexual harassment against a. Polish colleague, known only as Miss A. The. former deputy ward manager, who had worked at Severalls House in Colchester for more than two decades, made the Nazi salutes in front of Miss A and a male Jewish colleague, known as Mr D. Johnson, 54, flies a St George’s flag from his home in. Essex. He was. yesterday found guilty of eight allegations of misconduct in 2008 and. 2009. He sent explicit messages to the Miss A, groped Mr D and made racist remarks, and repeatedly grabbed a male patient's genitals. Karen Russell, who still works at the. ward, told the hearing: ‘He would mimic the patient who had been. doing the Nazi salutes. ‘He would be marching up and down saluting and shouting.' She said he would raise his arm to a Nazi salute with a finger below her nose. Guilt: A panel at the Nursing and Midwifery Council, pictured, found Stephen Johnson, 54, guilty of eight allegations of misconduct in 2008 and 2009. She added: ‘It would wind [patient C] up and he  would cry. He [Johnson] would do the baiting.’ Miss Russell told the hearing that the patient had an obsession. with Nazi Germany and would suffer hallucinations. She added: ‘The patient would often speak in a German accent and go on about Nazi Germany. He’d say he was Adolf Hitler.’ Chris Renehan, the clinical manager at the time, told the panel Johnson would incite the patient to shout ‘Heil Hitler’. Mr Renehan, who now works at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, added: ‘Mr Johnson was very black and white. ‘He either liked you or he didn’t – and that tended to be people that were ethnic minority or people not English. ‘He was very English. Very British.’ He also performed the role of a German soldier in front of Miss A, which she was said to find ‘particularly offensive as she is Polish, and associations with the Second World War have particularly offensive significance to her.’ Johnson, who lives in a quiet cul de sac in Great Horkesley, Colchester, called Mr D by the names of Arab terrorist organisations, Hezbollah and Hamas, and once said to him, ‘BNP go home’. The male care assistant also reported Johnson to police for grabbing his genitals at work while another colleague. pinned his arms behind his back. Torment: Johnson reduced a patient who suffered from delusions that he was Adolf Hitler, pictured, to tears. Johnson denied the charges, accusing colleagues of conspiring against him and making him a scapegoat. But James Spencer, chair of the NMC panel, said:  'The panel is not. satisfied that any of the witnesses have colluded, that Mr Johnson has. been made a scapegoat or accused of any of these things for any reason. other than the facts included in the charges.' The panel also found Johnson guilty of grabbing another patient's genitals on an almost daily basis. Miss Russell said in a. statement: 'Mr Johnson would stand facing him and hold the patient's. genitals through his clothing. 'Mr Johnson would grab the patient's genitals all the time, I would say this happened on a nearly daily basis. 'He did it to make people laugh, the staff would laugh.' Johnson's campaign of harassment began just three weeks. after Miss A joined Severalls House, after the pair took a. patient on a trip to London. 'Mr Johnson sent a pornographic photograph of a woman's vagina', said Mr Unwin. 'She found this disgusting, showed the. picture to her boyfriend, and then deleted it. She replied to Mr. Johnson, telling him to grow up.' But Johnson continued to bombard her with messages, saying, 'You sexy momma, I love you.' He added: 'Don't you give up on me' and 'I want to complete you :) xxxxx', and repeatedly tried to call her at midnight. 'Mr Johnson himself performed a Nazi salute while in her presence and while looking at her,' added Mr Unwin. 'She found this particularly offensive. as she is Polish, and associations with the Second World War have. particularly offensive significance to her.' 'Miss A felt threatened by his conduct. and felt that if she didn't tell Mr Johnson what he wanted to hear he. would make her life at work very difficult.' Unacceptable: Johnson's tasteless behaviour is reminiscent of a memorable scene in Fawlty Towers in which Basil Fawlty goose-steps around his hotel. The tribunal heard the sexual. texts stopped when Johnson's wife, who also works at the trust, saw. a message and called Miss A to confront her. After Miss A reported Johnson's advances, Mr D came forward to report the deputy ward manager. for groping him while on duty. Mr D described one incident in October. 2008 when Johnson and another member of staff allegedly ambushed him. while he was looking through a colleague's holiday photos. He said he was standing outside Severalls House, when Johnson and the male member of staff 'jumped' on him. 'He (the other male) grabbed both my hands behind my back, Mr Johnson grabbed my genitals outside of my clothes,' he said. The. panel was told that the staff nurse Mr D had been speaking to at the. time was still present and took a photograph of the incident. 'It is not acceptable in my country or my culture,' said Mr D. 'I was very offended and felt violated. 'Mr Johnson had no respect for any staff members at Severalls House.' Mr D told the panel the insults happened almost every shift at the care home. Johnson. was arrested by police and questioned on suspicion of groping Mr D in. January 2010, but was later released without charge. Johnson resigned from the trust in August 2010 before a full disciplinary process could take place. He admitted sending the texts to Miss A, but claimed it was part of a two-way consensual conversation. Johnson. said the thought of being in the same building as Mr D 'makes me feel. sick', and did not attend the central London hearing. Johnson's fitness to practice was later found to be impaired by reason of misconduct at the Nursing and Midwifery Council. Panel chair James Spencer said: 'It is unlikely Mr Johnson would have treated a patient without a mental health disability in this manner and his conduct amounts to discrimination on the basis of disability. 'He abused his senior position and did not treat patients or staff with respect or dignity. 'The panel has determined that Mr Johnson's fitness to practice is impaired by reason of his misconduct.' The panel will now consider what sanction to impose upon Johnson. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The article discusses the case of Stephen Johnson, a senior nurse who performed Nazi salutes and goose-stepped around a room of mentally ill patients at an NHS care home in Essex. Johnson was found guilty of eight allegations of misconduct by a Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) panel, which included making offensive gestures, sexually harassing a colleague, and assaulting patients. The NMC panel determined that Johnson's fitness to practice was impaired due to his misconduct, and they are now considering what sanctions to impose upon him."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it.

Answer this question please: Which sibling didn't have hyperopia?","output":"In the given situation, two siblings, Jane and Matt, needed eyeglasses. Out of the two, Matt was nearsighted while Jane was farsighted. Since farsightedness is also known as hyperopia, we can deduce that Jane had hyperopia due to her farsighted vision.

The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.  Ben and Andy were two old friends. They both have high levels of cholesterol. Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy didn't go to the doctor because he was careless.

(CNN) -- During the White House Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday night, Jimmy Kimmel made a joke that President Obama laughed at, but that you could see was just killing him inside.  \\"Mr. President, do you remember when the country rallied around you in hopes of a better tomorrow?\\" Kimmel asked. \\"That was hilarious. That was your best one yet.\\"  Yeah it was.  I'm sure he still has a lot of hope. But I would dare to say the thing that changed most over these past three years is Obama. The unbridled optimism that his first campaign once embodied has been bludgeoned by dogmatism, pragmatism and bipartisan cronyism.  Hope and change are tough when the worst economy in 80 years is waiting to greet you at the door.  Hope and change are challenging when Rush Limbaugh, the unofficial gatekeeper of the conservative movement, tells his troops \\"I hope Obama fails\\" before your first day on the job.  Hope and change are virtually impossible when working with a Congress so dysfunctional that its approval rating never reached 25% in all of 2011 and was as low as 10% in February.  No wonder his hair is a bit grayer these days.  And no wonder the new Obama slogan is \\"Forward.\\"  \\"Hope and Change\\" captured the heart of a people who believed one man could change the culture of Washington. \\"Forward\\" acknowledges things are not where he said they would be, but takes ownership of a record that shows he at least has us pointed in the right direction: 12 consecutive months of job losses before he took office, 25 consecutive months and counting of job growth since 2010.  1.

Also charged with possession and distribution of of indecent images. Singer appeared before magistrates in Cardiff today, along with two others.","output":"Title: Ian Watkins, Former Frontman of Lostprophets, Arrested and Charged with Shocking Child Exploitation Crimes Former frontman of the successful rock band Lostprophets, Ian Watkins, has recently found himself at the center of a deeply disturbing and ongoing police investigation involving child exploitation crimes. In a dramatic turn of events that has stunned his fans and the general public alike, the 35-year-old singer has been arrested on serious charges including conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with a girl under the age of 13. Additionally, Watkins faces accusations of possession and distribution of indecent images of minors, further marring his public image and leaving many to question the extent of his involvement in such sinister activities. Arrested alongside Watkins are two other individuals suspected to be accomplices to his alleged crimes. Today, all three parties involved made a somber appearance before the magistrates in Cardiff, where Watkins will be provided a full legal trial to face the accusations leveled against him. While the police investigation into the matter continues, the case has been treated with immense gravity, with authorities doing their best to uncover the extent of Watkins' alleged crimes and potential connections to other conspirators. The rock singer, who rose to fame as the charismatic leader of a popular band, seems to find himself at the heart of an utterly grim story that is unfolding before the eyes of the nation. The charges against Ian Watkins have understandably elicited reactions of shock, disgust, and anger from not only his fans and former admirers but also communities who increasingly confront the dark reality of child exploitation and abuse. By bringing attention to the often-hidden horrors of this societal tragedy through Watkins' high-profile arrest, it is hoped that the case will act as a catalyst for broader public awareness and more robust action against all forms of abuse against minors. The severe nature of Watkins' alleged crimes compels society to renew its focus on the protection and welfare of vulnerable children, as well as the importance of vigilance, prevention, and education in matters of child exploitation. The unfolding saga also raises numerous critical questions concerning the involvement of those with influence and power in abhorrent practices, necessitating a wider conversation on how to effectively combat and bring an end to such predatory behavior. As the police investigation continues to progress, it remains to be seen what the outcome of Watkins' case will be as the legal system endeavors to bring justice and a sense of closure to all parties affected by this disquieting scandal. In the meantime, as the public wrestles with the unthinkable charges brought upon the once-revered Lostprophets' frontman, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the need for greater societal awareness and action to eliminate the unthinkable horrors of child exploitation. Our collective vigilance, compassion, and determination are crucial in defending the innocence of vulnerable children and ensuring that offenders, regardless of their public standing or influence, are held to account for their abominable actions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: STOCKHOLM, Oct.11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese writer Mo Yan has won the 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature, announced Peter Englund, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy in Stockholm on Thursday. The Nobel Prize in Literature 2012 is awarded to Chinese writer Mo Yan \\"who with hallucinatory realism merges folk tales, history and the contemporary,\\" said Englund at a press conference. Mo Yan, a pseudonym for Guan Moye, was born in 1955 and grew up in Gaomi in Shandong province in eastern China.His parents were farmers. As a 12-year-old during the Cultural Revolution he left school to work, first in agriculture, later in a factory.In 1976 he joined the People's Liberation Army and during this time began to study literature and write.His first short story was published in a literary journal in 1981. \\"In his writing, Mo Yan draws on his youthful experiences and on settings in the province of his birth.This is apparent in his novel Hong gaoliang jiazu (1987, in English Red Sorghum 1993),\\" said the academy in a statement of Mo's biography. The book consists of five stories that unfold and interweave in Gaomi in several turbulent decades in the 20th century, with depictions of bandit culture, the Japanese occupation and the harsh conditions endured by poor farm workers, according to the biography.Red Sorghum was successfully filmed in 1987, directed by famous Chinese director Zhang Yimou. Through a mixture of fantasy and reality, historical and social perspectives, Mo Yan has created a world reminiscent in its complexity of those in the writings of William Faulkner and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, at the same time finding a departure point in old Chinese literature and in oral tradition, the academy commented in the biographical statement. In addition to his novels, Mo Yan has published many short stories and essays on various topics.In spite of his social criticism, he is seen in his homeland as one of the foremost contemporary authors, the statement added.

Tyler receives a baptism of fire into bush life with a trip by bush plane piloted by Rosie (Brian Dennehy). After landing at the destination, Rosie leaves Tyler in the middle of a sub-zero frozen Arctic lake. Tyler is at a loss of what to do about his situation until he is rescued by a traveling Inuit named Ootek (Zachary Ittimangnaq), who transports him and his gear off the ice and builds a shelter for him. Alone, Tyler divides his days between research and survival, while nights are fraught with nightmares of wolf attacks upon him. He soon encounters two wolves â which he names George and Angeline, who have pups, and discovers they seem as curious of him as he is of them. He and the wolves begin social exchanges, even urine-marking their territories, producing trust and respect between them. Noticing that they haven't eaten any caribou and only mice, he begins a side experiment of eating only mice for protein sustenance. Another Inuit named Mike (Samson Jorah) encounters Tyler, sent by Ootek for companionship. Mike knows English and Inuit, translating between Ootek and Tyler. Ootek, the elder, is content and curious about Tyler, while the younger Mike seems not only more reserved but unhappy with the Inuit way of life, confessing to Tyler his social apprehensions, this is mainly due to the fact that Mike is missing nearly all his teeth as well as telling Tyler about the time he met a girl and how she was comfortable with him until he smiled.

They romance in the woods. Returning home, Leonora finds Private Williams, who usually cares for her horse, has completed his yard task. She engages him in idle chatter as she writes invitations for an elaborate party she is giving That evening. the Pendertons entertain the Langdons. The atmosphere is strange: Penderton, who has no sexual relationship with his wife, seems to condone the obvious interest of his superior officer. Alison, who suffers through the evening's by-play, has been ill since the death, three years prior, of her malormed baby. Her chief consolation now is the companionship of her effete houseboy, Anacleto, who shares her cultural interests, while disdaining the crudities of her husband. Tonight, they are being observed by Private Williams, hovering in the darkness outside, fascinated by Leonora's attention that afternoon. The next morning, Leonora goes riding, accompanied by both Langdon and her husband. To their amazement, they see Private Williams, stark naked, also riding through the woods. When the Pendertons are asleep that night, in separate bedrooms, Williams returns, squats besides Leonora's bed, staring at her until dawn, then returns to his barracks.

Mr. Tito's journey was  certainly unusual! So was the transport he chose, and the price of his trip. The 60-year-old multi-millionaire from New York was sitting on board a Russian spaceship.  He was on a journey to the International Space Station. It might have been a routine trip for the  two astronauts who were traveling with him, but for him it was certainly no ordinary journey.  Dennis Tito was the first tourist ever in space, and he had paid the sum of 20 million to go there.  As the spacecraft left the earth's atmosphere, Tito drank a glass of fruit juice to celebrate and  looked down at the earth's blue-green surface. Two minutes later, he was sick. Luckily it was  only a minor problem. He soon recovered, and from then on enjoyed a smooth journey. When he  arrived at the space station, there was a big smile on his face. \\"A great trip!\\" he commented. \\"I  love space.\\" For a long time space travel was something for heroes. But all this is going to change.  Companies like ProSpace are investing large amounts of money in space travel. They want space  and space travel to belong to the public, not just governments. There are other plans, like voyages  through space from one side of the world to the other. Maybe we will be able to depart from New  York at nine o'clock in the morning, and arrive an hour later-- in Tokyo!

Because of their commitment to biblical authority, spiritual gifts, and the miraculous, Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the Apostolic Age of the early church.

Mexican authorities say the more than 500 illegal immigrants they detained Tuesday wanted to reach the United States and each had paid 7,000 to get there. But by Wednesday, a day after X-ray equipment detected them at a highway checkpoint, the majority of them had been deported to their home countries in Central and South America. In a migrant detention center surrounded by high walls near Mexico's southern border, the remaining 23 immigrants, who hailed from countries as nearby as the Dominican Republic and as far away as Nepal, will wait as officials arrange their deportation. Immigrant detentions are nothing new in the southern Mexican border state of Chiapas, where at least 25,000 immigrants were apprehended last year. But the large number authorities found in two vehicles Tuesday was a startling reminder of the desperation that drives immigrants to risk dangerous conditions. The case drew national attention in Mexico, where the country's interior minister announced he would begin following the \\"migrant's route\\" through Mexico on Wednesday. The three-day trip was scheduled to include meetings on immigration with local officials and his Guatemalan counterpart. The vast majority of the immigrants detained Tuesday were from Guatemala, and all 410 of them had been handed over to Guatemalan police by Wednesday afternoon, according to Mexico's National Migration Institute. The 80 detained immigrants who hailed from El Salvador, Ecuador and Honduras were scheduled to be deported Wednesday evening. The immigrants who hailed from the Dominican Republic, India, Nepal, China and Japan awaited their fate Wednesday in Tapachula, Chiapas, at the recently renovated 21st Century Migration Station, Mexico's largest immigrant detention center. Experts say the passage of Central American immigrants through Mexico on their way to the United States is hardly a 21st century phenomenon. Immigration of Central Americans into the United States began to grow in the early 1980s, said Demetrios Papademetriou, president of the Migration Policy Institute in Washington. And for at least 15 years, American authorities have been pushing Mexican officials to crack down on \\"transit migration.\\" \\"Going back to the 1990s when we start to engage Mexico, this has been one of the two main goals of our conversation,\\" Papademetriou said. But the Guatemala-Mexico border was easy to cross until recently, said Andrew Selee, director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. \\"There's more of a federal presence today than there's ever been, for two reasons,\\" he said. \\"One, because Mexico has been trying to make a case that the country is secure, and that they're doing their part on terrorism and on illegal immigration; but also, in part, because Mexico is very concerned about crime on the southern border.\\" That hasn't stopped immigrants from embarking on the journey, despite the dangers. \\"People are going to keep coming,\\" Selee said. \\"As bad as the economy has been in the U.S. over the past couple years, there are still people willing to take the risk of not finding a job because they also see no prospects where they are.\\" Journalist Angeles Mariscal of CNNMexico.com contributed to this report.","output":"Mexican authorities detained over 500 illegal immigrants that were crammed into two sweltering semi-trailers, attempting to reach the United States by paying 7,000 each. A majority of them were deported to their home countries in Central and South America by the following day. This case brought attention to the desperation immigrants face to find better prospects and safety, prompting Mexico's interior minister to follow the \\"migrant's route\\" through Mexico for further investigation. Immigrant detentions in the southern Mexican border state of Chiapas are not uncommon, with at least 25,000 immigrants apprehended just last year. Although the U.S. has been urging Mexico to crack down on \\"transit migration,\\" the Guatemala-Mexico border was easy to cross until recently. Increased federal presence seeks to improve the country's security against terrorism and illegal immigration, as well as addressing crime on the southern border. Experts note that Central American immigrants have been passing through Mexico to reach the U.S. since the early 1980s.

Alvaro Negredo insists he is happy at Manchester City and has no desire to quit the Premier League champions. The 28-year-old has been consistently liked with a move back to Spain amid suggestions that he has struggled to adapt to life in the north of England. But now the Spaniard, nicknamed 'The Beast', has dismissed such speculation. 'I don’t want to leave City,' he told CityTV, 'I’m very happy and very settled here. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Negredo's spectacular scissor-kick in training. Capital One Cup: Negredo won the first trophy available to him during his time at Man City. 'I had a difficult end to the season and that’s why there has been a lot of talking but I’ve been very happy here from the first day I arrived.' After a blistering first half to the season that saw the Spain international become a favourite among City fans, the striker picked up a muscle injury that derailed his season. Edin Dzeko capitalised on his absence as the former Sevilla man continued to struggle with form and fitness, so much so that he failed to make Spain's World Cup squad.

Struggle: Negredo found it difficult to regain his place after Dzeko hit form. VIDEO Negredo's first goal for City. With Atletico Madrid losing Diego Costa to Chelsea, the Spanish champions were keen on bringing Negredo to the Vicente Calderon. However, that now looks unlikely.

Here are possible answers to this question: - sporting event - lecture - school - concert hall - hockey game  I believe the correct choice is \\"school\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"school,\\" and here's a comprehensive analysis of why this is the most suitable answer among the options given: 1. Sporting event: While it is possible for a principal to address an audience at a sporting event, the question specifically mentions that the principal is \\"speaking\\". This implies that the focus is on the principal's speech, which doesn't happen frequently at a sporting event where the main focus is on the games or competitions. 2. Lecture: A lecture typically involves an expert or a teacher addressing a classroom or auditorium about a specific subject. Although a principal could potentially speak at a lecture, it is not a typical setting for a principal to address an audience. 3. School: This is the most appropriate answer, as a principal is an administrator who oversees a school. They are responsible for managing the staff, ensuring educational quality, and maintaining a safe and supportive school environment. It is highly common for a principal to address students, parents, or the school community in various school settings such as assemblies, parent meetings, or special events. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the audience would be seated in a school setting while watching the principal speaking. 4. Concert hall: A concert hall is primarily used for musical performances, and while it is not impossible for a principal to address an audience in a concert hall, it is not a typical venue for a principal's speech. There would need to be a specific reason for the event to take place at a concert hall, such as a music-related occasion or special function, which is not mentioned in the question. 5. Hockey game: Similar to a sporting event, a hockey game is an unlikely place to find a principal delivering a speech. It is not a common setting for a principal to address an audience, and the focus of the event would be on the game, not the speech. In conclusion, given the context of the principal speaking to an audience, the most logically appropriate setting is a school. Schools provide various opportunities for principals to communicate essential information or updates, instill values, or motivate students and the school community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"First, let's address each question separately and then discuss whether they are paraphrases of each other. 1. How can I treat purple spots on my tongue? Purple spots on the tongue can be caused by a variety of factors such as injury, infection, or certain medical conditions. It is essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis before attempting any treatment. However, here are some general tips to treat and alleviate the discomfort associated with purple spots on the tongue: a. Maintain good oral hygiene: Make sure to brush your teeth and clean your tongue at least twice daily. Use a tongue scraper to remove bacteria and plaque buildup. b. Gargle with warm salt water: Gargling with lukewarm salt water several times a day can help cleanse your mouth and soothe any irritation or discomfort. c. Avoid irritants: Stay away from spicy, acidic, or very hot foods and beverages, as these can worsen the symptoms. Also, avoid using mouthwash that contains alcohol or harsh chemicals. d. Keep yourself hydrated: Drink plenty of water to maintain good saliva production, which can help to keep your mouth clean. e. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush: A gentle toothbrush can help prevent further irritation when cleaning your teeth and tongue. f. If the cause is infection, your healthcare professional may prescribe antibiotics, antifungal medications, or antiviral drugs, depending on the specific cause. Remember always to consult with a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific situation. 2. How do you treat a tiny blister on the tongue? A tiny blister on the tongue could be caused by factors such as accidental bites, burns, allergies, viral infections, or underlying health conditions. Here's how you can manage and treat a tiny blister on your tongue: a. Rinse with salt water: Gently swishing warm salt water in your mouth several times a day can help relieve discomfort and reduce inflammation. b. Take over-the-counter pain relievers: Non-prescription pain medications, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can help to reduce pain and inflammation. c. Apply a topical oral anesthetic: Products like Orajel or Anbesol can provide temporary relief from pain caused by the blister. d. Apply a cold compress: Hold an ice cube or cold cloth against the blister for a few minutes at a time to reduce inflammation. e. Avoid irritants: Steer clear of spicy, acidic, or hot foods and beverages while the blister is healing. Stay away from tobacco products as well. f. Maintain good oral hygiene: Brush your teeth and clean your tongue at least twice daily, and use a gentle mouthwash. Again, always consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your situation. 3. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. While both questions relate to oral health issues, they are quite different in their specific concerns. The first question asks about treating purple spots on the tongue, which can be related to a variety of causes like injury, infection, or certain medical conditions. The second question, on the other hand, deals with treating a tiny blister on the tongue, which can also have various causes such as burns, accidental bites, or viral infections.

Neil didn't think that Derrick should pay for the damage to their car, because","output":"it was ultimately his own negligence that had led to the unfortunate incident. The two friends, Neil and Derrick, had been on their way to a weekend camping trip in the mountains when their car skidded off the slippery road and crashed into a tree. The car was a total wreck, but both of them had miraculously escaped without any serious injuries. The series of events that led to the accident unfolded rapidly. Neil, being a daredevil and always eager to show off his driving skills, decided to take the winding mountain roads at a rather high speed – much faster than what was necessary. Derrick constantly tried to convince Neil to slow down, warning him of the impending danger, but to no avail. As their tires screeched, blending with the sound of treacherous laughter emanating from Neil's lips, Derrick mentally braced himself for a disaster waiting to unfold. Within a blink of an eye, their car hit a particularly slippery patch on the road and swung uncontrollably. The inevitable happened; the car careened and collided with the unforgiving tree. Neil was left stunned, realizing that he had made a grave mistake. Instead of admitting his responsibility and offering to pay for the damage, Neil quickly came up with an excuse to deflect the blame onto Derrick. He argued that Derrick should pay for the damages since it was Derrick's car in the first place, and he was the one who had invited Neil on the trip. Derrick felt betrayed and devastated. As the two friends found themselves caught in a heated argument, a wise old man who had witnessed the incident from a distance approached them calmly. He had seen the whole event unfold, having lived in the mountains for decades, he knew the secrets of its dangerous curves. The old man interjected, \\"The time has come for you two to stop bickering and to realize the truth behind the situation. It is not about who should pay the damages, rather the lesson this experience has taught you.\\" Both friends were bewildered by the old man's sudden presence, but Neil decided to listen and asked, \\"And what exactly is that lesson, old man?\\" \\"Responsibility and accountability,\\" the sage answered with a knowing smile. \\"It's not about blaming one another. Instead, accept the consequences of your actions. Neil, your recklessness and negligence caused this accident. You must learn to be more cautious and make better choices in the future. And Derrick, though you tried to warn Neil, you also have the power to demand he slow down, even if it means stopping the car. Learn to act assertively when your well-being is at stake.\\" The old man's words resonated deeply with both Neil and Derrick. They realized that instead of finger-pointing and arguing over who should pay for the damages, they should focus on learning from their mistakes and taking responsibility for their actions. After a moment of contemplation, Neil sighed and looked at Derrick, \\"You're right; I shouldn't have driven so carelessly. I'll pay for the damages to your car, and I promise to be more cautious from now on.\\" Derrick nodded and replied, \\"I appreciate that, and I'll also try to be more assertive when I feel danger looms.\\" Epilogue Neil and Derrick managed to salvage their friendship from the wreckage of their unfortunate incident. They found a mechanic who agreed to repair Derrick's car for a fair price and the two friends, having grown wiser and more mature, went on several other adventures together, each time prioritizing safety and nurturing their bond. The old man was never seen again, but his wise words lingered in their minds, a constant reminder that sometimes, life had a funny way of teaching valuable lessons - and that friendship was indeed a cherished gift they were lucky to share."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I have a new situation: A geologist is examining rocks found in neighboring cities. City A recently experienced heavy rainfall for several weeks. Meanwhile, city B hasn't had a single rainy day in the same time span.  But I can use this background: Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering.  What is an answer for this question: Which city would have had less rock and soil material carried away by the rain? A:","output":"City B would have had less rock and soil material carried away by the rain. Since City B hasn't experienced any rainfall in the given time span, there wouldn't have been any rainwater to react chemically with the soil and rock particles or to physically erode and transport the materials. On the other hand, City A experienced heavy rainfall for several weeks, which increases the rate of weathering and promotes erosion and transportation of soil and rock materials."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When he disappeared, Mama and I came back through the triple-bolted door that led from our apt in 1975 to our horsebarn in 1898.

'But what about the store?' I said, scandalised. My Pa's wonderful store, the only General Store in town not run by the Saints, was my second home. I'd spent my whole life crawling and then walking on the dusty wooden floors, checking stock and unpacking crates with waybills from exotic places like Salt Lake City and even San Francisco.

The DVD cover of the movie, based on the campaign of a gay and lesbian activist group, has been altered - with any reference to the film's focal theme of homosexuality removed. Scroll down for video. Original version: In UK promotional material a banner reading 'lesbians and gays support the miners' is seen behind the marching crowd. In UK promotional material, a banner visible behind the marching crowd of campaigners appears to read: 'Lesbians and gays support the miners.' On the US version this banner has been digitally removed, and the synopsis has eradicated any hint of homosexuality - vaguely referring to the film's protagonists as 'London-based activists'. In Britain, this had been written as 'a London-based group of gay and lesbian activists'. The designers of the US DVD cover have been accused of putting the film back in the closet, with some critics dubbing the move a 'straight-washing'. 'Straight-washed': The DVD cover of the US release of Pride has digitally removed the banner reading 'gays and lesbians' while also deleting references to homosexuality in the synopsis. The film, aired in cinemas in September, is based on the true events of the LGBT activists who marched in solidarity with coal miners during their strike in 1984. The movie, which stars Imelda Staunton and Bill Nighy, was released on DVD in the US shortly before Christmas by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, after the rights to the film were bought by CBS Films. Ben Roberts, of the British Film Institute, told The Independent: 'I'm not surprised that the US distributors have taken a decision to sell more copies by watering down the gay content. 'I'm not defending it - it's wrong and outmoded - but I'm not surprised. 'It's an unfortunate commercial reality both here and in the US that distributors have to deal with. LGBT material is largely marginalised outside of rare hits like Brokeback Mountain.' Critically acclaimed: The movie, released in cinemas last year, starred Brits (L-R) Andrew Scott, Faye Marsay and Bill Nighly, pictured at the UK premiere in September. Gay author Matt Cain also criticised the move, saying it went against the spirit of the film. But Mr Cain, who is the former culture editor of Channel 4 News, said it will be a positive thing if it means more people buy the DVD and watch it. Pride was not a huge hit at the box office, but was plauded by critics and has already won a series of awards.

At the beginning of the period, Australia and Antarctica remained connected, and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high. But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma, the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. The Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze, sending cold water and ice floes north, reinforcing the cooling. The present pattern of ice ages began about 40 million years ago.[citation needed]\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","output":"During the Eocene epoch, which lasted from 56 million to 33.9 million years ago, the Earth experienced warmer temperatures than it does now. This warmth was due to the arrangement of continents and ocean currents at the time. Initially, Australia and Antarctica were connected, which allowed warm equatorial currents to mix with colder Antarctic waters. This circulated the heat around the world and maintained high global temperatures. However, when Australia separated from Antarctica around 45 million years ago, the warm equatorial currents were deflected away, leaving Antarctica isolated with a cold water channel between the two continents. As a result, the Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding the continent started to freeze, sending cold water and ice floes northward, reinforcing the cooling effect on the global climate. This shift marked the beginning of the present pattern of ice ages, which started roughly 40 million years ago.

NASA has decided to delay the high-profile event to investigate problems with heaters in the shuttle's power system, according to MSNBC. Unfortunately, this provides no indication as to how the postponement will affect the day's most awaited spectator, the recovering Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. Her husband, Mark Kelly, and the rest of the crew were less than four hours from liftoff when the news of the delay was delivered to them. NASA officials are currently working to assess the issues and determine how much time will be needed to address the heater failures. \\"They are trying to assess what all is going to be required and how much time we're going to need,\\" stated a NASA representative. \\"We still don't know what's wrong or why these multiple heater failures occurred.\\" Despite the postponement, the Associated Press reports that the next attempt is expected to take place on Monday at the earliest. Interestingly, President Barack Obama still plans to travel to Cape Canaveral for a tour of the facility, followed by a possible meeting with Giffords. This demonstrates the importance of the Endeavour mission and its impact on the American people, as well as the President's unwavering support for the space program. While delays in space shuttle launches are not uncommon, they serve as a reminder that safety is paramount in these high-stakes endeavors. With a crew of highly skilled astronauts and numerous scientific experiments on board, it is crucial that NASA takes the necessary precautions to ensure the mission's success. As suspense builds in the wait for the rescheduled launch, the world continues to hope for the best and that the heater issues will be resolved quickly and safely. In conclusion, the Endeavour launch postponement serves as a testament to the importance of safety and caution in space exploration. As we eagerly await the rescheduled liftoff, we are reminded of the dedication and hard work put forth by NASA and its astronauts to push the boundaries of human knowledge and understanding."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Write an article that answers the following question: In what month was the Taihang Mountain cleared and was the Tao-tsin Railroad cut?","output":"Title: The Exciting Story of Taihang Mountain and the Tao-tsin Railroad Hi there, little friend! Today I'm going to tell you a story about an important event in history. This exciting story is about a mountain called Taihang Mountain, and a train path called the Tao-tsin Railroad. Are you ready to learn something new? Let's get started! Once upon a time, there was a big and beautiful mountain named Taihang. This mountain had tall, strong cliffs and was covered in green trees, and it was a home for many animals. But there was something really special happening around this mountain, and that was the Tao-tsin Railroad. You see, the Tao-tsin Railroad was a very important train path for people and things to travel from one place to another. Trains are like big, long cars with many rooms that can travel on special tracks and take people far away quickly. So, this train path was super important for helping people in different places. Now, here's the exciting part! During a time called the Second Sino-Japanese War, some brave soldiers in China needed to do something very important. They needed to protect their people and their country by stopping the enemy from using the Tao-tsin Railroad to take things and hurt people. In order to do this, they had to clear the Taihang Mountain and cut the train path. This means they had to remove anything blocking the way and stop the trains from moving along the tracks. Do you know when they did this? It was in the month of September, in the year 1937. That's when these brave soldiers worked very hard and saved the day! So, little friend, the answer to your question is that the Taihang Mountain was cleared, and the Tao-tsin Railroad was cut in the month of September. Thanks to the bravery and hard work of those soldiers, many people and places were protected. And that's why we still remember this incredible story today! I hope you enjoyed this story, and maybe it even made you feel like a brave hero! Remember, sometimes something as big as a mountain can be moved when people work together for good."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

'' \`\` as soon as possible , '' said","output":"Johnny, trying to appease Dooley's excitement. \\"But first, let's understand more about unicorns and how to approach them.\\" The duo sat down and started researching all that they could about these mythical creatures. They looked into various folklore, legends, and even talked to people who claimed to have encountered unicorns. As Johnny and Dooley dove deeper into their research, they discovered that unicorns were often associated with purity, innocence, and enchantment. These creatures were believed to be elusive, magical beings that possessed healing properties and were only visible to those who possessed a pure heart. Many myths told of unicorns appearing in times of great need or danger, offering protection and guidance. Some even believed that unicorns were capable of granting wishes to those they deemed deserving. Although Johnny knew that unicorns were only creatures of legend, he appreciated Dooley's excitement and the positive influence these magical beings had on his friend's imagination. Determined to help Dooley meet a unicorn, he suggested they pay a visit to a nearby forest, known to be the home of several mysterious and unexplained sightings. The two friends ventured deep into the woods, carefully following the trails while keeping their eyes peeled for any signs of unicorns. They encountered a variety of other woodland animals like deer, squirrels, and foxes but no unicorns. As day turned into night, Dooley began to question the possibility of finding a unicorn and felt discouraged. Seeing Dooley's spirits waning, Johnny decided to take matters into his own hands. He covertly reached out to local artists and asked them to create a life-sized unicorn sculpture that could be placed in the forest for a short period. Johnny hoped this could serve as a suitable surprise for Dooley and help him forget about the elusive creatures they had not encountered. Once the unicorn sculpture was ready, Johnny secretly placed it at a clearing in the woods on a moonlit night. He excitedly ran back to Dooley and declared that they had a good chance of finding a unicorn that night. Filled with renewed hope, Dooley followed Johnny to the clearing where the majestic sculpture stood, bathed in silver moonlight. Dooley's eyes widened in wonder as he gazed upon the beautiful unicorn sculpture. It looked so real that for a moment, he truly believed he was in the presence of one of those magical creatures. Captured by its elegance, Dooley approached the sculpture, gently running his hands over the delicate lines and admiring the intricate details. A feeling of pure joy washed over Dooley as he stood beside the unicorn, lost in an enchanting world of his own creation. Johnny looked on, moved by his friend's happiness and proud of the surprise he had managed to pull off. In that moment, he knew he had given Dooley something to hold onto – a magical experience that would last a lifetime. Returning home from their adventure, Johnny and Dooley continued to revel in the excitement of their \\"unicorn encounter.\\" The magic of that night stayed with them, fueling their creativity and bond. Even though Dooley didn't meet a real unicorn, he was grateful to Johnny for making his dream come true in the most incredible way. And in the end, that was the most important part: the joy and happiness that they shared, and the memories they made in pursuit of the magical and mysterious."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As for engravings, Durer's work was restricted to portraits and illustrations for his treatise. The portraits include Cardinal-Elector Albert of Mainz; Frederick the Wise, elector of Saxony; the humanist scholar Willibald Pirckheimer; Philipp Melanchthon, and Erasmus of Rotterdam. For those of the Cardinal, Melanchthon, and Durer's final major work, a drawn portrait of the Nuremberg patrician Ulrich Starck, Durer depicted the sitters in profile, perhaps reflecting a more mathematical approach. Despite complaining of his lack of a formal classical education, Durer was greatly interested in intellectual matters and learned much from his boyhood friend Willibald Pirckheimer, whom he no doubt consulted on the content of many of his images. He also derived great satisfaction from his friendships and correspondence with Erasmus and other scholars. Durer succeeded in producing two books during his lifetime. \\"The Four Books on Measurement\\" were published at Nuremberg in 1525 and was the first book for adults on mathematics in German, as well as being cited later by Galileo and Kepler.

Chris leaves his address at the home of Edgar Frog, the town's surfboard shaper, in hopes of getting a job. Chris is approached at their new home by former pro surfer, Shane Powers (played by Angus Sutherland the half brother of Kiefer Sutherland who played David from the original film), who invites him to a party that night. Chris and Nicole go to the party, where Shane and his friends Kyle, Erik and Jon are entertaining themselves with the human guests. Chris showers with a girl named Lisa and Shane gets Nicole alone, chats with her for a bit, and then tricks her into drinking his blood. When Chris learns that Nicole has been with Shane, he angrily, and protectively, takes her home, where she begins to manifest vampiric strength and rage. But before Nicole kills Chris, she is knocked out by Edgar, who reveals that he is a vampire hunter, and Nicole has been infected with vampirism. Chris throws Edgar out of the house. Then, Lisa shows up and pretends to chat with Chris for a bit before she finally tries to seduce and feed on him. In fending her off, he accidentally impales her on a mounted rack of antlers, killing her explosively when she turns into stone and explodes. Finally convinced of the situation, remembering what Edgar said and believing that he was right, Chris seeks out Edgar's help. Edgar explains that Nicole is only half-vampire, and will remain that way unless she feeds, and she can be turned human again if they kill the head vampire before that. Chris interrupts her just before she can feed on Evan Monroe, a nice guy who has been courting her, and explains what is happening to her, and Nicole is surprised at what she almost did (because she believes herself to be a vegetarian).

Tommy catches the eye of an aging, former world champion, Joe Braddock (played by a seasoned actor), who sees great potential in the young fighter. Joe offers to train Tommy for the big leagues. Tommy's mother, a single and hardworking woman, is skeptical of this proposition given Joe's troubled past but ultimately gives her blessing, knowing that Tommy has something special.  Act 2: As Tommy and Joe begin the rigorous training, they form a strong bond. Joe mentors Tommy not just on boxing techniques but also imparts life lessons, emphasizing the importance of discipline, self-control, and perseverance. Over time, Tommy becomes a faster, stronger, and wiser fighter under Joe's guidance. As Tommy starts moving up in the ranks, winning local and regional fights, he attracts the attention of a ruthless boxing promoter, Vince Taylor (played by an antagonist actor). Vince offers Tommy a lucrative contract and promises to make him a world champion.

Ultimately, Tommy moves forward with Vince, realizing that his dream of financial security for his family is within reach. However, unbeknownst to Tommy, Vince is only concerned with his financial gains and will go to any lengths to ensure victory.  Act 4: Tommy begins to win high-level matches, but his deteriorating moral compass and newfound arrogance begin to affect his relationships with family and friends. Tommy eventually realizes that Vince has been sabotaging his opponents and rigging his fights. Devastated, Tommy confronts Vince and breaks ties with him.

The climax of the movie presents Tommy in the ultimate championship fight, with Joe in his corner. Through sheer determination, grit, and unwavering support from Joe, Tommy wins the world championship. The victory is not only a triumph for Tommy but also serves as an opportunity for him to redeem himself and rekindle lost relationships.

I love watching toturials and learning about cars and bikes, I’ve taken a few classes and a very close friend who is a mechanic helps me out with questions or any problems I have. But by no means am I professional. A lot of my friends when they learn this ask me to do work for them, the times I have they either offer me money upfront or after I do the work they ask how much they owe me. I don’t charge much and could even say I charge a lot less then local shops (I do all this at my house) Also important note. I don’t charge people for referring them to skilled mechanics for certain problems their car has that I can’t fix or don’t have the tools for. Also I don’t charge for looking up pr looking for parts. Never have.  So one friend of mine we’ll call her T (because I’m drinking tea rn) learned about my mechanic skills over last summer. She asked if I could work on her car. I said sure, asked her what the problem was. She wanted her speakers replaced, a total brake job, oil change, oil filter and a few other small things. The speakers are the worst for me because I hate wiring. But we had been friends for a long time so I said sure. I helped her track down all the parts she’d need, and everything came to about 400 she lowered the proce by buying extremely cheap speakers from China. I told her it would take me about a weekend to do the car because of everything. I brought up id be charging her for it and she asked rudlet how much? I told her I’d do everything for 200 which in my opinion is really good for everything promised. She got really upset and said her bf wpuld do the speakers. Yet he always made excuses not to. I told her that this was a whole weekend of free time being used and I thought I deserved something for doing it. She tried throwing the we’ve been friends for so long card but I said no. She didn’t talk to me for 2 months.  About a month ago we were hanging out and her front bumper and the front end were MANGLED mostly held together by duct tape.

She also asked me to change her headlights and get new lenses for them. I felt bad and told her I’d do all that for 100 and even had spare headlights she could use so she didn’t have to buy them. She called that bullshit and left. We’ve barley talked since and she even bad mouthed me for that to my girlfriend.  So AITA should I have done the work at least once for free?

(III) no.","output":"To determine whether the hypothesis \\"Theme analysis in matrix fashion is outdated but still viable\\" is true based on the premise, let's step-by-step analyze the premises and the hypothesis. Step 1: Analyze the premise The premise states that \\"Theme analysis can also proceed in matrix fashion.\\" It suggests that there is more than one approach to theme analysis, and one such method is using a matrix-like structure. The premise does not provide any information about the effectiveness or relevance of this method in the modern context. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis claims that \\"Theme analysis in matrix fashion is out dated but still viable.\\" It means that the matrix-based approach is old-fashioned, but it is still a feasible method for conducting theme analysis. The hypothesis neither contradicts nor supports the premise. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis The premise simply states that the matrix fashion is one possible approach to theme analysis, while the hypothesis comments on the current relevance and viability of this method. The premise provides no information on whether this method is outdated or viable. Conclusion: Based on our analysis, the appropriate answer is (II) it is not possible to tell. The premise does not provide sufficient information to confirm or disprove the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In the first statement, we are given the following pieces of information: 1. The man is wearing a purple shirt. 2. The man and woman are sitting together on the subway. 3. The man smiles. In the second statement, we only know that: 1. A man and a woman are using public transportation. The second statement does prove that a man and a woman are present together on public transportation.

A tsunami is an unusual form of wave caused by an infrequent powerful event such as an underwater earthquake or landslide, a meteorite impact, a volcanic eruption or a collapse of land into the sea. These events can temporarily lift or lower the surface of the sea in the affected area, usually by a few feet. The potential energy of the displaced seawater is turned into kinetic energy, creating a shallow wave, a tsunami, radiating outwards at a velocity proportional to the square root of the depth of the water and which therefore travels much faster in the open ocean than on a continental shelf. In the deep open sea, tsunamis have wavelengths of around 80 to 300 miles (130 to 480 km), travel at speeds of over 600 miles per hour (970 km/hr) and usually have a height of less than three feet, so they often pass unnoticed at this stage. In contrast, ocean surface waves caused by winds have wavelengths of a few hundred feet, travel at up to 65 miles per hour (105 km/h) and are up to 45 feet (14 metres) high.A trigger event on the continental shelf may cause a local tsunami on the land side and a distant tsunami that travels out across the ocean. The energy of the wave is dissipated only gradually, but is spread out over the wave front, so as the wave radiates away from the source, the front gets longer and the average energy reduces, so distant shores will, on average, be hit by weaker waves. However, as the speed of the wave is controlled by the water depth, it does not travel at the same speed in all directions, and this affects the direction of the wave front - an effect known as refraction - which can focus the strength of the advancing tsunami on some areas and weaken it in others according to undersea topography. As a tsunami moves into shallower water its speed decreases, its wavelength shortens and its amplitude increases enormously, behaving in the same way as a wind-generated wave in shallow water, but on a vastly greater scale.  Either the trough or the crest of a tsunami can arrive at the coast first....

Answer the following question: What was the last name of the person Cobain told that he should just re-cord the record and do the same thing they did last year?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  After the recording sessions were completed, Nirvana sent unmastered tapes of the album to several individuals, including the president of DGC's parent company Geffen Records Ed Rosenblatt and the group's management company Gold Mountain.  When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, \\"The grown-ups don't like it.\\"  He said he was told his songwriting was \\"not up to par\\", the sound was \\"unlistenable\\", and that there was uncertainty that mainstream radio would welcome the sound of Albini's production.  There were few people at Geffen or Gold Mountain who wanted the band to record with Albini to begin with, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and start all over again.  Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, \\"I should just re-record this record and do the same thing we did last year because we sold out last year—there's no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point.  I can't help myself—I'm just putting out a record I would like to listen to at home.\\"  However, a number of the group's friends liked the album, and by April 1993, Nirvana was intent on releasing In Utero as it was.  According to Cobain, \\"Of course, they want another Nevermind, but I'd rather die than do that.  This is exactly the kind of record I would buy as a fan, that I would enjoy owning.\\"The band members began to have doubts about the record's sound.  During this time, Cobain admitted, \\"The first time I played it at home, I knew there was something wrong.  The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen.  I got no emotion from it, I was just numb.\\"  The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album.  The producer declined; as he recalled, \\"[Cobain] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.'

(Associated Press)      The wreckage of Asiana Flight 214, which crashed on Saturday, July 6, 2013, is seen on a tarmac at San Francisco International Airport in San Francisco, Tuesday, July 9, 2013. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (Associated Press)      In this photo provided by the National Transportation Safety Board, on Tuesday, July 9, 2013, Investigator in Charge Bill English, foreground, and NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman discuss the progress... (Associated Press)      Chairwoman Deborah Hersman also revealed that the pilots told investigators they were relying on automated cockpit equipment to control their speed during final approach, which prompts questions about whether a mistake was made in programming the \\"autothrottle\\" or if the equipment malfunctioned.      The plane crashed when it came in too low and slow for landing. Hersman said the pilot at the controls was only about halfway through his training on the Boeing 777 and was landing that type of aircraft at the San Francisco airport for the first time ever. And the co-pilot was on his first trip as a flight instructor.      Saturday's crash killed two people but remarkably 305 others survived, most with little or no physical injuries. A final determination on the cause of the crash is months away and Hersman cautioned against drawing any conclusions based on the information revealed so far.      Audio recordings show pilots tried to correct the plane's speed and elevation only until seconds before hitting the seawall at the end of the runway, a calamitous impact that sent the fuselage bouncing and skidding across the airfield.      Here is what is known: Seven seconds before impact, someone in the cockpit asked for more speed after apparently noticing that the jet was flying far slower than its recommended landing speed. A few seconds later, the yoke began to vibrate violently, an automatic warning telling the pilot the plane is losing lift and in imminent danger of an aerodynamic stall. One and a half seconds before impact came a command to abort the landing.      The plane's airspeed has emerged as a key question mark in the investigation. All aircraft have minimum safe flying speeds that must be maintained or pilots risk a stall, which robs a plane of the lift it needs to stay airborne. Below those speeds, planes become unmaneuverable.      Because pilots, not the control tower, are responsible for the approach and landing, former NTSB Chairman James Hall said, the cockpit communications will be key to figuring out what went wrong.      \\"Good communication with the flight crew as well as the flight attendants is something I'm sure they're going to look at closely with this event,\\" he said Tuesday. \\"Who was making decisions?\\"      Hall was on the transportation board when a Korean Airlines Boeing 747 crashed in Guam in 1997, an accident investigators blamed in part on an authoritarian cockpit culture that made newer pilots reluctant to challenge captains.      Since then, the industry has adopted broad training and requirements for crew resource management, a communications system or philosophy airline pilots are taught in part so that pilots who not at the controls feel free to voice any safety concerns or correct any unsafe behavior, even if it means challenging a more senior pilot or saying something that might give offense.      If any of the Asiana pilots \\"saw something out of parameters for a safe landing,\\" they were obligated to speak up, said Cass Howell, an associate dean at the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Fla.      \\"There are dozens and dozens of accidents that were preventable had someone been able to speak up when they should have, but they were reluctant to do so for any number of reasons, including looking stupid or offending the captain,\\" said Howell, a former Marine Corps pilot.      There's been no indication, from verbal calls or mechanical issues, that an emergency was ever declared by pilots. Most airlines would require all four pilots to be present for the landing, the time when something is most likely to go wrong, experienced pilots said.      \\"If there are four pilots there, even if you are sitting on a jump seat, that's something you watch, the airspeed and the descent profile,\\" said John Cox, a former US Airways pilot and former Air Line Pilots Association accident investigator.      Investigators want to nail down exactly what all four Asiana pilots were doing at all times.      \\"We're looking at what they were doing, and we want to understand why they were doing it,.\\" Hersman said Monday. \\"We want to understand what they knew and what they understood.\\"      It's unlikely there was a lot of chatter as the plane came in. The Federal Aviation Administration's \\"sterile cockpit\\" rules require pilots to refrain from any unnecessary conversation while the plane is below 10,000 feet so that their attention is focused on taking off or landing. What little conversation takes places is supposed to be necessary to safely completing the task at hand.      Choi Jeong-ho, a senior official for South Korea's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, told reporters in a briefing Tuesday in South Korea that investigators from both countries questioned two of the four Asiana pilots, Lee Gang-guk and Lee Jeong-min, on Monday. They planned to question the other two pilots and air controllers Tuesday.      Choi said recorded conversation between the pilots and air controllers at the San Francisco airport would be investigated, too.      In addition, authorities were reviewing the initial rescue efforts after fire officials acknowledged that one of their trucks might have run over one of the two Chinese teenagers killed in the crash. The students, Wang Linjia and Ye Mengyuan, were part of a larger group headed for a Christian summer camp with dozens of classmates.      Asiana President Yoon Young-doo arrived in San Francisco from South Korea on Tuesday morning, fighting his way through a pack of journalists outside customs.      He said he will look at the efforts of airline employees to help injured passengers and their family members, visit with the NTSB and other organizations to apologize for the crash and try to meet injured passengers.      Yoon said he can't meet with the Asiana pilots because no outside contact with them is allowed until the investigation is completed.      More than 180 people aboard the plane went to hospitals with injuries. But remarkably, more than a third didn't even require hospitalization.      The passengers included 141 Chinese, 77 South Koreans, 64 Americans, three Canadians, three Indians, one Japanese, one Vietnamese and one person from France.      South Korea officials said 39 people remained hospitalized in seven different hospitals in San Francisco.      The flight originated in Shanghai, China, and stopped over in Seoul, South Korea, before making the nearly 11-hour trip to San Francisco.      ___      Associated Press writers Jason Dearen, Terry Collins, Paul Elias, Lisa Leff and Sudhin Thanawala in San Francisco and Hyung-jin Kim in Seoul also contributed to this report. ||||| The pilot who was in charge of the flight that crashed at the San Francisco airport was making his first trip as an instructor, overseeing a pilot who was still in training on the Boeing 777 and at the controls, investigators said Tuesday.      The disclosure came after the National Transportation Safety Board interviewed three of the four pilots who were on Asiana Airlines Flight 214 during Sunday's accident, which killed two teenagers. The fourth, who was in the cabin at the time, was being interviewed Tuesday.      It was also revealed that two flight attendants were ejected from the rear of the plane, but survived, National Transportation Safety Board chairwoman Deborah Hersman said at a Tuesday evening briefing.      There were four pilots on board Flight 214 because it was a trip of more than 10 hours across the Pacific Ocean from Seoul, South Korea.      The pilot at the controls, identified by the airline as Lee Kang-kuk, was still in training on the Boeing 777. He had had 43 hours of flying time in the aircraft, but officials have said he was landing a Triple 7 at San Francisco International for the first time.      He was working with a “training captain” who had logged 3,000 hours on the 777 — but who Hersman said was making his first trip as an instructor.      \\"This was the first time he and the flying pilot had flown together,” Hersman said.      She also said that the pilots told investigators they were relying on automated cockpit equipment to control their speed during final approach, which prompts questions about whether a mistake was made in programming the \\"autothrottle\\" or if the equipment malfunctioned.      The NTSB has not identified human error, mechanical failure or another problem as the cause of the accident, but the three pilots in the cockpit told the NTSB they realized they were coming in too low when they were at 500 feet.      They said they tried to correct it as they lost altitude but could not stop the jetliner's landing gear from clipping the seawall on the way to the runway.      “After the impact, the aircraft ballooned, it yawed left and went into a 360-degree spin,” Hersman said.      Drug and alcohol tests were not given to the pilots after the crash, but only U.S. pilots are required to take them after incidents at American airports, Hersman said.      In a press conference Deborah Hersman of the NTSB details the events from inside the cockpit according to the flight crew during the crash landing of Asiana flight 214.      Details of what happened next illustrated the power and horror of the crash:      Two flight attendants were ejected from tail-less plane at impact and were found off to the side of the runway. They survived but suffered injuries, Hersman said.      At least one evacuation slide deployed inside the cabin, trapping another flight attendant, she confirmed.      An oil tank ruptured and leaked fuel onto the hot No. 2 engine, sparking the fire that left the jet a charred hulk.      Hersman said she walked from the seawall to the plane on Tuesday, following a trail of wreckage that revealed the landing gear struck the seawall before the tail smacked down and was ripped off. Sections of cabin, aircraft parts, galley materials, newspapers, magazines and flooring were found in the debris field.      Two Chinese teenagers on their way to summer camp in the United States were killed — one perhaps run over by a fire engine racing to the scene — and 180 people were injured, with 25 remaining in area hospitals Tuesday, six in critical condition. Remarkably, scores of people walked away unhurt.      The plane came in far too slow — 119 mph just before it crash-landed, about 40 mph slower than touchdown speed. Four seconds before impact, the cockpit was warned of a possible stall by a mechanism that rattles the controls in the pilot’s hand.      The airline’s chief executive, Yoon Young-doo, said earlier Tuesday that the pilots had adequate qualifications, but he said the airline would nonetheless “beef up” its simulation training.      Yoon planned to fly to San Francisco on Tuesday on the same Flight 214.

Deborah Hersman, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board, revealed these and other details during a news conference that included information about the pilots and their flying experience, based on the interviews they've conducted with investigators.      Having finished classroom and simulator training, the \\"flying pilot\\" -- as Hersman referred to him -- was in the piloting portion of his training to fly a Boeing 777 at the time of Saturday's crash.      He had flown 10 legs and had about 35 hours of flying time with the 777, which put him about halfway through the training required by Asiana of 20 legs and 60 flight hours, when the plane went down, Hersman said.      Sitting beside him during Saturday's flight from Seoul to San Francisco was the instructor pilot. The trip across the Pacific was the first time he had been an instructor pilot and the first time he'd traveled with the flying pilot, according to Hersman.

The three pilots in the cockpit -- another was in the cabin -- told investigators they set the \\"auto throttle\\" speed to 137 knots (157 mph), which is the speed it should have been going. Akin to cruise control, auto throttles are used to maintain a plane's speed.      At 200 feet above ground, the instructor pilot said he noted precision approach path indicator lights indicated the giant jet was too low.      It was then \\"he recognized that the auto throttles were not maintaining speed, and he established a go-around attitude,\\" said the NTSB chief. \\"He went to push the throttles forward, but he stated that the other pilot had already (done so).\\"      Hersman cautioned anyone from jumping to conclusions as to whether a mechanical or pilot error is to blame for the crash. She also spoke specifically about the auto throttles, saying investigators were delving into how they were working and how they were used.      But Hersman also stated: \\"The crew is required to maintain a safe aircraft ... One of the very critical things that needs to be monitored on an approach to landing is speed. So we need to understand what was going on in the cockpit, and also what was going on in the aircraft.\\"      2 dead, 182 injured -- including 2 ejected flight attendants      When it departed South Korea, Flight 214 had 307 passengers and crew aboard.      Despite the scale of the wreckage -- a hole burned through much of the cabin's roof and the aircraft's back half lopped off -- 123 walked away.      Others weren't so lucky, most of all the two Chinese teenagers who died in the crash.      Those working on the flight were among the injured. The third pilot in the cockpit cracked a rib. One flight attendant was temporarily trapped by an evacuation chute that opened inside the plane.      JUST WATCHED How Asiana Flight 214 landed Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH Asiana crash: Rescuing the survivors 02:45      Two other flight attendants were not in their seats at the rear of the aircraft when the plane finally ground to a halt, because they were ejected as the aircraft broke up.      \\"They were found down the runway and off to the side of the runway,\\" Hersman said.      Many of those hospitalized have been released. At San Francisco General Hospital, for instance, 50 of the 62 patients are now free to go home.      But others still require care.      Four adults and one child in critical condition are still at San Francisco General suffering from internal bleeding, fractures and spinal cord, abdominal and traumatic brain injuries, according to the hospital.      Crew recall plane being too high, then too low      The \\"flying pilot\\" and \\"instructor pilot\\" who were in the front seat of the cockpit were not among the injured, according to Hersman.      Asiana hired the flying pilot in 1994, after which he reported amassing nearly 10,000 hours of total flight time. That experience included time piloting 737, 747 and A-320 aircraft, and he was a ground school and simulator instructor for the latter model.      The instructor pilot, a South Korean air force veteran with about 13,000 hours of flight experience, recalled Flight 214 being \\"slightly high when they passed 4,000 feet (and) they set vertical speed mode at about 1,500 feet per minute,\\" explained Hersman.      But they ended up coming in low. The third pilot in the cockpit told investigators that, with \\"the nose ... pitched up, ... he could not see the runway,\\" said the NTSB chief.      In the last few hundred feet before touchdown, the crew was making both lateral and vertical adjustments -- meaning they were both trying to move sideways to get toward the runway and adjust their height.      When the aircraft hit, it spun 360 degrees. An oil tank ruptured and leaked fuel onto the plane's right engine, starting a fire.      Eventually, evacuation chutes deployed, and at least seven of the aircraft's eight doors were opened. (An eighth was found on the ground, Hersman explained.)      Very soon after the plane stopped, tending to the wounded and the investigation began.      That probe will continue for months, though authorities have released significant details so far. So much information, in fact, the Air Line Pilots Association, for a second straight day on Tuesday, criticized what it called the \\"NTSB's release of incomplete, out-of-context information\\" that \\"has fueled rampant speculation about the cause of the accident.\\"      The union further questioned whether some tools were available to the crew, claiming, for instance, that the \\"Instrument Landing System, a critical aid to pilots, (was) out of service.\\"      \\"Without the full body of facts surrounding a catastrophic event, partial or incomplete information can lead to erroneous conclusions and, in turn, skew the perception of individuals' behavior,\\" the pilots union said in its Tuesday statement. \\"This could then lead to misguided assessments of the crew's intentions and actions.\\"      Hersman disputed the union's claims earlier Tuesday on CNN, saying the agency believes that transparent release of information is crucial.      \\"We believe that it is always better to put out the correct information and factual information so that bad information is not able to propagate,\\" she said.      Aviation experts say that air crashes often involve several factors, and the San Francisco tragedy appears to be following form. Experience, training, crew actions, airport navigation, and now the possible role of a mechanical system are all in the mix. The NTSB is not expected to render a decision on probable cause for months.      During her news conference later Tuesday, Hersman stressed that \\"there's still a lot of work to be done.\\"      \\"We will not determine probable cause while we are here on scene,\\" she said, adding there's a lot of information to collect and analyze. \\"...I would really encourage all of you to be very cautious about speculating on the cause of the crash.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Asiana Airlines Flight 214 crashed upon landing at San Francisco airport on July 6, 2013, resulting in two deaths and 182 injuries. The investigation into the crash revealed that the pilot at the controls was only about halfway through his training on the Boeing 777, and it was his first time landing that type of aircraft at the San Francisco airport. The co-pilot was also on his first trip as a flight instructor. The pilots stated that they were relying on automated cockpit equipment to control their speed during the final approach, raising questions about whether there was a mistake in programming the autothrottle or if there was an equipment malfunction. The plane crashed when it came in too low and slow for landing. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) urged caution in drawing conclusions based on the information available at the time, as the final determination on the cause of the crash was still months away."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The lyrics of both \\"Son of Three\\" and \\"The She\\" suggest extended road trips with unknown outcomes. The album's next song, \\"Put on a Side\\", has a distinctive bassline and a cramped, repressive feel. Berger wrote that Kim Deal's \\"voice grinds sweetly, weariedly, sloppily inside your brain,\\" as she repeats twelve words over the course of the song: \\"Better I better I stayed up / Better mono, put on a side.\\"An earlier version of \\"Full on Idle\\", Title TK's eighth track, was released on the Amps' Pacer in 1995. In a 1997 interview, Deal expressed an interest in redoing multiple Amps songs, partially because she did not feel Pacer was well recorded. Bryant opined that both versions of \\"Full on Idle\\" sound almost the same, but The Village Voice's Jessica Grose wrote that the Breeders' rendition is noticeably slower. In Cibula's view, this version contains elements of country music, cumbia, and ska.

It was a victory that they just threw away.’’ The day after The Fumble   Freiman  purchased a display ad in the Newark Star-Ledger for 120 that included a post office box urging angry fans to send their tickets in. “We’ll burn them and they’ll play in front of an empty stadium ’’  Freiman  said. “Hundreds of people sent their tickets to be burned ’’  Freiman  said. “I was totally baffled by the reaction. There were a lot of disappointed fans … as I’m sure there are now.’’ The famous airplane banner came the following Sunday.  Freiman  said  he  and another season-ticket holder named Peter Valentine  an attorney  arranged the plane flyover. “[Valentine] knew somebody who had this [plane-rental] service and we decided  ‘Let’s fly this thing around and see what happens ’ ’’  Freiman  recalled. “It caused quite a stir … and it did some good because they got rid of a lot of people  and they still talk about it.’’  Freiman  said  he  later met Young at a luncheon at the old Giants hangout  Manny’s in Moonachie  N.J. “He knew I was the guy who did it  so I wasn’t looked upon too well by Giants management ’’  Freiman  said with a laugh. “I sent the ashes from the ticket burning to Wellington Mara in a urinal  one of those hospital bedpans  and I don’t think they took very kindly to that. It’s probably still sitting up in their offices. Though he said he’s “still an enthusiastic fan ’’  Freiman  said  he  doesn’t get as riled up about the Giants’ failures as  he  once did in  his  season-ticket days. “It doesn’t bother me now the way it bothered me 40 years ago ’’  he  said. “But I know there are other people that are really upset by it now. I can understand how they feel about it.’’ Output:","output":"Part #1: Identify the document.

Write a summary based on this article: Play Facebook      Twitter      Embed FBI: Chattanooga Gunman Was a ‘Homegrown Violent Extremist’ 1:56 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog      At least one military service member opened fire on the Chattanooga gunman in the opening seconds of his attack on a Navy and Marines center last week, an FBI investigator revealed on Wednesday.      The service member got off several rounds but was unable to stop the gunman, who fired at the building, then charged inside and kept shooting, said Ed Reinhold, special agent in charge of the bureau’s Knoxville office.      In a chilling timeline, Reinhold described how the gunman, identified as Muhammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, moved through the building and shot people as he encountered them, then ran out the back and kept firing.      Four Marines and a Navy petty officer were killed before Chattanooga police shot and killed Abdulazeez. Four of the service members died outside, in a motor pool area behind the building, and one died inside, Reinhold said.      It all took less than five minutes.      Reinhold said the FBI was treating the gunman as a “homegrown violent extremist,” and he said investigators believe he had no help in executing the attack. But he said it was too early to determine whether Abdulazeez was radicalized.      Mohammad Youssuf Adbulazeez Hamilton County Sheriffs Office via AP      Investigators have focused on a trip to Jordan last year by Abdulazeez, and an uncle has been detained there, according to his lawyer.      NBC News reported on Tuesday that Abdulazeez downloaded audio recordings of Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical cleric and al Qaeda recruiter killed by an American drone strike in 2011.      A family representative has told NBC News that Abdulazeez had been in a three-day downward spiral before the attack, suffered from depression and had thoughts of suicide.      The Navy and Marines center was the second target of Abdulazeez’s rampage. Minutes earlier, he had unloaded dozens of rounds into the doors of a military recruiting station about seven miles away.      In the chaos at the Navy and Marines center, two service members “attempted to provide cover” and help people escape, Reinhold said.      And a Marine commander, Maj. Gen. Paul W. Brier, said that Marines went room to room to shepherd their fellow service members to safety, and that some “willingly ran back into the fight.”      \\"When history records what happened in Chattanooga last week,\\" he said, \\"it won’t be remembered for the heinous actions of one individual. The legacy of that day is one of valor — a day of American strength.”      Reinhold said that the service member fired on Abdulazeez after he crashed the gates of the Navy and Marines center and got out of his car carrying an assault rifle, a handgun and ammunition.      Investigators will have to wait for autopsy results to determine whether the service member hit Abdulazeez, Reinhold said.

At least one of those two weapons was fired at the gunman.      The military plans to increase security at recruiting stations and reserve centers because of the attack, but those plans do not include arming personnel at off-base facilities like the ones attacked in Chattanooga.      Besides the two weapons belonging to service members, investigators at the scene found two guns belonging to Abdulazeez and one in his car, Reinhold said. All five service members were killed with bullets from the same gun, he said. ||||| CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.

Jackson, the commander of the Navy Southeast Region, speaks at a news conference in Chattanooga, Tenn., on Wednesday, July 22, 2015, about the shootings that left four Marines one sailor... (Associated Press)      The driver blasted his way through that facility for the next three to five minutes, officials said during a Wednesday news conference that provided the most complete account yet of how four Marines and a sailor were killed. The shooter's motives remain unclear to investigators, even nearly a week later.      Muhammad Abdulazeez made his first stop at a military recruiting office about 7 miles away, sending recruiters there scrambling for cover from the hail of gunfire that left the front windows pocked with bullet holes. Abdulazeez never left the driver's seat, staying only briefly before moving to his next target.      After plowing his rented car through the gates, and with Chattanooga Police chasing close behind, the gunman got out of the car and stormed into the building. He was ready for a shootout: Abdulazeez wore a vest with extra ammunition. One gun was found in his vehicle; an assault rifle and a handgun were found on him.      A service member inside the building saw Abdulazeez approaching and fired at him. The gunman shot back and then proceeded inside.      Once inside, he fatally wounded Petty Officer 2nd Class Randall Smith and \\"continued to shoot those he encountered,\\" FBI Knoxville Special Agent in Charge Ed Reinhold said at a news conference.      As police followed the gunshots, he then walked out the back door into a gated motor pool area, where troops tried to scramble over a fence to safety. It was there that the remaining four were killed: Staff Sgt. David Wyatt, Sgt. Carson Holmquist, Gunnery Sgt. Thomas Sullivan and Lance Cpl. Squire Wells.      When the shooting first started, troops inside the building went room to room to rush their colleagues to safety, said Maj. Gen. Paul W. Brier, commanding general of the 4th Marine Division. Then, some rushed back into the fight.      Two guns belonging to service members were recovered at the scene, he said; shots were fired from at least one. It's unclear if the gunman was hit by one of those weapons, Reinhold said. The military will investigate whether the service members were authorized to have those weapons.      In the motor pool area, two Marines tried to \\"provide cover\\" while their comrades tried to escape over the fence, Reinhold said.      Both Reinhold and Brier declined to elaborate further on how the troops engaged Abdulazeez.      \\"I can tell you that our Marines reacted the way you would expect,\\" Brier said.      At one point, Abdulazeez tried to run back into the building. When he did, Chattanooga officers confronted him. A shootout erupted. One police officer was wounded; Abdulazeez was killed.      When asked about the possibility of friendly fire, Reinhold said it appears that all of the victims were killed by the same weapon.      Friends and neighbors recalled a happy, polite young man. But a picture has emerged showing Abdulazeez was troubled in his last days: He abused drugs and alcohol, stared down the possibility of bankruptcy and couldn't find a job. He failed a drug test in 2013, getting him fired from a job at a power plant, which prompted personal writings soon after lamenting what a failure he had been, according to his family.      An uncle in Jordan who agreed to host him in an effort to sober up Abdulazeez now is detained in that country, according to that man's attorney and a government official.      The Jordanian government official, who was not authorized to discuss the case and spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators are trying to learn as much as they can about Abdulazeez's stay there.      Reinhold said only that the FBI would investigate every possibility and every relative, no matter where they are located.      \\"The uncle is a regular person, he has a company, he is a businessman, he has no relation with any militant group or organization,\\" said Abed al-Kader Ahmad al-Khateeb, the attorney representing Asaad Ibrahim Asaad Haj Ali. \\"He cares about his work and his family, and Muhammad is just his relative, the son of his sister. That's it.\\"      It is too early to determine whether Abdulazeez was \\"radicalized\\" before the attacks, Reinhold said. But when asked if Abdulazeez acted alone, Reinhold said he was currently being treated as a \\"homegrown violent extremist.\\"      \\"We believe he acted on his own that day. ... We do not have any indication that anyone else was assisting him on that day.\\"      ___      Loller reported from Nashville.

Q:Article: Playing with toy blocks   may lead to improved language development in young children, a new study reported.      Early childhood is an important period in the development of young minds. The newborn brain grows three times in size between birth and age 2. Scientists have said that certain activities during this important period may promote   healthy development while others may hold it back, and development of memory and language may especially be helped by imaginative play.      After six months, language scores among half of the 175 children aged 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 who were sent plastic blocks were 15 percent higher than a matched group that did not receive the free blocks, according to the study by researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle.     Parents were given ideas about how to help their children play with the blocks, then were told to keep diaries of their children's activities over four days. Finally, all the parents filled out questionnaires that judged their children's vocabulary, grammar, and other language abilities. Study author Dimitri Christakis said unstructured play with blocks motivated children's thinking, memory and physical skills at a time when a child's brain is growing rapidly. \\"They are the foundation of thought and language,\\" he wrote of the skills learned from building blocks. \\"Older children begin to make up stories for these objects .\\" Such play may also take the place of less helpful activities such as watching TV, he said, adding parents ought to have doubts about some toy-makers' words. \\"An increasing number of media-based products are making ungrounded   claims that they can make children smarter, more literate, and more musical,\\" Christakis said.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Original master discs are created by lathe-cutting: a lathe is used to cut a modulated groove into a blank record. The blank records for cutting used to be cooked up, as needed, by the cutting engineer, using what Robert K. Morrison describes as a \\"metallic soap,\\" containing lead litharge, ozokerite, barium sulfate, montan wax, stearin and paraffin, among other ingredients. Cut \\"wax\\" sound discs would be placed in a vacuum chamber and gold-sputtered to make them electrically conductive for use as mandrels in an electroforming bath, where pressing stamper parts were made. Later, the French company Pyral invented a ready-made blank disc having a thin nitro-cellulose lacquer coating (approximately 7 mils thickness on both sides) that was applied to an aluminum substrate. Lacquer cuts result in an immediately playable, or processable, master record. If vinyl pressings are wanted, the still-unplayed sound disc is used as a mandrel for electroforming nickel records that are used for manufacturing pressing stampers. The electroformed nickel records are mechanically separated from their respective mandrels. This is done with relative ease because no actual \\"plating\\" of the mandrel occurs in the type of electrodeposition known as electroforming, unlike with electroplating, in which the adhesion of the new phase of metal is chemical and relatively permanent. The one-molecule-thick coating of silver (that was sprayed onto the processed lacquer sound disc in order to make its surface electrically conductive) reverse-plates onto the nickel record's face. This negative impression disc (having ridges in place of grooves) is known as a nickel master, \\"matrix\\" or \\"father.\\" The \\"father\\" is then used as a mandrel to electroform a positive disc known as a \\"mother\\". Many mothers can be grown on a single \\"father\\" before ridges deteriorate beyond effective use. The \\"mothers\\" are then used as mandrels for electroforming more negative discs known as \\"sons\\". Each \\"mother\\" can be used to make many \\"sons\\" before deteriorating. The \\"sons\\" are then converted into \\"stampers\\" by center-punching a spindle hole (which was lost from the lacquer sound disc during initial electroforming of the \\"father\\"), and by custom-forming the target pressing profile. This allows them to be placed in the dies of the target (make and model) record press and, by center-roughing, to facilitate the adhesion of the label, which gets stuck onto the vinyl pressing without any glue. In this way, several million vinyl discs can be produced from a single lacquer sound disc. When only a few hundred discs are required, instead of electroforming a \\"son\\" (for each side), the \\"father\\" is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper. Production by this latter method, known as the \\"two-step-process\\" (as it does not entail creation of \\"sons\\" but does involve creation of \\"mothers,\\" which are used for test playing and kept as \\"safeties\\" for electroforming future \\"sons\\") is limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings. The pressing count can increase if the stamper holds out and the quality of the vinyl is high. The \\"sons\\" made during a \\"three-step\\" electroforming make better stampers since they don't require silver removal (which reduces some high fidelity because of etching erasing part of the smallest groove modulations) and also because they have a stronger metal structure than \\"fathers\\". Now answer this question: What is the limitation of the two step process?","output":"The limitation of the two-step process is that it can only produce a few hundred vinyl pressings.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what does a cutter do Suggested answer: When a batter is able to hit a cutter pitch, it often results in soft contact and an easy out, due to the pitch's movement keeping the ball away from the bat's sweet spot . Should I validate this answer? The answer is:","output":"The answer provided is partially correct, as it focuses solely on the context of baseball, specifically addressing a cutter pitch. A cutter, in the context of baseball, is a type of pitch that is thrown with a slight side spin that causes the ball to move horizontally across the plate, often away from a right-handed batter if thrown by a right-handed pitcher (and vice versa). By doing so, it effectively keeps the ball away from the bat's sweet spot, making it difficult for the batter to make solid contact with the ball, often resulting in soft contact and an easy out for the fielding team. However, the term \\"cutter\\" can have multiple meanings outside of the baseball context. In general, a cutter refers to someone or something that cuts. Depending on the field or industry, this could mean: 1. A cutting tool or instrument: A cutter can be any tool or device designed to cut or slice through materials such as paper, cardboard, fabric, or metal. Examples include scissors, knives, and box cutters. 2. A person who cuts materials: In certain professions, such as tailoring or woodworking, the term cutter may refer to a skilled worker who specializes in cutting materials according to specific patterns or designs. 3. A ship: A cutter is a type of sailing vessel, often used by naval forces, coast guard, or maritime rescue organizations. Cutters typically have a single mast and are designed for quick maneuverability and deployment. 4. A film or video editor: In the film and television industry, a cutter refers to a person who edits raw footage, assembling it into coherent scenes, sequences, and ultimately, a completed film or program. In conclusion, while the suggested answer is accurate within the specific context of baseball, it does not address the various other meanings and uses of the term \\"cutter\\" in different fields and industries. To validate the answer, it is necessary to determine which context the question refers to, and if needed, provide additional information to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the term."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Additionally, a significant number of people speak English as a native language in countries like Ireland, South Africa, and several Caribbean nations. Here is a more detailed overview of these countries: 1. United Kingdom: English is the official language and the native language of the majority of the population in the United Kingdom, comprising England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. British English, with its distinct accent and vocabulary, is the most widely spoken variant of English in the UK. 2. United States: The United States is the single largest English-speaking country, with the majority of its more than 300 million people considering English as their native language. Several dialects are spoken across the country, including General American, Southern American English, and African American Vernacular English (AAVE). 3. Canada: English is one of the two official languages of Canada, along with French. Approximately 60% of Canadians claim English as their native language, with Canadian English bearing similarities to both British and American English. 4. Australia: English is the official language of Australia, spoken by the vast majority of its population. Australian English, a distinct dialect, is characterized by its unique vocabulary, pronunciation, and slang terms. 5. New Zealand: New Zealand English, a dialect resembling Australian English, is the most widely spoken language in the country. As one of New Zealand's official languages, it is used in government, education, media, and daily communication. 6. Ireland: Although Irish is the official first language of the Republic of Ireland, a significant majority of the population considers English their native language. Irish English, or Hiberno-English, is influenced by the Celtic Irish language and features unique pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar. 7. South Africa: English is one of the 11 official languages in South Africa, with a significant portion of the population using it as a first language. As the main language of business, politics, and media, South African English exhibits variations depending on the region and cultural background of speakers. 8. Caribbean Nations: In countries such as Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, The Bahamas, and many others, English is either the official language or is widely spoken by the majority of the population. Caribbean English dialects, heavily influenced by West African languages, vary across the region and are known for their unique vocabulary, accent, and grammar. While these countries represent the core English-speaking nations, it is important to note that English is spoken as a second language by millions of individuals worldwide due to its role as a global lingua franca and its widespread use in international trade, diplomacy, technology, and entertainment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Given the question: What was the name of the person that conducted the Tchaikovsky symphony?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Between the first and second season of promenade concerts, Wood did his last work in the opera house, conducting Stanford's new opera Shamus O'Brien at the Opera Comique. It ran from March until July 1896, leaving Wood enough time to prepare the second Queen's Hall season, which began at the end of August. The season was so successful that Newman followed it with a winter season of Saturday night promenade concerts, but despite being popular they were not a financial success, and were not repeated in later years. In January 1897 Wood took on the direction of the Queen's Hall's prestigious Saturday afternoon symphony concerts. He continually presented new works by composers of many nationalities, and was particularly known for his skill in Russian music. Sullivan wrote to him in 1898, \\"I have never heard a finer performance in England than that of the Tchaikovsky symphony under your direction last Wednesday\\". Seventy-five years later, Sir Adrian Boult ranked Wood as one of the two greatest Tchaikovsky conductors in his long experience. Wood also successfully challenged the widespread belief that Englishmen were not capable of conducting Wagner. When Wood and the Queen's Hall Orchestra performed at Windsor Castle in November 1898, Queen Victoria chose Tchaikovsky and Wagner for the programme. Wood, who modelled his appearance on Nikisch, took it as a compliment that the queen said to him, \\"Tell me, Mr Wood, are you quite English?\\"In 1898, Wood married one of his singing pupils, Olga Michailoff, a divorcée a few months his senior. Jacobs describes it as \\"a marriage of perfect professional and private harmony\\". As a singer, with Wood as her accompanist, she won praise from the critics. The answer is:","output":"The name of the person that conducted the Tchaikovsky symphony was Wood.  In the given text, the person referred to as conducting the Tchaikovsky symphony is Wood, evident from the line: \\"I have never heard a finer performance in England than that of the Tchaikovsky symphony under your direction last Wednesday\\", which suggests that he conducted the Tchaikovsky symphony.

As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression.

The study finds that a special enzyme  from sea bacteria is helpful to humans. It helps people to get more energy from food. To people's surprise, the enzyme is present only in the Japanese. The Japanese traditionally like to eat food rich in seaweed . And the seaweed is rich in this kind of enzyme. However, the enzyme isn't present in all the Japanese.

It is important to analyze the information that is presented in the sentence: \\"A red-haired person in a green shirt holds an ice cream cone up to the mouth of a man in a red shirt and yellow baseball cap, at the counter of an ice cream store.\\" From this sentence, we can deduce the following key points: 1. There are two people: a red-haired person in a green shirt and a man in a red shirt and yellow baseball cap. 2. They are at the counter of an ice cream store. 3. The red-haired person is holding an ice cream cone up to the mouth of the man. Based on this information, we can visualize the situation. It is evident that the two individuals are interacting and are involved in the ice cream sharing process. However, we cannot conclude that they went to the store together or that they have any relationship beyond this interaction. Since there are no explicit or implicit indications within the sentence that suggest they visited the ice cream store as a pair, we cannot confirm the veracity of \\"The two people went to get ice cream together.\\" For all we know, they could be complete strangers, or perhaps the red-haired person is an employee of the ice cream store assisting a customer. Therefore, the correct answer is that it is not possible to tell whether the two people went to get ice cream together or not, without more information."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If you’d like to be seen by as many passers-by as possible (and consequently receive as many tips as possible), you’ll need to select a location with a high level of pedestrian traffic. Street performers commonly set up along walking malls, large sidewalks and street corners, or in large public parks or gardens. Make sure to avoid areas where “No Busking” signs are prominently posted. You’ll also need to confirm that you can legally perform and solicit money in the area that you select. Generally, busking is legal on public property. Most large cities will have publically available busking guidelines posted online. Consult these, or speak with other buskers to determine where you can and cannot perform. Living statues often work as buskers and rely on their performance as a part of their income. Passing pedestrians who appreciate your costume and talent will often linger and join other individuals to watch you in full statue costume. If you have a hat, bucket, or jar set out, appreciative audience members will drop in money. If you’re only planning to perform as a living statue as a hobby and don’t want to make an income from the work, you don’t need to put out a collections bucket. Resist the urge to jump out at toddlers and young children to startle them. The idea of a large grey statue coming to life and frightening a child could potentially give them nightmares. If you treat your audience members—especially children—with hostility, your audience will soon stop giving you money.

If anybody complains, simply inform them that you are doing this as performance art, not to try to disturb people. Unfortunately, some individuals find it funny to harass, heckle, or otherwise bother and assault living statues. There are various ways that living can statues can discourage hecklers and protect themselves from hasslers. You can try various techniques, and find one that works for you and your costume. For example, when dealing with unruly teenagers or adults, jumping out and scaring them away can be a defense that allows you to stay in character. This applies to any people who try to touch you or generally treat you poorly. If you have tried to discourage hecklers while staying in character, you may need to break character and speak to persistent hecklers. Although performers try to stay in character for a long as possible, it’s worth breaking character to protect your personal space and keep from potentially being assaulted.

As a teenager, and a top member of his high school's wrestling team, he proves himself physically fit and athletic, as well as an academically exceptional student.

He confronts her at the prom and has a dance with her on his last night before leaving.The story then jumps to Kovic's second Vietnam tour in 1968. Now a Marine sergeant and on patrol, his unit massacres a village of Vietnamese citizens, believing them to be enemy combatants. During the retreat, Kovic becomes disoriented and accidentally shoots one of the new arrivals to his platoon, a younger Marine private first class, Wilson, who ends up in the line of fire between sides. Despite the frantic efforts of the Navy Corpsman present who try to save him, Wilson dies from his wounds. Overwhelmed by guilt, Kovic appeals to his executive officer (XO), who merely tells him to forget the incident. The meeting has a negative effect on Ron, who is crushed at being brushed off by his XO.The platoon goes out on another hazardous patrol on January 20.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: Secretary General Robert F. Kennedy and President John F. Kennedy confer during the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. (AP) One of the most significant moments of the presidency of John F. Kennedy, who died 50 years ago today, began when the United States discovered Soviet nuclear missiles on Cuba. The Cuban missile crisis ended peacefully -- the Soviet Union withdrew the warheads in exchange for Kennedy pulling its own missiles from Turkey -- but came awfully close to sparking World War III, a threat that forever changed Americans' perceptions of the Cold War. Historians have long debated how the crisis started, escalated and ended. One aspect of that debate getting a lot of attention on today's anniversary is Kennedy's role. Was it his fault that the world almost ended in nuclear annihilation in the fall of 1962? Here are the cases for, against, half-for-half-against and my own take. The case that it was Kennedy's fault The argument, explained nicely by colleague Dylan Matthews here, is that Kennedy provoked the Soviet Union into putting the missiles in Cuba and then overreacted when he found them. He had sponsored a failed militia invasion of Cuba with the Bay of Pigs debacle, leading Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to fear a fuller U.S. invasion. Kennedy had also put medium-range nuclear weapons in Turkey -- so-called \\"first-strike weapons\\" because they were close enough to Moscow to be used to start a war. Khrushchev, in this view, placed the missiles in Cuba only in response to Kennedy's provocations. The Soviet leader felt compelled to re-balance the playing field with his own potential first-strike weapons; he also wanted to prevent an American invasion of Cuba. Kennedy, Matthews argues, should have understood this and seen the warheads as a reasonable and defensive reaction rather than a provocative step toward war. But Kennedy took it as an implicit act of aggression and responded with the threat of severe escalation, which is how the world almost ended. The case that it wasn't Kennedy's fault Everyone pretty much concedes that the Bay of Pigs was a catastrophe. But it also virtually guaranteed that the United States, badly embarrassed by the incident, would not attempt a similar stunt again, much less the full military invasion that Khrushchev feared. His miscalculation led him to install the nuclear weapons on Cuba -- so did his mistaken belief that Americans would shrug off the warheads as a tit-for-tat response to the U.S. missiles in Turkey. Americans, Kennedy included, actually found it pretty terrifying. The fact that Khrushchev had installed them in total secret deepened fears that these weapons were meant not to protect Havana, but to launch a surprise first-strike against Washington. In this view, the mere chance that the Soviet Union would or could use the Cuba-based missiles to initiate a nuclear war against the United States made them unacceptable. Kennedy responded by publicly raising the pressure with an embargo against Cuba but also quietly offering Moscow concessions should it back down; historian Graham Allison argues that this increased the immediate risk of war but also created the opportunity for the ultimate, peaceful resolution. The case that it was and wasn't Kennedy's fault Both Kennedy and Khrushchev profoundly misunderstood one another's goals and intentions, leading the United States and the Soviet Union to misread the situation and almost walk into a war neither of them wanted. As I wrote last year on the crisis's 50th anniversary, each leader failed to understand the degree to which his counterpart simply saw a different world. At the time, Kennedy and Washington in general were obsessed with the perceived \\"missile gap\\" with the Soviet Union, an arms race they saw as all-important. They worried that, should any one side get too far ahead of the other, that \\"winning\\" side would be tempted to use its advantage to start and \\"win\\" a nuclear war before the other could catch up. So, when Khrushchev put missiles in Cuba, they assumed he was attempting to leap ahead of the United States in the placement of strategic nuclear weapons -- a possible prelude to war. Kennedy was wrong, but Khrushchev was making a similar mistake. He saw the Cold War as driven not primarily by the arms race, an American obsession, but by a grand ideological struggle. Western capitalist imperialism, he believed, sought ever-outward expansion. Kennedy would try again for Cuba before pushing on to the rest of Latin America. American aggression could be deterred only with defensive nuclear weapons. Without U.S. meddling, Khrushchev believed, Soviet-style communism would flow naturally from Cuba to the rest of the region. They were both very wrong, not just about the forces driving the world but about one another's motivations. Each assumed that the other must naturally share his assumptions and his understanding of the world. Which brings me to... The case that it was the Cold War's fault The Cold War had many, many causes, but this mutual misunderstanding was certainly one of them, and not just during the Cuban missile crisis or even Kennedy's tenure. American and Soviet leaders had been misreading one another's intentions, overstating one another's strengths and playing down one another's weaknesses for years before Kennedy took office and would continue to do so for decades after. Those mistakes consistently led both countries to escalate both defensively and offensively and to shape their foreign policies around one another. Ironically, it was Ronald Reagan, the American president we most remember as an anti-Soviet hard-liner, who along with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev would finally break down those mental barriers and attempt to erase the nuclear threat once and for all. Right up until the collapse of the Berlin Wall, much of the White House -- including future CIA director and defense secretary Robert M. Gates -- opposed those talks, warning that Gorbachev was a wolf in sheep's clothing. They were wrong, just as Kennedy had been wrong about Khrushchev's intentions during the Cuban missile crisis and just as Khrushchev had been wrong about Kennedy's intentions toward Cuba. But that was the Cold War -- completely insane.

The first words, in darkness, are \\"What if I shaved my moustache off?\\" Now, we see Marc (Vincent Lindon) shaving, and his girlfriend Agnes (Emmanuelle Devos) responds \\"I don't know you without it\\". She leaves, and he submerges in his bath water for a moment. Only then is there music as background to his shaving the moustache and thoroughly washing it down the drain. Later, there is a ring, and he starts for the door. She comes in asking \\"why didn't you let me in?\\". He waits in vain for her to notice his clean lip. Instead, she says he hasn't commented on her \\"tarty look\\". They drive to their friends Serge (Mathieu Amalric) and Nadia's (Macha Polikarpova) house, and he says to go in while he parks. Even Serge's little girl doesn't notice the missing moustache.Marc overhears Serge call Agnes two-faced, and insists on hearing the story. About 10 years ago, Serge and Agnes (Serge's ex) spent a weekend with two other couples. Serge insisted that it was clear that Agnes arranged to hog the heat, and Agnes still adamantly maintains that she didn't. This suggests Agnes might be a liar. On their drive home, Marc says \\"the joke has gone far enough\\", her pretending not to notice he shaved the moustache. She adamantly insists \\"I don't understand?.Finally in bed she yells \\"You know you've never had a moustache\\". He says she plotted with Serge and Nadia, so she phones them and they deny it.

Please answer the following question: This article: Agent Bart Langner finds Elsa Brinkmann, a would-be actress who looks and sounds just like  Lylah Clare, a flamboyant star who fell to her death in suspicious circumstances 20 years ago. He persuades arrogant director Lewis Zarkan, who had been married to Lylah, to see her. The two men then convince brash studio head Barney Sheean, who is equally struck, to back a picture with her as Lylah.  Besides coping with the tyrannical Zarkan and easy access to alcohol and drugs, Elsa also has to contend with other hazards of Hollywood like malicious journalist Molly Luther and lesbian admirer Rossella. As filming continues, her identification with her rôle gets more intense. She also begins to fall in love with Zarkan, who is happy to sleep with her but his priority is to get his film finished.  By the last day of shooting, her personality seems to have merged with that of the outrageous Lylah whose fatal fall, we learn, was prompted by the jealous Zarkan. To antagonise him, she first lets him find her in bed with the gardener. Then, as he directs her in a circus scene, she leaps to her death from the high-wire. The resulting publicity makes his film a huge success. Tragedy later comes when Zarkan himself is shot and killed by Rossella. A final sequence (in this case, a TV commercial for dog food that interrupts the film itself) suggests that the world of Hollywood is literally one of dog eats dog. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of character with whom Elsa begins to identify with?, what is it ?

It is the only such consolidation in California. The mayor is also the county executive, and the county Board of Supervisors acts as the city council. The government of San Francisco is a charter city and is constituted of two co-equal branches. The executive branch is headed by the mayor and includes other citywide elected and appointed officials as well as the civil service.

By. Daniel Martin. PUBLISHED:. 17:26 EST, 15 April 2012. |. UPDATED:. 02:35 EST, 16 April 2012. MPs are fighting to keep 12 fig trees in their offices, even though it costs the taxpayer £32,500 a year. They say removing the trees from an entrance hall in a parliamentary office block would make the place too hot and noisy. More than £400,000 has been spent on the rental and upkeep of the trees since they were installed 11 years ago. Not giving a fig: Politicians say this entrance at Portcullis House in Westminister would become overheated if the trees were removed. Despite this, MPs are suggesting they be kept – claiming that uprooting the trees would make the glass-roofed atrium of Portcullis House, in Westminster, uncomfortably hot in the summer and would decrease the quality of air that MPs breathe. They also claim that removing the trees would result in ‘higher ambient noise levels’, making it harder for parliamentarians to do their job. In February, John Bercow said he was 'horrified' to discover that parliamentary authorities had signed the contract and called for it to be scrapped. The option of keeping the trees will be discussed at a meeting of Commons officials next week. In February, Speaker John Bercow said he was ‘horrified’ to discover that parliamentary authorities had signed the contract, which began in 2001, and called for it to be scrapped to save taxpayers’ money. But it has now emerged that the House of Commons Commission, which runs the parliamentary estate, is suggesting that getting rid of the trees could be more trouble than it is worth. Instead, they will try to reduce the cost to taxpayers by renegotiating with the rental firm Plant Care. The information was revealed by Anne. Main, Tory MP for St Albans, after she tabled a parliamentary question. to the House of Commons Commission. She. asked whether the body had ‘given consideration to the use of the space. previously occupied by the fig trees in Portcullis House in the event. that the trees are removed’. John. Thurso, a Lib Dem MP who sits on the board of the Commission, replied:. ‘No. The Commission agreed on February 27 that the contract for the hire. and upkeep of trees should be renegotiated at the earliest opportunity. with the aim of reducing the cost significantly. ‘Removal of the trees would lead to a. noticeable increase in noise levels and reduced levels of shade. (especially in summer, where the glass roof would probably lead to a. requirement for additional cooling). The trees also improve air. quality.’ The option of keeping the trees inside Portcullis House, pictured, will be discussed at a meeting of Commons officials next week. Mr Thurso added: ‘The removal of the trees would result in higher ambient noise levels.’ A spokesman for the House of Commons Commission said no decision would be taken on what to do with the trees until next week. A spokesman for the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Despite all the warm words from Westminster, it appears MPs are all talk when it comes to rooting out wasteful spending. ‘Taxpayers are getting a terrible deal from renting this opulent greenery. Parliament should do the right thing and find a more affordable solution. ‘Politicians shouldn’t shy away from ditching wasteful contracts.’ Not giving a fig: Politicians say this entrance would become overheated. Write highlights for this article.","output":"The article reports on the ongoing debate over 12 fig trees installed in the parliamentary office block at Portcullis House, Westminster, which cost taxpayers £32,500 per year. The trees have been rented and maintained since 2001, totaling over £400,000 in expenses thus far. Some MPs argue that removing the trees would lead to increased temperature and noise levels, negatively impacting officials' working conditions. In response to these concerns, the House of Commons Commission plans to discuss a potential reduction to rental costs with the firm Plant Care, instead of removing the trees entirely.

This implies a strategic movement from Verizon to attract Cingular's customers. Justification of steps: 1. I read the entire text to grasp the basic idea. 2. The first part of the text mentions an 'attack' by Verizon Wireless towards Cingular Wireless, and the second part gives context that they are rivals in the cellphone industry. 3. The term 'appeal to rival's subscribers' gives me a clue that Verizon is making efforts to attract the customers of Cingular Wireless. 4. Combining all these clues, I concluded that the text outlines a competitive move by Verizon Wireless aiming to reclaim the top spot in the cellphone industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The authentic historical flag is the Rot-un-Wiss ; Red and White are commonly found on the coat of arms of Alsacian cities (Strasbourg, Mulhouse, Sélestat...) and of many Swiss cites, especially in Basel's region. The German region Hesse uses a flag similar to the Rot-un-Wiss. As it underlines the Germanic roots of the region, it was replaced in 1949 by a new \\"Union jack-like\\" flag representing the union of the two déprtements. It has, however, no real historical relevance. It has been since replaced again by a slightly different one, also representing the two départements.

Some overzealous statesmen have called it a Nazi invention - while its origins date back to the XIth century and the Red and White banner of Gérard de Lorraine (aka. d'Alsace). The Rot-un-Wiss flag is still known as the real historical emblem of the region by most of the population and the departments' parliaments and has been widely used during protests against the creation of a new \\"super-region\\" gathering Champagne-Ardennes, Lorraine and Alsace, namely on Colmar's statue of liberty.

Această libertate reprezintă dreptul fundamental al fiecărui individ de a călători, de a se muta și de a se stabiliza într-un loc fără restricții și limite impuse în mod abuziv. Acest drept nu este absolut, ci trebuie păstrat în echilibru cu drepturile și nevoile celorlalți membri ai societății. Într-o comunitate în care oamenii apreciază și respectă dreptul de a veni și de a pleca, devine crucial să existe înțelegere și colaborare pentru a asigura o dezvoltare armonioasă a societății. Acest lucru înseamnă că, în timp ce fiecare persoană este liberă să își trăiască viața după propriile dorințe, este de asemenea necesar să se țină cont de impactul pe care acțiunile lor îl pot avea asupra celorlalți. De exemplu, în cazul relocărilor sau migrărilor, persoanele care decid să se stabilească într-un alt loc trebuie să aibă grijă de modul în care aleg să se implice în societate și să respecte cultura și valorile locului în care se mută. În acest fel, veți putea să vă integrați cu succes și să luați parte la dezvoltarea armonioasă a comunității.

Interpretation and elimination of options: The first step in answering this question is to understand the meaning of the word \\"thick\\" in this context and to eliminate options that don't fit. The word \\"thick\\" here can be interpreted as referring to a person's body size, which means they have a larger or more substantial build. With this understanding, we can eliminate options that don't relate to a person's size or build, such as \\"sparse,\\" \\"unacquainted,\\" and \\"free-flowing.\\" 2. Synonyms and antonyms: The next step is to identify synonyms and antonyms of \\"thick\\" to get a better understanding of the appropriate answer. \\"Thick\\" in this context means having a wide or substantial build, so an antonym or opposite of that would be having a slim or narrow build. Out of the remaining options, \\"skinny\\" and \\"slender\\" both relate to a person's size, but \\"slender\\" is a better antonym for \\"thick.\\" 3. Connotation and nuance: Although \\"skinny\\" and \\"slender\\" both refer to a slim or narrow build, they have different connotations. \\"Skinny\\" implies that a person is excessively or unhealthily thin, whereas \\"slender\\" suggests a more attractive or healthy slimness. Since the question doesn't specify any negative connotation, a human would prefer the more neutral option, which is \\"slender.\\" 4. Context and common usage: Finally, a human might choose \\"slender\\" based on familiar language patterns and common usage in daily conversations regarding body size and shape descriptions. Considering these factors, a human would choose \\"slender\\" as the answer because it is the most appropriate and accurate opposite of \\"thick\\" in the context of the question."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

When I told Kathy she insisted that i need TWO sheep because ... well , just because . And I obeyed . What type of design does the narrator like ?","output":"The narrator likes folk-art design, which generally refers to a unique and expressive art style that often incorporates traditional cultural elements, symbolism, and craftsmanship. This type of design is typically created by untrained artists, self-taught individuals, or communities with a shared artistic heritage. In the context of the text, the narrator is specifically drawn to folk-art designs that incorporate repurposed materials, such as the sheep sculpture made from an oil can and flattened auto parts. Folk-art design embraces a broad range of art forms and media, encompassing decorative objects, functional items, and even architectural elements. It is valued for its artistic individuality, cultural significance, and the ingenuity with which it utilizes available resources. In this case, the artist's use of recycled materials like an oil can and car parts gives the sculpture a unique, creative, and environmentally conscious appeal. The narrator's appreciation for folk-art design stems from its distinctive and authentic character, which often embodies the spirit and traditions of the artist's community or cultural background. Additionally, folk-art designs offer an alternative to mass-produced and commercial art, providing a more personal, handcrafted touch to the pieces. The fact that the narrator's friend Kathy insisted on having two sheep further highlights the appeal of folk-art designs, as it often presents an opportunity to create unique pairings or groupings of items that reflect the owner’s personal taste and style. In the end, the narrator obeyed Kathy's suggestion, showcasing their love for this type of design and the desire to have a collection that stands out and tells a story of its own."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Most people who sell scrap copper don't rely on finding it by chance. They have sources on which they rely to find a steady supply of copper to sell.  For example, you might be able to set up an agreement with an appliance repair store to pick up damaged goods you know contain copper.  They might be happy to allow you to recycle what would otherwise wind up in a landfill. Cut wires off the outside.  Wire can be snipped off of TV’s and monitors with scissors.  Cut off the plugs from the end to add to your brass pile.  The small black boxes on charging cables can be cut off and put in your transformer pile.  Search inside for insulated wires and connectors.  Thinner insulated copper wires can be found throughout old laptops, VCR’s and DVD players. Take apart desktop computer towers to find the ribbon wire and insulated connectors in the board and hard drive. Large appliances are often sold for steel.  But don’t forget to look inside for copper wiring. Small appliances such as coffee makers, AC units, fans, blenders and toasters may all have copper wiring inside. Small electronics, such as cell phones, cameras and hand-held games are good places to search for copper wire. Electricians scrape up electrical wire for scrap during demolition.  Plumbing materials also contain copper and brass.  Always check with the owner or a construction supervisor before taking copper away from a property that you do not own.  Even if you are being paid to clean a demolition site, that does not give you a claim to the wire or any other materials you find there. Look for old statues or décor.  Old garden gnomes, statues and other lawn ornaments may contain copper.  In addition, sometimes roofing material is made from copper sheeting.  Roofing copper is recyclable and environmentally friendly. Unless you have permission to remove copper from a property you do not own, it is considered theft.  Copper theft has been on the rise since the value of copper started to increase in 2004.  CNBC refers to copper theft as an epidemic that is sweeping the United States.  The FBI states that copper theft is threatening the infrastructure of the United States.  Thieves are targeting electrical sub-stations, cellular towers, telephone land lines, railroads, water wells, construction sites, and vacant homes.  Delivery of electricity, water, telecommunications, transportation and security and emergency services is disrupted.  This poses a threat to public safety and national security.  Businesses are taking steps to protect themselves from copper theft.  They are installing security cameras, securing metals in locked areas, installing alarms, limiting access to buildings and increasing lighting.  In many states, the difference between a misdemeanor and a felony has to do with the value of items stolen.  Since copper is so valuable, copper thieves are often charged with a felony when caught.  Also, since copper thieves can knock out traffic lights or disrupt 911 services, other felony charges such as disrupting public service may be filed. Summary:","output":"To find a steady supply of scrap copper, consider setting up an agreement with appliance repair stores to pick up damaged goods containing copper. You can find copper in wires, TVs, monitors, laptops, VCRs, DVD players, desktop computer towers, large appliances, small appliances, small electronics, and plumbing materials. Electricians and construction sites are also sources, but always ensure you have permission from the owner or a supervisor to retrieve copper from these locations. Copper theft is a serious issue, so it is essential to avoid taking copper from properties you do not own without permission.

Cobb) , the corrupt boss of the dockers union. He witnesses a murder by a couple of Johnny's thugs, but won't betray Friendly, who is both his brother's (Rod Steiger) boss and a long-time friend of his family.What he sees at the docks repulses Terry. In an economically depressed environment in which many are out of work, more gather by the docks each morning hoping to secure work for that day than can be hired, placing Johnny Friendly and his forces in a position to exploit them. Those who complain of the working conditions or wages one day don't work the next day, or are placed in harm's way. Consequently, most tolerate being abused.After befriending both the sister (Eva Marie Saint) of the murdered man and the local priest (Karle Malden), Terry gradually becomes a man of deeper morality, and starts to speak of acts against Friendly, who will soon go on trial. Terry finds his breaking point when his brother is murdered by Friendly's thugs, and causes him to entertain thoughts of testifying against Friendly.

I read this background article the other day: During May, June, and July, the Northern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere.  I am facing a new situation today: Stan moved from the US to Australia, and he still gets confused because of the seasons in the southern hemisphere and the fact that they use the same calendar as the rest of the world.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which month is colder in the northern hemisphere, July or January? A:","output":"Based on the information from the background article, January is colder in the Northern Hemisphere. The article mentions that during May, June and July, the Northern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. This is due to Earth's axial tilt, which causes the sun to be higher in the sky during these months, increasing the solar flux and thus, warming the climate. As a result, these months are the summer season in the Northern Hemisphere, where temperatures are typically warmer. In contrast, the article points out that the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun more directly during November, December, and January. This implies that in these months, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun, receiving less direct sunlight. As a result, these are the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere, and the temperatures are typically colder. The calendar works the same in both hemispheres. However, the seasons are reversed due to differences in sunlight exposure caused by the Earth's axial tilt. This means that when it's winter in one hemisphere, it's summer in the other, and vice versa. So, if Stan moved from the US (located in the Northern Hemisphere) to Australia (in the Southern Hemisphere), he would experience winter during June, July, and August instead of December, January, and February, as he would have in the US. Conversely, during December, January, and February - typically the coldest months in the US - he would experience summer in Australia. Therefore, if we stick strictly to the question about which month is colder in the northern hemisphere, July or January, the correct answer would be January. July is a summer month in the Northern Hemisphere, thus typically seeing warmer temperatures, whereas January is a winter month and is typically colder."},{"instruction":"\\"Helge Andreas Norbakken\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Question: After Greeks from different areas, as opposed to those from Mother Cities began colonizing, what happened to the Greek language abroad. Context: After Alexander the Great's ventures in the Persian Empire, Hellenistic kingdoms were established throughout south-west Asia (Seleucid Empire, Kingdom of Pergamon), north-east Africa (Ptolemaic Kingdom) and South Asia (Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, Indo-Greek Kingdom). This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan. Equally, however, these new kingdoms were influenced by the indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the Ancient Greek world with that of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia, and a departure from earlier Greek attitudes towards \\"barbarian\\" cultures. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th–6th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. Those new cities were composed of Greek colonists who came from different parts of the Greek world, and not, as before, from a specific \\"mother city\\". The main cultural centers expanded from mainland Greece to Pergamon, Rhodes, and new Greek colonies such as Seleucia, Antioch, Alexandria and Ai-Khanoum. This mixture of Greek-speakers gave birth to a common Attic-based dialect, known as Koine Greek, which became the lingua franca through the Hellenistic world.

Q: [[27, -6, 97, -49, 77, -82, -77], [-86, -64, -67]] A:","output":"Task explanation: The task asks to sum up the values at each position from every inner list. The total sum will be put as an element of the answer list. If a list is shorter than others, missing values are considered 0. The output list's length should be the same as the longest inner list in the given data. Guidelines:  1. Identify the longest list among all the inner list. 2. Then iterate from the first element to the last element of the longest list. 3. In each iteration, add the value of each inner list's corresponding position. 4. If an inner list is shorter and doesn't have a value at that position, consider it 0. 5. The sum then is added to the output list. 6. Repeat the process until the end of the longest list. Solution: Let's work with the given example: [[27, -6, 97, -49, 77, -82, -77], [-86, -64, -67]]. The longest list is [27, -6, 97, -49, 77, -82, -77] with 7 elements. Start iterating: For the 1st position: sum of (27 & -86), -59 For the 2nd position: sum of (-6 & -64), -70 For the 3rd position: there's no 3rd element in the second list, so it's considered as 0. Hence sum of (97 & 0), 97 The same process 0 summing will be used for the 4th to the 7th positions. For the 4th position: sum of (-49 & 0), -49 For the 5th position: sum of (77 & 0), 77 For the 6th position: sum of (-82 & 0), -82 For the 7th position: sum of (-77 & 0), -77 Using these sums, we get the final summed list:  [-59, -70, 97, -49, 77, -82, -77]"},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

She thinks the  Options: 1). dolls will appreciate in value.; 2). clothes will appreciate in value.;","output":"Margaret prefers to spend her money on dolls, rather than clothes. She believes that dolls have a higher potential to appreciate in value compared to clothing items. Margaret has a set reasoning behind this belief, as she takes various factors into consideration. Firstly, Margaret understands that dolls, especially collectible or limited edition ones, can become rare and valuable over time as collectors seek to complete their collections. The demand for these specific dolls often increases, and as supply remains limited, their value appreciates. She has come to learn about the thriving community of doll collectors who are willing to pay premium prices to own rare and hard-to-find dolls, which further reinforces her idea of the potential appreciation in the value of dolls. Additionally, Margaret has seen some dolls become pop culture icons, such as Barbie dolls or American Girl dolls. These dolls are often rebranded, re-released, and reimagined over the years. This can lead to the original releases becoming more valuable due to nostalgia and historical significance. As people seek to reminisce about their childhood memories or capture a piece of pop culture history, the value of these dolls can increase substantially. Moreover, Margaret appreciates the artistic value that comes with some dolls. Dolls that are handmade or have intricate crafting can become valuable for the craftsmanship and skill behind their creation. These dolls can become miniature works of art that people are willing to pay a premium for, further adding to their potential appreciation in value. On the other hand, Margaret thinks that clothes are not likely to appreciate in value at the same rate as dolls. While some designer pieces and high-end fashion items can become coveted over time, the majority of clothing items face depreciation due to wear and tear and changes in fashion trends. Also, clothes are produced in larger quantities and are not likely to hold the same exclusivity factor that dolls can possess. Furthermore, clothes are not as easily preserved compared to dolls. Dolls can be stored in display cases for protection and retain their quality, but clothing items often deteriorate over time due to environmental factors, even when stored properly. This adds to the likelihood of depreciation in the value of clothes. In conclusion, Margaret prefers to invest her money in dolls over clothes as she perceives dolls to have a greater potential for appreciation in value. Dolls can become collectible items, pop culture icons, and even showcase artistic value, making them a more lucrative investment opportunity in comparison to clothing items. Margaret's perspective is shaped by her understanding of the market demands, rarity, and longevity of dolls, which she believes surpasses the potential for appreciation in the value of most clothes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Why were Greek texts important?\\"  Context: \\"Despite these crises, the 14th century was also a time of great progress in the arts and sciences. Following a renewed interest in ancient Greek and Roman texts that took root in the High Middle Ages, the Italian Renaissance began. The absorption of Latin texts had started before the Renaissance of the 12th century through contact with Arabs during the Crusades, but the availability of important Greek texts accelerated with the capture of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks, when many Byzantine scholars had to seek refuge in the West, particularly Italy.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Greek texts were important for several reasons, particularly during the 14th century and the Italian Renaissance, which was a period of significant progress in the arts, sciences, and intellectual development. The primary reasons behind the significance of Greek texts include: 1. Preservation of knowledge: Ancient Greek texts contained a wealth of knowledge in various fields, including philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and literature. The revival of interests in these texts led to the preservation and dissemination of this knowledge, which had been partly lost during the Middle Ages in Western Europe. 2. Influence on philosophical thinking: The works of Greek philosophers, such as Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates, played a crucial role in shaping the intellectual landscape of Europe during the Renaissance. These texts provided new ideas and perspectives on ethics, metaphysics, politics, and aesthetics, influencing the development of modern Western philosophy. 3. Advancement of scientific knowledge: Greek texts contained pioneering ideas in mathematics, physics, and biology, which laid the foundation for modern scientific inquiry. Figures like Euclid, Archimedes, and Hippocrates had a profound impact on the development of scientific thought during the Renaissance. 4. Inspiration for artistic expression: Greek literature, particularly the works of poets like Homer and playwrights such as Sophocles, Euripides, and Aristophanes, fueled the imagination of Renaissance artists and writers and contributed to the development of new literary and artistic styles. 5. Promotion of Humanism: Humanism, a key intellectual movement during the Renaissance, placed a strong emphasis on the study of classical Greek and Roman texts. Humanists believed in the inherent value of human knowledge, reason, and creativity, and the rediscovery of Greek texts helped shape this worldview. The focus on human excellence, reason, and potential drove many Renaissance thinkers to challenge established norms and explore new ideas. 6. Cultural exchange: As Byzantine scholars sought refuge in the West after the fall of Constantinople, they brought with them Greek texts and knowledge, fostering an intellectual exchange between the Eastern and Western worlds. This cross-cultural interaction spurred renewed interest in antiquity and stimulated growth in various disciplines. In summary, Greek texts were important because they preserved valuable knowledge, inspired innovative thinking, and nurtured the spirits of inquiry and creativity that characterized the Italian Renaissance. By reconnecting Western Europe with its classical roots, Greek texts contributed significantly to the intellectual, scientific, and artistic advancements of the period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Your task is to generate label \\"yes\\" if title is right for article, otherwise generate \\"no\\". Abstract: Bacteria encode a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein (SSB) crucial for genome maintenance. In Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus pneumoniae, an alternative SSB, SsbB, is expressed uniquely during competence for genetic transformation, but its precise role has been disappointingly obscure. Here, we report our investigations involving comparison of a null mutant (ssbB(-)) and a C-ter truncation (ssbBΔ7) of SsbB of S. pneumoniae, the latter constructed because SSBs' acidic tail has emerged as a key site for interactions with partner proteins. We provide evidence that SsbB directly protects internalized ssDNA. We show that SsbB is highly abundant, potentially allowing the binding of ~1.15 Mb ssDNA (half a genome equivalent); that it participates in the processing of ssDNA into recombinants; and that, at high DNA concentration, it is of crucial importance for chromosomal transformation whilst antagonizing plasmid transformation. While the latter observation explains a long-standing observation that plasmid transformation is very inefficient in S. pneumoniae (compared to chromosomal transformation), the former supports our previous suggestion that SsbB creates a reservoir of ssDNA, allowing successive recombination cycles. SsbBΔ7 fulfils the reservoir function, suggesting that SsbB C-ter is not necessary for processing protein(s) to access stored ssDNA. We propose that the evolutionary raison d'être of SsbB and its abundance is maintenance of this reservoir, which contributes to the genetic plasticity of S. pneumoniae by increasing the likelihood of multiple transformation events in the same cell..

Its Solar Impulse vehicle's batteries were damaged on the last leg of the journey from Japan to Hawaii and will take several months to repair. The aircraft will be kept at its Pacific stop-over at Kalaeloa airport while the maintenance is undertaken. Once the work is done there will be some test flights before the global quest resumes in 2016, the team says. That is likely to be in April, and would see Solar Impulse fly from Hawaii to the West Coast of the US. It should then have a sizeable weather window to try to cross America, the Atlantic, and make its way back to Abu Dhabi, UAE, where the circumnavigation began in March this year. The suspension will be a disappointment but the project has already met a number of its key objectives. Pilot Andre Borschberg smashed aviation records when he steered Solar Impulse from Nagoya to Kalaeloa at the beginning of the month. Flying just on the power of the Sun, he completed the 7,200km in 118 hours. Not only did this set several new marks for manned solar aeroplanes, but it surpassed with ease the absolute aviation record for the longest duration solo flight in an un-refuelled vehicle. However, in achieving this mammoth feat, Mr Borschberg's plane experienced damaging overheating in its lithium-ion battery system. Although the battery units performed as expected, they had too much insulation around them, making temperature management very difficult. Engineers on the project have not been able to make the quick repairs that might allow Solar Impulse to have a crack at completing the round-the-world journey this year.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Kim Davis, the county clerk, to remain in Kentucky jail But Davis' lawyer told U.S. District Judge David Bunning that his client would not allow her deputies to issue the licenses. Davis was not in the courtroom for the second session. She was in a hallway outside. \\"We cannot represent to the court that she would allow licenses to be issued,\\" attorney Mat Staver said. Kim Davis case: Some GOP candidates rally around her Staver later told CNN's \\"The Lead with Jake Tapper\\" that Davis would issue licenses if her name and title were not on them. \\"Because that in her understanding and mind is authorizing something that is contrary to her Christian values and convictions,\\" he said. \\"That's where the conscience rub is.\\" Earlier Thursday, Bunning remanded Davis into the custody of U.S. marshals for refusing to heed a U.S. Supreme Court order legalizing same-sex marriage, saying she would remain in jail until she complies with the ruling. Bunning then asked Davis' six deputy clerks whether they would issue the licenses, and despite some of them holding the same religious beliefs as Davis, five told Bunning they would issue the licenses. The sixth -- Davis' son, Nathan -- didn't answer. Gov. Steve Beshear said the judge's decision \\"speaks for itself.\\" \\"The future of the Rowan County Clerk continues to be a matter between her and the courts. Deputy clerks have said they will commence issuing marriage licenses beginning (Friday),\\" he said. \\"It appears that the citizens of Rowan County will now have access to all the services from the clerk's office to which they are entitled.\\" The governor said he had no authority to use an executive order to relieve a county clerk of his or her duty. During Davis' hearing, April Miller told the court that the clerk had denied her a marriage license three times, and when Davis took the stand to deliver her at-times emotional testimony, she explained that she could not issue the licenses because of her religious beliefs. \\"You can't be separated from something that's in your heart and in your soul,\\" she told the judge, according to CNN affiliate WKYT-TV. American Civil liberties Union attorneys argued in a motion filed Monday that Davis \\"continues to collect compensation from the Commonwealth for duties she fails to perform.\\" They said they didn't want her to be jailed as punishment, but rather, the attorneys asked the court to \\"impose financial penalties sufficiently serious and increasingly onerous\\" to make her comply with the court order. Bunning, however, apparently felt she deserved jail time, but he also told Davis she could end her incarceration by complying with the Supreme Court order and telling her deputy clerks to do the same. He said he didn't believe fining Davis would convince her to comply with the high court ruling, especially considering that Davis had testified earlier that her supporters are raising funds for her and calling her office to offer financial support, WKYT reported. Bunning said he, too, was religious, but he explained that when he took his oath to become a judge, that oath trumped his personal beliefs, the station reported. \\"Her good faith belief is simply not a viable defense,\\" Bunning said. Davis thanked the judge for his ruling, according to WKYT. She was not placed in handcuffs, but a U.S. marshal led her out of the courtroom. Celebrations and protests erupted outside the courthouse in Ashland when those who attended the hearing exited the courtroom with news of the decision. Chants of \\"Love won! Love won!\\" filled the air. Staver, founder of Liberty Counsel, which represented Davis, said he was \\"stunned\\" by the judge's ruling. \\"Knowing Kim Davis and her strong Christian resolve and convictions, she may be jailed behind bars, but her conscience remains free,\\" he told CNN. He said his client had became a different person 4 1/2 years ago after attending a church service that affected her beliefs. \\"That is the reason why her conscience is so strong,\\" he said. \\"She loves her Lord, she loves God, and she can't disobey her conscience or be disobedient.\\" Davis, an Apostolic Christian who says she has a sincere religious objection to same-sex marriage, has refused to issue any marriage licenses since the Supreme Court decision in June legalizing same-sex marriage. In court documents filed Wednesday, her attorneys argue that she shouldn't be held in contempt. Instead, they argued, there are alternatives that would allow couples to get marriage licenses in Rowan County without going against Davis' religious beliefs. Among the options they offered were allowing other officials to issue marriage licenses in the county, distributing marriage licenses at the state level or changing marriage license forms to remove Davis' name. A seat inside the courtroom was a hot ticket. Before the session began, more than 100 people were turned away from Bunning's courtroom, which holds 300 people. A federal law enforcement source told CNN that because of the controversy surrounding the case, Bunning was provided with a security escort on his way into work. A large crowd, leaning mostly in support of Davis, gathered outside the courthouse before the hearing, many carrying signs. \\"Jesus Saves\\" read one, \\"Homo sex is sin,\\" read another, while one sign pointed passers-by to the Bible's Acts 5:29, which quotes Peter and other apostles saying, \\"We must obey God rather than human beings!\\" Lana Bailey of Worthington, about a 20-minute drive northwest of Ashland, brought signs as well, both of which seemed to address Davis: \\"My gay friends pay taxes which helps pay you... right??\\" and \\"Respect the law; do your job!\\" \\"I'm here to support equal rights for all,\\" she said. \\"It's just called respect. I don't understand why we're having this. Why are we spending money on this? ... If you can't do your job then you need to step down. You need to resign.\\" Jason Porter, a pastor at Ashland's Gospel Light Baptist Church, spoke for the other side and said he wasn't at the courthouse \\"to bash people's decisions and lifestyles,\\" but he worried that if people were allowed to continue doing whatever they want to do, \\"the floodgates will open to other areas of polygamy.\\" He did not elaborate on how same-sex marriage was akin to polygamy, which is the act of having multiple spouses. Polygamy is illegal in every state. Echoing those who cited Acts 5:29, he said he felt Davis had a right to refuse to issue the marriage license and, waving his Bible, he told CNN he bore no hatred toward gay couples and is merely standing \\"for the truths of my God's word.\\" \\"I just know the destruction that this brings. As a pastor, I see the background. I see the broken families. I see the AIDS. I see the folks dying of diseases and the brokenness of relationships,\\" he said. Two other county clerks in Kentucky are also refusing to issue same-sex marriage licenses, according to a statement on Beshear's website. Bunning ordered Davis to resume the issuing of marriage licenses on August 12. Monday night, the Supreme Court denied an emergency application from Davis, who asked that Bunning's order be put on hold pending appeal. In a statement released Tuesday, Davis, a Democrat, said she has received death threats but intends to continue to serve as the county clerk -- a position she was elected to fill in November. In court papers, attorneys for Davis argued that she is unable to comply with the court orders because issuing same-sex marriage licenses \\"irreparably and irreversibly violates her conscience.\\" Finding her in contempt of court, they argued in the motion filed Wednesday, also would \\"substantially burden Davis' religious exercise.\\" Related: Court clerk who won't issue marriage licenses has been divorced three times But some scoff at the clerk, suggesting she's a hypocrite because she's been divorced three times. Davis said she's a different person now since becoming a Christian four years ago. \\"I am not perfect,\\" she said in a statement. \\"No one is. But I am forgiven.\\" The ACLU attorneys, who represent two same-sex couples and two opposite-sex couples who want to get married in Rowan County, argued that Davis has no legal basis to avoid performing her duties as a government clerk. And a federal prosecutor said it's time for Davis and her county to comply. \\"Government officials are free to disagree with the law, but not disobey it,\\" U.S. Attorney Kerry B. Harvey said in a statement. \\"The County Clerk has presented her position through the federal court system, all of the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. It is time for the Clerk and the County to follow the law.\\" CNN's Sonia Moghe, Alexandra Field, Ariane de Vogue and Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.","output":"Kim Davis, a county clerk, has been sent to jail because she refused to follow a new law that says it is okay for people of the same sex to get married. She believes it is wrong due to her religious beliefs. Her lawyers said she would be okay with giving out marriage licenses if her name was not on them. As of now, she will stay in jail until she agrees to follow the law."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Before I give Spike Lee's mess of a film SUMMER OF SAM a well-deserved thrashing, I would like to make one thing clear. I do not revile this film simply for its abundance of sleazy and unpleasant images. What makes this film so unwatchable is the fact that Lee seems to believe that SUMMER OF SAM should be taken seriously as a socially enlightening drama. The crime caper films of Quentin Tarantino, for example, are filled with violence, profanity, and other sleaze, but are nonetheless highly watchable because Tarantino does not attempt to pass these films off as socially redeeming works of art. He knows that such films are for entertainment value only. On the other hand, serious dramas such as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and SCHINDLER'S LIST are often unpleasant to watch, but the unpleasantness serves to develop the film's plot and characters, with the end goal of getting the audience emotionally involved with the story and characters onscreen. SUMMER OF SAM, unfortunately, merely wallows in its own sensationalism and sleaze, while believing that it is serving as social commentary, much like other trash epics . SUMMER OF SAM does not serve as a serious drama because its characters are merely cardboard-cutout stereotypes. Its plot purports to show the emotional impact of the hysteria over the Son of Sam murders on the residents of the predominately Italian-American north Bronx neighborhood where the murders ocurred. However, instead of of presenting the locals as a diverse mix of personalities, Lee simply wheels out every negative Italian stereotype imaginable. The men are ignorant, lazy, oversexed goombahs. The women are split between weak, complacent \\"good girls\\" (Mira Sorvino's Dionna) and promiscuous \\"bad girls\\" (Jennifer Esposito's Ruby). Lee seems to vindictively wants to \\"payback\\" Hollywood for their years of negative African-American stereotyping by wheeling out stereotypes of his own, and few critics seem to care. If Martin Scorsese, for example, presented residents of an African-American neighborhood as a bunch of Amos 'n Andy and Aunt Jemima stereotypes, critics would rightfully condemn such blatant stereotyping. More importantly, one-dimensional, stereotypical characters undermine any film that attempts to be a serious social commentary. Without exception, the cast of SUMMER OF SAM is excellent. However, the acting, for the most part, is uninspired. The cast is either just going through the motions, or they have little to work with scriptwise. Additionally, there is notable miscasting. Comedian John Leguizamo is very talented, but his Vinny character seems to be a stale, comedic impersonation of John Travolta's Tony Manero from SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER. And Michael Badalucco, a perennial \\"nice guy\\" actor, is badly miscast as serial killer David Berkowitz, coming across as funny rather than frightening. The only performance worth paying attention to is Adrien Brody as the troubled, but sincere, neighborhood misfit Ritchie. The Brody performance and the typically stylish Lee cinematography are this film's only virtues. *1/2 out of **** How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is highly negative and critical towards the film SUMMER OF SAM. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with various aspects of the movie, including its perceived misuse of stereotypes, weak character development, and a sense of misplaced seriousness in its approach to social commentary. This negative sentiment is only briefly interrupted by the reviewer's appreciation for Adrien Brody's performance and the film's cinematography."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a question about the following article: At home for the first time in three weeks, the Patriots, looking to remain unbeaten, faced off against the 4-2 Redskins. After spending the first seven weeks of the season on the Physically Unable to Perform list, defensive end Richard Seymour was activated for the game, but did not start. Following a Redskins punt, in their first possession of the game, the Patriots drove 90&#160;yards over more than 7&#160;minutes, finishing the drive with a 3-yard Brady rushing touchdown, continuing a season-long opening drive scoring streak. The teams exchanged punts into the second quarter, before a 67-yard Patriots drive was capped off with a 2-yard touchdown reception by Vrabel, his second for the season and the tenth of his career (including playoffs). On the Redskins' ensuing possession, Warren recovered a Vrabel strip-sack of Jason Campbell at the Redskins' 21-yard line, setting up a 36-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Redskins turned the ball over again on their next possession on a Samuel interception, only to regain it on the next play after Brady was strip-sacked by Phillip Daniels at the Patriots' 40-yard line. The string of turnovers continued as the Redskins drove 20&#160;yards before another Vrabel strip-sack of Campbell was again recovered by Warren. With less than 2&#160;minutes remaining in the first half, the Patriots drove 73&#160;yards, and on a fake spike play from the Redskins' 6-yard line, increased their lead to 24-0 on a touchdown catch by Moss from Brady. That touchdown pass was Brady's 29th of the season, eclipsing his career high set in 2004 and 2002, but with it only being week 8, accomplished this in only playing through the first eight of 16 games. On the opening drive of the second half, an 85-yard Patriots drive ended in another Brady touchdown run, this one from 2&#160;yards out. The Redskins committed their fourth turnover of the game on their next possession, as Vrabel strip-sacked Campbell for the third time in the game; this time Colvin recovered the fumble and returned it 11&#160;yards for a touchdown to increase the Patriots' lead to 38-0. The Redskins managed to reach the Patriots' 13-yard line on their next drive, but on fourth down, the Redskins could not convert and turned the ball over again. The Patriots began their next drive where they left off, going 88&#160;yards on a 14-play drive that spanned into the fourth quarter. It was finished on a 2-yard touchdown reception by Welker that grew the Patriots lead to 45-0. Following a Redskins punt, on the Patriots' next series, Cassel replaced Brady. A 21-yard pass from Cassel to Gaffney gave the Patriots their 33rd first down of the game, a new single-game franchise record. Two plays later, Cassel ran it in for a touchdown from 15&#160;yards out, and the first rushing touchdown of his career, increasing the Patriots' lead to 52-0; the touchdown was the longest rushing touchdown by a Patriots quarterback in more than 20 years. The Redskins then drove 63&#160;yards and scored their only points of the game on a 15-yard Chris Cooley touchdown reception. Third-string quarterback Matt Gutierrez replaced Cassel on the next possession, a three-and-out. The Redskins then punted back to the Patriots to end the game. The Patriots' 52-7 win gave them an 8-0 record heading into a Week 9 matchup against the 7-0 Colts.  It also made Brady only the second quarterback to defeat the other 31 teams at least once; the Colts' Peyton Manning was the first to accomplish the feat, having done so earlier that day.","output":"In the article detailing the Patriots' home game after three weeks away, in which they aimed to maintain their unbeaten record against the 4-2 Redskins, how did the activation of defensive end Richard Seymour, who had spent the first seven weeks on the Physically Unable to Perform list, impact the game?

Construction workers were trying to lower the Bay Crane Company crawler crane and secure it as 25 mph winds whipped through the area about 8:24 a.m., when it flipped over, sending its 565-foot-long arm careening onto Worth Street stretching from West Broadway to Church Street, officials said.      Harvard-educated trader David Wichs, 38, (inset) was crushed to death by a falling crane Friday morning. (Photo by DNAinfo/Megan Cerullo/Facebook)      Crews had been directing pedestrian and road traffic away from Worth Street before the crane fell, officials said.      Eyewitness Tony Menendez, a Telx employee at 60 Hudson St., watched the operator lower the boom amid the intensifying weather conditions, he said.      \\"It started getting windy,\\" Menendez said.      \\"The crane was coming down.

Two guys ran to the right and one guy ran to the left. I believe who ran to the left was killed.\\"      The toppling crane slammed into some nearby buildings and shook others when it hit the ground, neighbors said.      Menendez said that police frantically tried to pull the man out from under the crumpled equipment.      Officials confirmed that one man, David Wichs, 38, who reports said emigrated from Prague and lived on the Upper West Side, was killed on the street.      Sergeants Benevolent Association Vice President Bob Ganley, whose office window overlooks the street, saw the boom drop. He and two coworkers raced to the scene and found a man sitting in a crushed car. Miraculously, the man was unharmed, he said.      They found Wichs laying on the side walk and put a blanket over him.      The impact of the equipment shook the neighborhood.      \\"It sounded like a bomb,\\" said Mark Melville, a construction worker at a nearby site.      \\"I look over and I see the bricks were flying up the block,\\" Melville added.      Falling debris injured another three people, officials said. Two people — a 45-year-old woman, a 73-year-old man — were treated for serious injuries at Bellevue while a another only suffered minor injuries, officials said.      \\"Our hearts go out to the families of the individual who was lost and all those who were injured,\\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said during a press conference Friday morning.      Wichs immigrated to the United States as a teen, later earned a mathematics degree from Harvard and was worked at the financial trading firm Tower Research Capital, according to the Associated Press.      He graduated from Harvard, where he was co-chairman of the campus Hillel group, in 2000, the university said.      Wichs was \\"the most brilliant person ever,\\" his sister-in-law told the wire service.      Menendez said the crane operator survived the crash.      \\"It's a miracle there wasn't more of an impact. Thank God we didn't have more injuries and we didn't lose more people,\\" de Blasio said.      Officials with both Galasso Trucking, which operates the crane, and the Bay Crane Company, which owns it, declined to comment.      \\"I believe they were doing the right thing bringing it down, but somebody should have looked at the weather last night,\\" Menendez said.      NYPD detectives were interviewing the crane's operator to determine if any criminality was involved in the deadly collapse, police officials said.      The crane had been replacing air conditioners and generators atop 60 Hudson St., the former Western Union headquarters, officials said.      The crane was erected a week before and crews had added an extension on Thursday to better reach the roof, officials said. The Department of Buildings had visited the site that day and approved the work that was being done there, officials said.      A woman who lives nearby said she saw work men putting plywood in front of the crane's tracks to help it gain traction.      \\"They inched the crane forward. They couldn't move it so they put large pieces of plywood, they put them in front of each of the two treads — 3 or 4 sheets,\\" said artist Vivien Collens, who watched the work from her fourth floor window.      \\"[He] started move it forward,\\" she said. \\"The moment after he started to move it forward, it slipped and somersaulted.

A crane collapsed in Lower Manhattan Friday morning, crushing a row of parked cars and leaving one person dead and two others seriously hurt. A fourth victim suffered only minor injuries.The massive crane came crashing down at Worth and Church streets in TriBeCa just before 8:30 a.m., clipping at least one building in the process.The construction crane, owned by Bay Crane and operated by Galasso Trucking and Rigging, was previously positioned as high as 20 stories and now stretches across several blocks. David Wichs -- a 38-year-old pedestrian who lives on the Upper West Side -- was pronounced dead at the scene , while two others were rescued from vehicles before being rushed to the hospital. A 45-year-old woman identified as Dawn Kojima, of Nutley, suffered a leg injury, while 73-year-old Thomas O'Brien sustained a laceration to the head.Mayor Bill de Blasio said the crane was being moved into a secure position because of high winds when the incident occurred. The crane was last inspected Thursday morning, and no work was being done at the site Friday. He said crews were keeping people and traffic away from the scene as the crane was being lowered, which likely prevented the injury total from being higher.No workers were injured, and the 56-year-old crane operator is cooperating with detectives and tested negative for alcohol.The force of the collapse caused a water main break at Worth Street and West Broadway and a possible gas main break on the West Broadway side.The FDNY and Con Edison are on the scene working on the gas issue, and spokesperson Sidney Alvarez is warning everyone in the area to be aware of an odor of rotten eggs. Anyone who smells such an odor is urged to contact Con Ed or dial 911.At this point, no elevated gas levels have been reported.The New York City Office of Emergency Management says there is no structural damage to any of the impacted buildings. Officials said four structures were damaged, most on the first floor. Still, several office buildings in the area were evacuated. They include:NY Law School (four buildings)71 Thomas Street, which is a state Supreme Court building40 Worth Street, which is a large office building. Weill Cornell Medicine has practices in that building and said everyone was evacuated safely.No residential buildings were evacuated.Worth Street is closed from Church Street to Hudson Street, while West Broadway is closed south of Canal Street.It appears the crane was working on 60 Hudson Street, a longtime industrial building undergoing renovation to luxury apartments. The crane was parked on Worth Street and had been lifting wood and other equipment to the roof.The plan is to start dismantling the crane Saturday morning. Crews are emptying the hydraulic fluid and fuel from the crane first, which should be ongoing through the early overnight hours.Once they have the crane dismantled, Con Ed and DEP need to access their infrastructure currently underneath the crane to assess the damage to the water main and gas line in the area.Officials hope to have the street open for Monday morning, but it's unclear if that will be able to happen in time. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"A \\"brilliant\\" mathematician from Prague was killed and three other people were injured when a crane toppled at a TriBeCa construction site amid high winds on Friday morning.

Here is an article: Frank Sinatra crouches to kiss his daughter Nancy on a train platform around 1942. Editor's note: CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a bestselling author whose 25 books include \\"Late Edition: A Love Story\\"; \\"When We Get to Surf City: A Journey Through America in Pursuit of Rock and Roll, Friendship, and Dreams\\"; and \\"Once Upon a Town: The Miracle of the North Platte Canteen.\\" (CNN) -- Attention, holiday shoppers: Put away your wallets and credit cards. If you're looking for a gift that will please someone close to you, there's one that won't cost you a cent, and that you won't find on any store shelf. This thought occurred the other day when, on a visit to the west coast of Florida, I was walking through a crowded outdoor mall and the familiar voice of Frank Sinatra wafted out of the loudspeaker system: \\"If I don't see her each day I miss her. . . .\\" I recognized the song immediately. \\"Believe me, I've got a case, \\"On Nancy, with the laughing face. . . .\\" It's one of the songs Sinatra cherished most. And what does that have to do with the most meaningful present you can give to a loved one this holiday season? There's a story behind the song: a story with a lesson. In the early 1940s, when Sinatra was a relatively young man, he and his wife were having a birthday party for their firstborn child, Nancy. Among the invited guests were two good friends of Sinatra: the wonderful musical composer Jimmy Van Heusen, and the brilliant comedic actor Phil Silvers. Van Heusen and Silvers wanted to bring a gift. But what could they purchase that Sinatra himself could not provide for his daughter? What the two men did was revise a song they'd been working on. Van Heusen had written the melody; Silvers was the writer of the lyrics. (He would go on to immense fame in the 1950s playing Army Sgt. Ernest Bilko on CBS television, but his talents extended to many fields.) Their song, in an early version, had featured the words \\"Bessie, with the laughing face,\\" referring to the wife of a colleague. Now they worked some more on it, and fashioned the lyrics for Sinatra's young daughter. They played and sang it at the birthday party. Sinatra adored it; by some accounts, he was so moved by the gesture from his friends that he began to cry. Talk about a gift for the man who has everything: What are you going to give to Frank Sinatra that he will remember? A tie? A car? A bottle of liquor? He needed nothing. But that song, and the effort his two friends had put into it, touched him so deeply that, until his dying day, it signified something achingly personal to him. And now it's the holiday season. We've all read about the mobs of people at door-buster sales, the fights in the aisles of stores. Yet there is a way that each of us, if we are willing to invest the hours, can come up with a gift that will mean more than any flat-screen television or video game. If you're good with words, write the best and longest letter you've ever written to a family member who maybe doesn't know just what he or she means to you. That letter will be kept, and treasured, long after gifts bought in a store have worn out or been thrown away. If you're artistic, paint a picture with a special significance that the person you love will understand. If you're the organized type, gather family photos from over the years, select them carefully, and put them together in an album that will mean everything to the person who receives it. If you're musical ... well, do for the person you care about what Phil Silvers and Jimmy Van Heusen did for Frank Sinatra and his family. Will the effort be time-consuming? Yes, and that's the point. It will certainly be time better spent than standing in line for hours before some big-box store opens its doors for midnight bargains. Because I'd heard about the Sinatra story for so many years, I called his younger daughter Tina the other afternoon to ask her about its veracity -- and its meaning to her family. \\"All of it is true,\\" she said. She said that her dad, Silvers and Van Heusen were dear buddies who loved to spend time together: \\"There would be New Year's Eve parties where they'd set up a stage, and play charades games. Everyone had to participate. They just liked being around each other.\\" When the two men presented the song at the birthday party, she said, \\"It was done out of pure friendship.\\" Her father and her mother -- whose name was also Nancy -- couldn't have been more moved by the personal nature of the gift. Tina had not yet been born, but the reason she is certain of this, she said, is that her dad talked about it, from time to time, for the rest of his life. And for him, the song -- and the memories of his friends who wrote it -- never diminished in emotional power. She recalled one time in Paris when her dad was in a brittle mood over some things that were going on in his life. He was angry and irritable; at a concert, as he worked his way through his song list, his agitation was evident to everyone who knew him. But then he got to \\"Nancy (with the Laughing Face)\\". \\"His entire physicality changed,\\" Tina said. 'He relaxed. He calmed down. The gentleness of the song, and the meaning of the story behind it, did that to him. You could see it. He went from being tense and on edge to being like an at-ease sergeant.\\" The gift from his buddies did that for him, all those years later. The best gifts are like that. Here's hoping you'll find the right one. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene. Write a title for it.","output":"Discovering the Perfect Gift: The Heartfelt Story Behind Frank Sinatra's Cherished Song \\"Nancy (with the Laughing Face)\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.  - Melanie Clare Sophie \\"Mel\\" Giedroyc (born 5 June 1968) is an English presenter, actress and comedian, best known for her comedy work with Sue Perkins, co-hosting series including \\"Light Lunch\\" for Channel 4, \\"The Great British Bake Off\\" for the BBC and chat show \\"Mel and Sue\\" for ITV.  - BBC One is the flagship television channel of the British Broadcasting Corporation in the United Kingdom, Isle of Man and Channel Islands. It was launched on 2 November 1936 as the BBC Television Service, and was the world's first regular television service with a high level of image resolution. It was renamed BBC TV in 1960, using this name until the launch of sister channel BBC2 in 1964, whereupon the BBC TV channel became known as BBC1, with the current spelling adopted in 1997.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster. It is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London, is the world's oldest national broadcasting organisation, and is the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, with over 20,950 staff in total, of whom 16,672 are in public sector broadcasting; including part-time, flexible as well as fixed contract staff, the total number is 35,402.  - Light Lunch was a Channel 4 lunch-time comedy chatshow broadcast on weekdays at 12:30 between March 1997 and February 1998. It starred Mel and Sue (Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc). The show was a huge success initially but audience figures declined slowly eventually resulting in low viewer figures and was deemed \\"unsatisfactory\\" by Channel 4.  - Susan Elizabeth \\"Sue\\" Perkins (born 22 September 1969) is an English comedian, broadcaster, actress and writer, born in East Dulwich, London. Originally coming to prominence through her comedy partnership with Mel Giedroyc in \\"Mel and Sue\\", she has since become best known as a radio broadcaster and TV presenter, notably of \\"The Great British Bake Off\\" (20102016) and \\"Insert Name Here\\" (2016present).  - Irony, in its broadest sense, is a rhetorical device, literary technique, or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case. Irony may be divided into categories such as verbal, dramatic, and situational. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of simile, used in sarcasm, and some forms of litotes can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection.  - Channel 4 is a British public-service television broadcaster that began transmission on 2 November 1982. Although largely commercially self-funded, it is ultimately publicly owned; originally a subsidiary of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the station is now owned and operated by Channel Four Television Corporation, a public corporation of the Department for Culture, Media & Sport, which was established in 1990 and came into operation in 1993. With the conversion of the Wenvoe transmitter group in Wales to digital on 31 March 2010, Channel 4 became a UK-wide TV channel for the first time.  - The Channel Islands (Norman: \\"Îles d'la Manche\\", French: \\"Îles Anglo-Normandes\\" or \\"Îles de la Manche\\") are an archipelago in the English Channel, off the French coast of Normandy. They include two Crown dependencies: the Bailiwick of Jersey, consisting of Jersey, the largest of the islands; and the Bailiwick of Guernsey, consisting of Guernsey, Alderney, Sark and some smaller islands. They are considered the remnants of the Duchy of Normandy, and although they are not part of the United Kingdom, it is responsible for the defence and international relations of the islands. The Crown dependencies are not members of the Commonwealth of Nations nor of the European Union. They have a total population of about 168,000, and the bailiwicks' respective capitals, Saint Helier and Saint Peter Port, have populations of 33,500 and 16,488, respectively. The total area of the islands is 198 km.  - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Herman Northrop Frye (July 14, 1912  January 23, 1991) was a Canadian literary critic and literary theorist, considered one of the most influential of the 20th century.  - Political satire is a significant part of satire that specializes in gaining entertainment from politics; it has also been used with subversive intent where political speech and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of advancing political arguments where such arguments are expressly forbidden.  - Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \\"enhance\\" their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs, neo-burlesques, colleges and theatres. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD and the internet.  - The Isle of Man, also known simply as Mann, is a self-governing crown dependency in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title of Lord of Mann. The Lord of Mann is represented by a Lieutenant Governor. Foreign relations and defence are the responsibility of the British Government.  - Satire is a genre of literature, and sometimes graphic and performing arts, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society.  - A double act, also known as a comedy duo, is a comic pairing in which humor is derived from the uneven relationship between two partners, usually of the same gender, age, ethnic origin and profession but drastically different in terms of personality or behavior. Often one of the members of the duothe straight man, feed, dead wood, or stoogeis portrayed as reasonable and serious, while the other onethe funny man, banana man or comicis portrayed as funny, less educated or less intelligent, silly, or unorthodox. If the audience identifies primarily with one character, the other will often be referred to as a comic foil. The term \\"feed\\" comes from the way a straight man is wont to set up jokes and \\"feed\\" them to his partner.  - A television channel is a physical or virtual channel over which a television station or television network is distributed. For example, in North America, \\"channel 2\\" refers to the broadcast or cable band of 54 to 60 MHz, with carrier frequencies of 55.25 MHz for NTSC analog video (VSB) and 59.75 MHz for analog audio (FM), or 55.31 MHz for digital ATSC (8VSB). Channels may be shared by many different television stations or cable-distributed channels depending on the location and service provider.  - Insert Name Here is a British comedy panel game show presented by Sue Perkins.

More recently they have hosted the BAFTA Award - winning BBC One cookery series The Great British Bake Off .  - Laughter is a physical reaction in humans and some other species of primate, consisting typically of rhythmical, often audible contractions of the diaphragm and other parts of the respiratory system. It is a response to certain external or internal stimuli. Laughter can arise from such activities as being tickled, or from humorous stories or thoughts. Most commonly, it is considered a visual expression of a number of positive emotional states, such as joy, mirth, happiness, relief, etc. On some occasions, however, it may be caused by contrary emotional states such as embarrassment, apology, or confusion such as nervous laughter or courtesy laugh. Age, gender, education, language, and culture are all factors as to whether a person will experience laughter in a given situation.

In January 1844 , North Carolina Representative James Iver McKay , the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means , solicited the views of Director Patterson on the gold dollar . Patterson had more of Gobrecht 's pattern dollar struck to show to committee members , again advising against a coin that if issued would be only about a half inch ( 13 mm ) in diameter . He told Treasury Secretary John C. Spencer that the only gold coins of that size in commerce , the Spanish and Colombian half @-@ escudos , were unpopular and had not been struck for more than twenty years . This seemed to satisfy the committee as nothing more was done for the time , and when a gold dollar was proposed again in 1846 , McKay 's committee recommended against it . Even before 1848 , record amounts of gold were flowing to American mints to be struck into coin , but the California Gold Rush vastly increased these quantities . This renewed calls for a gold dollar , as well as for a higher denomination than the eagle (  10 piece ) , then the largest gold coin . In January 1849 , McKay introduced a bill for a gold dollar , which was referred to his committee . There was much discussion in the press about the proposed coin ; one newspaper published a proposal for an annular gold dollar , that is , with a hole in the middle to increase its small diameter . McKay amended his legislation to provide for a double eagle (  20 gold coin ) and wrote to Patterson , who replied stating that the annular gold dollar would not work , and neither would another proposal to have dollar piece consisting of a gold plug in a silver coin . Nevertheless , Gobrecht 's successor as chief engraver , James B. Longacre , prepared patterns , including some with a square hole in the middle . McKay got his fellow Democrat , New Hampshire Senator Charles Atherton , to introduce the bill to authorize the gold dollar and the double eagle in the Senate on February 1 , 1849 — Atherton was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee . McKay introduced a version into the House on February 20 ; debate began the same day . The dollar was attacked by congressmen from the Whig Party , then in the minority , on the grounds that it would be too small , would be counterfeited and in bad light might be mistakenly spent as a half dime , the coins being similar in size . McKay did not respond substantively , but stated that if no one wanted these denominations , they would not be called for at the Mint , and would not be coined . Pennsylvania Representative Joseph Ingersoll , a Whig , spoke against the bill , noting that Patterson opposed the new denominations , and that the idea had been repeatedly turned down , whenever considered . Another Whig , Massachusetts 's Charles Hudson , related that Patterson had sent a real and a counterfeit gold dollar to his committee and the majority of members had been unable to tell the difference . McKay made no answer to these claims , but others did , including New York Congressman Henry Nicoll , who assured the House that the counterfeiting allegations were greatly exaggerated . The point was , he indicated , that the double eagle and gold dollar were wanted by the public , and , in the case of the gold dollar could help money circulate in small communities where banknotes were not accepted . Connecticut Representative John A. Rockwell , a Whig , tried to table the bill , but his motion was defeated . The bill passed easily , and met only minimal opposition in the Senate , becoming law on March 3 , 1849 . fill in the blank  : In January 1844 , North Carolina Representative James Iver __________________ , the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means , solicited the views of Director Patterson on the gold dollar .

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Confidentiality agreements typically limit the ways the receiving party can use the confidential information provided, as well as provide the standard for keeping and protecting confidential information.  For example, if you're looking for investor evaluations of something you've invented, your confidentiality agreement may specify that the information can only be used for the purposes of evaluating the product and not in the evaluator's own business. If you're having an employee or contractor sign a confidentiality agreement, you would probably want to limit your employee's use of information to the performance of job duties directly related to the employment. Many confidentiality agreements recite that receivers must keep the information disclosed to them in the same way they would keep their own confidential information. However, this statement only works if the receiving party has a known policy for handling confidential information. Generally, confidentiality standards include limiting access to the information and taking basic precautions to keep the information secure so it doesn't easily fall into outside hands. Such precautions might include, for example, using encryption for emails discussing the confidential information. If your confidentiality agreement relates to software designs, inventions or technology, it should include a statement that the receiver of the information has no license, expressed or implied, in the information by virtue of its disclosure.   Most state laws hold that, at a minimum, the receiver has the duty not to breach confidentiality or induce others to breach it. Your agreement should specify two time periods: the period during which disclosure will be made, and the time period thereafter during which the information should be kept confidential.  American confidentiality agreements typically last for a period of five years, although some may only last two or three years.  The end point doesn't have to be a specific date, but there should be a specific date used as a starting point. Otherwise it's unclear when the agreement will take effect and for how long it will be enforceable. If your agreement specifies a confidentiality period of two years, for example, but fails to establish when that two year period starts, the receiver of the information can argue that she didn't believe the agreement had gone into effect yet.  Another way to set a specific starting date is to have the confidentiality period start from the date the agreement is signed. If you use this method, make sure you don't disclose any secrets until you have the signature and the agreement is in force. The confidentiality time period also may end when a certain event happens. For example, if you're seeking evaluation of a new product, the confidentiality period may end when you market and distribute that product in stores. Some confidentiality agreements include stiff financial penalties if secret information is revealed to the general public. Others leave the consequences up to a judge or arbitrator to decide.  You can sue for an injunction -- a court order to stop the person who breached confidentiality from continuing to share the information in violation of the agreement.  You also have the ability to sue for damages incurred as a result of the breach of confidentiality, which may include penalties. For example, in some states you may have the ability to get double or triple damages if the breach was intentional rather than accidental. How detailed you want to get with penalties generally relates to how unique the information being disclosed is, and how damaging it would be if it got out. The more difficult something is to value, the more likely there is to be a clause listing a specific dollar amount in damages for breach. If both parties agree the information is worth this amount, the issue isn't left up to the discretion of a judge. Sometimes called “boilerplate,” all agreements contain various clauses that don't fit in any other section, such as which state's law will apply and whether attorneys' fees will be available to an injured party if they agreement is breached. Both parties must sign the agreement before it can be considered valid.","output":"The article discusses the importance of confidentiality agreements, their role in limiting the use of confidential information, and the protection they provide for sensitive data. It covers various aspects such as the purpose of the agreement, the standard of care to be taken while handling confidential information, period of disclosure and confidentiality, establishing a specific starting date for the agreement, the possible consequences of breach and penalties, setting a specific dollar amount for damages, and the inclusion of boilerplate clauses to address additional legal matters. The article also highlights the need for both parties to sign the agreement for it to be considered valid and enforceable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The footage showed several fans chanting: \\"We're racist and that's the way we like it.\\" Mr Barklie denies chanting. The Metropolitan Police is applying for football banning orders to be imposed on four men the force believes were involved in the confrontation. In addition to Mr Barklie, 50, of Victoria Street in Carrickfergus, Jordan Munday, 20, of Ellenborough Road, Sidcup, Kent; Josh Parsons, 20, of Woodhouse Place, Dorking, Surrey; and William Simpson, 26, of Hengrove Crescent in Ashford, Surrey, are challenging the ban. The banning orders would prevent them from attending games at home or abroad. Scotland Yard confirmed another Chelsea supporter, Dean Callis, 32, of Liverpool Road, Islington, had received a five-year banning order ahead of the court hearing for a number of incidents, including the one in Paris.

Hypothesis: The man is talented. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the given premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the man is talented. The premise only describes the physical appearance of a pedestrian - slinging a guitar and carrying a backpack in a metro setting. Although this may suggest that the individual has an interest in playing guitar and possibly possesses some skill in doing so, we cannot assert for certain that the individual is talented solely because they are carrying a guitar. However, we can make educated assumptions or construct alternative hypotheses based on the given premise, which may lead us closer to identifying the level of talent present. It is essential to gather more information on the pedestrian's actual musical abilities before making a valid conclusion. Some alternative hypotheses that could be derived from the premise are: 1. The pedestrian is an aspiring musician who is currently learning how to play the guitar. In this case, the man may be talented but is still in the initial stages of honing his skills. 2. The pedestrian is a professional musician who carries his essential gear as he travels between gigs in the metro setting. A skilled musician could indicate some level of talent. 3. The pedestrian is carrying the guitar as a means to express himself or his identity, rather than reflecting his ability to play. It may be a fashion statement or an accessory without necessarily demonstrating any level of talent. In summary, the given premise does not provide enough information to conclude that the man is talented. However, we can infer that the pedestrian might have some interest in music or guitar playing. To have a more accurate conclusion of his talent, we would need to obtain more information about the pedestrian's background, experiences, and musical skill level."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Crucifixion of Jesus: The assumption of the use of a two-beamed cross does not determine the number of nails used in the crucifixion and some theories suggest three nails while others suggest four nails. However, throughout history larger numbers of nails have been hypothesized, at times as high as 14 nails. These variations are also present in the artistic depictions of the crucifixion. In the Western Church, before the Renaissance usually four nails would be depicted, with the feet side by side. After the Renaissance most depictions use three nails, with one foot placed on the other. Nails are almost always depicted in art, although Romans sometimes just tied the victims to the cross. The tradition also carries to Christian emblems, e.g. the Jesuits use three nails under the IHS monogram and a cross to symbolize the crucifixion. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\".

It can be something like “I need to leave now” or even something silly like “My monster needs me.” It’s about trying to keep the person bullying you off-balance. This often confuses the bully enough that he or she is less sure of how you will respond the next time the possibility of bullying arises. Bullying often follows a script, and you want to change it so the bully is off-balance.  If you are a bystander and see someone being bullied, try to create a distraction or take the bully's attention off of what he's doing. You can also provide an interruption by telling the person being bullied like, \\"Hey, I really need to talk to you for a second\\" or \\"Mr. X wants to see you for a minute.\\" If they follow you, or it happens again and you feel comfortable doing so, ask the person to stop. If the person refuses, detail the steps you will take to deal with the situation.  For example, you can say something like, \\"Please stop calling me mean names. If you don't, I will report you to the principal.\\" It's important not to give bullying an audience if you're a bystander. Attention will only encourage the bully. Don't laugh at or encourage bullying behavior. If it feels safe, you can even say something like, \\"That's really not funny\\" or \\"Take it easy.\\" No matter how the person who is bullying you responds, staying calm will show them their efforts to upset you aren’t working. Show that you are unaffected by their actions, even if you are inside. Write down as exactly as you can what they said and did and who was there. This can help when you talk to teachers or people in authority about the situation. Letting people in authority know will make it harder for the person who does the bullying to continue. You might not be the only one suffering, and it might be time for the school administration to take action against that person. It’s important to have a record of complaint against the person doing the bullying in case it continues. If the verbal abuse has taken the form of sexist, racist, or homophobic slurs, you also might want to reach out to teachers involved in student groups trying to combat sexism, racism, and homophobia. Change your routes. Go with a crowd whenever you can. Bullies often avoid taking on someone with a group around them. If the bullying consists of any physical violence, go to the police immediately. Threats of violence should also be reported to the police, as they are illegal in many jurisdictions. Being the target of bullying is not your fault.  No one should have to deal with bullying, social isolation, and shaming alone. Even if people who were your friends have gotten involved in the social bullying situation, look for new activities and new friends. Get yourself out of the toxic situation. If needed, speaking with a school counselor, joining a \\"beat-bullying\\" group, or seeing a therapist may also help with your emotional pain.

After meeting Sir Henry, Holmes remembers that he is going to be away on another case when Sir Henry returns to Baskerville Hall. Holmes puts Watson in charge of watching over Sir Henry. A tarantula attacks Sir Henry briefly in London; Holmes suspects foul play. Before he leaves, Holmes reminds Watson not to let Sir Henry go out onto the moor after dark. On the way to Baskerville Hall, the coach driver, Perkins (Sam Kydd), warns that a convict named Selden (Michael Mulcaster) has escaped from nearby Dartmoor Prison two days ago. Watson remembers the case: Selden was convicted of murdering a number of street women; due to his being found insane, he was sentenced to life imprisonment instead of hanging. At Baskerville Hall, Watson and Sir Henry learn from the butler, Barrymore (John Le Mesurier), that one of the two paintings of Sir Hugo was stolen several months ago. Watson then inquires Barrymore about further details of Sir Charles's death since Barrymore was the first to discover the body. Barrymore explains that he was on his way to warn Dr. Mortimer of Sir Charles's disappearance and then found the body by chance.

But do you know that a colour has weight? I think you'll say \\"no\\". But I am afraid you are wrong. If you don't believe, you may do a small experiment . First, put two objects with the same weight into two boxes. Then cover the boxes. Wrap  one box with a red piece of paper, the other with a white piece of paper. Now hold the boxes with your hand one by one. It is certain that you will think the red one is a little heavier. Why does it happen? A scientist found that different colours have different weight in a man's mind. So he did many tests and at last he got the result. That is to say, every colour has its own weight in our mind. The heaviest colour is red, then blue, green, orange, yellow and white. The scientists told us that colours also have smell. Can you smell the colour? Of course not. Then why did the scientists say so? That is because every colour represents a kind of light wave ------ a certain wavelength . It reaches our brain  through organs  According to this discovery, scientists say that people accept the colour they like, and _ the colour they hate. So your body and mind will be healthy by using the colours you like. Or you'll be nervous or even get ill.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that made recorded works by more than fifty composers? from the following article ?  Monteux made a large number of recordings throughout his career. His first recording was as a violist in \\"Plus blanche que la blanche hermine\\" from Les Huguenots by Meyerbeer in 1903 for Pathé with the tenor Albert Vaguet. It is possible that Monteux played in the Colonne Orchestra's 20 early cylinders recorded around 1906–07. His recording debut as a conductor was the first of his five recordings of The Rite of Spring, issued in 1929. The first of these, with the OSP, is judged by Canarina to be indifferently played; recordings by Monteux of music by Ravel and Berlioz made in 1930 and 1931, Canarina believes, were more impressive. Stravinsky, who also recorded The Rite in 1929, was furious that Monteux had made a rival recording; he made vitriolic comments privately, and for some time his relations with Monteux remained cool.Monteux's final studio recordings were with the London Symphony Orchestra in works by Ravel at the end of February 1964. In the course of his career he recorded works by more than fifty composers. In Monteux's lifetime it was rare for record companies to issue recordings of live concerts, although he would much have preferred it, he said, \\"if one could record in one take in normal concert-hall conditions\\". Some live performances of Monteux conducting the Metropolitan Opera, and among others the San Francisco Symphony, Boston Symphony, BBC Symphony and London Symphony orchestras survive alongside his studio recordings, and some have been issued on compact disc. It has been argued that these reveal even more than his studio recordings \\"a conductor at once passionate, disciplined, and tasteful; one who was sometimes more vibrant than the Monteux captured in the studio, and yet, like that studio conductor, a cultivated musician possessing an extraordinary ear for balance, a keen sense of style and a sure grasp of shape and line.\\"Many of Monteux's recordings have remained in the catalogues for decades, notably his RCA Victor recordings with the Boston Symphony and Chicago Symphony orchestras;...

The Covent Garden area has over 60 pubs and bars; several of them are listed buildings, with some also on CAMRA's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors; some, such as The Harp in Chandos Place, have received consumer awards. The Harp's awards include London Pub of the Year in 2008 by the Society for the Preservation of Beers from the Wood, and National Pub of the Year by CAMRA in 2010. It was at one time owned by the Charrington Brewery, when it was known as The Welsh Harp; in 1995 the name was abbreviated to just The Harp, before Charrington sold it to Punch Taverns in 1997. It was eventually purchased by the landlady Binnie Walsh around 2010 then subsequently sold by her to Fuller's Brewery in 2014.  It continues to win regular CAMRA pub awards under its new owners. The Lamb and Flag in Rose Street is possibly the oldest pub in the area. The first mention of a pub on the site is 1772 (when it was called the Cooper's Arms – the name changing to Lamb & Flag in 1833); the 1958 brick exterior conceals what may be an early 18th-century frame of a house replacing the original one built in 1638. The pub acquired a reputation for staging bare-knuckle prize fights during the early 19th century when it earned the nickname \\"Bucket of Blood\\". The alleyway beside the pub was the scene of an attack on John Dryden in 1679 by thugs hired by John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, with whom he had a long-standing conflict.The Salisbury in St Martin's Lane was built as part of a six-storey block around 1899 on the site of an earlier pub that had been known under several names, including the Coach & Horses and Ben Caunt's Head; it is both Grade II listed, and on CAMRA's National Inventory, due to the quality of the etched and polished glass and the carved woodwork, summed up as \\"good fin de siècle ensemble\\".

The Neptune Pool at Hearst Castle is 104 feet long and 95 feet wide at the alcove. I decided to celebrate the unofficial return of reasonable driving vacations with a venture to the ultimate temple of excess -- Hearst Castle. From Los Angeles, my family and I retraced the journey of Hollywood luminaries who headed north to hang out with publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst. Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, Clark Gable, Gregory Peck, Carol Lombard and Hearst's mistress Marion Davies all made the trek to what Hearst called \\"La Cuesta Encantada,\\" or the Enchanted Hill. Winston Churchill and President Calvin Coolidge also rested here amid art and antiquities from around the world. Hearst Castle looks down over golden fields, the glistening Pacific and the town of San Simeon, California, home to less than 500 people. We took a tour bus from the visitors center to the mansion, a long gull's dive from the ocean, 1,610 feet above sea level. Hearst hired San Francisco architect Julia Morgan in 1919 and by 1947 the 165-room estate stretched over 127 acres. It's crystal clear Hearst was a demanding mastermind of his kingdom on the hill, putting Morgan through what must have been agonizing brain twisters. Visitors see that when Hearst wanted European choir chairs wedged into his assembly room, Morgan made it work. When he wanted elaborate ceilings salvaged from Europe, Morgan expanded their reach to fit into the estate's rooms. A massive 95 x 104-foot outdoor swimming pool, made of concrete and Vermont marble, is one of the central jewels of the property. Our guide recounted Hearst house rules. In an effort to control his guests' alcohol consumption, Hearst banned them from bringing their own liquor. The Hollywood types reportedly snuck it in anyway, like frat boys at a football game. Guests stayed in opulent guest houses adorned with religious icons, art and other worldly treasures. Hearst mandated unmarried guests sleep apart, while violating his own edict by sleeping with his beloved actress friend Marion Davies. Though Hearst remained married to Millicent Hearst, with whom he had five children, Davies' ghost is everywhere at Hearst Castle. Images of the actress, along with Charlie Chaplin and others stars, flicker about in a short film shown in the mansion's 50-seat movie theater. Museum-worthy pieces fill the property, including intricate Flemish tapestries in an east-facing sitting room called the Morning Room. Owing to my Belgian roots, I looked at the tapestries and cracked to my kids, \\"No wonder my 83-year-old mother can still sew a tiny patch onto a Girl Scout vest.\\" The castle's grandeur was enough to hold the childrens' attention. We saw them as young as 4 years old, eyes popping while taking in ancient Egyptian statues or towering Christmas trees. \\"This guy was rich!\\" my friend's 7-year-old-son, Nicolas, exclaimed. Perhaps a headline from Hearst's San Francisco Examiner in another era could best describe our trip:. \\"The road to fun is back and affordable!\\" Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article is about a family taking a road trip to visit Hearst Castle, a big, fancy house built by a rich man named William Randolph Hearst. Many famous people used to visit him there, like Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, and even a president!

Are galaxy filaments the state of displacement of the strongly interacting dark matter which fills 'empty' space? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"Imagine you have a room filled with invisible and mysterious stuff called dark matter. It's everywhere in the room, even when it looks empty. Now, when you place a toy (like a ball) in the room, the dark matter has to move a little to make room for it. This is what we mean by displacement - the dark matter moves to give space to something else. Now, let's talk about the Milky Way. Picture it as a big spinning toy in the room. It has a halo, which is an area surrounding the spinning toy, and some people think it's made up of dark matter. So, the Milky Way's halo might be the area where the dark matter has moved away to make room for the galaxy. Galaxy filaments are like big strings that connect many toys (galaxies) together. Think of them like strings on a necklace holding many beads. Some people think these galaxy filaments are also made up of dark matter that has moved and gathered together, just like the Milky Way's halo. Now, let's see if these questions have the same meaning. The first question is about if dark matter can fill 'empty' space and move to make room for other things like galaxies. The second question is about whether the Milky Way's halo and galaxy filaments could be areas where dark matter has moved. They have a similar idea because they both talk about dark matter moving and organizing itself around other things. But they're not exactly the same, as the first one is more general, and the second one specifically talks about the Milky Way's halo and galaxy filaments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The term \\"railcar\\" is usually used in reference to a train consisting of a single coach (carriage, car), with a driver's cab at one or both ends. Some railways, e.g., the Great Western Railway, used the term Railmotor. If it is able to pull a full train, it is rather called a motor coach or a motor car.  - A tram (also known as tramcar; and in North America known as streetcar, trolley or trolley car) is a rail vehicle which runs on tracks along public urban streets, and also sometimes on a segregated right of way. The lines or networks operated by tramcars are called tramways. Tramways powered by electricity, the most common type historically, were once called electric street railways (mainly in the USA). However, trams were widely used in urban areas before the universal adoption of electrification; other methods of powering trams are listed below under \\"History\\".  - Trondheim Trafikkselskap or TT was the city public transport company for Trondheim, Norway between 1974 and 2001. It operated both the city buses, and the Trondheim Tramway until 1988. The company was owned by the city council.  - Elgeseter is a location in Trondheim, Norway located south and east of the river Nidelven, south of Midtbyen, east of Nidarø, west of Singsaker and north of Lerkendal.

Here is a goal: How do you poke holes in polymer clay beads before they're baked? How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of poking holes in polymer clay beads before they're baked, you will need to follow a series of specific steps. Below is a detailed guide to help you: 1. Gather the necessary tools and materials:   - Polymer clay (in the desired colors)   - Round bead- or lentil-shape maker (optional)   - Needle, toothpick, or bead-piercing tool   - Cornstarch or water (to prevent clay from sticking)   - Flat working surface   - Wax paper or plastic sheet (to prevent clay from staining your work surface)   - Oven-safe baking sheet or glass (for baking)   - Oven or toaster oven (for baking) 2. Prepare your work area:    - Place your flat working surface, such as a cutting board or table, in a well-lit area.    - Lay down wax paper or a plastic sheet to prevent the clay from adhering to your work surface.    - Preheat your oven or toaster oven according to the polymer clay manufacturer's instructions. 3. Condition the clay:    - Before shaping the beads, you will need to soften and condition the polymer clay by kneading it with your hands or running it through a pasta machine a few times. This step is crucial for achieving a uniform consistency, which will result in better quality beads. 4. Shape the beads:    - Using the conditioned clay, shape your beads by rolling small portions of the clay into rounds or lentil shapes. You can use a round bead- or lentil-shape maker for more precise and uniform shapes.    - The size and shape of the beads are entirely customizable, depending on your preference or project requirements. 5. Poke the holes:    - Before you pierce the bead, decide on the orientation of the hole (horizontal or vertical in relation to the bead) by considering your final jewelry design.    - Lightly dust the needle, toothpick, or bead-piercing tool with cornstarch or dip it in water to prevent the clay from sticking to the tool.    - Gently press the needle or toothpick into the bead at the desired entry point. Rotate the tool as you push, maintaining a slow and steady pressure. This will help reduce distortion in the bead's shape.    - Carefully push the tool through until you feel it exit the other side. Pull the tool straight out, being mindful of the bead's shape.   - Check the hole's size and adjust it by gently rotating the tool or using a larger tool, if necessary.    - If the bead's shape gets distorted, reshape it gently with your fingers, taking care not to close the hole. 6. Smooth the holes:    - For a polished look, smooth out the edges of the holes by gently rubbing your fingers around the entry and exit points or using a small, clean brush. 7. Bake the beads:    - Place the beads on an oven-safe baking sheet or glass dish, ensuring that they don't touch each other to prevent melting.    - Bake the polymer clay beads according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually around 250-275°F (120-135°C) for 15 to 30 minutes. Baking time may vary depending on the thickness of the beads.   - After baking, remove the beads from the oven and allow them to cool completely before handling. 8. Finish and use the beads:    - Your polymer clay beads are now ready to be used in your jewelry-making projects. If desired, you can further embellish them with paint, varnish, or other finishes to create unique, eye-catching pieces. By following these steps, you'll be able to create beautiful and evenly-shaped polymer clay beads with securely poked holes, ready for various applications and craft projects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If you want the dye to appear like it does on the packaging, you need to start with a white base. If you prefer a muted shade, however, you could start with gray linen instead.  You can try dyeing a cotton-linen or rayon-linen blend, but be aware that the results may not be consistent or even. If you are working with yarn, wind the yarn around your hand and elbow to create a large hank. Loosely tie pieces of string around the hank to secure it. Use a funnel to fill a large jug with 1 cup (140 g) of soda ash. Add 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water that is around 105 °F (41 °C). Close the jug and shake it to dissolve the soda ash. Open the jug and set it aside so that the water can cool.  Use pure soda ash (sodium carbonate), not baking soda (sodium bicarbonate). You can find it online and in well-stocked craft stores. If you have hard water in your town or city, add some water softener. This will prevent the minerals from affecting the dye. Place your fabric or yarn into a plastic tub. Fill it with enough of the soda ash solution to completely cover the linen. Let the linen soak for at least 20 minutes. Save the rest of the soda ash for later. The soda ash solution can still be hot for this step. Each brand will be a little different, but in most cases, you will have to mix 2 teaspoons of fabric reactive dye powder with 1 cup (240 mL) of water. Mix the dye with a little bit of warm water to form a paste first, then add the rest of the water.  Wear safety googles and rubber of plastic gloves to protect your eyes and skin. Wear a dusk mask approved for fine particles for this step. Powdered fabric reactive dye is dangerous to breathe in. Use less dye for a lighter shade and more dye for a darker shade. You don't have to use an applicator bottle if you won't want to, but many people find it easier to use than just pouring the dye from the container your prepared it in. How much more dye you prepare depends on how much linen you are dyeing; refer to the manufacturer's instructions for more advice. Take the linen out of the soda ash bath, and squeeze out the excess solution. Set the linen down onto a plastic tray or bag, then squirt the dye onto it. You can create an all-over solid color or a splotchy color. You can even use multiple colors to create a tie dye effect.  Keep color mixing in mind. If you put 2 contrasting colors next to each other, they will form brown then they touch. Squeeze the linen after you apply the dye, then apply more dye if needed. If you dyed your linen multiple colors, be careful not to bundle it up. Arrange the linen so that no 2 colors touch or smoosh together. Zip or tie the bag shut, and leave it in a warm place for 12 to 24 hours.  The place should be at least 65 °F (18 °C). The longer you leave the linen in the bag, the brighter and more vibrant the colors will turn out. Don't worry, fiber reactive dyes are non-toxic, so they won't harm the environment or waterways. The soda ash can also unblock clogs in your sink! Keep rinsing until the water runs clear. It would be a good idea to rinse the linen afterwards with Synthrapol, which helps set the dye into the linen better. You need to use Synthrapol with hot water; follow the instructions on the bottle. Make sure that no soda ash remains inn the linen before you start. Squeeze the linen with your hands until you get most of the water out. Spread it out on an old towel in a well-ventilated area away from sunlight. Allow it to air dry completely before using the fabric or yarn. Once the yarn is dry, snip the strings holding the skein together, then roll the skein into a ball.","output":"To obtain the desired color for dyeing linen fabric or yarn, it is crucial to start with the appropriate base. Dye is translucent, meaning it mixes with the existing color of your material. Using a white base will help achieve colors similar to those displayed on dye packaging, whereas a gray base will produce more muted shades. You may use cotton-linen or rayon-linen blends, but be prepared for potential uneven or inconsistent results. Before dyeing, create a hank of yarn by winding it around your hand and elbow, and secure it loosely with string. Next, prepare a soda ash solution by combining 1 cup (140 g) of soda ash with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of 105°F (41°C) water in a large jug. Shake to dissolve the soda ash and allow it to cool. Use pure soda ash (sodium carbonate) and avoid baking soda (sodium bicarbonate). If you have hard water, add a water softener to prevent minerals from interfering with the dye. Place your fabric or yarn in a plastic tub and add the soda ash solution to cover the material completely. Soak the linen for at least 20 minutes, then prepare the fabric reactive dye. Typically, you will need to mix 2 teaspoons of dye powder with 1 cup (240 mL) of water; adjust the amount according to your desired shade and the instructions provided by the dye manufacturer. When handling the dye, protect your eyes, skin, and respiratory system by wearing safety goggles, rubber or plastic gloves, and a dusk mask approved for fine particles. Remove the linen from the soda ash solution, squeezing out any excess. Place the damp material on a plastic tray or bag and apply the dye using an applicator bottle or other technique. You can create a solid color or patterns with multiple colors, but be cautious of color mixing, as contrasting colors will form brown when they touch. After applying the dye, fold the linen carefully without causing colors to mix or touch. Place it in a zip or tie bag, keeping it in a warm location (minimum of 65°F or 18°C) for 12 to 24 hours. The longer it remains, the brighter and more vibrant the colors will be. Fiber reactive dyes are non-toxic and safe for the environment. Rinse the dyed linen until the water runs clear. It is recommended to use Synthrapol, which assists in setting the dye, but ensure all soda ash has been removed beforehand. Follow the instructions on the Synthrapol bottle, using hot water for rinsing. Finally, squeeze out most of the water from the linen and lay it flat on an old towel in a well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight. Allow it to air dry completely before using the fabric or yarn. If dyed yarn is used, cut the strings holding the skein together and roll it into a ball after drying."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Lucy gets beauty treatments before arriving for the event. She is the only girl dressed in white lingerie; the other women seem to be much older, wear severe makeup, and have black lingerie designed to reveal much more than to conceal. The event is a formal dinner party at an elegant home. Lucy serves drinks for the party and goes home with the money she made from it. After one other session as a serving girl, Lucy gets a call from Clara's assistant Thomas (Eden Falk) for a different request.

Q:Article: Being able to count at least ten people as friends makes us happy, but those with five or fewer are likely to be miserable, researchers say. Their study of hundreds of men and women also found t hat people who feel satisfied with their lives always have lots of close friends and regularly make new ones. While it is not clear whether our friends make us happy or we make friends because we are happy, the researchers say it is clear that we should maintain our friendships. Psychologist RichardTunney said, \\"Whatever the reason is, actively working on friendships in the same way as to maintain a marriage is a prerequisite  to happiness. \\"Dr. Tunney, of Nottingham University, quizzed more than 1,700 people about their satisfaction  with their lives and the state of their friendships. Those with five friends or fewer had just a 40 percent chance of being happy.  In other words they were more likely to be unhappy than happy. Ten was the first number at which people were more likely to be happy than unhappy. The happiest people were those with dozens of friends, according to the study, which was carried out for the National Lottery . For women, this meant having 33 friends;for men, the number was 49. Dr. Tunney said,\\"People who were extremely satisfied with their lives had twice the number of friends of people  who were extremely dissatisfied. \\" Women tended to have fewer friends than men but formed tighter relationships. Interestingly, the study found that childhood friends are no more likely to make us happy than people we become close to later in life. Lottery winners, however, have a differentopinion on life. They are always happier than others despite spending their time with asmall circle of old friends. This could be because they trust people they've known for along time.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it.  John is a an ophthalmologist in a local hospital. Today, he has seen two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A had hyperopia, but patient B didn't have any issues with eyes. John would now treat the patient that have eye problem.  Which patient would see nearby objects clearer, patient A or pateint B? Answer:","output":"Patient B would see nearby objects clearer than patient A. This is because patient A has hyperopia, a condition that causes nearby objects to appear blurry. In contrast, patient B does not have any eye issues, which means their vision is normal and they can see both distant and nearby objects with clarity. Farsightedness, or hyperopia, affects an individual's ability to focus on nearby objects. In a person with hyperopia, the light rays entering the eye are focused behind the retina, making close-up images blurry. This is a result of the eyeball being shorter than normal or the cornea being too flat. As these individuals can typically see distant objects clearly, their distance vision is not impacted by this condition. To correct hyperopia, convex lenses can be prescribed. These lenses bend the incoming light rays so that they focus properly on the retina, resulting in sharper vision of nearby objects. Convex lenses are thicker in the center and thinner at the outer edges. Depending on the severity of hyperopia, an individual may need glasses or contact lenses only for specific activities, such as reading or working on a computer, or they may need them for all tasks that involve near vision. On the other hand, patient B appears to have no eye issues. Their vision is considered normal, allowing them to focus on both nearby and distant objects with clarity. A person with normal vision, or emmetropia, has a well-proportioned eyeball and a cornea that refracts light correctly, producing a clear image on the retina. In conclusion, patient B, who does not have any eye issues, would see nearby objects clearer compared to patient A, who is affected by hyperopia and experiences blurry vision when focusing on close-up objects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - television - bus - email - web page - la ville  Explain why a human would choose \\"web page\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"web page\\" to answer the question because while reading news, you are most likely to encounter advertisements on the platforms where you access the news content – which is on web pages. In the digital age, a significant portion of news consumption takes place on websites and mobile applications. With the popularity of online and digital media, advertising has also adapted and shifted heavily towards web pages. Internet websites and news platforms are full of display ads, banners, sponsored content, and pop-ups. These advertisements blend seamlessly with the news articles and grab the readers' attention while they browse through the content. The main goal of these ads is to target relevant viewers and provide a more engaging and personalized experience. On the other hand, television, buses, and la ville (which means \\"the city\\" in French) do have advertisements, but they are unrelated to the act of reading news specifically. In these cases, the ads are more traditional and are usually not contextually related to the news that someone would be reading. Email could also be considered an option, as one might receive newsletters and updates from news organizations. However, advertisements within emails are generally less obtrusive and visually prominent compared to those on web pages.

They are specifically intended for holding and consuming a variety of beverages efficiently. 2. Suitability for various liquids: Drinking glasses can accommodate various types of liquids, including water, soft drinks, juices, and even alcoholic beverages.

The wider opening at the top allows for easy sipping, and the transparent structure lets you see the contents and check the quantity remaining clearly. While the other choices like jar, cup, container, and tankard can also hold liquids, they may not be as specifically designed for drinking purposes or may not be as commonly used for consuming liquids as a drinking glass. For example, a jar or container usually serves a storage purpose, cups can be used for hot beverages, and tankards are typically associated with beer or ale.

See if she wants to keep your attention or if her eyes move away from yours. If she is consistently making eye contact and sometimes blushing while doing it, chances are she’s interested in you. She may also try stealing quick glances at you when she thinks you're not looking.  Of course, you don't want to just stare at her because that will come off as creepy. Just glance in her direction, or try to hold her eyes for a couple of seconds. However, some girls are just shy, and they may not want to make eye contact with you. Try encouraging her with other steps. Smiling shows your interest, and makes it easy for her to smile back at you. Sometimes, it might take a while for both of you to just make eye contact and smile before you’re ready to actually talk to each other. Even if you’re nervous, smiling is a good way to make contact because a smile actually acts as a reward to other people. In other words, when you smile at her, her brain perceives it as a reward, making her happier to be around you. Don’t just hang around with the same group of friends. It’s much easier to approach someone who is alone rather than someone who's with a large group, so if you make sure you're alone sometime when she's around, she might come over and talk to you. You could also try and go alone to a place you know she will be to make yourself a little more available. You never know what might happen. For instance, maybe you notice she spends time at the library after school. Make it a point to show up there, too. Try sitting at a table near her, where she can see you. ” It’s an easy first step and a way to acknowledge that you’re noticing each other. You don’t have to do much more at first if you’re shy. If she’s unwilling to say “hi” back, she might not be interested. Try it a few more times, but if she never responds, let it go. You might be nervous about approaching her, but the only way you can really test your theory of whether she likes you or not is to actually talk to her. If she’s responded to your greeting, you can move ahead to actually talking to each other. Consider what you know about her, as that can lead to a conversation. Is she part of the drama club, or does she play sports? Engaging with her about school activities is a great first way to make conversation. You could even try to be funny, but that can be hard.  You could ask, \\"Is your training on the track team really hard?\\" or \\"What did you think of the pep rally?\\" You could also say something like, \\"Wasn't the food gross in the cafeteria today? Isn't it awful what they call food?\\" or \\"Don’t you think Mr. Harrison looks and sounds a lot like Yoda?\\" Now that you have some possible questions, find a good time to talk to her. It should be a time when neither of you is hurrying off to class or activities, and hopefully when you’re both alone. It can feel really awkward the first time, but it does get easier. If she really responds and starts asking you questions too, chances are that she is interested in you. If she doesn’t really respond, it’s likely she’s not that into you. For example, if you asked whether her track training was hard, she might say, \\"Yes, but I love it!\\" In that case, you could say, \\"Cool! What do you love about it? I've always thought about getting into running, but it seems really hard.\\" Summary:","output":"To see if she likes you, check if she makes eye contact and smiles at you. It's a good sign if she blushes or steals glances at you. Try to be alone sometimes, so she has a chance to approach you. Say \\"hi\\" as a simple way to connect. If she responds, start talking about things you know she's interested in. Ask questions and see if she asks you questions, too. This can help you figure out if she likes you. Just remember to be friendly, smile, and be yourself."},{"instruction":"Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Unlike the previous Omen films, the adult Damien is now entirely aware of his unholy lineage, and his destiny.An alignment of the stars in the Cassiopeia region of the night sky causes the generation of a 'superstar', described in the film as a second Star of Bethlehem. Thorn realizes it is a sign of the Second Coming of Christ and he orders all boys in England born on the morning of March 24, 1982 (the morning when, in the story, the Cassiopeia alignment occurred) to be killed in order to prevent the Christ-child's return to power.A subplot deals with one of Thorn's disciples, Harvey Dean, attempting to hide the fact that his own son was born at the appointed time; Dean not only fails at hiding that fact about his child from Damien, but is killed by his own hypnotized wife - likely in retaliation for refusing to go through with Damien's command to murder his son as a test of loyalty (the last child whom Damien suspects).Thorn has also become romantically involved with journalist Kate Reynolds (Lisa Harrow), a complex relationship which undermines his plans for political dominion for the time being. But Damien is not deterred from his plans and even focuses his attention on her preadolescent son Peter (Barnaby Holm), whom he takes as a disciple, partly by manipulating and exploiting the boy's internal desire to have a father-figure.Meanwhile, Father DeCarlo (Rossano Brazzi) and six other priests armed with the seven daggers of Megiddo - ancient holy weapons which are the only Earthly weapons which can harm the Antichrist - hunt Thorn in the hope of killing him before he can destroy the Christ-child. However, one by one, Damien kills off all the priests (some in horrific circumstances) until only DeCarlo survives.Finally, in spite of Thorn's efforts, DeCarlo informs Reynolds that the Christ-child is out of his...

The body of pensioner Edith Gravener, who suffered from dementia, was found inside her home in St Helens, Merseyside, by her daughter-in-law last Tuesday. After officers were called, a search for her missing husband Ronald resulted in the 78-year-old's body being found in Carr Mill Dam, less than a mile from the couple's property, just hours later. Post mortem examinations showed that Mrs Gravener, a retired seamstress, died as a result of asphyxiation and Mr Gravener, a retired coal miner, of drowning. Edith Gravener, 79, was found dead at her home in Mallory Grove in the St Helens area of Merseyside (pictured), and her husband Ronald, 78, was found dead just a few hours later at a dam less than a mile away. Police confirmed that they believe Mr Gravener strangled his wife before committing suicide. A criminal investigation is now underway, with a file set to be prepared for the coroner. Stunned neighbours living in the sleepy cul-de-sac told of their shock after the bodies of the elderly couple were discovered just hours apart. One said: 'They had lived here for 20-plus years and were a really lovely couple. 'She suffered from dementia but he was totally devoted to her and cared for her around the clock. 'We used to see him going up the road to get his paper every morning. 'It's terrible what's happened. We've lived here for 30 years and nothing like this has ever happened around here before.' Another told how the first he knew of the tragedy was when police knocked on his door and told him that Mrs Gravener had been found dead and that Mr Gravener and his car had disappeared. He added: 'Whichever way you look at it, it's a tragedy.' Inquests into both deaths were opened on Monday afternoon. In the opening statements, it was revealed that Mrs Gravener's daughter-in-law, Amanda, had arrived at the house shortly after 9am on December 2 to take Mrs Gravener to see her GP, but had found the couple's property unlocked. Inside, she discovered Mrs Gravener's body and a note, penned by Mr Gravener, in which he allegedly apologised for his actions. A subsequent police search resulted in officers finding Mr Gravener's body in Carr Mill Dam shortly before 1pm. Police said an investigation into both deaths was 'ongoing' but detectives confirmed that they were not seeking anyone else in relation to either death.

Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city.

Samuel jotted down the essential elements and factors to consider while buying a computer. While discussing, Samuel learned that there are various types of computers, such as desktops, laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, gaming computers, and workstations. Samuel needed to determine which of these would make the best gift for Ryan. He considered factors like Ryan's preferences, usage requirements, and the computer's portability. One of Samuel's friends suggested that he could subtly inquire about Ryan's preferences and desires in a computer. So, Samuel initiated a conversation with Ryan, discussing casual topics like work, hobbies, and technology. He paid close attention to Ryan's opinions on various computer models and brands, hoping for some clues. Based on the conversation, Samuel now had a rough idea of what type of computer Ryan might appreciate. Ryan had mentioned a need for portability and expressed an interest in graphic design and gaming. With this information in hand, Samuel narrowed down his options and focused on high-performance laptops. Samuel took his research online and began reading reviews for various high-performance laptops on reputable websites, forums, and blogs. He compared specifications, prices, battery life, and display qualities to ensure that the laptop he chose would meet Ryan's multitasking and performance needs, as well as fit within his budget. Once Samuel had a list of potential laptops, he reached out to some of his tech-savvy friends again to help him finalize his decision.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Many people take it for granted that black is a color of bad things while white should always mean something good. This may be because, in their opinion, black is related to darkness and white to purity. However, that is not always the case. Did you know that the same one color may mean something differently in different places of the world? In the English-speaking world, black is the color of mourning--people wear black at the funeral. Red is concerned with danger or bloodshed . Yellow is the word for fear. If you are afraid, you are yellow. Yet none of these sayings is true outside the English-speaking world. In China and Korea white is the color of mourning. In Russia, China and some other countries, red stands for beauty, life and excellence. In Italy and Germany, you are yellow with anger, not with fear. Even within the English-speaking area, it is not difficult to find color contradictions .A redcap in the United States is a porter in a railway station. In Britain, however, a redcap is a military policeman. Both names are logical, because both men wear red caps. Similarly, the British term for an American white-collar worker is sometimes called a black-coated worker. One does not have to cross an area to find color differences. Would you rather be red-blooded or a blue-blooded? If we go back to the origin, we find that both terms are logical as both names suggest. The expression \\"blueblood\\" comes from Spain, where some noble families proudly told the world that they had \\"blue blood\\". Actually they meant that they had no Moorish or Jewish blood. But then why \\"blue\\" blood? Because they were fair-skinned, and it is only natural that their blood vessels  stood out appearing blue. Question: The best title for this reading selection is   _  .

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What two fleets were involved in the Battle of Bornholm?, using the article: Early in March 1676, a Danish fleet of 20 ships under Admiral Niels Juel left Copenhagen. On 29 April it landed troops on Gotland, which soon surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May, but experienced adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then already left Visby, the principal port of Gotland with a garrison force. He headed for Bornholm to join with a small Danish–Dutch squadron in cruising between Scania and the island of Rügen to prevent any Swedish seaborne reinforcement from reaching Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets met each another in the battle of Bornholm. Despite the considerable Swedish advantage in ships, men and guns, they were unable to inflict any losses on the allied force, and lost a fireship and two minor vessels. The battle revealed the lack of coherence and organization within the Swedish ranks, which soured relations between Creutz and his officers.After the failed action, the Swedish fleet anchored off Trelleborg where King Charles was waiting with new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to avoid combat with the allies at least until they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters. When the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May they were soon intercepted by the allied fleet, which then began a pursuit. By this time the allies had been reinforced by another small squadron and totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large and medium ships of the line. The reinforcements brought with them a new commander, the Dutch Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the most renowned naval tacticians of his time. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of Öland in a strong gale. The Swedish ships fared poorly in the rough winds, losing masts and spars. The Swedish officers formed a battle line that held together only with great difficulty. They tried to get ahead of Tromp's ships to gain the weather gage by getting between the allies and the shore, and thereby gaining an advantageous tactical position. The..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The two fleets involved in the Battle of Bornholm were the Danish-Dutch fleet under Admiral Niels Juel and Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, and the Swedish fleet led by Admiral Creutz."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

(CNN) -- What does it mean when a white sorority wins a competition that African-American fraternities and sororities not only created but also consider an essential part of their cultural expression? It means an uncomfortable discussion about race, history, culture and inclusivity that is not black and white. On February 20, the University of Arkansas chapter of Zeta Tau Alpha, a predominantly white sorority, won the inaugural Sprite Step Off stepping competition, beating two predominantly black sororities. Stepping, which began in the 1960s, is a intricate rhythmic dance that features synchronized foot stomps, handclaps, choreographed movements and chants. The competition was fierce, and all of the competitors fought hard for the 100,000 first-place scholarship. But this is the very reason why any African-American who dismissed the","output":"win as mere tokenism or cultural appropriation should take a closer look at the cultural exchange at play. The victory of Zeta Tau Alpha in the Sprite Step Off, while initially contentious, represents an opportunity for an overdue conversation on shared spaces, cultural understanding, and the shifting boundaries of artistic expression. In the face of an increasingly globalized and interconnected society, this milestone exemplifies the growing importance of diverse and inclusive participation. This extends beyond simply race relations to include wider conversations about gender, sexual orientation, disability, and social class. It is worth reflecting on how any institution that seeks to enrich the lives of its participants should be receptive to all voices and talents, regardless of their origins. Engagement with various backgrounds and experiences can foster growth, collective learning, and shared perspectives among increasingly diverse communities. Historically, black fraternities and sororities have created and supported stepping as a vehicle for building unity, camaraderie, and cultural pride. The art form has been integral to the underpinning social and political structures of these communities, allowing members to engage with their own history and identity. Despite its association with traditionally African-American cultural spaces, the appeal of stepping lies in the energy, passion, and creativity of its participants. It speaks to something more universal – a celebration of expression, unity, and self-affirmation. While stepping is rooted in African-American history and culture, it is not necessarily exclusionary in nature. Creativity and expression, after all, are universal human impulses. By participating in stepping, the Zeta Tau Alpha sorority showed an appreciation for the cultural value and impact of the art form. By not only participating but also excelling in the competition, they demonstrated commitment, dedication, and respect for stepping as an artistic and cultural practice. Admittedly, there may have been initial surprise or skepticism about the participation and victory of a predominantly white sorority in a historically black art form. However, such reactions should not be allowed to overshadow the larger narrative – one of cultural exchange, mutual understanding, and goodwill. Instead, this moment should be seen as an opportunity to challenge preconceived notions, build bridges across cultural divides, and create shared spaces for growth and learning. With the ever-changing landscape of racial, cultural, and social dynamics in contemporary society, finding common ground and fostering understanding is more important than ever. The victory of the University of Arkansas chapter of Zeta Tau Alpha, while perhaps unexpected, sparked a dialogue on the inclusivity and diversity that animate stepping and similar forms of artistic expression. Through continued communication, shared experiences, and open-mindedness, this dialogue can facilitate more equitable, supportive, and empathetic communities. In conclusion, the issue of a white sorority winning a predominantly black stepping competition is not solely about race or cultural boundaries. It is about embracing opportunities for dialogue, understanding, and growth, allowing the driving principles of artistic expression and cultural pride to transcend social and racial divides. By doing so, we can work towards creating more inclusive, diverse, and harmonious spaces in our society."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Process:  - Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral - A fossil is formed -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose animals die on wetter soil happens, how will it affect sediments will not build on the top of the animals.

The wood frog has garnered attention by biologists over the last century because of its freeze tolerance, relatively great degree of terrestrialism (for a ranid), interesting habitat associations (peat bogs, vernal pools, uplands), and relatively long-range movements. The ecology and conservation of the wood frog has attracted research attention in recent years because they are often considered \\"obligate\\" breeders in ephemeral wetlands (sometimes called \\"vernal pools\\") that are themselves more imperiled than the species that breed in them. The wood frog has been proposed to be the official state amphibian of New York.  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix.  - The true frogs, family Ranidae, have the widest distribution of any frog family. They are abundant throughout most of the world, occurring on all continents except Antarctica. The true frogs are present in North America, northern South America, Europe, Asia, Madagascar, Africa, and from the East Indies to New Guinea; the species native to Australiathe Australian wood frog (\\"Hylarana daemelii\\")is restricted to the far north.  - The Australian wood frog (\\"Hylarana daemeli\\"), locally simply known as the wood frog, is the only species from the family Ranidae found in Australia. The species is restricted to the rainforest of northern Queensland, the eastern border of Arnhem Land, in the Northern Territory, and much of New Guinea. Long placed in the \\"wastebin genus\\" \\"Rana\\", it is now in \\"Hylarana\\" together with such species as the common green frog of Southeast Asia.  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.  - The southern leopard frog ( Rana sphenocephala ) is a species of mostly aquatic true frog , found in the south - eastern third of the United States . There are two accepted subspecies .  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction.

Many times we find it hard to stay happy. When one problem is solved, another one comes up. People have money problems, work problems, family problems, health problems..... the list goes on. And we usually think that people who are happy and successful are having fewer problems than us. Look at the successful people we often mention. They have money they need, they have jobs they love, they have good friends, they have obedient  kids, they have the successful business, they have loving families etc. Everything goes well with them. That is why they are happy and successful. But in fact, the more successful you are, the more problems you have to face. More success means more challenges they have to face, and more success means more risks they have to take. Young and old, rich and poor, successful and unsuccessful, educated and uneducated, all have problems. The difference is that their problems are different from each other.  Rich and successful have big problems. Poor and unsuccessful have small problems. Still they all have problems which they can face. Successful people are successful just because they are ready to face challenges larger than ordinary people. Winning the US elections  makes Obama very happy. As a new US president, he has to face bigger challenges. He has to be more careful about his work he does, or he will lose his position . Looking at him, we may say he is lucky, happy and successful.

Summarize this article: For almost 40 years a bust has stood in Stockton-on-Tees in Country Durham commemorating match inventor John Walker.      John Walker invented the friction match in 1826 and sold his first from his pharmacy in the town the following year.      The inventor has been much celebrated by Stockton ever since and a celebratory bust was unveiled by the town's mayor in 1977. ||||| Walker did not patent his invention. Samuel Jones from London copied his idea and marketed his matches as \\"Lucifer's\\"!In 1826, John Walker, a chemist in Stockton on Tees, discovered through lucky accident that a stick coated with chemicals burst into flame when scraped across his hearth at home. He went on to invent the first friction match. Until the first half of the nineteenth century, the process by which fire was created was slow and laborious. Walker's friction match revolutionised the production, application and the portability of fire. Walker sold his first \\"Friction Light\\" on the 12th April 1827 from his pharmacy in Stockton on Tees. Walker's first friction matches were made of cardboard but he soon began to use wooden splints cut by hand. Later he packaged the matches in a cardboard box equipped with a piece of sandpaper for striking. He was advised to patent his matches but chose not to and, as a result, Samuel Jones of London copied his idea and launched his own \\"Lucifers\\" in 1829, an exact copy of Walkers \\"Friction Lights\\".      Walker did not patent his invention. Samuel Jones from London copied his idea and marketed his matches as \\"Lucifer's\\"! |||||","output":"The article talks about John Walker, who invented the friction match in 1826 and started selling it in Stockton-on-Tees from his pharmacy in 1827. Walker's invention greatly improved the process of creating fire, making it faster and more portable. Despite its revolutionary nature, Walker did not patent his invention, which led to Samuel Jones from London copying his idea and marketing his version as \\"Lucifer's\\" in 1829.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Mail lay scattered across the kitchen table. I couldn't put off sorting through it any longer. I checked the envelopes, putting aside the ones addressed to my husband. It had been over three years since Bob had died. To friends and family it looked like I had moved past the worst of my sorrow. I took care of my house, socialized and kept up with community. On the outside everything appeared to be normal. But inside I was anything but I worried I would never get better, never be myself again. They say sorrow has no set time limit, but I was so tired of feeling empty and hopeless. My sorrow was sharp and fresh as ever. It was like a wall of pressure in my chest, pressing my heart. I picked up a piece of Bob's mail and held it out to tear in half, but stopped myself from cutting up the envelope. The letter was from an organization that funded a Haitian orphanage called _ . Its founder, Carol Hawthorne, had given a presentation at our church. Bob and I had donated, and Bob ended up on the mailing list to receive the newsletter   with updates on the children. I hadn't read one since Bob died. But just three months before, in January 2012, the country had been hit by a terrible earthquake. In my depressed state, it hadn't even occurred to me to wonder whether the orphanage had survived. I opened the newsletter and was surprised to find out that My Father's House was still standing. Of course now it was more crowded than ever. At the bottom of the page was an announcement about an upcoming trip to visit the orphanage in person. \\"I should go.\\" The thought wouldn't leave me.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? the better film 's","output":"To determine the sentiment of the sentence, \\"the better film's,\\" it's crucial to analyze the surrounding context and overall message of the complete statement. In isolation, the given phrase is not enough to accurately judge a positive or negative sentiment. However, going by the words' meanings, the term \\"better\\" generally has a positive connotation as it refers to something superior or of higher quality compared to another, while \\"film\\" is a neutral term referring to a movie or a recording on film. Considering these aspects, we can tentatively lean towards a positive sentiment. Nonetheless, without a full sentence or context, it is impossible to say with certainty whether the sentiment is definitively positive or negative. For instance, if the complete sentence were \\"The better film's message was uplifting and inspiring,\\" the sentiment would undoubtedly be positive. On the other hand, if it were \\"The better film's ending left me feeling depressed and disheartened,\\" then the sentiment would be negative. As a result, any sentiment analysis of the given phrase \\"the better film's\\" in isolation would be limited and not entirely accurate. It's essential to have more context or a complete sentence to confidently determine a positive or negative sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Air has been the best-selling ultra-portable in certain countries over Windows Ultrabooks, particularly the United States. While several Ultrabooks were able to claim individual distinctions such as being the lightest or thinnest, the Air was regarded by reviewers as the best all-around subnotebook/ultraportable in regard to \\"OS X experience, full keyboard, superior trackpad, Thunderbolt connector and the higher-quality, all-aluminum unibody construction\\". The Air was among the first to receive Intel's latest CPUs before other PC manufacturers, and OS X has gained market share on Windows in recent years.

Question: Background: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease.  Paragraph: Margaret is a sophomore in high school who just started her Spring break. With a week off from school, her family is spending some time driving out of state to visit her grandma, Kathy, who has a cabin up in the snowy mountains. Margaret always enjoys spending time with her grandma because she has interesting stories and makes some of the best pie around. Also, they always go skiing when visiting the cabin so Margaret is excited for that.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Whose joints will be more sore after skiing? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided and the paragraph about Margaret and her grandmother Kathy, it is likely that Kathy's joints will be more sore after skiing. This is because Kathy, being in late adulthood, is more susceptible to conditions such as arthritis and experiences a decline in strength and stamina. Additionally, individuals in late adulthood often face weakening immune systems and slower reflexes, which may contribute to a greater likelihood of experiencing soreness or discomfort after physical activities like skiing. While Margaret, as a sophomore in high school, is still young and likely in better overall physical condition, she can recover more quickly from physical exertion. Her muscles, joints, and immune system are stronger and more resilient, allowing her to better withstand the strains of skiing. Furthermore, Margaret's youth likely grants her better reflexes, strength, and stamina, all of which contribute to a reduced risk of joint soreness following physical activity. In conclusion, although both Margaret and Kathy may experience some degree of joint soreness after skiing, given the age-related factors and known risks associated with late adulthood, it is more probable that Kathy's joints will be more sore after their skiing adventure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What was the last name of the person who was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge? from the following article ?  The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904. It remains standing to this day.In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia.

Summarize this article: See more of Lorene Bible on Facebook ||||| CHETOPA, Kan. — The latest search for a pair of missing Welch girls turned up empty.      Cameras were used Friday to seach a well on property in Chetopa, Kansas, formerly owned by a convicted murderer in hopes of finding the remains of Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman or a trace of anything that would help investigators solve the 16-year-old mystery.      “The only thing we saw was a old bucket,” said Gary Stansell, an investigator for the district attorney’s office for Craig, Mayes and Rogers counties.      Stansell said he continues to get leads on the case. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation classifies the girls’ 1999 disappearance as an ongoing investigation.      The three-hour search of the well was initiated after Lorene Bible, Lauria’s mother, received a private message on a social networking site.      “The person said come to the old Charlie Krider house and look in the well,” Bible said.      Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman disappeared after the teens celebrated Ashley’s 16th birthday with a sleepover at the Freeman family home.      In the early morning hours of Dec. 30, 1999, the Freemans’ mobile home in Welch went up in flames, and the charred remains of Ashley’s parents, Danny and Kathy Freeman, were found inside. Both had sustained gunshot wounds that shattered their skulls, according to autopsy reports.      The well, covered with a concrete slab, is around 10 miles north of the Freeman property on an empty lot about a block from the main thoroughfare in Chetopa.      “There are still people scared of whoever did this,” Lorene Bible said. “The fear for them is still there.”      The Chetopa land once was owned by Charles Christian Krider, 54. It was sold after Krider was convicted of second-degree murder in the 2004 death of Judith Schrum, who was strangled before her body was dumped in a Cherokee County creek, according to court documents.      Krider is serving a 14-year sentence, and his earliest possible release date is April 13, 2017, records show.      He was reported to be a close friend and co-worker of Danny Freeman and had several head of cattle on the Freeman farm, Stansell said.      “We’re waiting on the next person who can tell to go look here or you need to go look here,” Lorene Bible said. “I need information that will lead to something good.”      Bible said she receives about two or three tips a month that are serious.      “The law enforcement has been wonderful — whether in Oklahoma or across the state line in Kansas,” she said. “I’ll go on and see what’s next.” ||||| Fifteen years ago Tuesday, Danny and Kathy Freeman were shot and killed and their mobile home set on fire.      Their 16-year-old daughter, Ashley, and her best friend, Lauria Bible, were having a sleepover to celebrate Ashley’s birthday. The teens bodies were not discovered in the charred remains of the mobile home.      Working on the premise that intruders kidnapped and possibly killed the teens, law officers began a frustrating, seemingly endless search that spanned the United States, Canada and Mexico.      Today, law enforcement officers rattle off their names as one word.      Lauria and Ashley.      Their story has been profiled locally, statewide and nationally — and yet it remains unsolved.      Jay and Lorene Bible, Lauria’s parents, are holding a memorial service Tuesday in Vinita, in hopes that publicity might help stir up memories in the case.      “I still believe Lauria is alive,” Lorene Bible said.      The Bibles want all the involved law enforcement agencies — the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, the Craig County sheriff’s office, the Craig County district attorney’s office and the FBI — to sit down with them and release all the information and leads they have and work together to solve the case.      Surviving members of the Freeman family had Ashley declared legally dead in 2010, according to court records.      Meanwhile, investigators say that new leads have surfaced in the past months.      Once such item involves two people, presumably men that got into an argument with Danny Freeman two weeks before the shooting deaths, said Gary Stansill, an investigator for the district attorney in Craig, Mayes and Rogers counties.      “We learned that Danny told friends that two people came to the Freeman’s residence and there was a heated verbal exchange with one of the men,” Stansill said.      Freeman knew one of the men and the other he knew by reputation, the investigator said.      “We are not saying they are suspects,” Stansill said. “We just want to talk with them. If they have nothing to do with the missing girls or the killings, that’s OK — we just want to talk with them.”      Stansill said he doesn’t know what the meeting was about.      “That’s one of the questions we have,” he said.      Danny Freeman reportedly had a hand in marijuana sales, family and friends have said in the past.      “He (Freeman) did tell friends he had to run the men off and if they came back on his property he would run them off with a gun,” Stansill said.      OSBI spokeswoman Jessica Brown said the case is not closed as far as her agency is concerned.      Brown said the agency recently received a tip, “and we will run it out to see if it has validity.”      Brown said the state agency has investigated “hundreds” of leads and tips over the past 15 years.      “Just because it is an old case doesn’t mean it can’t be solved,” Brown said. “We have solved 20- and 30-year-old cases in the past.”      Solving the case depends on getting the right lead, she said.      “Relationships can change between suspects,” Brown said.      What happened?      The Freeman’s property is located just outside of the Welch city limits and at that time was identifiable by the mailbox that sat on top of an iron-chain stand. A half-mile dirt driveway was marked with a rock entrance that led to the family home, which was slightly visible at night due to the few pole lights in the area.      According to an autopsy report, a shotgun blast sheared off the bottom portion of Danny Freeman’s face and Kathy Freeman was shot in the back of the head and was found by investigators lying face down on the couple’s waterbed.      Danny Freeman’s remains were found the next day near the waterbed by the Bibles, who were searching through the ashes.      Danny Freeman’s extensive arrowhead collection was never found in the ruble. Lauria Bible’s car was still parked in front of the Freeman mobile home with the keys in the ignition. The teen’s purse, which contained money, was found in the charred remains of the mobile home.      OSBI investigators also found a small arsenal of weapons as they searched through the debris of the house.      Person of interest      Jeremy Jones, 41, a convicted killer and rapist who once lived in Miami, OK, was a person of interest in the Freemans’ deaths.      “I believe he knows something about the case,” Lorene Bible said.      Arrest records show Jones was arrested on complaints of public drunkenness and possession of drug paraphernalia at 4 a.m. Dec. 30, 1999, roughly 18 miles from the Freeman’s farm.      Jones confessed to killing the couple and setting their mobile home on fire over a drug debt and taking the teenagers to Galena, Kan., where he said he shot them and threw their bodies into an abandoned mine.      A search of the area in June 2005 turned up nothing, and Jones recanted his confession. He has not been charged in the case.      He is now on Alabama’s death row for the murder and rape of a woman from Turnerville, Ala. ||||| By Tiffany Alaniz      Quick Facts:      Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman disappeared in 1999      Her mother, Lorena, wants anyone who has called tips over 16 years to re-file tips      New Facebook page set up to get tips to find Lauria Bible      Citing changes in staffing, a mother wants help to strengthen a missing person’s investigation.

Her father is disabled, so the modest profit the two of them earn must cover food, clothing and other necessities for all seven children and their parents. Despite having precious little time to study, Rashida is one of the top students at her junior secondary school. But with so much responsibility on her small shoulders, she admits that it is sometimes hard for her to imagine a more promising future. Last year, Rashida was invited to join 155 other girls at Camfed Ghana's first Girls' Career Camp, a program designed to inspire girls growing up in the country's Northern Region to dream big, and to support them to pursue those dreams. \\"We organized this camp because we wanted to let girls know that even if they are struggling with poverty, their lives will not be defined by limitations,\\" says Dolores Dickson, Camfed Ghana's Executive Director. Over the course of five days, the camp led the junior and secondary school students through a range of experiences and career opportunities that were entirely new to them. Dr. Agnes Apusiga, a lecturer from the University of Development Studies, ran the workshop on goal-setting and career choices, describing the universities and training colleges in Ghana that could help them achieve their dreams. Participants then visited the University for Development Studies, where they toured the medical school and science labs. Another highlight was a workshop at the computer lab at Tamale Secondary School. Many of the girls had studied information technology from a book but had never before seen a computer. \\"When the girls arrived at camp, they were not ambitious, because they didn't have any idea what the world held for them,\\" says Eugenia Ayagiba, Project Officer with Camfed Ghana. \\"Many had scarcely traveled beyond their own villages.\\" \\"I think the most important thing that happened at the camp is that we opened a...

On a scale of 0 to 5, where 5 would be an exact match, the user has asked for a 3.  Step 2: Determine the key elements of the original sentence The original sentence includes these primary elements: an animal (dog), an action (laying), and an object (pet jacket). Step 3: Create a similar sentence To meet the '3 out of 5' similarity requirement, I need to create a sentence that keeps the primary elements (animal, action, object) but changes some aspect of these elements.  Step 4: Justification of the proposed sentence  \\"A puppy is resting in a pet coat.\\" This statement maintains the original elements: the animal (dog replaced with puppy), the action (laying replaced with resting), and the object (pet jacket replaced with pet coat). The changes are not too drastic but there's enough difference to warrant a similarity of around 3 out of 5. The action is comparable and the object is essentially the same, but using different terminology.

Continue writing the following text. Prior to the 80\\"s theme party, Kenneth studied the clothing styles, while Nick went partying, so when at the theme party","output":", Kenneth arrived feeling prepared and excited, dressed to impress in his carefully curated outfit. He had chosen a combination of some of the most iconic trends of the 80s, hoping to achieve an authentic and stylish look that would be a conversation starter. His outfit consisted of a vintage washed denim jacket covered in colorful patches, each one representing a different memorable aspect of the decade, such as famous movies, music artists and popular slang phrases. He wore a tight neon-colored graphic t-shirt depicting a well-known 80s band underneath. Kenneth also embraced the trend of high-waisted jeans, pairing them with a flashy white studded belt. Accessorizing his outfit was just as important to Kenneth, as he knew that the decade was defined by bold, statement-making fashion. He wore a pair of fingerless gloves, a bright colored bandana tied around his neck and his most prized possession, an original pair of white high-top sneakers that he had carefully restored to their former glory. To complete his look, Kenneth styled his hair in a wild, yet purposeful, manner which was inspired by musicians like Billy Idol and David Bowie. He opted for a voluminous messy-up texture, using plenty of hairspray to ensure his hair stayed put throughout the evening. Meanwhile, Nick, unaware of the details of an 80s theme and uninterested in preparing, decided to wing it. He threw on a pair of loose-fitting jeans, a plain t-shirt and had no distinctive hairstyle. He naively thought that his spontaneous party-animal attitude would be enough to impress the guests. As the two friends arrived at the 80's theme party, they were met with an array of vibrant and nostalgic decorations. The room was filled with neon streamers, disco balls and pop culture posters referencing popular movies, television shows and music icons of the era. The playlist was a carefully curated mix of the decade's most beloved and dance-worthy hits. As guests mingled and sipped on their period-appropriate cocktails, it quickly became apparent that Kenneth's extensive preparation and research had paid off. Not only did he look the part, but he was also well-versed in the decade's music, films, and slang, making him a popular addition to conversations throughout the evening. In contrast, Nick's lack of effort became evident as partygoers, one by one, expressed their disappointment about his seemingly uninspired appearance. Despite his usually outgoing nature, Nick found it difficult to connect with other guests, who were deeply engaged in discussions about their favorite 80s memories, trivia, and references. As the night wore on, Kenneth and Nick's experiences at the theme party became vastly different. Kenneth found himself immersed in a world he had grown to love – dancing to classic hits, singing karaoke with newfound friends, and taking part in 80s-themed games and contests. He even won the \\"Best Dressed\\" award, which boosted his confidence and love for the decade. On the other hand, Nick couldn't help but feel out of place and slightly regretful about his lack of preparation. He quickly realized that not taking the time to appreciate and understand the 80s had hindered his experience and ability to connect with others at the party. Their contrasting experiences at the 80s theme party served as a valuable lesson for the pair. Kenneth's dedication to understanding and embracing the decade's culture showed just how much impact one's effort and preparedness could have on their experiences and their ability to connect with others. For Nick, it highlighted the importance of respecting the themes of such events and not relying solely on his charismatic personality to carry him through the evening. In the end, both Kenneth and Nick walked away from the 80s-themed party having gained valuable insights into the power of preparation, understanding, and authenticity – concepts that, while initially inspired by the vibrant, wild and eclectic world of the 1980s, could be applied to many aspects of their lives moving forward."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sir Donald George Bradman, AC (27 August 1908 - 25 February 2001), often referred to as \\"The Don\\", was an Australian international cricketer, widely acknowledged as the greatest batsman of all time. Bradman's career Test batting average of 99.94 has been cited as the greatest achievement by any sportsman in any major sport. The story that the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore. Bradman's meteoric rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years. In 1930-31, against the first West Indian side to visit Australia, Bradman's scoring was more sedate than in England--although he did make 223 in 297 minutes in the Third Test at Brisbane and 152 in 154 minutes in the following Test at Melbourne. However, he scored quickly in a very successful sequence of innings against the South Africans in the Australian summer of 1931-32. For NSW against the tourists, he made 30, 135 and 219. In the Test matches, he scored 226 (277 minutes), 112 (155 minutes), 2 and 167 (183 minutes); his 299 not out in the Fourth Test, at Adelaide, set a new record for the highest score in a Test in Australia. Australia won nine of the ten Tests played over the two series.  At this point, Bradman had played 15 Test matches since the beginning of 1930, scoring 2,227 runs at an average of 131. He had played 18 innings, scoring 10 centuries, six of which had extended beyond 200. His overall scoring rate was 42 runs per hour, with 856 (or 38.5% of his tally) scored in boundaries. Significantly, he had not hit a six, which typified Bradman's attitude: if he hit the ball along the ground, then it could not be caught. During this phase of his career, his youth and natural fitness allowed him to adopt a \\"machine-like\\" approach to batting. The South African fast bowler Sandy Bell described bowling to him as, \\"heart-breaking ... with his sort of cynical grin, which rather reminds one of the Sphinx ... he never seems to perspire\\".  Between these two seasons, Bradman seriously contemplated playing professional cricket in England with the Lancashire League club Accrington, a move that, according to the rules of the day, would have ended his Test career. A consortium of three Sydney businesses offered an alternative. They devised a two-year contract whereby Bradman wrote for Associated Newspapers, broadcast on Radio 2UE and promoted the menswear retailing chain FJ Palmer and Son. However, the contract increased Bradman's dependence on his public profile, making it more difficult to maintain the privacy that he ardently desired.  Bradman's chaotic wedding to Jessie Menzies in April 1932 epitomised these new and unwelcome intrusions into his private life. The church \\"was under siege all throughout the day ... uninvited guests stood on chairs and pews to get a better view\\"; police erected barriers that were broken down and many of those invited could not get a seat. Just weeks later, Bradman joined a private team organised by Arthur Mailey to tour the United States and Canada. He travelled with his wife, and the couple treated the trip as a honeymoon. Playing 51 games in 75 days, Bradman scored 3,779 runs at 102.1, with 18 centuries. Although the standard of play was not high, the effects of the amount of cricket Bradman had played in the three previous years, together with the strains of his celebrity status, began to show on his return home.","output":"This text is about Sir Donald George Bradman, an Australian international cricketer who is often referred to as \\"The Don\\" and widely acknowledged as the greatest batsman of all time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Generate a 1-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package org.ppsspp.ppsspp. Answer:","output":"Title: Extremely Disappointing, Full of Issues - Was Expecting More As an avid gamer and someone who really appreciated the idea of having a PlayStation Portable emulator on my phone, I couldn't wait to try the org.ppsspp.ppsspp app. Unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory, and I struggle to find any redeeming qualities in this app. Hence, I am left with no choice but to give it a 1-star review. First of all, the app's compatibility with various game titles is severely lacking. I tried to run multiple games from different genres and with different file formats, only to find that more than half of them wouldn't even launch. Those that did launch were either plagued with unbearable lag or failed to work at a crucial point during gameplay. For an app that is designed specifically for the purpose of playing PSP games on mobile devices, such poor compatibility is simply unacceptable. The user interface is another major letdown. It is not intuitive at all, and navigating through the app feels like traversing a maze. There are too many options and confusing settings that make the entire configuration process a tiresome chore, even for someone with technical knowledge. The absence of a proper tutorial or guide only exacerbates this issue for first-time users who are left to figure everything out by themselves. When it comes to performance, the app severely under-delivers. I experienced frequent crashes at random intervals, which only added to my frustration. Moreover, the app seemed to drain my phone's battery at an astonishingly fast rate, rendering it practically unusable for extended periods of time. Besides that, even on the lowest settings, the app heats up my device to an alarming degree, which is worrisome as it could potentially cause permanent damage to my phone. Another frustrating aspect of the org.ppsspp.ppsspp app is the inconsistency in its updates. Whenever the developers release a new version, it seems to introduce a new set of glitches and bugs that make the gaming experience even more disappointing. Instead of making any significant improvements, every update seems to take the app one step back. Lastly, the customer support is virtually nonexistent. I reached out to the developers on multiple occasions to report issues, ask for guidance, or inquire about potential fixes to the existing problems, but have yet to receive any response. This lack of support further highlights the app's inadequacies and showcases the developers' lack of commitment to their users. All in all, the org.ppsspp.ppsspp app is a massive disappointment and falls short on numerous fronts. Between its poor compatibility, counter-intuitive interface, dismal performance, unreliable updates, and nonexistent support, the app is hardly worth anybody's time or effort. It is incredibly unfortunate to see such an amazing concept so poorly executed. Until the developers seriously address these issues and deliver significant improvements, I would strongly advise users to look for better alternatives in the market."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"First, I want to say, if you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts, please reach out to a professional or a trusted adult for help. It's important to take these feelings seriously. Now, let me explain it in a more simple way: 1) Dealing with a person with suicidal thoughts because of a relationship: Imagine a friend is feeling really, really sad because they had a big fight with someone they love. They might feel like they don't want to be alive anymore. Your job is to be a good listener and remind them that they are not alone and that they should talk to a grown-up who knows how to help them feel better. 2) Best ways to deal with suicidal thoughts: Let's say you are the one feeling very sad and you don't know what to do. You should tell someone you trust, like a parent or teacher, so they can help you. Remember, it's okay to ask for help when we don't feel well. 3) Are these questions the same? While both questions are about helping people who feel very sad, they are not exactly the same. One question is about helping a friend, while the other question is about helping yourself.

Answer the following question: Given the below context:  In 1898 and again in 1899 Norman Heathcote visited the islands and wrote a book about his experiences. During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. \\"For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy\\". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.By the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Scottish Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.

Astana ( , ; Kazakh: Astana ] ) is the capital city of Kazakhstan. It is located on the banks of Ishim River in the north portion of Kazakhstan, within the Akmola Region, though administrated separately from the region as a city with special status. The 2017 census reported a population of 1,006,574 within the city limits, making it the second-largest city in Kazakhstan, behind Almaty. Can we infer the following? The combined population of the two largest cities in Kazakhstan is over two million.","output":"To infer the combined population of the two largest cities in Kazakhstan, we need to analyze the information given and follow these steps: 1. Identify the population of Astana: The text states that Astana has a population of 1,006,574 as per the 2017 census. 2. Identify that Almaty is the largest city in Kazakhstan, which means it has a higher population than Astana. Now, let's infer the combined population of Astana and Almaty: Since Astana has a population of 1,006,574, and Almaty's population is higher than Astana's, we can safely assume that their combined population would be greater than twice the population of Astana (2 x 1,006,574 = 2,013,148).

In fact, the context states the opposite.  Here is the evidence from the given context that supports the use of computer-generated animation in the making of Roving Mars: 1. \\"The film uses few actual photographs from Mars\\": This phrase indicates that the filmmakers did not solely rely on actual photographs taken during the Mars Exploration Rovers' mission. This suggests that some other method or technology was used to depict the rovers and their experiences on Mars.  2. \\"opting to use computer generated animation based on the photographs and data from the rovers and other Mars probes\\": This sentence explicitly states that the filmmakers chose to use computer-generated animation in the creation of Roving Mars. This choice was made to enhance the viewer's experience by generating animations based on the real photographs and data collected by the Mars rovers and probes.  3. \\"The film has been released on Blu-ray disc by distributor Disney\\": This statement does not directly relate to the use of computer-generated animation in the making of the documentary. However, Disney, as a distributor, is known for its expertise in animation and visual effects. This connection could further strengthen the notion that computer-generated animation was utilized during the production of Roving Mars. Based on these points from the context, it is clear that computer-generated animation was used in the making of Roving Mars.

You have to generate an answer to the question based on the information present in the context. Input: Context: Retinal ischemia/reperfusion (IR) is common in eye disorders. Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) are reported to initiate sterile inflammatory response. The role of PRRs in retinal IR injury is currently unknown. Thus, we investigated the expression and function of membrane and cytoplasmic PRRs during retinal IR.', 'Retinal IR was induced in adult Brown Norway rats by clipping the retinal vessels for 30 minutes. RNA and proteins were extracted during the course of reperfusion, and the expression levels of the following proteins were determined: Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR4, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor with pyrin domain protein 1 (NLRP1), NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18. TLR4 expression in the retina was studied using immunohistochemistry. In addition, a TLR4 inhibitor was injected into the vitreous body as a therapeutic agent. After the treatment of TLR4 inhibitors, the levels of the above factors were evaluated, the apoptosis of cells in the retina, expression of cleaved-caspase-3 (c-casp-3), death of retinal ganglion cells, and the retina electroretinography was assessed.', 'After releasing the artery clamp, the retinal vessels were reperfused in 5 minutes. During the reperfusion, TLR4, MyD88, TRAF6, NF-κB, NLRP1, NLRP3, mature IL-1β, and IL-18 were upregulated, but not TLR2. In the IR model, TLR4 was highly expressed in ganglion cell and glia cell. Additionally, the inhibition of TLR4 significantly downregulated the activation of NLRP3, but not NLRP1, and the secretion of mature IL-1β and IL-18 also were inhibited. Moreover, the TLR4 inhibitor partially attenuated the injury of the retina, including alleviated retina apoptosis, downregulated c-casp-3 expression, rescued retinal ganglion cells death, and restored retina function.Question: Is retinal ischemia/reperfusion injury mediated by Toll-like receptor 4 activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes?

(CNN)There has been a new twist in the curious case of leading golfer Robert Allenby who last month reported being beaten and kidnapped in Hawaii. Hawaii Police have confirmed they have arrested a 32-year-old man on charges of identity theft, attempted theft and unauthorized possession of confidential personal information. But in a press conference, Lieutenant John McCarthy told reporters there was no evidence of a kidnapping or a physical altercation. \\"Honolulu police booked a 32-year-old male this afternoon for three counts of second-degree identity theft, three counts of second-degree attempted theft, and one count of unauthorized possession of confidential personal information,\\" the police statement read. \\"The suspect was arrested at the Oahu Community Correctional Center where he was being held on a contempt warrant for an unrelated incident. The male has five previous convictions, including one felony drug conviction. \\"Investigators identified numerous unauthorized charges made on Mr. Allenby's credit cards. The charges were made at various retail and convenience stores on Oahu. \\"No additional suspects are being sought, and this case has been turned over to the Office of the Prosecuting Attorney.\\" Channel Seven in Australia reported that Allenby told them his initial version of events may not have been accurate because he had concussion and was drugged. Australian Allenby did not respond when contacted by CNN. The police also said there was no credible evidence the golfer had visited a strip club, as was reported by several media outlets. Allenby, a four-time winner on the PGA Tour, was in Hawaii for the Sony Open and after missing the cut went out for dinner on Friday 16 January with his caddie Mick Middlemo and another friend. Soon after the incident the 43-year-old said in an interview with the Golf Channel that as he left the wine bar he was approached by a group of men who then attacked him. \\"Somebody hit me and I woke up on the streets in the gutter. I'd been thrown out of the trunk of a car and I'd been robbed,\\" said Allenby, who was pictured sporting cuts on his nose and forehead in the interview. \\"It was scary, you just never know. You see it in the moves -- I've seen Taken and Taken 2 and it's kind of like a spitting image,\\" he added, referring to the 2008 French thriller that starred Liam Neeson. But a woman who witnessed the incident later told Australian network Nine News that she found Allenby a block from the wine bar and not 10 kilometers away as he had suggested. \\"Two homeless people were kicking me -- I don't know if they were just trying to see if I was alive. But they were trying to take stuff off me, but all I had on me was my clothes,\\" Allenby explained. \\"I started running down the street away from them once I'd pulled myself together, and this lady was helping me, she was fantastic.\\" Asked about the golfer's claims he was beaten, Lieutenant McCarthy said: \\"I don't know what physical altercation you are talking about. \\"There is no kidnapping investigation going on. I don't want to get into the details but his (Allenby's) story with us has been very consistent.\\" Allenby released a statement through the PGA Tour on Thursday. \\"I want to thank the Honolulu Police Department (HPD) for their ongoing work in this investigation,\\" he said. \\"As I have continually said, these detectives are the best at what they do and I was always confident they would discover what happened. \\"I continue to fully cooperate with the HPD and I look forward to this matter being fully resolved. \\"I also want to thank the many people who have expressed their support and concern for me in the last month.\\" Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Hawaii police have arrested a 32-year-old man in connection with the case of golfer Robert Allenby, who reported being beaten and kidnapped in Hawaii last month.

Please answer a question about the following article about Namibia: South Africa occupied the colony in 1915 after defeating the German force during World War I and administered it from 1919 onward as a League of Nations mandate territory. Although the South African government desired to incorporate 'South-West Africa' into its territory, it never officially did so, although it was administered as the de facto 'fifth province', with the white minority having representation in the whites-only Parliament of South Africa, as well as electing their own local administration the SWA Legislative Assembly. The South African government also appointed the SWA administrator, who had extensive powers. Following the League's replacement by the United Nations in 1946, South Africa refused to surrender its earlier mandate to be replaced by a United Nations Trusteeship agreement, requiring closer international monitoring of the territory's administration (along with a definite independence schedule). The Herero Chief's Council submitted a number of petitions to the UN calling for it to grant Namibia independence during the 1950s. During the 1960s, when European powers granted independence to their colonies and trust territories in Africa, pressure mounted on South Africa to do so in Namibia. In 1966 the International Court of Justice dismissed a complaint brought by Ethiopia and Liberia against South Africa's continued presence in the territory, but the U.N. General Assembly subsequently revoked South Africa's mandate, while in 1971 the International Court of Justice issued an \\"advisory opinion\\" declaring South Africa's continued administration to be illegal.

Lydia Lynch (Ann Magnuson), the realtor, explains that the previous owner was a reclusive millionaire who built the hidden panic room as a safeguard against intruders. It's protected with four-inch walls and an impressive security system built in complete with a separate phone line and security cameras situated throughout the townhouse. However, despite Sarah's intrigue, Meg is apprehensive about the room. Still, pressured by the tight market and assured that the home will quickly close, Meg decides to move in right away. After some light unpacking and a pizza dinner, they settle in for the night. Meg checks her daughter's watch, designed to track her blood sugar and keep her type 1 diabetes in check, before retreating to her room to bathe and down a bottle of red wine, clearly distraught over the move and her recent divorce.

Residents were told they had 14 days to respond to legal notice. Hampshire County Council has apologised for the 'breathtaking error' Article:","output":"Title: A Case of Bureaucratic Bungling: Misdirected Legal Notices Shock Stubbington Residents  In a recent turn of events that put a peaceful village in the eye of a potential bureaucratic storm, Hampshire County Council made a salient blunder, in inadvertently mailing legal notices to nearly 150 residents in the quaint village of Stubbington. This miscalculation, stemming from within the bureaucratic machinery, led to unanticipated confusion and concern amongst the ordinarily tranquil lives of the villagers, resulting in the council issuing an immediate formal apology for the gaffe. This delivery mistake was of no trivial nature, as the letters made recipients believe they had just 14 days to respond to the assumed legal notice. A fortnight—terribly short a span—to comply with what seemed like abrupt and unexpected legal obligations was understandably a source of shock and consternation for the peaceful residents of Stubbington. The repercussions of such an error sent reverberations across the quiet village, with an understandable air of concern and worry permeating across households and neighbourhood gatherings. Residents wondered if they had inadvertently run afoul of the law or if they had unintentionally overlooked a civic responsibility. Once the error was flagged, Hampshire County Council swiftly owned up to the mistake, referring to it as a 'breathtaking error' in their public apology. The council exhibited immediate transparency in an attempt to quell the unease. The council's public statement read, \\"We unequivocally apologise for this breathtaking error. We are conducting a rigorous internal investigation to determine how this could have occurred and to prevent any recurrence in the future. We understand the distress that this may have caused our residents and we assure them that the letters were sent in error. There is no action required on their part.” The council's swift response and promise to look into the matter did bring a level of respite to the shaken residents, assuaging their apprehensions about their purported legal responsibilities. The swift and unequivocal apology from the council helped bring a scent of normality back to the rustling leaves of Stubbington. However, the incident has brought to light the need for the implementation of a more robust system in place to prevent such mishaps from recurring. On the one hand, any oversight can lead to unnecessary distress to the recipients, and on the other hand, breaches of this nature can potentially damage the council's credibility, leading to a chink in their otherwise sturdy shield of public trust. In looking ahead, it is vital for Hampshire County Council to address two main aspects in the aftermath of this incident. First, a thorough analysis and improvement of their internal processes to minimise such bungling in the future. And second, to continuously reassure and communicate with the residents, thereby renewing their faith in the council's capacity to manage their affairs effectively and efficiently. In conclusion, the quiet village of Stubbington experienced an unusual period of uncertainty and concern due to the 'breathtaking error' by Hampshire County Council. However, the experience served as a stark reminder for all public service entities about the importance of precision, accuracy, transparency and accountability in their operations, and the impact that a lack of these can have on the communities they serve."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Given the task definition and input, reply with output. A ploynomial equation is a sum of terms. Here each term is either a constant number, or consists of the variable x raised to a certain power and multiplied by a number. These numbers are called weights. For example, in the polynomial: 2x^2+3x+4, the weights are: 2,3,4. You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. In this task, you need to compute the result of a polynomial expression by substituing a given value of x in the given polynomial equation. Equation weights are given as a list. x = 7, equation weights = [0, 8]","output":"Part #1: Understand polynomial equations. Usage: In the polynomial equation 2x^2 + 3x + 4, the weights are 2, 3, and 4. It meets the criteria because the weights are the numbers multiplying the variable x or its powers in the equation. Part #2: Represent polynomial equations with weights. Usage: The equation weights [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4, and [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. This meets the criteria because the given weights list corresponds to the coefficients in the polynomial equation. Part #3: Substitute a given value of x in a given polynomial equation. Usage: Substitute x=7 in the equation represented by weights [0, 8], which is 0x^1 + 8 (or simpler, 8). This meets the criteria as the given value of x is used as a substitute in the equation. Part #4: Compute the result of the polynomial equation after substitution. Usage: After substituting x=7 in the equation 0x^1 + 8, the result is 0*(7) + 8 = 0 + 8 = 8.

And the answer is...","output":"Alright, let's solve the problem step by step, remembering we're talking to a 5-year-old: 1. We have 61 oranges (o) and 19 more oranges (o). How many oranges do we have in total? That's right! 61 + 19 = 80 oranges (o). 2. Now we know there are 80 oranges on one side. On the other side, we have a box that can hold 106 oranges (o), but it's currently empty, so it has -106 oranges (o) inside. 3. Our problem now looks like this: 80*o + 186 = -106*o 4. To solve for the number of oranges (o), we need to get all the oranges on one side. Let's move the -106 oranges (o) to the other side with the 80 oranges (o). 5. When we move the -106 oranges (o), it becomes positive, so we add it to the 80 oranges (o). What do we get? Yes! 80 + 106 = 186 oranges (o). 6. Our problem now looks like this: 186*o + 186 = 0 7. To find the number of oranges (o), we need to get rid of the 186 we added earlier. So let's subtract 186 from both sides. 8. This gives us: 186*o = -186 9. Finally, to find out how many oranges (o) we have, we need to divide the -186 by 186. What do we get? That's right! -186 ÷ 186 = -1 So, the answer is: o = -1 That means there is one less orange than we expected, or we could say there's a missing orange."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Build a movie plot around this: Who causes a distraction, allowing Han, Sean, and Neela to flee? Twinkie The answer to this question is:","output":"Step 1: Develop the main characters and their relationships Our main characters are Han, Sean, and Neela. All three are street racers who form a bond over their shared experiences and love for fast cars. Han is an experienced racer, Sean is a newcomer looking to make a name for himself, and Neela is a fiercely independent woman who is trying to escape her past. Twinkie is their quirky and resourceful friend who provides comic relief and support to the group. Step 2: Introduce conflict and set the story's main goal The story begins with Han, Sean, and Neela embroiled in the cutthroat world of street racing, where they make powerful enemies. They become targets of a dangerous criminal organization led by the ruthless kingpin, Racer X, who wants to control the entire city's underground racing scene. The team's main goal is to bring down Racer X and his organization, while evading the authorities and Racer X's henchmen. Step 3: Create the build-up to the climax As the story unfolds, Han, Sean, and Neela score several wins against Racer X's organization, successfully disrupting his operations and gaining a reputation in the street racing community. Their targets are now painted even larger on their backs, as both the authorities and Racer X's henchmen are closing in on them. Step 4: Establish the scene for the answer to the given question In a tense scene where the main characters' backs are against the wall, they find themselves cornered at a big street racing event. Racer X's henchmen and the police surround the area, making it nearly impossible for Han, Sean, and Neela to escape. Step 5: Introduce Twinkie's involvement in the climax Now, let's answer the given question: Who causes a distraction, allowing Han, Sean, and Neela to flee? Twinkie. In realizing the grave danger their friends are in, Twinkie steps up to the plate and creates an ingenious distraction. Twinkie remotely hacks the race event's sound and lighting system, causing chaos and confusion amongst Racer X's henchmen and the police. Simultaneously, Twinkie compromises the engines of the henchmen's and police cars, rendering them temporarily unusable.  Step 6: Show the escape and resolution Taking advantage of the distraction caused by Twinkie, Han, Sean, and Neela quickly make their escape amidst the chaos. They hop into their fast cars and speed away together to a safe location. The group ultimately dismantles Racer X's organization and frees the city's underground racing scene from his control. Step 7: Conclude the story In the end, our heroes have managed to evade their pursuers and stay one step ahead of danger, forging a stronger bond. They continue racing and making sure the streets stay free from criminals like Racer X. The story concludes with Twinkie receiving well-deserved praise and respect from Han, Sean, and Neela for their heroic intervention. In conclusion, the movie plot revolves around the intense world of underground street racing, where Twinkie's quick thinking and resourcefulness allow their friends, Han, Sean, and Neela, to escape from their powerful enemies and achieve their goals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The Los Angeles Lakers rolled over the Indiana Pacers in Wednesday's the opening round game of the NBA championship series. Hypothesis: The Los Angeles Lakers will win the NBA championship series this year.","output":"From the context provided, we can only draw a limited perspective on the hypothesis that the Los Angeles Lakers will win the NBA championship series this year. While the information presented suggests that the Lakers had a strong performance against the Indiana Pacers in Wednesday's opening round game, it doesn't necessarily guarantee that they would win the entire championship series. There are several factors to consider in building a more thorough understanding of the hypothesis: 1. Strength and form of other competing teams: The NBA championship series involves multiple teams competing at various stages of the playoffs and the finals. The overall performance of the Lakers would depend not only on their success against the Pacers but also how they fare against other strong contenders in the series. 2. Key players' performance and health: The performance of any team in a professional sports league depends largely on the form and health of its key players. It is important to know the injury status of the Lakers' star players, as well as how they are performing throughout the season. 3. Consistency in performance: A single opening round victory doesn't necessarily indicate a championship-winning team. The Lakers need to maintain consistent performances over the course of the entire championship series. Some teams may excel in the early stages, but then falter as the competition progresses. 4. Coaching and team strategies: A team's success also depends on their coaching staff's ability to devise effective strategies and tactics that can exploit the opposition's weaknesses. Information about the Lakers coaching staff's success in this area would contribute to the hypothesis. 5. Historical performance in the championship series: While past performance doesn't always guarantee future success, it's worth considering the Lakers' track record in NBA championship series. Is the team known for multiple NBA championships, or do they tend to struggle in the latter stages of the competition? In conclusion, while the Los Angeles Lakers' victory over the Indiana Pacers in the opening round game of the NBA championship series is a positive indicator, it is not enough to confidently claim that they will win this year's championship series. Further analysis and consideration of a multitude of factors, including team performance, player health, coaching strategies, and historical context, are essential for drawing a more informed and robust hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What do Emma and Dean learn together on a deserted island? Movie title: The Blue Lagoon Movie plot: In the Victorian period, Emmeline Foster and Michael Reynolds, two British children, are the survivors of a shipwreck in the South Pacific. After days afloat, they are marooned on a lush tropical island in the company of kindly old sailor Paddy Button. Eventually, Paddy dies in a drunken binge, leaving Emmeline and Michael all alone with each other. Together, they survive solely on their resourcefulness, and the bounty of their remote paradise. Years pass and both Emmeline and Michael become tanned, athletic and nubile young adults. Eventually, their relationship, more along the lines of brother and sister in their youth, blossoms into love, and then passion. Emmeline and Michael have their baby boy, and they live together as common-law husband and wife, content in their solitude. But their marriage is threatened by the arrival of two evil traders, who force the child to dive for pearls at gunpoint, before killing each other off. Emmeline is reminded of the outside world and wants to leave the island. She fears for the child if she and Michael should die, and begins to think of his future. Michael finally succumbs to her pleading and they pack a small boat and leave the island. But becalmed in the middle of the ocean, they succumb to exposure. They are found by a British ship, but the film leaves their fate ambiguous. The answer is:","output":"Emma and Dean learn to survive on a deserted island together by relying on their resourcefulness and the natural resources provided by their remote paradise. They develop skills such as hunting, fishing, and building shelter.

Background: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart. Inspired by the farces of the ancient Roman playwright Plautus (251-183 BC), specifically Pseudolus, Miles Gloriosus, and Mostellaria, the musical tells the bawdy story of a slave named Pseudolus and his attempts to win his freedom by helping his young master woo the girl next door. The plot displays many classic elements of farce, including puns, the slamming of doors, cases of mistaken identity (frequently involving characters disguising themselves as one another), and satirical comments on social class. The title derives from a line often used by vaudeville comedians to begin a story: \\"A funny thing happened on the way to the theater\\". Context: A revival opened on Broadway at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on April 4, 1972 and closed on August 12, 1972 after 156 performances. Directed by co-author Burt Shevelove the cast starred Phil Silvers as Pseudolus (later replaced by Tom Poston), Lew Parker as Senex, Carl Ballantine as Lycus and Reginald Owen as Erronius. Larry Blyden, who played Hysterium, the role created by Jack Gilford, also co-produced. \\"Pretty Little Picture\\" and \\"That'll Show Him\\" were dropped from the show, and were replaced with \\"Echo Song\\" (sung by Hero and Philia), and \\"Farewell\\" (added for Nancy Walker as Domina, as she and Senex depart for the country). \\"Echo Song\\" and \\"Farewell\\" had been added to a production staged in Los Angeles the previous year and were composed by Sondheim. They had to close soon after Phil Silvers suffered a stroke. The show won two Tony Awards, Best Leading Actor in a Musical for Silvers, and Best Featured Actor in a Musical for Blyden.  The musical was revived again with great success in 1996, opening at the St. James Theatre on April 18, 1996 and closing on January 4, 1998 after 715 performances. The cast starred Nathan Lane as Pseudolus (replaced by Whoopi Goldberg and later by David Alan Grier), Mark Linn-Baker as Hysterium, Ernie Sabella as Lycus, Jim Stanek as Hero, Lewis J. Stadlen as Senex, and Cris Groenendaal as Miles Gloriosus. The production was directed by Jerry Zaks, with choreography by Rob Marshall. Lane won the 1996 Tony Award for Best Leading Actor and the Dramas Desk Award, Outstanding Actor in a Musical; the production was nominated for the 1996 Tony Award and Drama Desk Award, Revival of a Musical.  Every actor who has opened in the role of Pseudolus on Broadway (Zero Mostel, Phil Silvers, and Nathan Lane) has won a Best Leading Actor Tony Award for his performance. In addition, Jason Alexander, who performed as Pseudolus in one scene in Jerome Robbins' Broadway, also won a Tony for Best Actor in a Musical. Question: Did it win any awards Answer:","output":"Yes, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum won several awards, particularly for the actors who portrayed the role of Pseudolus on Broadway. The 1972 revival starring Phil Silvers as Pseudolus won two Tony Awards: Best Leading Actor in a Musical for Silvers, and Best Featured Actor in a Musical for Larry Blyden, who played Hysterium.  The 1996 revival, which opened at the St. James Theatre, was also successful in terms of awards and nominations. Nathan Lane, who starred as Pseudolus, won the 1996 Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical as well as the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Musical. The production itself was nominated for the 1996 Tony Award and Drama Desk Award for Revival of a Musical.  It is noteworthy that every actor who has opened in the role of Pseudolus on Broadway (Zero Mostel, Phil Silvers, and Nathan Lane) has won a Best Leading Actor Tony Award for his performance.

Given the below context:  The museum's founder Sigurður Hjartarson worked as a teacher and principal for 37 years, teaching history and Spanish at Reykjavík's Hamrahlid College for the last 26 years before his retirement. As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment. His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: \\"Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'\\" According to Sigurður, \\"Collecting penises is like collecting anything. You can never stop, you can never catch up, you can always get a new one, a better one.\\" The collection was at first housed in Sigurður's office at the college until he retired from his teaching job. He decided, more as a hobby than a job, to put it on public display in Reykjavík and was awarded a grant from the city council of ISK 200,000 to...  Guess a valid title for it!

For older models, check out buyer's guides from Mac Rumors and similar sites.  If you're new to Macs, visit a physical Apple Store for personal assistance. Just don't be tempted to buy on the spot — there are better deals. Apple tends to release new computer models every six months or less. If the current model has been around a few months, wait for an update. The \\"old\\" model will drop in price. Current or incoming college students get a major discount, as do faculty and staff at any school. Visit the online education store to get the cheaper price. After you choose a product and enter payment info, Apple will send you to another site to verify your status for free.  You'll need proof of your educational status (typically a student or staff ID). If you do not have this, call or visit an Apple Store for advice.  Look for summer back to school deals. Apple usually throws in a free 100 gift card to the App Store.

Remember to check the exact model of each computer. An older model can save you some money, but make sure it has the specs you need. Apple does have clearance sales, but they're not common.

Yes, some plots are a bit hard to follow, and The Bill does have a tendency to get violent, but it is actually an engrossing show, that I try not to miss. A vast majority of the episodes are very exciting and quite tense, and the acting is fairly good, though I do miss Roberta Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent. I will admit, I prefer the older episodes to the newer episodes, and it is a bit of a shame that the programme is now after the watershed, as I found it easier to watch when it was at 8.00. Still, why I like The Bill is because not only it is engrossing, but the cliffhangers at the end do make the next episode unmissable.

An eight-grade student's father was angry after his son received an assignment with a cartoon depicting political views on immigration policy. Scott Radies of Wisconsin said his 13-year-old son, Jarrett, received the homework for social studies class at Shattuck Middle School with an illustration of two bricklayers - one each to represent a Republican and a Democrat, while the bricks symbolized a 'pathway to citizenship'.

The assignment was intended to encourage critical thinking and observational skills, and it was not meant to sway the students' political affiliacies, the spokesperson added.  \\"We encourage students to think critically about a wide variety of views and appreciate the diverse perspectives that shape our world,\\" the spokesperson said. \\"This exercise was part of that broader effort to develop well-rounded, informed citizens who can evaluate complex information and form their own opinions.\\" However, Scott Radies argued the cartoon was inherently biased and created a divisive narrative in the classroom. He believes the assignment unfairly pits Republicans against Democrats in an unfavorable light regarding their views on immigration policy. Radies said that his son felt uncomfortable and thought the assignment put him in a tough spot where his own views were at odds with the political cartoon. Scott Radies shared the incident on social media and his posts garnered significant attention, with many people expressing concerns about the potential indoctrination of children with politically skewed views in schools. An online petition was started calling for more balanced representation of political viewpoints in educational coursework, which has been signed by over a thousand individuals. In response, the school district affirmed their commitment to presenting balanced views on all topics discussed in school. They stated they are reviewing the appropriateness of the material used in this particular assignment. \\"We need to make sure we're providing our students with a fair and balanced approach to complex issues like immigration policy,\\" the spokesperson said. \\"We’ll be meeting with educators and parents to discuss the situation and see what adjustments need to be made moving forward.\\" They also noted that they are planning a series of community dialogues to discuss such issues with parents and students, hoping to strike a balance while educating youngsters about prevailing social and political issues in the country. On top of that, they will be providing additional training for teachers regarding the sensitivity of these types of assignments, with an aim to better equip them in handling political issues in the classroom in a balanced, thoughtful and inclusive manner that respects the diverse political beliefs of their students and their families. Scott Radies stated that he wants the school to admit that the cartoon assignment was a mistake, and to assure that no other student will face such a situation in the future where they might feel their political beliefs are challenged. His hope is for a discussion where everyone’s views – including those of the students and their parents – are heard and respected. In conclusion, while the school district maintains that the assignment was intended to stimulate critical thinking and not to propagate a particular political bias, they recognize the need to review the material used to ensure no inadvertent propagation of a political bias, and aim to foster a better dialogue among their community. This incident has underlined the delicate balance that schools must maintain while teaching potentially contentious topics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The proposed £19 billion EuroVegas casino resort, which is planned to be built on the outskirts of Madrid, has stirred controversy among various sectors of Spanish society, despite the potential massive inward investment and job creation it promises. With a design covering an area approximately the size of 750 football pitches, the extensive complex is expected to include 12 hotels, six casinos, a convention center, three golf courses, theaters, shopping centers, bars, and restaurants. Furthermore, it is projected that the development process will span 18 years and create 260,000 jobs, providing a significant boost to the local economy during a time when Spain is grappling with a substantial deficit and an unemployment rate of 26 percent. However, not everyone in Spain welcomes the idea of such an ambitious project. There are several concerns and reasons as to why the EuroVegas plan faces rejection in various sectors of Spanish society. 1. Moral and ethical concerns: Some groups and individuals argue that the construction of EuroVegas could lead to an increase in negative social factors, including gambling addiction, prostitution, and organized crime. There is a fear that the resort will facilitate an uncontrolled proliferation of such issues, negatively affecting both residents and tourists alike. 2. Environmental concerns: The size and scale of the EuroVegas project have raised concerns regarding its environmental impact. Issues such as excessive water and energy consumption, waste generation, and habitat destruction have been mentioned as potential problems that could result from the project's development. 3. Cultural impact: Some Spanish citizens believe that EuroVegas could result in the loss of national identity and cultural heritage. They fear that the resort will contribute to an Americanization of their local culture by introducing a foreign business model that may overshadow traditional Spanish values and customs. 4. Economic concerns: Critics argue that the EuroVegas project could destabilize the local economy by shifting resources and focus away from more sustainable industries and towards an industry based largely on gambling tourism. There is also a concern that the employment opportunities offered will consist predominantly of low-quality, insecure jobs. 5. Political concerns: Some sectors of Spanish society fear that the development of EuroVegas could negatively influence the country's legal and regulatory framework, potentially leading to political corruption and the erosion of democratic processes. In conclusion, although the proposed EuroVegas casino resort project comes with the promise of economic rejuvenation through significant inward investment and job creation for Spain, a large portion of Spanish society remains wary of the potential moral, ethical, environmental, cultural, economic, and political consequences. This rejection signals that many believe the costs may outweigh the benefits in the long run."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Leila is brought in; Zurga is captivated by her beauty as he listens to her pleas for Nadir's life, but his jealousy is rekindled. He confesses his love for her, but refuses mercy (\\"Je suis jaloux\\"). Nourabad and some of the fishermen enter to report that the funeral pyre is ready. As Leila is taken away, Zurga observes her giving one of the fishermen her necklace, asking for its return to her mother. With a shout, Zurga rushes out after the group and seizes the necklace. Outside the temple, Nadir waits beside the funeral pyre as the crowd, singing and dancing, anticipates the dawn and the coming double execution (\\"Dès que le soleil\\"). He is joined by Leila; resigned now to their deaths, the pair sing of how their souls will soon be united in heaven. A glow appears in the sky, and Zurga rushes in to report that the fishermen's camp is ablaze. As the men hurry away to save their homes, Zurga frees Leila and Nadir. He returns the necklace to Leila, and reveals that he is the man she saved when she was a child. He recognises now that his love for her is in vain, and tells her and Nadir to flee.

James Bulger's mother Denise Fergus says she is 'shocked and upset' to hear of Mr Bradley's death.","output":"Title: Tragic Death of Innocent Man Mistaken for Child Killer Shocks Community and Bulger Family Introduction A tragic event unfolded last weekend as 36-year old Scott Bradley was found dead in his home, after being subjected to months of harassment over unfounded rumors that he was involved in the murder of toddler James Bulger. The shockwaves of this event have deeply distressed the community, including Bulger's mother Denise Fergus, who expressed her condolences to Bradley's family. Background James Bulger, a two-year old British boy, was killed by two ten-year-old boys in a horrendous and notorious crime in 1993. The highly-publicized case left a permanent scar on the nation's conscience and ever since, the public has remained highly sensitive to those connected or involved in any capacity to the case. Scott Bradley's Ordeal Scott Bradley, a 36-year-old man unrelated to the Bulger case, was tragically found dead at his residence on Sunday. For months, he had been relentlessly targeted over false rumors that he was one of the child killers. Unfortunately, the constant harassment and emotional distress seem to have taken a toll on him, ultimately resulting in his untimely death. Denise Fergus' Reaction Upon learning of Mr. Bradley's death, James Bulger's mother, Denise Fergus, expressed her shock and sadness regarding the situation. In a heartfelt statement, she said, \\"I am shocked and upset to hear of Mr. Bradley's death. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family during this extremely difficult time.\\" Fergus empathized with the pain of losing a loved one and called for respect and support for Bradley's family. A Call to End Unfounded Rumors This incident serves as a stark reminder of the severity of the consequences that can result from false accusations and the drawing of erroneous connections. The loss of Scott Bradley, an innocent man, should be a wake-up call for the public to refrain from spreading baseless rumors and to act more responsibly in the age of social media. Conclusion As the community continues to grapple with the sad news of Scott Bradley's death, we must take this opportunity to condemn false assumptions and urge everyone to think before they speak. We extend our sincerest condolences to Mr. Bradley's family and friends and hope that we can all learn from this tragedy in order to prevent similar events in the future."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

News article: What is Cupping Therapy Used at Olympics by Michael Phelps This week everyone’s talking about cupping, a therapy that some Olympic athletes competing in Rio have been partaking of. It caught people’s attention this week because the therapy often leaves round marks that look like bruises on the skin, but it’s certainly not new. The practice has been used in ancient Chinese medicine for thousands of years as a way to treat pain, muscle stiffness and even respiratory issues. Perhaps one of the most notable athletes to sport the signature cupping marks is Michael Phelps. Other athletes, including swimmer Natalie Coughlin have also embraced the practice, as you can see below. “That’s been the secret that I have had through this year that keeps me healthy,” said American gymnast Alexander Naddour, USA Today reports. “It’s been better than any money I’ve spent on anything else.” So how does cupping work? Either heat or air is used to create a suction in special cups that are placed on the body. The vacuum that’s created pulls the skin and blood vessels in toward the cup, which is why they can leave marks on the skin. Cupping is thought to pull blood to a certain area, and improve circulation and loosen up muscles and joints. There’s also some suggestion that it has anti-inflammatory effects. In the U.S. it is sometimes used in addition to acupuncture or massage. A specialist can apply the cups, though as USA Today reports, some athletes say they are doing it themselves. There is a difference between how cupping is practiced in traditional Chinese medicine and how it is used in Western medicine, says Dr. Brent Bauer, director of the Mayo Clinic Complementary and Integrative Medicine Program. Bauer says a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner would likely offer cupping as part of a larger integrative health check, which might include recommendations around nutrition and other health things, and not just as a one-off therapy. “It’s kind of an American phenomena, I think, to consider cupping by itself,” he says. In traditional Chinese medicine, the theory is that cupping can influence the flow of energy or “qi” through the body, says Bauer. If someone’s flow is blocked or stagnant, a practitioner might use cupping to impact the flow. Western practitioners may focus more on what the therapy might be doing to muscles or blood flow. Some question whether there’s enough clinical evidence to say cupping is definitely effective—though it has been studied. A 2010 review of 550 clinical studies, including 73 randomized controlled trials—which are considered the gold-standard study in the science community— concluded that the “majority of studies show potential benefit on pain conditions, herpes zoster and other diseases.” None of the studies reported serious bad health outcomes from the practice. Another 2014 review of 16 studies with 921 people reported short-term pain reduction from cupping. “I think you have to step back and say, if this has been part of an organized medical system for three thousand to five thousand years, we probably shouldn’t be too quick or too arrogant to dismiss it out of hand as Western scientists sometimes do,” says Bauer. “On the other hand, just because something has been around for that long doesn’t mean we should embrace it willy nilly.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"1. Cupping therapy, an ancient Chinese practice, has gained attention due to its use by Olympic athletes like Michael Phelps. 2. The therapy involves creating suction in special cups placed on the body, with the aim of promoting circulation, loosening muscles and joints, and potentially offering anti-inflammatory effects. 3. Despite being used for thousands of years, questions remain about the clinical efficacy of cupping therapy, though some studies have shown potential benefits for pain conditions and other diseases. 4. Cupping is practiced differently in traditional Chinese medicine compared to Western medicine, with the former considering it as part of an integrative health approach while the latter tends to focus on its physical effects on muscles or blood flow."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is a better than average silent movie and it's still well worth seeing if you are a fan of the silents. However, if you aren't yet a fan of the genre, I suggest you try a few other films before watching this one. That's because the plot just seems pretty old fashioned and difficult to believe in spots. But, despite this, it's still a good film and kept my interest. A nice lady unfortunately hooked up with the wrong man and ran away to marry him. The film starts five years later after she has come to realize that he is really a brutal thief. Despite this, she tries to make the best of it and not dwell on how good life had been before this jerk came into her life. However, the rent is due and there's no money, so the lady is forced to look for work. She becomes a personal seamstress for a rich lady whose husband is trying to swing a business deal. Unfortunately, the lady who they were trying to hook up a potential client with for a dinner party can't make it and the seamstress is paid handsomely to be the man's date. Well, like Cinderella, she cleans up pretty well and the man is infatuated with her! What to do now--given that she is actually married and the new fella wants to marry her?! Well, see the movie yourself to see how it's all resolved. I DIDN'T like how they handled the husband, as it seemed awfully predictable and clichéd. However, once he was out of the way, I do admire how the film also DIDN'T give up a by-the-numbers finale and left the film with a few loose ends. All in all, a very good film worth seeing, but certainly not great. Would you say this review is positive or negative?","output":"This review is mostly positive. The reviewer mentions that it's a better than average silent movie worth seeing for fans of the genre but suggests newcomers try a few other films first. Although they point out a plot they find old-fashioned and difficult to believe, they note that the film kept their interest. They didn't like how one character was handled, but they appreciated the film's less predictable ending.

Movie A movie, also known as a film or motion picture, is a visual art used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty, or atmosphere through the use of moving images. Movies are an ideal source of entertainment on a screen, as they are specifically designed to be displayed on screens, whether it be in a cinema, on a television, or a personal device such as a tablet or computer. Movies come in a variety of genres, such as action, drama, romance, comedy, science fiction, animation, and documentaries, which cater to the diverse interests and tastes of the audience. The process of film production, from scriptwriting to post-production editing, often involves numerous creative professionals who come together to turn ideas into compelling stories on screen. High-quality visuals, acting performances, musical scores, and sound design work together to deliver an immersive and enjoyable viewing experience. Cinemas, or movie theaters, offer an enhanced viewing experience with large screens and professional sound systems, allowing the audience to fully engage with the film. Additionally, watching movies at home through digital streaming services, satellite or cable channels, or DVD and Blu-ray players has become a popular form of entertainment, with audiences having access to an extensive library of films. While the other options, such as casino (B), theatre (C), show (D), and comedy (E) may provide some form of entertainment, they do not necessarily focus on screen-based experiences. For instance, casinos primarily involve gambling, and theatre focuses on live performances, such as plays or musicals. Shows and comedies can be a part of movies, television, or theatre, but they represent specific genres, whereas movies encapsulate a broader range of screen-based entertainment. In conclusion, the most suitable option to answer the question, \\"What do you see for entertainment on a screen?\\" is A. Movie, given its diverse genres, immersive viewing experience, and the fact that movies are explicitly created to be displayed on screens across various platforms, making it an ideal option for on-screen entertainment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It doesn't give any information about their intentions, emotions, or actions. We can only understand that they are at that particular location.

Next question: when did it become legal to advertise prescription drugs on tv?","output":"The history of advertising prescription drugs on television can be traced back to the United States in the 1980s. However, it was not until August 1997 that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued new guidelines which effectively made Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) advertising of prescription drugs on television legal. Before the 1980s, there were limitations on how pharmaceutical companies could promote their products. The FDA traditionally confined prescription drug promotion to medical journals and professional audiences, including physicians, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals. This was done to ensure a greater level of control and responsibility in advertising, while also aiming to prevent misinformation on medications being communicated to the general public. As the media landscape evolved and the potential reach of television commercials grew, pharmaceutical companies sought new opportunities to market their products directly to consumers. Initially, in the 1980s, some prescription drug advertisements did gradually appear on TV, but they were discrete and heavily focused on brand promotion. These advertisements often avoided mentioning therapeutic claims or specific benefits. In 1997, the FDA released draft guidance that set forth specific requirements and limitations applicable to DTC advertising of prescription drugs on television. These guidelines revolutionized drug advertising by allowing pharmaceutical companies to market their prescription drugs directly to consumers, in addition to healthcare professionals. The 1997 FDA guidelines mandated that DTC advertisements for prescription drugs must include a \\"major statement\\" that discloses the most important risk information associated with the drug, as well as a \\"brief summary\\" detailing all risks. Additionally, if the TV advertisement makes any effectiveness claims, it must present both the drug’s benefits and risks in a balanced and fair manner. To ensure consumer access to detailed information, these advertisements must also provide sources where consumers can obtain the FDA-approved prescribing information, such as toll-free telephone numbers, referencing print ads, or website addresses. Following the FDA's updated guidelines, DTC advertising of prescription drugs on television increased significantly. The United States remains one of the few countries, alongside New Zealand, where prescription drug advertising directly to consumers is legal on television. It is important to note that the practice of advertising prescription drugs on television remains a controversial topic. Supporters argue that it raises consumer awareness of available treatments and encourages patients to seek help for medical conditions. Critics, on the other hand, believe that consumer-directed advertising can lead to overprescription of medications and undermine the decision-making authority of healthcare professionals. As a result, discussions concerning prescription drug advertising on television continue to occur in both legal and public health spheres."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

BRIAN WILLIAMS, anchor: We begin with what may be the largest confrontation of its kind since the Korean War . Tonight South Korea is threatening enormous retaliation after an attack by North Korea , in a dangerous part of the world, where the chance of a nuclear confrontation already runs high on a good day. The first attack happened while most Americans were sleeping. It was after midnight Eastern time . The North fired a barrage of artillery at an island controlled by South Korea . Two soldiers were killed. After the volleys that followed, there were reports of dozens of homes and buildings on fire. President Obama has had morning and evening briefings. Here's a photograph of tonight's meeting in the situation room. Tensions remain high, with the South threatening a counterattack. We want to begin our reporting here tonight with our chief foreign affairs correspondent, Andrea Mitchell . Andrea , good evening.      ANDREA MITCHELL reporting: Good evening, Brian . This was basically an act of war. Arguably North Korea 's worst attack on civilian targets since the Korean War . The big question tonight, why did Pyongyang do it, and how will South Korea respond? The crisis began routinely. Eight PM Monday night, Eastern time , South Korea is engaging in a military drill after notifying the North . Midnight Eastern , four hours later, North Korea starts firing dozens of rounds of artillery onto a highly-populated South Korean island, killing two South Korean marines, injuring dozens more, including civilians. For more than an hour, North Korea unleashes a barrage of artillery, about 80 shells. South Korea scrambles F-16 fighter jets and returns fire almost immediately. 3:55 AM , President Obama is awakened by the national security adviser, Tom Donilon . 4:33 AM , the White House issues a written statement saying, \\" The United States strongly condemns this attack and calls on North Korea to halt its belligerent action.\\" 9:15, the Oval Office , Donilon and director of national intelligence , General James Clapper , brief the president. The US decides not to respond or escalate, urging South Korea to show restraint. In Seoul , South Korea 's President Lee Myung -bak meets with his generals and threatens \\"an enormous retaliation\\" if the North attacks again. In fact, this is the second attack from the North in eight months. In March, Pyongyang sank a South Korean ship, killing 46 sailors. Is all this a show of strength as North Korea 's ailing leader, Kim Jong Il , prepares to turn over power to his youngest son, Kim Jong-un ?      Mr. KENNETH LIEBERTHAL (Asia Expert): The younger Kim is being encouraged to show that he can be strong, that he's a tough guy. And so this is probably not the last such provocation we're going to see. And these are really acts of war.      MITCHELL: Special US envoy Stephen Bosworth , already in Beijing , pressed China today to get Pyongyang to stop its aggression.      Mr. STEPHEN BOSWORTH: We strongly believe that a multilateral diplomatic approach is the only way to realistically resolve these problems.      MITCHELL: China , along with the US, signed the armistice in 1953 that ended the Korean War , and is obligated to help police the cease-fire. But China has been reluctant, reports NBC Beijing bureau chief Adrienne Mong .      ADRIENNE MONG reporting: China is unlikely to do America 's bidding, but this latest situation puts Beijing in a delicate position. As an ally of North Korea , it has considerable influence. But China is also concerned about regional stability and afraid of being overrun by refugees should North Korea collapse.      MITCHELL: In recent days, North Korea also shocked the US by revealing that, despite tough sanctions, it has built a sophisticated uranium enrichment plant potentially capable of producing powerful atomic bombs. The Stanford nuclear expert who saw that plant briefed Secretary of State Clinton today. Tonight the president is calling South Korea 's president and the US officials here are hoping for a united front at the United Nations , even though that has not      stopped North Korea before. Brian: We're watching this one very closely. Andrea Mitchell , part of      WILLIAMS: ||||| SEOUL—North Korea fired artillery at a South Korean island near a disputed western maritime border Tuesday, killing two South Korean marines in a surprise barrage that kindled global worries about worsening relations between the countries.      In the wake of North Korea's attack on a South Korean island, John Bussey looks at how the incident differs from past skirmishes and what role China might play to lower tensions between the two countries. Plus, making art out of beef fat.      Victor Cha, Director of Asian Studies at Georgetown University, talks to Simon Constable about the implications of today's artillery rocket attack by North Korea on a South Korean island and whether it will lead to a full-scale war.      A South Korean military unit on the island returned fire, while South Korean military officials scrambled fighter jets. At least 16 marines were injured, military officials said. Three civilians were injured, and the island's 1,200 residents were sent scrambling for bomb shelters.      \\"The whole neighborhood is on fire,\\" said, Na Young-ok, a resident of the island, called Yeonpyeong, from a bomb shelter about an hour after the shelling began.      South Korean officials condemned North Korea and warned that it would respond in kind to further provocations, while South Korean President Lee Myung-bak convened an emergency meeting of defense and security agencies.      \\"The attack is a sheer act of provocation. Moreover, shooting indiscriminately on civilians cannot be forgiven,\\" said Hong Sang-pyo, spokesman for Mr. Lee. \\"Our military reacted immediately according to our combat rules. We will act sternly against any more provocation. North Korea should take the responsibility for this.\\"      North Korea's official media late Tuesday said South Korea's military fired artillery into water on the North's side of the maritime border while conducting a drill, and that in response it fired the artillery at Yeonpyeong.      A South Korean presidential spokeswoman said officials were exploring whether there was a link between the shelling and North Korea's earlier complaints about a large-scale exercise the South's military started this week. North Korea has complained in the past about exercises without retaliation, however, and the South's large-scale exercise wasn't taking place near the island.      A History of Korean Tensions A detailed timeline of the recent skirmishes between North and South Korea. View Interactive      The U.S. and European Union condemned the shelling, while Russia and China called for a cooling of tensions on the peninsula. Japan's government went on high alert, with Prime Minister Naoto Kan ordering cabinet members to step up information gathering and prepare for emergencies.      \\"The United States is firmly committed to the defense of our ally, the Republic of Korea, and to the maintenance of regional peace and stability,\\" the White House press secretary said in a statement, referring to South Korea by its formal name. The White House said President Barack Obama plans to call South Korean President Lee Myung-bak to discuss the attack.      The U.S. will stand \\"shoulder-to-shoulder\\" with South Korea over the incident, said White House Press Secretary Bill Burton .      Mr. Burton called the attack \\"outrageous\\" and said the U.S. wants to send its condolences to South Korea. Mr. Burton said the U.S. will work with global leaders in the coming days to figure how to best deal with North Korea's attack.      Col. David Lapan, the Pentagon spokesman, said that no additional U.S. military assets had been moved to the region, nor were any discussions of immediately holding military exercises planned.      Catherine Ashton, the EU's foreign policy chief, called on the \\"North Korean authorities to refrain from any action that risks further escalation and to fully respect the Korean Armistice Agreement.\\"      A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China, North Korea's main benefactor, called for peace and stability. \\"We hope all involved parties will do more to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula,\\" Hong Lei said during a regular news conference.      U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also condemned the attack and conveyed his concerns to the Security Council's president, saying the attack was \\"one of the gravest incidents since the end of the Korean War.\\"      British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant, whose country holds the council presidency, said he is in discussions with other council members and the secretary-general and that a council meeting is likely to be held Wednesday.      The incident comes after relations soured dramatically between the two Koreas over the past two years, as North Korea's totalitarian regime became angered at South Korea's decision to cut off economic assistance unless it ends its pursuit of nuclear weapons. The issue of North Korean nuclear weapons intensified over the weekend after the revelation that Pyongyang had already installed thousands of centrifuges to produce nuclear fuel at its Yongbyon nuclear facility      The exchange of fire also comes less than two months after North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il began a process of transferring power to his son Kim Jong Eun, a process that analysts have said is likely to be volatile as the younger Kim grapples for authority over the North's military.      The incident roiled financial markets in Asia, briefly sending the U.S. dollar sharply higher before it gave back some gains, on a flight from what are considered riskier investment. The Bank of Korea convened an emergency meeting to discuss potential effects. Several financial analysts quickly issued reports that said they didn't expect South Korea's stock market to be heavily affected.      The episode adds to a list of more than 30 fatal or life-threatening attacks by the North against the South—including plane bombings, assassinations and naval skirmishes—since the two countries fought the Korean War in the 1950s.      Most recently, a South Korean warship sank in March about 40 miles west of the island struck Tuesday. South Korea blamed North Korea for the sinking, citing an exploded torpedo it found and other evidence.      South Korea Under Attack View Slideshow Associated Press A train-station TV screen in Seoul shows smoke pouring from Yeonpyeong island Tuesday.      A spokesman for South Korea's Joint Chief of Staff said \\"scores of rounds\\" were fired by the North. The artillery was fired from positions south of the North Korean city of Haeju. Video captured by closed-circuit monitoring cameras on location showed people scrambling out of buildings as explosions rocked the island.      The artillery fire came without warning at 2:34 p.m local time and lasted for 65 minutes, military officials said. About 250 residents escaped the island in fishing boats and arrived in the port city of Incheon two hours later. As the sun set three hours after the attack, fires continued burning in numerous homes and buildings and smoke covered the island, according to people there and on a nearby island called So-yeonpyeong.      The incident shocked South Koreans, who have become accustomed through the years to brash statements and other provocations by North Korea.      \\"If this leads to any other provocation, it really will be disturbing in many ways,\\" Song Young-min, an insurance consultant and military reservist, as he watched the news on his cellphone in downtown Seoul.      Lee Eui-sup, who works at South Korea's National Pension Service, said he immediately suspected instability inside the North's leadership due to the succession process prompted the firing. \\"It is a serious problem but will soon disappear as it usually does, I believe,\\" Mr. Lee said.      From the island of So-yeonpyeong, residents watched as the rockets hit the larger Yeonpyeong island. Some sent photos and cellphone videos of the attack to South Korean TV stations. \\"When I heard the artillery, I thought it was a usual military exercise, but then I noticed the fire and smoke,\\" said Lee Seung-yeon, a resident on the smaller island.      What Happened When 2:34 p.m.—North Korea attacks Yeonpyeong island near disputed maritime border. South Korea returns fire \\"immediately,\\" the defense ministry said. A military alert for battle situations is issued. 3:28 p.m.—Local media report four South Korean marines seriously wounded by the North's artillery fire 3:40 p.m.—South Korean fighter jets are deployed to western sea border to counter the attack. 3:57 p.m.—President Lee Myung-bak convenes an emergency meeting of ministers. 5:19 p.m.—Meeting scheduled for Wednesday morning with South Korea's Vice Finance Minister Yim Jong-yong and other officials from the Knowledge Ministry, Financial Services Commission and Bank of Korea. 6 p.m.—President Lee's office issues a statement on the attack, calling it \\"clear military provocation\\" and warning of \\"stern\\" action if the North makes further military moves. Bank of Korea officials plan to hold an emergency meeting in Seoul to discuss monetary and financial market issues. 6:35 p.m.—The White House \\"strongly condemns\\" the attack. 7:11 p.m.—North Korea says it will continue to launch strikes if the South violates the maritime border. Source: Dow Jones Newswires      The two Yeonpyeong islands are the easternmost of five small islands that are within close firing range of North Korea. All are just a few kilometers away from the maritime border known in South Korea as the Northern Limit Line, or NLL, that was drawn up by the United Nations after the end of the Korean War in 1953.      The North has objected to the line since the early 1970s, arguing in part that the line forces its ships to take lengthy detours to international shipping lanes. Its objections intensified in the 1990s and led to two deadly skirmishes in the area in 1999 and 2002.      In 2007, leaders of the two Koreas agreed to turn the area into a \\"peace zone.\\" That vaguely worded agreement was struck just ahead of a South Korean election by an outgoing government and never implemented. It was interpreted in North Korea as erasing the maritime border and in the South as keeping it.      —Joe Lauria, Jieun Shin, In-soo Nam, Aaron Back and Megumi Fujikawa contributed to this article.
