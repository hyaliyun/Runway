You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Information:  - Erich Rudolf Bagge ( 30 May 1912 , Neustadt bei Coburg -- 5 June 1996 , Kiel ) was a German scientist . Bagge , a student of Werner Heisenberg for his doctorate and Habilitation , was engaged in German Atomic Energy research and the German nuclear energy project during the Second World War . He worked as an Assistant at the Kaiser - Wilhelm - Institut für Physik in Berlin . Bagge , who became associated professor at the University of Hamburg in 1948 , was in particular involved in the usage of nuclear power for trading vessels , and he was one of the founders of the Society for the Usage of Nuclear Energy in Ship - Building and Seafare . The first German nuclear vessel , the \`\` NS Otto Hahn '' , was launched in 1962 . A research reactor was installed in Geesthacht near Hamburg at about the same time which has over the years formed into a center for materials research with neutrons .  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - Quantum mechanics (QM; also known as quantum physics or quantum theory), including quantum field theory, is a branch of physics which is the fundamental theory of nature at small scales and low energies of atoms and subatomic particles. Classical physics, the physics existing before quantum mechanics, derives from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid only at large (macroscopic) scales. Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum and other quantities are often restricted to discrete values (quantization), objects have characteristics of both particles and waves (wave-particle duality), and there are limits to the precision with which quantities can be known (Uncertainty principle).   - In nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, nuclear fission is either a nuclear reaction or a radioactive decay process in which the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller parts (lighter nuclei). The fission process often produces free neutrons and gamma photons, and releases a very large amount of energy even by the energetic standards of radioactive decay.  - Habilitation is a post-doctoral qualification or academic degree at some European and Central Asian, North African, and Latin American universities. It is conferred for a habilitation thesis based on independent scholarship, which was reviewed by and successfully defended before an academic committee in a process similar to that of a doctoral dissertation. In some countries, a habilitation degree is a required formal qualification to independently teach and examine a designated subject at the university level.  - An urban area is a human settlement with high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets and in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources leads to human impact on the environment.  - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?  - The Spree is a river that flows through the Saxony, Brandenburg and Berlin states of Germany, and in the Ústí nad Labem region of the Czech Republic. Approximately in length, it is a left bank tributary of the River Havel, which itself flows into the Elbe and then the North Sea. It is the river on which the original centre of Berlin was built.  - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances.  - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes.  - Werner Karl Heisenberg (5 December 1901  1 February 1976) was a German theoretical physicist and one of the key pioneers of quantum mechanics. He published his work in 1925 in a breakthrough paper. In the subsequent series of papers with Max Born and Pascual Jordan, during the same year, this matrix formulation of quantum mechanics was substantially elaborated. In 1927 he published his uncertainty principle, upon which he built his philosophy and for which he is best known. Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1932 \\"for the creation of quantum mechanics\\".  - Coburg is a town located on the Itz river in the Upper Franconia region of Bavaria, Germany. Long part of one of the Thuringian states of the Wettin line, it joined Bavaria by popular vote only in 1920. Until the revolution of 1918, it was one of the capitals of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. Through successful dynastic policies, the ruling princely family married into several of the royal families of Europe, most notably in the person of Prince Albert, who married Queen Victoria in 1840. As a result of these close links with the royal houses of Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Coburg was frequently visited by the crowned heads of Europe and their families.  - The European Plain or Great European Plain is a plain in Europe and is a major feature of one of four major topographical units of Europe - the \\"Central and Interior Lowlands\\". It is the largest mountain-free landform in Europe, although a number of highlands are identified within it.  - Max Born (11 December 1882  5 January 1970) was a German physicist and mathematician who was instrumental in the development of quantum mechanics. He also made contributions to solid-state physics and optics and supervised the work of a number of notable physicists in the 1920s and 1930s. Born won the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physics for his \\"fundamental research in Quantum Mechanics, especially in the statistical interpretation of the wave function\\".  - A chemist (from Greek chm (ía) alchemy + -ist; replacing chymist from Medieval Latin alchimista) is a scientist trained in the study of chemistry. Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties. Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of molecules and their component atoms. Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, reaction rates, and other chemical properties. The word 'chemist' is also used to address Pharmacists in Commonwealth English.  - Ernst Pascual Jordan (18 October 1902  31 July 1980) was a theoretical and mathematical physicist who made significant contributions to quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. He contributed much to the mathematical form of matrix mechanics, and developed canonical anticommutation relations for fermions. While the Jordan algebra is employed for and is still used in studying the mathematical and conceptual foundations of quantum theory, it has found other mathematical applications.  - Neustadt bei Coburg (also written \\"Neustadt b. Coburg\\") is a town in the district of Coburg in northern Bavaria, Germany. It is situated 15 km northeast of Coburg, as its name indicates.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - The Nobel Prize in Physics is a yearly award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for those who conferred the most outstanding contributions for mankind in the field of physics. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901; the others being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.  - Otto Hahn, , (8 March 1879  28 July 1968) was a German chemist and pioneer in the fields of radioactivity and radiochemistry. He was exclusively awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1944 for the discovery and the radiochemical proof of nuclear fission. He is referred to as the father of nuclear chemistry.  - The Nobel Prize in Chemistry is awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to scientists in the various fields of chemistry. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895, awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. This award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on proposal of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry which consists of five members elected by Academy. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. The first Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 1901 to Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, of the Netherlands, \\"for his discovery of the laws of chemical dynamics and osmotic pressure in solutions.\\"    Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'occupation' with the subject 'erich bagge'.

Plot title: Hannibal Rising Movie plot: In 1944, Lecter is eight years old, living in Lecter Castle; constructed by his paternal ancestor, Hannibal the Grim, in the Lithuanian countryside. Lecter, his younger sister, Mischa, and his parents escape to the family's hunting lodge in the woods to elude the advancing German troops. Back at Lecter Castle, six Lithuanian militiamen (Grutas, Dortlich, Grentz, Kolnas, Milko, and Pot Watcher) request to join the Waffen-SS. The SS commander orders them to kill the Lecters' Jewish cook who was left behind, to which they gleefully comply.A Soviet tank stops at the Lecters' lodge looking for water, and forces everyone out of the house. However, the tank is then spotted by a German Stuka bomber, which sparks a firefight. The bomber is shot down by the tank, but subsequently crashes into it and the ensuing explosion kills everyone, except Hannibal and Mischa. The SS militiamen then loot Lecter Castle. Seeing their wounded SS commander, Grutas shoots him and takes his Iron Cross. However, the impending Russian advance forces them to hide out in the woods where they locate the Lecter lodge. The SS militiamen storm and take over the lodge. Finding no other food in the bitterly cold Baltic winter, the men look menacingly at Hannibal and Mischa.The movie then cuts to a scene eight years later inside Lecter Castle, which has been turned into a Soviet-run orphanage. A bully harasses Lecter, who has been rendered mute by his experiences, about not singing the orphanage anthem. The bully attacks his head, but Lecter blocks his swing with a fork, impaling the bully's hand. That evening, Lecter experiences a flashback about Mischa screaming in his sleep, which angers the youth commander, who locks him in a dungeon. However, Lecter escapes from the castle orphanage to Paris to live with his widowed aunt, the Lady Murasaki-Lecter. She gets him to speak for the first time since his childhood, and instructs him about flower arrangement, martial arts and ancestor worship.At a local market, a butcher makes a crude and racist...

It also educated us on the lives of the saints in that area. We felt it gave us an experience that most people are unaware of when traveling to such holy places. Because we read the book prior to the trip and took it with us, we had expections that we could actually experience the presence of the saints and we did.

Please answer a question about the following article about Religion in ancient Rome: Funeral and commemorative rites varied according to wealth, status and religious context. In Cicero's time, the better-off sacrificed a sow at the funeral pyre before cremation. The dead consumed their portion in the flames of the pyre, Ceres her portion through the flame of her altar, and the family at the site of the cremation. For the less well-off, inhumation with \\"a libation of wine, incense, and fruit or crops was sufficient\\". Ceres functioned as an intermediary between the realms of the living and the dead: the deceased had not yet fully passed to the world of the dead and could share a last meal with the living. The ashes (or body) were entombed or buried. On the eighth day of mourning, the family offered further sacrifice, this time on the ground; the shade of the departed was assumed to have passed entirely into the underworld. They had become one of the di Manes, who were collectively celebrated and appeased at the Parentalia, a multi-day festival of remembrance in February. What goddess was an intermediary  between the dead and the living?","output":"The goddess who served as an intermediary between the dead and the living in ancient Rome was Ceres. Ceres was a Roman goddess of agriculture, grain, and the love a mother bears for her child. Her role as an intermediary was significant as it functioned during funeral and commemorative rites when the deceased had not yet fully transitioned to the world of the dead. She allowed the dead to share a last meal with the living as a way to facilitate their passage and maintain a connection between the two realms. Additionally, the rites and offerings dedicated to Ceres played an important part in the overall process of mourning and honoring the deceased in ancient Roman society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: yeah they've they've got plenty of problems without the Iraqi problem Sentence 2: The Iraqi problem is one of their many problems. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"Yes, the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true. Both sentences convey the same general idea, which is that the entity being discussed is facing various problems, and the Iraqi problem is just one among the several issues they are dealing with.  The first sentence – \\"yeah they've they've got plenty of problems without the Iraqi problem\\" – uses informal language, and it implies that even without considering the Iraqi problem, the entity already has numerous problems. The repetition of \\"they've\\" could either be a typo or emphasis on the point that the subject has multiple issues. The second sentence – \\"The Iraqi problem is one of their many problems.\\" – conveys the same notion in a concise and formal manner. It explicitly states that the Iraqi problem is part of the various problems the entity is facing. In summary, if the first sentence is true, the second sentence is also true because both sentences signify that the entity is struggling with multiple problems, including the Iraqi issue. By acknowledging this common underlying theme, it can be concluded that the truth of the first sentence supports the truth of the second sentence as well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In his weekly commentary, Randi often gives examples of what he considers the nonsense that he deals with every day.  Beginning in 2003, the JREF annually hosted The Amaz!ng Meeting, a gathering of scientists, skeptics, and atheists. The last meeting was in 2015, coinciding with Randi's retirement from the JREF.  James Randi began a series of conferences known as \\"The Amazing Meeting\\" - TAM - which quickly became the largest gathering of skeptics in the world, drawing audiences from Asia, Europe, South America, and the UK. It also attracted large percentage of younger folks. Randi has been regularly featured on many podcasts, including The Skeptics Society's official podcast Skepticality and the Center for Inquiry's official podcast Point of Inquiry. From September 2006 onwards, he has occasionally contributed to The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe podcast with a column titled \\"Randi Speaks.\\" In addition, The Amazing Show is a podcast in which Randi shares various anecdotes in an interview format.  In 2014 Part2Filmworks released An Honest Liar, a feature film documentary, written by Tyler Measom and Greg O'Toole, and directed and produced by Measom and Justin Weinstein. The film, which was funded through Kickstarter, focuses on Randi's life, his investigations, and his relationship with longtime partner Jose Alvarez, a.k.a. Deyvi Pena. The film was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival, at Toronto's Hot Docs film festival, and at the June 2014 AFI Docs Festival in Silver Spring, Maryland and Washington, D.C., where it won the Audience Award for Best Feature.

However, Churchill could not ignore Gamal Abdul Nasser's new revolutionary government of Egypt that had taken power in 1952, and the following year it was agreed that British troops would withdraw from the Suez Canal zone and that Sudan would be granted self-determination by 1955, with independence to follow.

Movie title: Once Movie plot: A thirty-something busker performs with his guitar on Grafton Street, a Dublin shopping district and chases a man who steals his money. Lured by his music, a young Czech flower seller talks to him about his songs. Delighted to learn that he repairs hoovers, she insists that he fix her broken hoover. The next day she returns with her broken hoover and tells him that she is also a musician. At a music store where the Czech woman regularly plays piano, the man teaches her one of his songs (\\"Falling Slowly\\"); they sing and play together. He invites her to his father's shop, and on the bus home musically answers her question about what his songs are about: a long-time girlfriend who cheated on him, then left (\\"Broken Hearted Hoover Fixer Sucker Guy\\"). At the shop, the man introduces the woman to his father and takes her to his room, but when he asks her to stay the night, she feels insulted and leaves. The next day, they reconcile and spend the week writing, rehearsing and recording songs. The woman rehearses lyrics for one of his songs (\\"If You Want Me\\"), singing to herself while walking down the street; at a party, people perform impromptu (including \\"Gold\\"). The man works on \\"Lies\\", a song about his ex-girlfriend, who moved to London. The woman encourages him to win her back. Invited to the woman's home, the man discovers that she has a toddler and lives with her mother. He decides to move to London, but he wants to record a demo of his songs to take with him and asks the woman to record it with him. They secure a bank loan and reserve time at a recording studio. The man learns the woman has a husband in the Czech Republic. When he asks if she still loves her husband, she answers in Czech, \\"Miluju tebe\\",[4] but coyly declines to translate. After recruiting a band from other buskers, they go into the studio to record. They impress Eamon, the jaded studio engineer, with their first song (\\"When Your Mind's Made Up\\").

Question:   Rupert is evaluating the impact of factories on the natural resources of developing nations. If Nation X added 100 new factories, it will decrease or increase demands on their natural resources?    Paragraph :  Developing nations will also increase demands on natural resources as they build more factories. The answer to this question is:","output":"If Nation X added 100 new factories, it will increase demands on their natural resources.  According to the given information in the paragraph, as developing nations build more factories, it leads to increased demands on natural resources. This is because factories typically require raw materials, energy, and water to produce goods. When a developing nation adds new factories, these facilities inevitably consume resources that are derived from the environment, such as minerals, fossil fuels, timber, water, and other essential inputs. In the context of Nation X, as it adds 100 new factories, it means that these facilities would need natural resources to be used for the manufacturing processes and to operate their machines. As production increases, it puts a higher demand on these natural resources which leads to larger extraction, consumption, and depletion of the country's resources. Another aspect to consider is the indirect impact of increased industrialization on natural resources. When a country expands its industrial sector, this often drives urbanization and increases demand for housing, infrastructure, and transportation. All these translate to a higher consumption of natural resources, such as the land being converted for infrastructure development and the resources required for the construction of housing and transportation networks. In summary, Nation X's addition of 100 new factories will definitely increase its demands on natural resources, directly through the manufacturing processes as well as indirectly through other socio-economic changes driven by industrialization. It is crucial for Nation X to manage its natural resources efficiently and promote sustainable practices in its industrial sector to minimize the negative consequences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Boys between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 11 mg of iron every day. Pregnant women need the most iron—27 mg daily. Good sources of iron include shellfish, such as clams and oysters. Red meats, such as beef, are also a good source of iron. Non-animal sources of iron include seeds, nuts, and legumes. Breakfast cereals often have iron added to them in a process called fortification. Some good sources of iron are listed below ( Table below ). Eating vitamin C along with iron-containing food increases the amount of iron that the body can absorb.  Story: David works as a nutritionist with the public health department.

Here are possible answers to this question: - england - living less expensively - city - town - inside car  I believe the correct choice is \\"england\\", here's why: The answer is:","output":"England, and here is a detailed explanation why: The question specifically mentions two key elements: row houses and red phone booths. Let's analyze both of these elements to understand why England is the most suitable answer among the given options. 1. Row Houses: Row houses, also known as terraced houses or townhouses, are a type of residential architecture that originated in Europe. These houses are designed to be built in rows, with each house sharing a sidewall with the neighboring house on either side. This style of housing gained popularity in the United Kingdom during the 18th and 19th centuries, particularly in the Georgian and Victorian eras. Many British cities, such as London, Manchester, Birmingham, and Liverpool, are known for their iconic rows of terraces. 2. Red Phone Booths: The classic red phone booth, also known as the red telephone box or kiosk, is an iconic symbol of the United Kingdom. These booths, designed by the architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, were first introduced in the 1920s and have since become an internationally recognized symbol of British culture. The color red was chosen to make them easily visible, and for many years, they were the primary means of public communication in the UK before the widespread adoption of mobile phones. Now, let's evaluate the other options presented: - Living less expensively: This is not a location; it is a description of a lifestyle or living situation. This answer does not provide any information about where the row houses and red phone booths might be located. - City: This option is too vague and non-specific. Many cities around the world feature row houses and might even have red phone booths, but the combination of these two elements and their historical significance points to a specific country – England. - Town: Similar to the option \\"city,\\" this choice is non-specific and does not give a precise location or connection between the row houses and red phone booths. - Inside car: This option is not relevant, as it suggests a situation rather than a location. Row houses and red phone booths cannot be found inside a car. In conclusion, the most accurate and logical answer to the question among the given options is England. The presence of both row houses and red phone booths, as well as their cultural and historical significance, strongly suggests a typical British setting. Furthermore, none of the other suggested options provide a specific or logical location to associate with the combination of row houses and red phone booths."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: FERGUSON • The Aug. 9 fatal shooting here that sparked three months of protests and calls for change from around the world happened in less than 90 seconds, interviews and an analysis of police and EMS records shows.      The records, obtained by the Post-Dispatch via Missouri's Sunshine Law, provide the best timeline yet for the events surrounding the shooting of Michael Brown Jr., 18. Also released were police station surveillance videos that provide the most recent images of Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, who has stayed out of the public eye since the shooting. Wilson left the police station for the hospital two hours after the shooting, accompanied by other officers and his union lawyer.      They returned about two and one-half hours later.      Shortly after Brown's death, a grand jury began hearing evidence to determine whether Wilson should be indicted in the killing. The grand jury's decision is expected any day.      A FATAL ENCOUNTER      At 11:29 a.m. on Aug. 9, a dispatcher asked Wilson to help other officers search for a man who had reportedly threatened to kill a woman. At 11:47 a.m., Wilson said he would respond to a call for a 2-month-old with breathing problems. Wilson drove his police SUV from the west side of West Florissant Avenue to Glenark Drive, east of Canfield Drive and Copper Creek Court, where the fatal encounter would soon occur.      At 11:53 a.m., a dispatcher reported a \\"stealing in progress\\" at the Ferguson Market. The 911 operator was still talking to the caller in the background. In a second broadcast, 19 seconds later, the dispatcher says the suspect is a black male in a white T-shirt running toward QuikTrip, and had stolen a box of Swisher cigars.      About four minutes later, there's more detail: the suspect is wearing a red Cardinals hat, a white T-shirt, yellow socks and khaki shorts, and is accompanied by another man.      At noon, Wilson reports that he’s back in service from the sick-baby call. He then asks the officers searching for the thieves -- units 25 and 22 -- if they need him. Seven seconds later, an unidentified officer broadcasts that the suspects had disappeared.      At 12:02 p.m., Wilson says, \\"21. Put me on Canfield with two. And send me another car.\\" His call triggered at least two officers to head his way, including one who said he was close to Wilson.      Sources have told the Post-Dispatch that Wilson has told authorities that before the radio call he had stopped to tell Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, 22, to quit walking down the middle of the street. They kept walking, and he then realized that Brown matched the description of the suspect in the stealing call.      Wilson then asked dispatch for backup and backed up his SUV next to Brown and Johnson.      Wilson said Brown attacked him, sources said, and that they struggled over the officer's gun before Wilson was able to fire twice, hitting Brown once. Brown ran away.      Wilson has told authorities that he called, \\"Shots fired, send all cars,\\" on his radio, but during the struggle his radio had been jarred and the channel changed.      The Post-Dispatch reviewed radio calls made during that period on all St. Louis County police channels, the fire channel used by Ferguson and other channels publicly archived online and could not locate the call. At least one channel on the Ferguson police radio is \\"receive-only,\\" meaning that the call may not have been broadcast.      After the call, Wilson pursued Brown on foot.      According to sources, Wilson has said that Brown turned and charged, and that Wilson then fired once, paused when Brown appeared to flinch and fired again, multiple times. He said he then radioed for an ambulance.      Witnesses' accounts vary widely. Most saw only part of the encounter. Johnson said that Wilson grabbed Brown by the throat, and, later, tried to pull him into the SUV. Johnson also said that Wilson's fatal shot came after Brown turned around and was getting to the ground with his hands in the air.      Other witnesses have said that Brown stood still or walked, staggered, stumbled or fell toward Wilson before he was killed. Some witnesses said Brown's hands were up; others said they were not.      HELP ARRIVES      Forty-one seconds after Wilson's call, unit 25 reported that he was about to arrive at Wilson's location, saying he was \\"going out on Canfield\\" and accompanied by the sound of his racing engine.      Forty-eight seconds later, another officer had arrived or was about to, announcing, \\"22's out.\\"      At 12:03 p.m., an eyewitness to the shooting Tweeted:      I JUST SAW SOMEONE DIE OMFG — TheeavageEP (@TheePharoah) August 9, 2014      If his smartphone's clock, or Twitter's, agreed with the clock on dispatch records, Brown was killed less than 61 seconds after the dispatcher acknowledged that Wilson had stopped two men.      At one minute, 13 seconds after Wilson's call, an unidentified officer has arrived and asks, “Where's the other one?” referring to Johnson.      Eleven seconds later, there's a brief burst of static and an unintelligible bit of speech. A dispatcher responds, “10-4 on Canfield.”      Twenty seconds later, unit 25 called in to ask if the dispatcher could send a supervisor to Canfield and Copper Creek Court.      At 12:05, a dispatcher called for an ambulance, erroneously reporting that someone had been hit with a Taser.      By 12:07 p.m., a woman wailed in the background as an officer called over his radio: “Get us several more units over here. There's gonna be a problem.”      BROWN FAMILY LAWYERS RESPOND      Lawyers for the Brown family issued a statement Saturday saying that from the beginning the Ferguson Police Department has sought to “vilify the victim and put the shooter on a pedestal.”      The statement also said, “the audio clearly demonstrates that the initial interaction with the officer and Brown had nothing to do with the incident at the convenience store.”      Christine Byers of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report. ||||| A call for backup that a police officer claims to have made seconds before he killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, reportedly cannot be found in police recordings. The officer blames the problem on his radio.            Darren Wilson has told investigators he radioed “shots fired, send all cars” after a struggle at his SUV with Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, following the officer’s stop of Brown and a friend for jaywalking in Ferguson on 9 August, according to the St Louis Post-Dispatch.            Yet a set of recordings released to the newspaper by police did not include the call. Wilson is reported to have stated that “during the struggle his radio had been jarred and the channel changed”, meaning it was not broadcast to his fellow officers in the St Louis suburb.            “At least one channel on the Ferguson police radio is ‘receive-only,’ meaning that the call may not have been broadcast,” the newspaper said in its report on Friday evening. Wilson shot Brown repeatedly soon after allegedly making the request for assistance.      A series of witnesses told media in the days after the shooting that Brown had surrendered to the officer after fleeing and may have had his hands up. Wilson is said to have told investigators the 18-year-old had in fact turned and charged towards him.            The killing of Brown, who was African American, by a white officer led to nights of protests. Police clashed repeatedly with demonstrators, firing teargas and rubber bullets and making dozens of arrests. Ferguson is anxiously awaiting the decision of a grand jury on whether Wilson should face criminal charges for the shooting.            There was confusion over Wilson’s future on Saturday, after Ferguson’s police chief, Thomas Jackson, initially told a local TV news channel the officer would be able to return to duty if not indicted by the grand jury, before later saying the department had not decided whether to allow this.      Ferguson’s mayor, James Knowles, also appeared to dismiss Jackson’s earlier claim. “Nothing has been decided as to the fate of Wilson,” the mayor told the Wall Street Journal, adding that “it is an oversimplification of the issue to say he immediately returns”.      The new details of the day Brown died emerged in material released by police in response to an open records request. The recordings, the first of Wilson’s voice to be made public, trace the 28-year-old officer’s movements from a separate incident to his encounter with Brown.            After a robbery of cigars from a grocery store was reported over the radio, Wilson – identified as car 21 – asked colleagues dealing with it if he could assist around noon. “Twenty-one to 25 and 22 – do you guys need me?” he asked. About two minutes later, he said over his radio: “Put me on Canfield with two. And send me another car.” Canfield Drive is the street on which Brown was shot dead.            While it is unclear from the recording, Wilson has reportedly testified that at this point he asked Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, to get out of the road, and then realised that Brown matched the description given for one of the grocery store robbers. During the next minute a rapper going by the name Thee Pharoah tweeted that he had witnessed the killing.            In remarks to the media in August, Ferguson’s police chief, Thomas Jackson, initially suggested Wilson had stopped Brown for this reason. Within hours he said the stop was not linked to the robbery, then finally said Wilson had made the connection during the encounter.

Bill poured the entire bag of Spinach into the mixing bowl until the","output":"mountain of green leaves threatened to overflow onto the kitchen counter. With a half-smile playing on his lips, Bill couldn't help but chuckle at the thought of his friends’ reactions when they tasted his culinary creation. He had decided to host a dinner for his closest friends – a decision that originally stemmed from a friendly wager on who could prepare the most delectable dish using unexpected ingredients. Bill had chosen spinach as his secret weapon, determined to dispel the old myth that healthy food couldn't possibly taste good. He had contemplated various ways to incorporate the leafy vegetable into a delicious and unique meal, and finally decided upon a dish that was sure to leave a lasting impression: Spinach and Artichoke Stuffed Chicken Breasts. He began by preheating the oven to 375°F, knowing that maintaining a consistent temperature was crucial to the success of the dish. He then turned his attention back to the mixing bowl, where the spinach awaited its transformation. Gently, Bill began to massage the leaves with a drizzle of olive oil, ensuring that each one glistened with a oily sheen. He then seasoned the spinach with salt, pepper, and a medley of dried Italian herbs before setting it aside. Next, Bill prepared the artichokes. He had carefully selected a jar of marinated artichoke hearts, which would provide a delightful tang to the dish while also cutting down on preparation time. He drained the jar and chopped the artichokes into smaller pieces, their fragrance mingling with the scent of herbs wafting from the seasoned spinach. With a skilled hand, he mixed the artichokes into the spinach, along with a generous helping of grated parmesan cheese and a dollop of cream cheese. The chicken breasts, meanwhile, had been sitting patiently, as if anticipating their moment in the culinary spotlight. Bill had already taken the time to trim any excess fat from the meat and had sliced a deep, horizontal pocket into each breast, careful not to cut all the way through. He knew that this step was essential for both housing and containing the savory filling. Now came the moment of truth. Bill delicately filled each pocket with the spinach and artichoke mixture, taking care to stuff the chicken breasts as full as possible without compromising their structural integrity. Once satisfied with the generously-stuffed chicken, Bill wrapped each breast with two slices of prosciutto – a thin, Italian-style ham that would not only serve to lock in moisture but also lend a salty, savory depth to the meal. With the chicken now ready for cooking, he carefully transferred the stuffed breasts onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, allowing for easy clean-up and a perfectly cooked final product. He slid the baking sheet into the preheated oven, set the timer for 25 minutes, and allowed the enticing aroma of the cooking meat to fill his kitchen. As Bill cleaned up his workspace and prepared for his guests' arrival, he couldn't help but grow increasingly excited for the culinary experience that awaited them. He had put great thought and effort into crafting this extraordinary meal, and he knew that their taste buds were in for one unforgettable adventure. Once the buzzer signaled the completion of the baking time, Bill removed the chicken from the oven and allowed it to rest for a few minutes, enabling the juices to redistribute evenly throughout the meat. He then plated each spinach and artichoke-stuffed chicken breast, accompanied by a light salad and a glass of crisp white wine. As his friends took their first flavorful bites, the satisfaction on their faces told him everything he needed to know – his unique and delicious dish was a resounding success, proving that healthy ingredients could indeed create a truly mouthwatering meal."},{"instruction":"Q: Kai ate their fill during the only meal of the day.

Movie title: Perfume: The Story of a Murderer Movie plot: The film begins with the sentencing of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), a notorious murderer. Between the reading of the sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on the scent of a kindly girl selling plums (Karoline Herfurth) and startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her until the scent fades.Afterwards, Grenouille becomes haunted by the desire to preserve the woman's scent forever. After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with his ability to create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to convert scents into perfume. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. He also tells a story about a perfume discovered in an Egyptian tomb that was so perfect that it caused everyone in the entire world to briefly believe they were in paradise the moment the bottle was opened.When Grenouille discovers that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the scents of all objects, such as iron chains and dead animals, he becomes depressed. After receiving a letter of presentation written by Baldini, Grenouille leaves to learn a different method in Grasse. En route to Grasse, Grenouille realises that he has no scent of his own, and is therefore a cipher. He decides that creating the perfect smell will prove his worth.Upon arrival in Grasse, Grenouille catches the scent of the naive Laura Richis (Rachel...

Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths making them more susceptible to droughts.

People who are amusic are born without the ability to enjoy musical notes. Amusic people often cannot tell the differences between two songs. As a result, songs sound like noise to an amusic. Many amuics compare the sound of music to pieces of metal hitting each other. Life can be hard for amusics. In fact, most people cannot begin to understand what it feels like to be an amusic. Just going to a restaurant or a shopping center can be uncomfortable or even painful. That is why many amusics have to stay away from places where there is music. However, this can result in social loneliness. \\"I used to hate parties,\\" says Margaret, a seventy-year-old woman who only recently discovered that she was amusic. By studying people like Margaret, scientists are finally learning how to identify  this unusual condition. Scientists say that the brains of amusics are different from those of people who can enjoy music. The difference is complex , and it is not connected with poor hearing. Amusics can understand other non-musical sounds well. They also have no problems understanding common speech. Scientists compare amusics to people who just can't see certain colors.

There are gifts to give this month for Christmas, Hanukkah and the African American celebration of Kwanzaa. The traditional shopping season began last Friday, after Thanksgiving Day. Personal spending represents two-thirds of the economy, so holiday sales are especially important. Reports on November results have just come out. Wal-Mart is the biggest seller in the world. The company had expected growth of two to four percent in November, fueled by sales on \\"Black Friday.\\"  The day after Thanksgiving is called that. Storekeepers used to record profits   in black ink and losses in red ink. A day in the black means a return to profit.  The National Retail Federation estimated   in September that holiday sales would increase four and one-half percent this year. Holiday sales increased five percent last year, after poor sales the year before.  The business group estimated that Americans will spend 220,000 million dollars this season. It says they spent just over 10 percent of that last weekend.  Also, it says more Americans for the first time this season plan to use a debit card than a credit card for purchases. A debit card, also called a check card, is linked to the money that a person has in a bank. In other words, users must have the money before they can spend it.  About thirty - five percent of shoppers said they would mainly use debit cards, compared to 30 percent for credit cards.

Arab history in the United States goes back to the late 1800's when large numbers of Arab immigrants first began making their journey to a land known simply as\\"Amreeka\\". Historians generally describe Arab immigration to America in two waves.The first wave took place between 1860 and 1924.The first wave consisted of Lebanese and Syrian,and some Egyptian immigrants.These new immigrants,who were mostly Christian,came to America in search of better opportunities.Even the doomed Titanic,which set sail for America in 1912,had close to a hundred Arab passengers aboard.The majority of Arab-Americans today are descendents of the first wave of immigrants;they are the third or more generation Americans. The second wave of immigrants followed after World War II,caused by political unrest in the Middle East.This second wave of immigrants consists of mainly Arab Muslims and continues to this day. Arab-Americans make up 3 million of the population in the United States,according to demographers.And quite different from popular belief,64 percent of them are American-born.Eighty-two percent of Arab-Americans are US citizens.

Possible answers: + yes. + it is not possible to tell. + no.","output":"Yes, the hypothesis \\"The last Ice Age ended approximately 10,000 years ago\\" can be considered true based on the given premise. The premise states that ancient glaciers eroded many valleys and created space for lakes as they melted at the end of the last Ice Age, which occurred around 8,000 B.C. If we convert 8,000 B.C. to years ago, we get: 2022 A.D. (the current year) - 8000 B.C. = 10,022 years So, the statement that the last Ice Age ended approximately 10,000 years ago is accurate, as it is close to the actual number of years ago (10,022 years) when the last Ice Age ended, according to the given premise. This hypothesis generally aligns with most scientific estimates as well, which place the end of the last Ice Age between 11,700 and 12,000 years ago. During the last Ice Age, large ice sheets and glaciers covered the northern continents, including North America, Europe, and Asia. As temperatures began to rise and the Earth's climate changed, these colossal ice masses started melting, resulting in the formation of massive lakes and causing sea levels to rise significantly. The retreat of the glaciers not only shaped the valleys and created space for lakes but also significantly transformed the Earth's landscape. As the ice melted, it deposited layers of sediment, forming fertile soil in some areas and less fertile soil in others. The melting of ice also affected the Earth's weather patterns and distribution of plant and animal species. As newly exposed land became available for colonization, many species that were adapted to the cold conditions began to decline, while others flourished in the rapidly changing environment. The end of the last Ice Age has left a lasting impact on the structure and composition of the Earth's ecosystems, as well as on human civilizations. It shaped the way ancient societies developed, influenced agriculture, and drove the dispersal of human populations across the planet. Given this understanding and the fact that the premise aligns with the hypothesis \\"The last Ice Age ended approximately 10,000 years ago,\\" it can be considered true. However, it is important to note that scientific understanding and knowledge about the Ice Ages are continually evolving based on new discoveries and research, so this approximation may be subject to change in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Leaflet called Death Penalty? said: 'The death sentence is the only way this immoral crime can be erased from corrupting society' Article:","output":"Title: The First Prosecution for Inciting Hatred on the Grounds of Sexual Orientation: A Closer Look at the Case of Kabir Ahmed and His Co-defendants In a landmark legal scenario, five individuals, including 28-year-old Kabir Ahmed, are facing the first prosecution for inciting hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation since the introduction of this law. Ahmed has openly voiced his belief, stating that he couldn't \\"just stand by and watch somebody commit a sin.\\" This case has shone a spotlight on the pressing issue of discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community and the role the law plays in curbing such instances of hatred. The leaflet that has brought this case to the forefront of public attention is titled \\"Death Penalty?\\" and contains the controversial statement: \\"The death sentence is the only way this immoral crime can be erased from corrupting society.\\" This bold claim has raised widespread concerns about the propagation of violent sentiments towards a section of the society based solely on sexual orientation. Kabir Ahmed, along with his four co-defendants (whose identities have not been revealed), are being tried under the offense of incitement to hatred, a crime that only came into existence recently. This law is a direct reflection of the efforts taken by the authorities to address the growing problem of discrimination and hostility against marginalized communities. One may wonder what could have possibly driven Kabir Ahmed and his associates to such an extreme stance. Preliminary investigations into the case have revealed that the accused individuals have a deep and abiding belief in the teachings of their faith that have shaped their negative and hostile reactions towards those who identify as LGBTQ+. However, it is vital to recognize that such interpretations of religious teachings often stem from a distorted understanding of sacred texts and do not represent the essence of the faith itself. It is crucial to address the dangers that such beliefs pose, as they can easily escalate and lead to tragedy. In a world where hate crimes, queerphobia, and violent attacks towards the LGBTQ+ community are not unheard of, it is our collective responsibility as a society to reject and condemn such ideologies that fan the flames of hatred. At the same time, it is equally important to educate ourselves and work on promoting a more compassionate understanding of diverse communities. Education and advocacy are key to fostering empathy and breaking down the barriers of prejudice. By raising awareness and initiating thoughtful conversations, we can begin to tackle the root cause of hate and discrimination and build solidarity in our diverse societies. The trial of Kabir Ahmed and his co-defendants will serve as an eye-opener for many, demonstrating that the law does not condone any form of incitement to hatred or discrimination based on sexual orientation. As the case unfolds, it will also reveal how deep-rooted prejudices can be challenged and confronted in the court of law. As we observe this landmark case, we must not forget the larger struggle to end prejudice and intolerance based on sexual orientation. The lessons learned from this case must be used as a resource for promoting understanding, fostering dialogue, and ensuring that every member of our society is treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their sexual orientation. The hopeful outcome is that the first successful prosecution of this nature will send a powerful message of deterrence to those who may be inclined to perpetuate hatred."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Compare the vocabulary: Both sentences use mostly the same words, including the name \\"Lars Elinderson,\\" the year \\"1949,\\" the term \\"politician,\\" and the mention of the \\"Swedish Party.\\" The only difference is the capitalization of the word \\"Moderate\\" in the second sentence, which gives a sense that it's referring to a specific party rather than just a political stance. Step 3: Compare the meanings: The meanings of the two sentences are generally the same. They both convey the information that Lars Elinderson is a moderate politician and a member of the Swedish Party, and he was born in 1949. The only slight difference in meaning is that the first sentence seems to describe his political stance as \\"moderate\\" while the second sentence could be read as referring to his membership in the \\"Moderate Party.\\" Conclusion: Based on the comparisons in structure, vocabulary, and meaning, it can be concluded that these two sentences are paraphrases of each other with only a slight difference in the capitalization of the word \\"Moderate.\\" However, the core information conveyed by both sentences is essentially the same."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Question: When people travel they usually don't have to worry about medical emergencies because hospitals are where? Options: - people are - military base - every state - major city - urban area  Explain why a human would choose \\"every state\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","output":"A human would choose \\"every state\\" as the answer to this question because it implies that hospitals are available in all states, regardless of whether these states are urban or rural, large or small. This reassuring fact means that travelers can generally expect to find medical care facilities no matter where they are within a country. There are a few reasons for this answer being the most accurate. Firstly, as states are the administrative and geographic units of a country, having hospitals distributed in every state is a more comprehensive way of ensuring that people have access to medical facilities while traveling. States are large enough to encompass both urban and rural areas, and thus, hospitals will be accessible to more people regardless of where they are coming from or heading to. Secondly, both \\"major city\\" and \\"urban area\\" options are limiting, as they provide coverage only to people who travel to or within cities. Many people who travel might visit rural or remote areas and still require access to medical facilities. Answering \\"every state\\" covers the need for healthcare services in both urban and non-urban regions. Lastly, \\"people are\\" and \\"military base\\" answers are too broad and an inaccurate representation of the locations where hospitals are found. Not all places where people are present will have hospitals, and military bases are specific facilities that are not meant to cater to the general public's medical needs. In summary, a human would choose \\"every state\\" as the answer because it acknowledges the fact that hospitals are distributed across the entire country, allowing travelers to have access to medical care no matter where their journey takes them. This answer covers various travel scenarios and provides confidence to those concerned about medical emergencies while traveling."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Translate to English","output":"Serbian-Montenegrin authorities have issued an order for military personnel to detain war crimes suspects in the army and provide all information they possess about individuals sought by the UN court. The Serbian-Montenegrin authorities have given an order for members of the armed forces to detain any war crimes suspects who are currently present within the military institution. In addition, they have instructed the military personnel to share any and all information they have regarding individuals who are being sought by the United Nations tribunal. This order likely aims to promote accountability and transparency in addressing past war crimes and ensuring that those responsible face the appropriate legal consequences. The involvement of the UN court implies that many of the suspected war criminals may have participated in atrocities during times of conflict or have been involved in gross human rights violations. Sharing the information about these individuals with the international tribunal can significantly help in their pursuit of justice and closure for the victims and their families. Such collaboration between national and international authorities is essential because it assists in upholding the rule of law and preventing impunity. By taking responsibility for their roles in war crimes, military personnel will be deterred from repeating such actions in the future. Collaboration also portrays the Serbian-Montenegrin authorities' commitment to international humanitarian standards and their willingness to work cooperatively with global organizations to address complex issues. Moreover, this order could serve as an example for other countries grappling with similar war crimes issues. It demonstrates that asserting control over military forces and fully cooperating with international legal bodies is a viable approach to addressing these concerns and ensuring justice prevails. In conclusion, Serbian-Montenegrin authorities' order to armed force members to detain war crimes suspects within the army and provide all the information they have on individuals sought after by the UN court is an essential step towards accountability and transparency.

A consultative ballot in 2014, which recorded a large majority for independence, was ignored by Spain. Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy has again ruled out the possibility of a referendum. Embracing Spain's second city, Barcelona, Catalonia is one of the country's richest regions. Separatist sentiment has built into a mass movement over the past five years, promoting a distinct Catalan identity which goes back centuries. In his video address (in Catalan), Mr Puigdemont said: \\"We Catalans will freely decide our own future through a legal and binding referendum.\\" Such a vote is expected to take place in September, based on a resolution passed by the Catalan parliament, where separatists hold a majority of seats.

Remy dated for three years before deciding that he didn't like it.  Given the context: What will happen to Remy? Answer:","output":"It is essential to understand that everyone's journey through life and relationships is unique. Based on the context provided, Remy has decided to stop dating after three years, likely due to personal reasons or past experiences that were not fulfilling or enjoyable. Therefore, it is crucial to consider that the future outcome for Remy could vary significantly, depending on preferences, circumstances, and potential life changes. However, it is possible to outline likely scenarios that could occur in Remy's life after this decision. 1. Personal growth and self-discovery: Following the decision to stop dating, Remy may take time to explore his feelings, values, and aspirations independently. This period of self-reflection could lead to better understanding of personal strengths, weaknesses, and boundaries. Focusing on oneself can allow Remy to determine the qualities he wants in a potential partner or the type of relationship he desires, should he decide to pursue romantic connections in the future. 2. Developing deep friendships: While Remy may not be interested in dating, it does not exclude the possibility of forming strong bonds with others. He could focus on nurturing relationships with friends, family, and acquaintances who share similar interests, values, or goals. By fostering these connections, Remy could find a strong sense of belonging, community, and support without the pressures of a romantic relationship. 3. Exploring alternative forms of relationships: Remy's decision to stop dating could lead him to explore nontraditional relationship dynamics. This could include platonic, non-monogamous, or long-distance relationships that better align with his preferences and expectations. Engaging in such arrangements can offer Remy an opportunity to experience deep connections with others without the traditional constraints of dating or committing to a single partner. 4. Embracing solitude and independence: It is possible that Remy may find satisfaction and contentment in leading a solitary life without pursuing romance or intimate partnerships. Being self-reliant and independent can provide him with a sense of stability and confidence in decision-making, personal growth, and pursuing goals. 5. Future changes in perspective: Remy's decision to stop dating may not be permanent. As he grows older or encounters new life experiences, his opinions and choices may change, leading to a renewed interest in pursuing romantic relationships. It is important to acknowledge that people change over time, and Remy could potentially decide to reenter the dating world when he feels more comfortable or better equipped for it. In conclusion, Remy's future after deciding to stop dating depends on various factors, including personal growth, relationships, and life experiences. While his decision to discontinue dating may initially seem limiting, it can open doors for self-discovery, deep friendships, exploration of alternative relationships, and personal independence. Additionally, Remy's outlook might change with time, and he may choose to reevaluate his decision based on internal growth and new experiences. Ultimately, it is up to Remy to invest in creating a fulfilling life that aligns with his values and priorities while remaining open to change and growth."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His bliss is disturbed by another impostor, Marla Singer, whose presence reminds him he is attending these groups dishonestly. The two agree to split which groups they attend, but not before they exchange contact details on the premise of switching groups at short notice. On a flight home from a business trip, the Narrator meets and interacts with soap salesman Tyler Durden. The Narrator returns home to find that his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion.

If \\"A baby is laying in a hospital bassinet.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A toddler is standing\\"?","output":"No, it does not logically follow that \\"A toddler is standing\\" if \\"A baby is laying in a hospital bassinet\\". The two statements are unrelated, and one does not provide any information to deduce the status of the other. To understand why these statements don't logically follow, let's break down each statement and examine the logical connections between them. Statement 1: \\"A baby is laying in a hospital bassinet.\\" This statement provides information about the whereabouts and current position of a baby, presumably a newborn or infant. It tells us that this particular baby is in a horizontal resting position in a hospital bassinet, which is a small bed designed for newborns and infants. The statement does not provide any information about the age of the baby, or the existence or actions of any other individuals, such as toddlers. Statement 2: \\"A toddler is standing.\\" This statement refers to the physical position of a toddler, who is a young child usually between one to three years old. It tells us that this toddler is in an upright position, supporting themselves on their legs and feet. Logical Connection: Upon analyzing the two statements, there is no logical connection between them. The first statement focuses on a baby's position in a hospital bassinet, while the second statement discusses a toddler's position. The two subjects – a baby and a toddler – are different and separate individuals. Furthermore, babies and toddlers are at different stages of development, with the latter being older, more mobile, and capable of standing and walking.  Therefore, there is no logical connection or causality between the two events described in the statements. One does not influence or determine the other. It is entirely possible that a baby could be laying in a hospital bassinet while simultaneously, a toddler may be standing, sitting, or engaging in any other action. On the other hand, both events could also occur separately, and the situation of one does not provide any information about the other's state. In conclusion, the statement \\"A baby is laying in a hospital bassinet\\" does not logically follow that \\"A toddler is standing,\\" as the two statements are about different individuals and are not connected logically or causally. The situation of the baby in the hospital bassinet provides no information or inference on the state of a toddler, and vice versa."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First, let's break it down step by step. We have: 455 - 6404 = 582*q + 1617 First, we are going to subtract 455 from 6404. Are you ready? Here we go! 6404 - 455 = 5949 Now, our equation looks like this: -5949 = 582*q + 1617 Next, we are going to subtract 1617 from both sides of the equation. Let's do that! -5949 - 1617 = -7566 Now the equation is: -7566 = 582*q Now, we need to find what number \\"q\\" should be. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 582. -7566 ÷ 582 = -13 So, the answer is: q = -13 And there you go! The solution to the problem is q = -13.

Electricity, like clean water, is a resource that's often taken for granted. But last summer, when blackouts struck much of the northeastern US, Ontario and Rome, consumers on two continents were given a painful reminder of just how easily broken electricity supplies can be. The massive disorder stranded  commuters, stopped freezers, shut down businesses and refocused attention on where most of the planet's power comes from:oil-and-gas-fired generators and nuclear plants, These sources not only pollute the environment but also make many consumers feel unacceptable health risks. Companies are trying to offer an alternative, clean energy from renewable resources that's plentiful and portable. Lifton's Medis Technologies, as well as companies like Hydrogenics and Nanosys, is tapping into fuel cells and dolor panels to give people power whenever and wherever they want it, free from dependence on local grids . The search for alternative energy is nothing new, but the current trend of innovators is focusing on the goal of making clean and sustainable power a mainstream commodity. For example, the fuel cell, which produces electricity from the chemical reaction between oxygen and hydrogen, has been around for about 150 years, though its commercial development did not begin until the 1960s and then only as part of NASA spacecraft. Today this technology is coming down to Earth in places like Tokyo; in nine European cities, from Stockholm to Porto, each operating three hydrogen-fuel-cell buses; and in Iceland, which is trying to create the first fuel free hydrogen economy by 2030. When hydrogen and oxygen molecules combine, the reaction produces heat and water. Fuel cells use this reaction to generate electricity. With the cell phone and gadget market in mind, Medis has developed a fuel cell with cheap components that produces little heat and effortlessly reduces waste water without turning to energy consuming pumps. Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage? A) Lifton's Medis Technologies is tapping into fuel cells and solar panels. B) The fuel cell has been around for about 150 years. C) The fuel cell's commercial development did not begin until the 1960s.

Given the question: You are given a new situation: Organisms are constantly exposed to different kinds of radiations. Keith was studying the effect of radiations on a organism in two different locations, place A and place B. He noticed that in place A the the organism had beneficial mutation due to the radiation. On the other hand, in place B, the organism didn't have beneficial mutation.  and a hint : Some mutations have a positive effect on the organism in which they occur. They are called beneficial mutations . They lead to new versions of proteins that help organisms adapt to changes in their environment. Beneficial mutations are essential for evolution to occur. They increase an organism’s changes of surviving or reproducing, so they are likely to become more common over time. There are several well-known examples of beneficial mutations. Here are just two:  Please answer this question : In which place the organism would less likely develop proteins to adapt in their habitat, place A or place B? The answer is:","output":"The organism would be less likely to develop proteins to adapt in their habitat in place B. This is because, as mentioned in the given information, place A had beneficial mutations due to the radiation exposure, leading to the development of new versions of proteins that help the organisms adapt to changes in their environment. On the other hand, in place B, the organism did not have beneficial mutations, which suggests that it would be less likely to develop the necessary proteins to adapt to its habitat. Therefore, the organism's chances of surviving or reproducing might be lower in place B compared to place A, where the beneficial mutations aid in the organism's adaptation and evolution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who wanted to start the tour right away? ?  In a letter to his friend and landlord Johann Lorenz Hagenauer (1712–1792), a prominent Salzburg merchant, written after the tour, Leopold quotes the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm, who after hearing the children play had said: \\"Now for once in my life I have seen a miracle: this is the first\\". Leopold believed that it was his duty to proclaim this miracle to the world, otherwise he would be \\"the most ungrateful creature\\". He was said to have described Wolfgang as \\"The miracle which God let be born in Salzburg.\\" Mozart biographer Wolfgang Hildesheimer has suggested that, at least in the case of Wolfgang, this venture was premature: \\"Too soon, [the] father dragged [the] son all over Western Europe for years. This continual change of scene would have worn out even a robust child...\\" However, there is little evidence to suggest that Wolfgang was physically harmed or musically hindered by these childhood exertions; it seems that he felt equal to the challenge from the start.Leopold wanted to begin the tour as soon as possible—the younger the children were, the more spectacular would be the demonstration of their gifts. The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the Austrian Netherlands, Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Dutch trip was an unplanned detour. The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, as well as the great cultural capitals—Leopold was relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities. These would enable them to obtain money en route, while waiting for the proceeds from their performances to accumulate.Wolfgang prepared for the tour by perfecting himself on the violin, which he had learned to play apparently...

Question: Information:  - Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship that God established with the Children of Israel. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth-largest religion in the world.  - The Habsburg Monarchy or Empire, occasionally also styled as the Danubian Monarchy (\\"Donaumonarchie\\"), is an unofficial appellation among historians for the countries and provinces that were ruled by the between 1521 and 1780 and then by the successor branch of Habsburg-Lorraine until 1918. The Monarchy was a composite state composed of territories within and outside the Holy Roman Empire, united only in the person of the monarch. The dynastic capital was Vienna, except from 1583 to 1611, when it was moved to Prague. From 1804 to 1867 the Habsburg Monarchy was formally unified as the Austrian Empire, and from 1867 to 1918 as the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  - The Austrian Empire (modern spelling \\"\\") was an empire in Central Europe created out of the realms of the Habsburgs by proclamation in 1804. It was a multinational empire and one of Europe's great powers. Geographically it was the second largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire (621,538 square kilometres [239,977 sq mi]). It was also the third most populous after Russia and France, as well as the largest and strongest country in the German Confederation. Proclaimed in response to the First French Empire, it overlapped with the Holy Roman Empire until the latter's dissolution in 1806. The \\"Ausgleich\\" of 1867 elevated Hungary's status. It became a separate entity from the Empire entirely, joining with it in the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary.  - Solomon Judah Löb HaKohen Rapoport ( June 1 , 1786 -- October 15 , 1867 ) ( Hebrew :     ) , was a Galician rabbi and Jewish scholar . He was born in Lemberg , Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria . He married in 1810 Franziska Freide Heller , the daughter of the well - known Aryeh Leib Heller , and was instrumental in publishing the work Avnei Miluim of his father in law . He wrote both the index , sources and numerous comments . After various experiences in business , Rapoport became rabbi of Tarnopol ( 1837 ) and of Prague ( 1840 ) . He was one of the founders of the new Wissenschaft des Judentums movement . His chief work was the first part of an ( unfinished ) encyclopaedia ( Erekh Millin , 1852 ) . Equally notable were his biographies of Saadia Gaon , Nathan ( author of the Arukh ) , Hai Gaon , Eleazar Kalir and others . Thrown upon his own resources about 1817 , Rapoport became the collector of the meat - tax on farmers . He had already given evidence of marked critical ability , though his writings previously published were of a light character -- poems and translations . His critical talent , however , soon revealed itself . In 1824 he wrote an article for Bikkure ha - ' Ittim on the independent Jewish tribes of Arabia and Abyssinia . Though this article gained him some recognition , a more permanent impression was made by his work on Saadia Gaon and his times ( published in the same journal in 1829 ) , the first of a series of biographical works on the medieval Jewish sages . Because of this work he received recognition in the scholarly world and gained many enthusiastic friends , especially S. D. Luzzatto . After the fashion in rabbinic circles , Rapoport was known by an acronym \`\` Shir '' , formed by the initial letters of his Hebrew name Shelomo Yehuda Rapoport ( Shir literally means \`\` song '' in Hebrew )  - The First Partition of Poland took place in 1772 as the first of three partitions that ended the existence of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth by 1795. Growth in the Russian Empire's power, threatening the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Austrian Empire, was the primary motive behind this first partition. Frederick the Great engineered the partition to prevent Austria, jealous of Russian successes against the Ottoman Empire, from going to war. The weakened Commonwealth's land, including what was already controlled by Russia, was apportioned among its more powerful neighborsAustria, Russia and Prussiaso as to restore the regional balance of power in Central Europe among those three countries. With Poland unable to effectively defend itself, and with foreign troops already inside the country, the Polish parliament (Sejm) ratified the partition in 1773 during the Partition Sejm convened by the three powers.  - The PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, formally the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after 1791 the Commonwealth of Poland, was a dualistic state, a bi-confederation, of Poland and Lithuania ruled by a common monarch, who was both the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania. It was one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th- and 17th-century Europe. At its peak in the early 17th century, the Commonwealth spanned some and sustained a multi-ethnic population of 11 million. The union was formalized by the Union of Lublin in July 1569, but the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were in a de-facto personal union since 1386 with the marriage of the Polish queen Hedwig and Lithuania's Grand Duke Jogaila, who was crowned King \\"jure uxoris\\" Wadysaw II Jagieo of Poland. The First Partition of Poland in 1772 and the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 greatly reduced the nation's size and the Commonwealth disappeared as an independent state following the Third Partition of Poland in 1795.  - The Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, also known as Galicia or Austrian Poland, became a crownland of the Habsburg Monarchy as a result of the First Partition of Poland in 1772, when it became a Kingdom under Habsburg rule. From 1804 to 1918 it was a crownland of the Austrian Empire. After the reforms of 1867, it became an ethnic Pole-administered autonomous unit under the Austrian crown. The country was carved from the entire south-western part of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth. Among the many ceremonial titles of the princes of Hungary was \\"ruler of Galicia and Lodomeria\\".  - Poland, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe, situated between the Baltic Sea in the north and two mountain ranges (the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains) in the south. Bordered by Germany to the west; the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south; Ukraine and Belarus to the east; and the Baltic Sea, Kaliningrad Oblast (a Russian exclave) and Lithuania to the north. The total area of Poland is , making it the 69th largest country in the world and the 9th largest in Europe. With a population of over 38.5 million people, Poland is the 34th most populous country in the world, the 8th most populous country in Europe and the sixth most populous member of the European Union. Poland is a unitary state divided into 16 administrative subdivisions, and its capital and largest city is Warsaw. Other metropolises include Kraków, Wrocaw, Pozna, Gdask and Szczecin.  - In Judaism, a rabbi is a teacher of Torah.

Picture book: A picture book is an excellent choice to see a sloth that is not real. Picture books often contain illustrations and photographs of various animals, including sloths.

Another place: This option is quite vague and could refer to any physical or imaginary location. While it is possible that one might find a representation of a sloth that is not real in another place, it does not provide a specific or reliable source to see such a sloth. D. Universe: The term universe encompasses everything that exists, including the space we live in. The possibility of witnessing a sloth that is not real in the universe is minimal and vague. The vastness of the universe and the lack of specificity in this option make it a weak choice. E. Zoo: A zoo represents a location where animals are kept and exhibited to the public. It contains real living animals, including sloths.

Endemic to southern and central Chile (including the Juan Fernández Islands), this genus is represented by four accepted species. Hypothesis: Sylvestris Ochagavia lived in southern Chile.","output":"Based on the provided context, we can deduce several pieces of information but not entirely draw the hypothesis that Sylvestris Ochagavia lived in southern Chile. From the context, we can establish the following facts: 1. Ochagavia is a genus of the botanical family Bromeliaceae, subfamily Bromelioideae. 2. The genus is named after Sylvestris Ochagavia, who was the Chilean minister of education. 3. The genus is endemic to southern and central Chile, including the Juan Fernández Islands. 4. There are four accepted species within this genus. The context suggests a connection between Sylvestris Ochagavia and the Ochagavia genus; that is, the genus was named in his honor due to his position as the Chilean minister of education. This tells us that Sylvestris Ochagavia was influential and held a significant position in Chile. This information, however, does not directly indicate his place of residence within Chile. Moreover, although the Ochagavia genus is endemic to southern and central Chile, it does not necessarily imply that Sylvestris Ochagavia lived in that area. The plants could have been named in his honor for various reasons unrelated to his place of residence, such as his contributions to the country's education, botanical research, or conservation efforts, among other possibilities. In conclusion, while the context offers essential information about the Ochagavia genus and its connection to Sylvestris Ochagavia, it does not provide direct evidence to conclude that Sylvestris Ochagavia lived in southern Chile. For that hypothesis to be accurate, more information and supporting evidence about his life, work, and the reasons behind the naming of the genus would be required."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Which comic theorist began studying comics after the start of the 21st century?\\" is in \\"European comics studies began with Töpffer's theories of his own work in the 1840s, which emphasized panel transitions and the visual–verbal combination. No further progress was made until the 1970s. Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle then took a semiotics approach to the study of comics, analyzing text–image relations, page-level image relations, and image discontinuities, or what Scott McCloud later dubbed \\"closure\\". In 1987, Henri Vanlier introduced the term multicadre, or \\"multiframe\\", to refer to the comics a page as a semantic unit. By the 1990s, theorists such as Benoît Peeters and Thierry Groensteen turned attention to artists' poïetic creative choices. Thierry Smolderen and Harry Morgan have held relativistic views of the definition of comics, a medium that has taken various, equally valid forms over its history. Morgan sees comics as a subset of \\"les littératures dessinées\\" (or \\"drawn literatures\\"). French theory has come to give special attention to the page, in distinction from American theories such as McCloud's which focus on panel-to-panel transitions. Since the mid-2000s, Neil Cohn has begun analyzing how comics are understood using tools from cognitive science, extending beyond theory by using actual psychological and neuroscience experiments. This work has argued that sequential images and page layouts both use separate rule-bound \\"grammars\\" to be understood that extend beyond panel-to-panel transitions and categorical distinctions of types of layouts, and that the brain's comprehension of comics is similar to comprehending other domains, such as language and music.\\".

Plot:  The movie starts in the bustling city of New York where our protagonist, Jake Donovan - a genius, yet somewhat carefree, coder working in a booming tech startup, is busy writing code lines for their really ambitious AR (Augmented Reality) project. Jake's life is casual, involving coding during the day, frequent banter with his colleagues, countless cups of coffee, and occasional card games in the evening at their favorite hangout place.  One day, Jake's company is tasked by renowned and wealthy tech entrepreneur, Maxwell Sinclair, with a highly secretive project - The Final Table. The project stirs up interest within the tech community due to Sinclair's cryptic remarks about how it will change the world. Jake's team is chosen for the project, with a shattering deadline just 11 days away at 5 A.M.  The plot thickens as Jake and his team dive headfirst into the project. Each day, they encounter hurdles and experience moments of breakthrough. The movie encapsulates these chaotic days and sleepless nights fabulously while also building up each character, their motivations, and internal dynamics. Throughout this, Jake becomes particularly engrossed in the complexity of The Final Table. Despite initial delays and disagreements, they all push their limits to meet the deadline, only to discover that The Final Table is much more than a tech project. It's a doomsday device capable of inducing realistic mass hallucinations through AR, effectively capable of controlling the entire human population. Sinclair's corporative image is just a façade to his nefarious plan of global dominance. The team is shocked and utterly torn between their morally correct path and their professional obligation towards the project. The climax builds up as Jake decides not to let Sinclair implement his dystopian plan.  While simultaneously working on the project, Jake and his associates stealthily work on an antithesis to the device. With the deadline approaching, tension grows as both Sinclair and Jake race against time - one to take over the world, and one to save it, all leading up to the unforgettable 5 A.M. As the deadline arrives, Sinclair, who has been monitoring the team's progress, is ready to activate The Final Table. But right as he is about to start it, Jake and his team activate the antithesis device, which hijacks Sinclair's system and sends it into a destructive loop.  Just when Sinclair realizes what transpires, it's too late. The Final Table crashes and falls apart even before it starts. Sinclair is arrested as the evidence against his malicious intent surfaces, and Jake and his team are hailed as unsung heroes. The film culminates in an emotional climax as Jake submits the project report of The Final Table to his boss with, ironically, the remark \\"Project Completed\\". The movie ends there, leaving audiences with a feeling of closure and a lingering thought about the misuse of technology in wrong hands.

He was told he had bruised ribs and was discharged but died the following day. From 2005 to 2009, there were between 400 and 1,200 more deaths than would have been expected at the hospital. The inquest at Leicester Coroner's Court heard that the telecommunications engineer's condition was assessed by a paramedic as being life-threatening before his arrival at hospital. Giving evidence, Dr Girish Sharma said he would have had regard to the views of the paramedic but admitted the hour and 10 minutes it took to see his patient was too long. Conceding that his notes about Mr Moore-Robinson did not reveal the full extent of his examination of the patient, Dr Sharma said: \\"There are a lot of things that are not in the documentation.\\" Dr Sharma, who ruled out bone fractures by ordering chest and pelvic X-rays but did not ask for a CT-scan, added: \\"I did carry out a full examination. \\"At that point in time I wasn't aware of delayed rupture of the spleen.

Given the below context:  Doménikos Theotokópoulos (Greek: Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος [ðoˈminikos θeotoˈkopulos]; October 1541 –  7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco (\\"The Greek\\"), was a Greek painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. \\"El Greco\\" was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος, Doménikos Theotokópoulos, often adding the word Κρής Krēs, Cretan. El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings. El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting.  Guess a valid title for it!

Premise:  \\"But as Johnny Shannon's gaze flitted from Topham to the Kentuckian, Drew was once more aware that, whatever he might outwardly seem, Johnny Shannon was no boy.\\" The premise suggests that Johnny Shannon may outwardly appear like a young boy, but Drew comes to realize that he is not just a boy. This could mean that Johnny Shannon possesses qualities, skills, knowledge, or experiences that go beyond his boyish appearance and make him stand out as a more mature individual. Hypothesis: \\"Drew knew that Johnny Shannon was no man.\\" The hypothesis makes a different statement, claiming that Drew knows Johnny Shannon is not a man. This statement could imply that Drew considers Johnny Shannon to be something other than a man, maybe a young boy or some other categorization. Now, let's analyze the relationship between the premise and hypothesis. The available options are: I. yes; II. it is not possible to tell; III. no; Comparing the information in the premise and the hypothesis, the premise primarily focuses on Johnny Shannon not being a mere boy, while the hypothesis revolves around whether Johnny Shannon is a man or not. Even though both pieces of information refer to the characterization of Johnny Shannon, they do not provide a direct link to conclude the truth of the hypothesis based on the premise. Therefore, the answer is: II. it is not possible to tell. It is not possible to conclude the hypothesis as true based solely on the given premise.

Aug 25, 2015 2:44 PM Aug 25, 2015 2:44 PM      For eight seasons, Jerry Seinfeld’s television persona dealt with the fictional “Newman,” his neighbor and arch-nemesis. Mr. Seinfeld, a part-time East Hampton resident, dealt with a real-life meddling neighbor last Tuesday afternoon, August 18, when his family’s lemonade stand on Egypt Lane in the village was shut down following complaints.            Mr. Seinfeld’s wife, Jessica, posted a photo on Instagram of Mr. Seinfeld, their son, Julian, and two friends with their hands on top of their heads in surrender. An East Hampton Village Police car could clearly be seen in the back right corner of the photo.            “Lemonade dreams crushed by local neighbor, but not before raising lots of money for @loverecycled,” wrote Ms. Seinfeld in the caption. “Thanks to all of our customers and big tippers! Thanks, Xander and Jaden, for crushing it today with Julian and Jerry.”            East Hampton Village Police Chief Jerry Larsen said police received a complaint about illegally parked vehicles at the location of the lemonade stand. At the scene, an officer advised the Seinfeld family that village code does not permit lemonade stands on village property. The village prohibits all forms of peddling on its property.            While the money was ultimately raised for Ms. Seinfeld’s charity, Baby Buggy, many of Ms. Seinfeld’s Instagram followers expressed their disdain over the neighbor’s complaint and strict policies about lemonade stands in the area.            “People always talk about how kids today need to get back to the basics, and when they do, they change their mind,” PamB2001 commented in an Instagram post.            Tom Keaney, Mr. Seinfeld’s publicist, said he could not add anything beyond what was posted on Instagram.            Ms. Seinfeld founded Baby Buggy in 2001. The organization focuses on providing families under financial strain with clothing, gear and services, and has donated 16 million items since its formation. Its motto is “Love Recycled,” hence its Instagram handle. ||||| Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)      Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)      Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)      It’s “No lemonade for you!” in East Hampton, where a sourpuss neighbor put the squeeze on the drink stand Jerry Seinfeld and his family had set up for charity, resulting in this goofy “arrest.”      The roadside business was selling cold drinks on hot days to benefit the group Baby Buggy, before it was shut down for violating a village prohibition on peddling.      “Lemonade dreams crushed by local neighbor but not before raising lots of money for @loverecycled.

Mr. Hoffman, a former ambassador to Portugal, has donated millions to Republican candidates and causes over the years, including more than 1 million to Right to Rise, a “super PAC” that supported Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign in 2016.      A critic of President Trump, Mr. Hoffman has continued to donate heavily to other Republicans.      Alluding to past mass killings, Mr. Hoffman argued in his email that future gun massacres were inevitable without government intervention: “If we go from Orlando to Las Vegas, and now Parkland, you just have to know that there are others around the country just dreaming about staging another mass murder.”      Republican elected officials in Washington and Florida have shown no significant interest in considering new gun restrictions after the Florida school shooting. The party, which has full control of both the state and federal government, has traditionally opposed virtually all new limitations on firearms. Mr. Scott has resisted pressure to back new gun regulations after the killing of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Broward County on Wednesday, though he said “everything’s on the table” in a television interview.      And Senator Marco Rubio of Florida voiced resistance to discussing gun control in a speech after the massacre, arguing in the Senate that a person determined to carry out an attack would find the weaponry to do it regardless of government regulations. His comments provoked outrage among some students who survived the shooting.      Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A previous federal assault weapons ban, enacted in 1994 under a Democratic president and Congress, lapsed in 2004 while Republicans had full control of Washington.      Mr. Hoffman acknowledged it was “not likely” that he would succeed in making the party more open to an assault weapons ban, and said Republicans were too beholden to the National Rifle Association. He has urged Republicans in the past to support certain firearms restrictions, without effect, but has not previously issued such a blunt threat.      One of the recipients of Mr. Hoffman’s Saturday message, Mel Sembler, another former ambassador and ally of the Bush family, suggested he did not intend to join the proposed donation boycott. “I don’t plan on getting into this debate,” Mr. Sembler, who also lives in Florida, said in a brief email.      Peter S. Rummell, a Jacksonville-based donor who gave 125,000 to Jeb Bush’s “super PAC” in 2016, said he was on board with Mr. Hoffman’s plan and would only contribute to candidates supportive of banning assault weapons. He said the Parkland shooting was a turning point: “It has to start somewhere,” Mr. Rummell said, of controlling guns.

He said he would close his checkbook to that group and others like it, and would encourage others to do the same in the absence of action on guns. Mr. Hoffman said he would also be open to backing fiscally conservative Democrats who favor certain gun restrictions.      “I’m going to email every single donor I know in the Republican Party and try to get them on board,” he said. “We’ve really got to start a little movement here.” ||||| One of the students who survived Wednesday’s deadly shooting at a Florida high school called for stricter gun regulations and took aim at President Donald Trump and other Republicans for their inaction on the matter on Saturday.      “If the president wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and how it should never have happened and maintain telling us how nothing is going to be done about it,” Emma Gonzalez said, “I’m going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association.”      Gonzalez delivered an impassioned speech at a gun control rally in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Saturday.      “Politicians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seated funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have ever been done to prevent this, we call BS,” she said. “They say that tougher gun laws do not decrease gun violence. We call BS. They say a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun. We call BS. They say guns are just tools like knives and are as dangerous as cars. We call BS. No, they say that no laws could have been able to prevent the hundreds of senseless tragedies that have occurred. We call BS.”      A 19-year-old former student, Nikolas Cruz, has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder after killing 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, with Gonzalez attends, on Wednesday. He was armed with an AR-15 rifle, which he used to carry out the rampage.      The massacre, among the deadliest school shootings in modern US history, has yet again sparked debate about US gun laws and lawmakers’ continued inaction on gun control.      President Trump traveled on Friday to visit shooting victims, survivors, and first responders. He also wrote in a tweet that there were “so many signs” that Cruz was mentally disturbed, and seemed to cast blame on those around him for not reporting him. “Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem,” he wrote. “Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!”      So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2018      The FBI had been tipped off that Cruz might be dangerous but failed to act, which it admitted in a statement on Friday.      Gonzalez on Saturday addressed Trump’s tweet directly, saying they had alerted the authorities about Cruz time and time again and that for students who had known him over the years, “it was no surprise to anyone who knew him to hear that he was the shooter.”      She continued:      We need to pay attention to the fact that this isn’t just a mental health issue. He wouldn’t have harmed that many students with a knife. How about we stop blaming the victims for something that was the shooter’s fault? The fault of the people who let him buy the guns in the first place, those at the gun shows, the people who encouraged him to buy accessories for his guns to make them fully automatic, the people who didn’t take them away from him when they knew that he expressed homicidal tendencies, and I am not talking about the FBI. I am talking about the people that he lived with; I’m talking about the neighbors who saw him outside holding guns. If the president wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and how it should never have happened and maintain telling us how nothing is going to be done about it, I’m going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association.      “To every politician taking donations from the NRA, shame on you,” Gonzalez said.      During her impassioned speech, she also declared, “This will be the last mass shooting.” As US lawmakers remain essentially paralyzed on gun control, the sad thing is that it very probably won’t be. ||||| Fort Lauderdale (United States) (AFP) - A student survivor of the Parkland school shooting called out US President Donald Trump on Saturday over his ties to the powerful National Rifle Association, in a poignant address to an anti-gun rally in Florida.      \\"To every politician taking donations from the NRA, shame on you!\\" said Emma Gonzalez, assailing Trump over the multi-million-dollar support his campaign received from the gun lobby -- and prompting the crowd to chant in turn: \\"Shame on you!\\"      Wednesday's massacre, which claimed 17 lives at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, has fueled urgent calls for an end to the national deadlock over gun control -- with a string of shooting survivors rallying behind the cause.      The gunman, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, was able to legally buy an assault rifle despite a history of troubling and violent behavior.      In Washington, however, the political response has made clear that the powerful NRA pro-gun lobby remains formidable, while Trump himself suggested the root cause of mass shootings was a crisis of mental health -- making no mention of gun control.      \\"If the president wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and... how nothing is going to be done about it, I'm going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association,\\" said Gonzalez.      \\"It doesn't matter because I already know. Thirty million,\\" she told the rally attended by fellow students, parents and local officials, citing the sum spent by the NRA to support Trump's election bid and defeat Hillary Clinton.      Dividing that sum by the number of shooting victims in the United States so far this year, Gonzalez asked: \\"Is that how much these people are worth to you, Trump?\\"      The young woman's powerful address immediately went viral, with her name a top trending topic on Twitter.      The US leader also tweeted a day after the massacre that that neighbors and fellow students had failed to flag Cruz to the authorities.      \\"We did,\\" Gonzalez said, her shaking with emotion. \\"Time and time again. Since he was in middle school. It was no surprise to anyone who knew him to hear that he was the shooter.\\"      US authorities have come under mounting scrutiny for failing to act on a series of warning signs.      The FBI admitted Friday it received a chilling warning in January from a tipster who said Cruz could be planning a mass shooting, but that agents failed to follow up.      Cruz was also known to local police after his mother repeatedly called them over his violent outbursts, while records obtained by the South Florida Sun Sentinel show welfare services investigated Cruz after he cut his arms and said he wanted to buy a gun. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"A man named Mr. Hoffman, who used to be an ambassador to Portugal, has given a lot of money to the Republican party and its candidates for office in the past.

Q:Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Of the new planets, which one has more trapped terrestrial radiation?  Two new planets have just been discovered in our solar system. Scientists have just landed on both and are in the process of analyzing the environment and atmosphere of each planet. What is immediately apparent is that both planets are remarkably similar to Earth since both are oxygen rich and do not require a space suit to breathe. Another similarity that one of the planets, Jarthrow, has with Earth is that it naturally outputs approximately the same amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as Earth does. The other planet, Millhouse, outputs about twice as many greenhouse gases. Climate scientists are rushing to try to see if anything new can be discovered to help out our planet with these new discoveries.  Hint: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. A:","output":"Millhouse has more trapped terrestrial radiation because it outputs about twice as many greenhouse gases compared to Jarthrow and Earth. Since greenhouse gases partially absorb longer wavelengths of terrestrial radiation, an increase in greenhouse gases leads to an increase in trapped terrestrial radiation, causing higher global temperatures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She sets up a number of things such as an interview, which he thwarts.Later, on the pretense of taking him to a temple, she plans another set up. On the way to the temple, she pretends that the car has broken down and he leaves to roam around a bit. While he is walking he sees a crying child and offers him a chocolate. Suddenly he is swarmed by more children and other villagers who confront him of being a child-kidnapper. Using the event, Rekha cut's Arun's beard off, a symbol of piety. After a few more set-ups such as this, he renounces his sainthood.Later, Arun goes to work and finds out that his father has been sending money to someone for over twenty years.In another scenario, a man informs a lady that someone has proposed to her nephew John (again Rajinikanth). She informs the bride's parents about John, telling them he is actually a man named Alex Pandian's (also portrayed by Rajinikanth) son.A flashback ensues that explains Alex Pandian's story. Alex Pandian is a scrupulous police officer. He arrests some criminals and brings upon him the wrath of their mob boss, Egambaram (Senthamarai). Egambaram kills him and as he exhales his last breadth, Alex Pandian vows that he will be born again to take revenge.When Alex Pandian dies so does his wife after giving birth to twins. One is named Arun and the other, John. Meanwhile Thengai Srinivasan's wife gives birth but the child dies, just like the other two times she had been pregnant. Alex's sister gives one of Alex Pandian's children to them and he is christened Arun.On Arun's 25th birthday party he gets a divine epiphany that makes him realize he is the reincarnation of Alex Pandian.

It provides hints towards the initial part of the plot where he changes his way of living and becomes a saint. This part of the title allows room for interpretation, engaging the curiosity of potential viewers.  The second part \\"The Pandian Legacy\\" indicates the recurring role of character Alex Pandian, who perceivably sets the tone for the rest of the plot even after his demise. The term \\"Legacy\\" points to the persistence of Alex Pandian's spirit and principles in his sons John and Arun, who progressively reveal their ties to their father's identity. Additionally, it suggests the intertwined fates and Karmic justice that the twins (Arun and John) indirectly deliver, affirming their father's vowed retribution against his murderer.  Together, these components capture the primary themes of transformation, family secrets, and revenge in the plot. The title is both intriguing and reflective of the storyline."},{"instruction":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal. Can you help me answer a few questions?

An arrow pierced through the darkness, its barbed head tearing through flesh and muscle. A roar echoed off of the mountains far to the west. A cry broke through soon after. Then silence. Char stood over a pile of black fur and red blood. He held a curved sword, jagged half way down the wide blade and hilted in bone. He held a large thick bow in the other. Lorfel and Ranur stood behind him, panting. Lorfel, a short man of twenty six held a large axe in both hands and still prepared to swing it hard. Ranur, the largest of the three held a pike in one hand, its tip hanging low towards the ground. He buried his other hand in his gray tunic. \\"Did it get either of you?\\" Char's voice rasped low in the silence of the night. \\"No\\" Lorfel said. He planted his axe head on the ground with a thud and leaned on the tall handle. There was a pause. Char turned towards Ranur. \\"Are you hurt?\\" \\"Mm...My hand.\\" Ranur took his hand out of his tunic. Moonlight gleamed red off of the ragged wound. Char thought he saw a glimmer of bone. \\"Did he claw you or bite you?\\" Char's voice held an urgency that set both Lorfel and Ranur on edge.

You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. In this task, you are given two strings A, B. Find the longest common substring in the strings A and B. JdEKNd, eUEKea Output:","output":"To find the longest common substring in the strings A and B, I will follow these steps: 1. I will create a matrix 'dp', where dp[i][j] represents the length of the common suffix of substrings A[0..i] and B[0..j]. 2. I will initialize the first row and first column of 'dp' with 0, as an empty substring has no characters in common. 3. I will iterate through both strings and compare characters at respective indices. 4. If characters at indices i and j are the same (A[i] == B[j]), I will update the value in the matrix as dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1. This is because the common suffix increases by one character. 5. If characters at indices i and j are different (A[i] != B[j]), I will update the value in the matrix as dp[i][j] = 0, as a new common suffix starts here. 6. During the process, I will also keep track of the maximum value in the matrix and its position, as they determine the length and starting point of the longest common substring. 7. Once the matrix is completely filled, I will extract the longest common substring using the maximum value and its position. Here is a step-by-step process for the given input: Input: A = \\"JdEKNd\\" B = \\"eUEKea\\" Step 1: Create a matrix 'dp' dp = [     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] ] Step 2: Initialize the first row and first column with 0 The matrix is already initialized with 0 in the first row and the first column. Step 3-5: Iterate through the strings and fill the matrix For example, when i = 2 and j = 5: A[2] = \\"E\\" B[5] = \\"e\\" Since they are not equal, dp[2][5] = 0. When i = 4 and j = 3: A[4] = \\"K\\" B[3] = \\"K\\" Since they are equal, dp[4][3] = dp[3][2] + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. The resulting matrix after filling all values will be: dp = [     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],     [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],     [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],     [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],     [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0] ] Step 6: Find the maximum value and its position in the matrix The maximum value is 2, located at position (6, 3), meaning that the longest common substring has a length of 2 and ends at index 3 of string B. Step 7: Extract the longest common substring Extract the substring using the maximum value and its position. In this case, B[3-2+1:3+1] = B[2:4] = \\"EK\\".

Hercules was once destined to be the King of Mycenae as his father Zeus had planned but his jealous stepmother Hera had other plans. Hera not willing a bastard son of Zeus should overshadow her, decided to let another boy, Eurystheus, his cousin born first which deprived Hercules of the right. Hera tried to kill Hercules with two serpents but he strangles them both. As the years go by, Hercules displayed strength like no other boy his age which unknown to many, his father is really Zeus. Eurystheus was then declared king after winning a race. Unable to accept his defeat, Hercules challenged Eurystheus to another round which accidentally takes away the life of his mother Alcmene. Feeling guilty even with all the consolation Megara gives him, he goes to the oracle and consults Apollo who tells him he must perform the \\"Twelve Labors\\" for Eurystheus. He refuses at first until the guilt goes so deep that he gives in to the challenge. Hercules is given a series of challenges each one was designed tougher by the other by his stepmother Hera. He was first sent to kill the Nemean lion which he succeeded into turning his coat. He also drove away the Stymphalian birds with the help of Athena's cymbals. Each one was made difficult by the other as his stepmother hopes to see the last of him.

Her father was an itinerant preacher originally from Shelby, Mississippi, while her mother was an accomplished piano player and vocalist. Alongside Franklin, her parents had three other children while both C. L. and Barbara had children from outside their marriage. The family relocated to Buffalo, New York when Franklin was two. Franklin dealt with weight issues for years. In 1974, she dropped 40 pounds (18 kg) during a crash diet and maintained her new weight until the end of the decade. Franklin again lost the weight in the early 1990s before gaining some back. A former chain smoker who struggled with alcoholism, she quit smoking in 1992. Franklin admitted in 1994 that her smoking was \\"messing with my voice\\", but after quitting smoking she said later, in 2003, that her weight \\"ballooned\\".  In 2010, Franklin canceled a number of concerts after she decided to have surgery for an undisclosed tumor. Discussing the surgery in 2011, she quoted her doctor as saying it would \\"add 15 to 20 years\\" to her life. She denied that the ailment had anything to do with pancreatic cancer, as it was rumored. On May 19, 2011, Franklin had her comeback show in the Chicago theatre. In May 2013, Franklin canceled two performances to deal with an undisclosed medical treatment. Later in the same month, Franklin canceled three more concerts in June and planned to return to perform in July. However, a show of July 27 in Clarkston, Michigan was canceled due to continued medical treatment. In addition, Franklin canceled an appearance at an MLB luncheon in Chicago honoring her commitment to civil rights on an August 24 date. She also canceled a performance of September 21 in Atlanta due to her health recovery. During a phone interview with The Associated Press in late August 2013 Franklin stated that she had a \\"miraculous\\" recovery from her undisclosed illness but had to cancel shows and appearances until she was at 100% health, stating she was \\"85% healed\\". Franklin has since returned to live performing, including a 2013 Christmas concert at Detroit's Motor City Casino. She launched a multi-city tour beginning the summer of 2014, starting with a performance of June 14 in New York at the Radio City Music Hall.  In 2017, Franklin canceled a series of concerts due to health reasons. During an outdoors Detroit show, Franklin told the audience to \\"keep me in your prayers\\".

The only home Hamilton ever owned was a Federal style mansion designed by John McComb Jr., which he built on his 32-acre country estate in Hamilton Heights in upper Manhattan. He named the house, which was completed in 1802, the \\"Grange\\" after his grandfather Alexander's estate in Ayrshire, Scotland. The house remained in the family until 1833 when his widow sold it to Thomas E. Davis, a British born real estate developer, for 25,000. Part of the proceeds were used by Eliza to purchase a new townhouse from Davis (Hamilton-Holly House) in Greenwich Village with her son Alexander. The Grange, first moved from its original location in 1889, was moved again in 2008 to a spot in St. Nicholas Park on land that was once part of the Hamilton estate, in Hamilton Heights, a neighborhood in upper Manhattan. The historic structure was restored to its original 1802 appearance in 2011, and is maintained by the National Park service as Hamilton Grange National Memorial. Alexander Hamilton served as one of the first trustees of the Hamilton-Oneida Academy in New York state. Later the Academy received a college charter in 1812, and the school was formally renamed Hamilton College.Columbia University, Hamilton's alma mater, has official memorials to Hamilton on its campus in New York City. The college's main classroom building for the humanities is Hamilton Hall, and a large statue of Hamilton stands in front of it.

Choices: [i] no [ii] yes","output":"The word \\"kudos\\" has an interesting origin, with roots in ancient Greece. To understand the etymology and history of this term, we need to delve into its various aspects. The term \\"kudos\\" comes from the Greek word \\"κῦδος\\" (kŷdos), which means 'praise' or 'glory.' In ancient Greek culture, recognition and praise for one's actions or accomplishments were essential to maintaining social status and honor. In this competitive environment, individuals sought kudos in various ways, such as through bravery in combat, artistic achievements, or athletic prowess. Over time, the concept of kudos spread beyond ancient Greece through the expansion of their language and culture. The term started to make its way into English in the early 19th century, when it was borrowed as a slang term for acclaim or praise. By the mid-19th century, it had gained more widespread usage among English-speaking communities, especially in Britain and its colonies. In the late 19th and 20th centuries, the term became increasingly popular in American English, where it eventually adopted a more colloquial and casual connotation. The modern usage of \\"kudos\\" in English is similar in meaning to its ancient Greek roots, referring to the praise, recognition, or honor given to someone for their achievements or accomplishments. Today, we often use it to express admiration, approval, or congratulations. Regarding the two questions mentioned: 1. \\"Where did the word 'kudos' come from?\\" 2. \\"Where does the term kudos come from?\\" These questions essentially have the same meaning as they both inquire about the origin of the term \\"kudos.\\" Despite the slightly different phrasing, both questions aim to understand the history and etymology of this word.

What is the sentiment of the following review? Another one of my favorite buffets!!! No, it's not on the strip. Yes, it's at the M Resort... Yes, M Resort is that one hotel off the 15 surrounded by absolutely nothing where you can see the lights and hotels of the strip in the distance.  Totally worth it.  Along with the buffet comes unlimited drinks. And by unlimited drinks I mean beer, wine, and cider. For free. Although, you should be nice and tip them lol  So at Studio B they have the weekday lunch buffet, which does NOT have the crab legs and other seafood. It's a little more boring, but also because the price is MUCH cheaper. Then they have weeknight buffets and then the weekend seafood buffet. I love the weekend seafood buffet because they have snow crab legs (hot and cold), raw oysters (which are just eh-- but they're raw oysters and you're in Vegas, you can expect them to be fresh LOL), shrimp, paella, etc. There's a bunch of dishes that you can't find during the rest of the week.  There's an incredible selection of food. I usually start at the end with the pizzas and salads. By the time I'm halfway through the line my plate is full and overflowing. I always get prime rib, but that's partly because I want to get my money's worth in food. Whenever I come for the seafood buffet, my boyfriend and I get at least one full plate of crab legs, piled high like a mountain.   I never eat the sushi there or the Asian food, but that's also because I feel like it's a waste of precious stomach real estate when you eat orange chicken and eggrolls at a buffet like this.  There's a huge dessert selection as well. I don't like the desserts as much as I like Wicked Spoon's desserts. Their gelato's just ok, but I always get some because I can't say no to ice cream lol. They have a lot of dessert shooter type things in mini cups that are just okay as well. Their creme brulee's not bad though. They serve espresso and coffee in that dessert section as well, but I'm usually all tapped out to get anything from there. Pick your answer from: + negative + positive","output":"+ positive The sentiment of this review is positive because the reviewer talks about how much they love the buffet, mentions the great selection of food, and recommends specific dishes. They also mention free unlimited drinks and appreciate the dessert options. While there are a few minor criticisms about certain dishes, the overall tone and content of the review are positive, making it clear that the reviewer enjoyed their experience at the buffet.

Q: Passage: On November 4, an extratropical disturbance was spawned just off the coast of western France, within a cold front, by another extratropical cyclone to the north, named \\"Quinn.\\" This storm began causing heavy rainfall in northern Italy, leading to flooding in the region. On the next day, a low-pressure area formed over western France, and the system was named Rolf by the Free University of Berlin, which names all significant low pressure systems affecting Europe. As the storm slowly moved eastward, it caused flooding in the Balearic Islands. Rolf gradually organized, and convection began to increase in the storm. Over the next couple of days, the storm continued to organize as it moved eastward, approaching the northwestern coast of Italy. On November 5, Rolf's forward motion slowed while the storm was stationed above the Massif Central in southern France, maintaining a central pressure of . On November 6, the system moved into the western Mediterranean Sea and stalled off the coast of Liguria, while gradually strengthening, bringing additional flooding to the region. Around the same time, the storm's frontal structure shrunk to in length. During that evening, Rolf spawned a tornado over Alassio, in northern Italy, causing some structural damage. On November 7, 2011, Rolf turned westward and slowly transitioned from an extratropical system into a subtropical depression over the warm waters of the Mediterranean Sea, with the system acquiring a warm quasi-symmetric core, and with organized convective rainbands wrapping around the center of the storm. The storm was then given the designation Invest 99L, by the United States Naval Research Laboratory (the NRL). The NOAA also began watching the subtropical depression, which was now located in the Gulf of Lion. Later that day, Rolf transitioned from a subtropical depression into a tropical depression off the coast of France, and the NOAA gave Rolf the identifier 01M.

Please add spaces between words: OkawasalsointerestedinJapanesepoetryandZenphilosophy.","output":"Okawa was also interested in Japanese poetry and Zen philosophy.  Okawa was a unique individual who had a strong passion for various aspects of Japanese culture. This blend of interests made Okawa a well-rounded individual who could appreciate the depth and beauty of both literature and the spiritual world. Japanese poetry has a long and rich history, with several forms such as haiku, tanka, and renga. As a lover of Japanese poetry, Okawa must have been fascinated with how poets were able to capture the essence of nature, emotions, and human experiences in such concise and profound ways. Japanese poetry often relies on simple language and evokes powerful imagery through subtle metaphors and allusions. Haiku, for example, is a traditional form of Japanese poetry comprising just three lines with a syllabic structure of 5-7-5. Despite its brevity, a good haiku can encapsulate the emotions or feelings of a particular moment or scene in nature. Okawa would have admired the mastery of this form by renowned poets like Matsuo Basho, Yosa Buson, and Kobayashi Issa. Zen philosophy, on the other hand, is a strand of Buddhism that originated in China and later spread to Japan. It emphasizes mindfulness, meditation, and the attainment of enlightenment through direct experience and intuitive understanding. Okawa's interest in Zen philosophy suggests a deep curiosity about spiritual growth, self-awareness, and the nature of reality. Some of the essential aspects of Zen philosophy include zazen (sitting meditation), koans (paradoxical questions or statements to provoke enlightenment), and the appreciation of the impermanent nature of life. Okawa's study of Zen would have made him familiar with the famous Zen masters like Dogen and Hakuin, as well as their teachings which often intersect with poetic expressions. The combination of Okawa's interests in Japanese poetry and Zen philosophy likely fostered a profound appreciation for the interconnectedness of art and spirituality. Japanese poetry often reflects aspects of Zen philosophy, such as the focus on simplicity, directness, and the awareness of the impermanent nature of life. Overall, Okawa's affinity for both Japanese poetry and Zen philosophy highlights a deep respect and understanding of the Japanese culture. This unique perspective would have shaped the way Okawa engaged with the world around them and provided them with a wealth of inspiration, wisdom, and insight."},{"instruction":"Question: Question: who was the first one to invent medicine I found the following answer on Google: Universities began systematic training of physicians around the years 1220 in Italy.

This is not some crazy future concept -- this is a real vehicle, fully electric, and on sale now. Prices for the Twizy start at PS6,690, with battery hire from PS45 a month. But is it a car? Technically no, it' s classified under UK law as something closer to a moped  . A two-seater (the passenger sits behind the driver), the Twizy runs on electric power only, and is designed to cover all those little trips we do. And as 87 percent of Europe's drivers do less than 37 miles a day -- 50 per cent less than 12--there's really no need to be burning gas for that sort of journey. The Twizy is arguably the most unusual vehicle in this country. Other cars have been beautifully designed, others have been small, but no car has turned motoring on its head in quite the same way. The Twizy's batteries have a range of 62 miles, and it plugs into a standard socket like any other electrical equipment, going from flat to full power in three and a half hours. There are no full doors on the vehicle, so think of it like a covered moped with four wheels, but no noise and no need for a helmet. There's also a lower-powered type being designed, the Twizy 45, for which you don' t need a license. Seeing the Twizy in the flesh, you' re surprised by how striking it looks. Sit in it and everything feels right --just car enough to be easy, but different enough to be exciting. With the battery underneath you, the vehicle is suckered   to the road, and the electric power means it accelerates with real energy up to about 50 mph. You don't feel you need any more. In the UK, the weather alone may make it a good buy, but the lack of easy access to outdoor sockets is the biggest challenge. Only time will tell if this brave move answers enough problems to find a place in our lives. Question: In which part of a magazine can we most probably read this text?

If Rahul Gandhi or Sonia Gandhi are hurt by my statements, I regret what I said,\\" the DNA website quotes him as saying.

Born Sonia Maino on 9 December 1946 in the town of Orbassano, near Turin, to a building contractor and his wife, Mrs Gandhi was raised in a traditional Roman Catholic household. In 1964, she went to Cambridge to study English at a language school. Her life changed forever when she met her future husband, Rajiv Gandhi, who was studying engineering at the university. She is now an Indian citizen and heads the main opposition Congress party. Her party has demanded an apology from Mr Singh and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. \\"The Congress strongly deprecates and condemns the intemperate and distasteful remarks of Giriraj Singh bordering on insanity,\\" the NDTV website quotes Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala as saying.

Hint: Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury.

Write highlights for this article: By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 22:21 EST, 5 August 2012. |. UPDATED:. 04:42 EST, 6 August 2012. Half a million Sikhs in the U.S. have worried about their safety ever since the September 11 attacks, when some began targeting adherents of a peaceful religion that stresses the equality of people. Those fears came true on Sunday, when six worshippers were gunned down at a temple in suburban Milwaukee in a massacre which police believe was an act of 'domestic terrorism'. While police have not identified the gunman, who was killed by police, or described a possible motive for the Wisconsin shootings, several leaders of Sikh organizations nationwide say the killings have brought to the surface fears that have lingered since 9/11, when some ignorant about their beliefs began mistaking them for potential terrorists. Nightmare: Armed police outside the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in response to a massacre which left six worshippers dead on Sunday morning. Grief: A Sikh man wipes away a tear in the aftermath of the tragic shooting in Wisconsin. 'This is something we have been fearing since 9/11, that this kind of incident will take place,' said Rajwant Singh, chairman of the Washington-based Sikh Council on Religion and Education. 'It was a matter of time because there's so much ignorance and people confuse us [as] being members of Taliban or belonging to Bin Laden.' Valarie Kaur, 31, a filmmaker from New Haven, Connecticutt who has chronicled Sikh attacks for 11 years, said the shooting 'is reverberating through every Sikh American home,' where the worst is feared. 'We are experiencing it as a hate crime,' she said. 'Every Sikh American today is hurting, grieving and afraid.' The cloth turbans worn for centuries by members of the Sikh faith so they could better serve their communities through a commitment to the oneness of God in all faiths and equality for all people has ironically made them targets of those ignorant of their history, she argued. 'That turban has tragically marked us as automatically suspect, perpetually foreign and potentially terrorists,' Ms Kaur said. Horror: Sikhs have long feared a backlash from people who confuse them with jihadi terrorists. Confusion: Many members of Sikh communities in the U.S. have felt victimised since September 11. Amarjit Singh, vice president of the Illinois Sikh Community Center, which serves 5,000 Sikhs, agreed about the September 11 fears and said the congregation prayed for the slain victims as word of the shooting spread. 'We have a lot of families who have family members that attend that temple,' Mr Singh said. 'It seemed so random.' Two elderly men wearing turbans were shot to death in March while taking a walk in Elk Grove, California, and police are investigating it as a hate crime. Days after the 2001 terror attacks, a Sikh man was killed in suburban Phoenix. The man who was later convicted of his death had told his wife that 'all Arabs should be shot'. And at airports, controversy has erupted when airport workers try to search or remove Sikh turbans, considered sacred in the Sikh faith. Comfort: A father holds his daughter near the scene in Oak Creek where six Sikhs were shot dead. Tragedy: On Sunday, Sikhs were faced with a disaster many had feared would eventually come to pass. Though there were no known threats, the New York Police Department announced it was increasing coverage in an abundance of caution in and around Sikh temples. Harkirat Sandhu, 45, of Hanover Park, Illinois, a member of the Sikh Religious Society of Chicago for more than 10 years, said he worried more Sikhs could be targeted. 'The Sikh community is a peaceful community,' he said. 'We don't believe in this type of hate and crime. We condemn this situation.' 'Americans of all faiths should stand in unified support with their Sikh brothers and sisters,' said Sapreet Kaur, executive director of the New York-based Sikh Coalition, the largest Sikh American civil rights organization in the U.S. Barack Obama and his presidential challenger, Mitt Romney, expressed their sorrow in statements.South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, whose parents are Sikh, posted a statement with condolences to 'the innocent victims and the family of the heroic officer' on her Facebook page. Ms Kaur, the filmmaker, said she was encouraged by the outpouring from others, unimaginable a decade ago. 'My phone has been ringing off the hook,' she said. 'That gives me hope. Any expressions of solidarity, messages, prayers, will be felt not only by Sikhs in Milwaukee but all over the country.'","output":"In August 2012, a tragic incident occurred at a Sikh temple in suburban Milwaukee, where six worshippers were killed in a shooting, believed by the police to be an act of 'domestic terrorism.'

Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian national visiting family in Dallas, Texas, succumbed to the deadly virus on October 8, 2014. Meanwhile, President Obama maintains his opposition to the much-discussed travel ban amid growing concerns about the potential threat the virus poses to the United States.  Thomas Eric Duncan's story captured the hearts and minds of the nation as he became the first person to be diagnosed with and die from the Ebola virus in the United States. He arrived in the country from Liberia on September 20, 2014, and he began showing symptoms of the disease a few days later. On September 28, he was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where he would fight for his life until his tragic passing on October 8. In an emotional public statement, Duncan's fiancée, Louise Troh, described him as a \\"kind and compassionate man,\\" while expressing her deep grief over his loss. She has faced isolation and public scrutiny as a close contact of an Ebola patient, but through it all, she clung to hope for Duncan's survival, steadfastly maintaining her love and support for him throughout his battle with the deadly disease. Troh, along with her son, Duncan's extended family, friends, and members of their tight-knit Liberian community in Dallas, now come together to grieve his death and celebrate his life. Duncan's demise has sparked a vigorous discussion about the possibility of banning travel from countries most affected by the Ebola outbreak, such as Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. Those in favor of the ban argue that it would protect the United States from further cases of the virus, while opponents contend that it would only exacerbate the outbreak and hinder aid and relief efforts in West Africa. In a White House news conference on October 15, 2014, President Obama reiterated his opposition to a travel ban, stating that it would \\"restrict the ability of the United States to respond to the crisis.\\" Obama emphasized that the best way to contain the Ebola outbreak is by addressing the problem at its source in West Africa and noted that the administration would continue to take appropriate precautions to protect the health and security of the American people. Obama's stance on the issue is supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international leaders in the fight against Ebola, who also express concern that a travel ban would hinder the efforts of healthcare workers and aid agencies in the affected regions. Dr. Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General, asserts that \\"closing borders and imposing travel bans would not stop Ebola,\\" and that \\"the only way to defeat the virus is to work together.\\" Despite the administration's objections, several members of Congress and the general public continue to call for a travel ban. The question of how best to protect the United States from the threat of the Ebola virus, while simultaneously addressing the crisis in West Africa, remains a contentious issue, with valid arguments on both sides. As family and friends mourn the loss of Thomas Eric Duncan, they also grapple with the broader implications of his tragic story. The heartbreaking case of Duncan brings to light the ongoing global health menace posed by the Ebola virus and ignites debates over the proper steps to ensure public safety in the face of this unprecedented outbreak."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: As time passes, the number of HIV copies keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells keeps decreasing. The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one.  I am facing a new situation today: A doctor tested two people for HIV. Tom had the virus in his blood, while Nick didn't have HIV, he was healthy. Tom has apparently had the virus for 20 years.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person didn't have the ability of the immune system to defend the body decreasing? Answer:","output":"Based on the background article and the new situation, the person whose ability of the immune system to defend the body is not decreasing is Nick. The article states that as time passes, the number of HIV copies in a person's body keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells, which plays a crucial role in the immune system, keeps decreasing. When the number of T cells decreases, the ability of the immune system to defend the body also decreases. Consequently, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections, and their immune system becomes more susceptible to various diseases. In the new situation, Tom has been living with HIV for 20 years, which means that over this period, his helper T cells declined, impairing his immune system’s ability to defend his body. On the other hand, Nick is healthy and does not have HIV. This implies that his helper T cells have not been affected by the virus, and his immune system is functioning normally. Therefore, it is Nick who does not have a decreasing ability of the immune system to defend his body. It is essential to note that although medicines can slow down the virus and its damage to the immune system, there is currently no cure for HIV infections or AIDS. Scientists are also working on developing a vaccine that could immunize people against HIV infection in the future. In the meantime, it is crucial for individuals to practice safe behaviors, engage in regular testing, and, if diagnosed with HIV, adhere to recommended treatment regimens to minimize the impact of the virus on their immune system and overall health."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If the striker remains on Merseyside while serving his four-month ban, he will cast a heavy cloud. Brendan Rodgers needs reliability and stability as well as talent to create title-winning team.","output":"Title: The Impact of Luis Suarez's Ban on Liverpool's Title Hopes Introduction Luis Suarez is undoubtedly a world-class footballer, capable of performing at the highest level and putting in match-winning performances for his club. However, the Uruguayan international's prowess on the field has often been overshadowed by his disciplinary problems, leading to adverse consequences for his team. In light of Suarez's latest ban, this article examines the impact of his lengthy suspension on Liverpool's title aspirations and explores Brendan Rodgers' options in terms of squad development and stability. The Significance of Suarez's Absence in the First Nine Premier League Matches Luis Suarez's prolonged suspension will see him miss the first nine Premier League matches of the upcoming season, a series of fixtures that could prove pivotal in determining Liverpool's title credentials. This ban not only entails a loss of crucial attacking talent for the Reds but also poses a significant disruption to the team's overall rhythm, as Rodgers will need to reshape his attacking lineup during this period. Among the matches that Suarez will miss are encounters against top teams, such as Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur, as well as matches that tend to be potential banana skins, such as the Merseyside Derby against Everton. In these high-pressure games, Suarez's absence may be felt even more acutely, as the Uruguayan's penchant for scoring crucial goals has been well-documented. Suarez's Presence on Merseyside: A Heavy Cloud over the Club During the four-month ban, Luis Suarez will be unable to partake in any football-related activities whatsoever, which raises questions about his role at the club. If the suspension is not reduced or overturned, Suarez is likely to be present at the club's Melwood training ground during this period. This scenario has the potential to cast a heavy cloud over the club, as rumors surrounding his future and the possible negative influence on the team's morale will remain a significant concern for the Liverpool hierarchy. The Need for Reliability, Stability, and Talent The key to any title-winning team is a combination of reliability, stability, and talent within the squad, a balance that Brendan Rodgers will struggle to strike in the initial stages of the upcoming Premier League season. In the past, the Northern Irish tactician has praised Suarez's professionalism and attitude on the training ground, but the striker's current ban negates these qualities, further disrupting the harmony in the dressing room. Rodgers will urgently need to find a solution that maintains the stability of the team while simultaneously compensating for the loss of Suarez's goals and creativity. Additionally, the manager will have to manage the expectations of the fans and the media through this period, as every Liverpool performance is likely to be scrutinized more closely due to Suarez's absence. Conclusion The considerable impact of Luis Suarez's lengthy ban poses a genuine threat to Liverpool's title aspirations for the upcoming season. The Merseyside club will need to quickly find a way to adapt to life without their talisman and ensure that they maintain a sense of stability and togetherness in the face of adversity. Brendan Rodgers has already shown his ability to handle difficult situations through his tenure at Liverpool, but the challenge of navigating the Suarez-sized void could prove to be his sternest test yet. Only time will tell whether Rodgers can minimize the effects of Suarez's absence, prevent it from derailing the team's title charge, and ultimately transform Liverpool into a force to be reckoned with in the Premier League once again."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 2*t - 8 = 6*t for t.","output":"To solve the given equation 2*t - 8 = 6*t for t, we need to isolate t on one side of the equation. Here's a step-by-step walkthrough: 1. Write down the equation:    2*t - 8 = 6*t 2. Start by moving the term containing t on the right-hand side to the left-hand side of the equation. To do this, subtract 6*t from both sides of the equation:    2*t - 8 - 6*t = 6*t - 6*t 3. Simplify the terms:    -4*t - 8 = 0 4. Now, we have to isolate t by moving the constant term on the left-hand side to the right-hand side of the equation. To do this, add 8 to both sides of the equation:    -4*t - 8 + 8 = 0 + 8 5.

Article: I think the Buddy Club is great. I really enjoy talking with the older students about school life and growing up. They can tell me a lot. One student told me how he relaxed   before exams. Another student told me about great websites about learning History and English. The Buddy Club is also a good place to just forget about school altogether! One of the older students taught us origami  . We made paper planes, birds and hats together. The table tennis tournament  was a great idea. I didn't do very well, but I learnt a lot from watching the doubles tournament won by a fourteen-year-old girl and a seventeen-year-old boy. Last year, we had the annual   Buddy Club Picnic. Everyone enjoyed the games we played. After I learnt how to fish, I caught two fish in the lake. I think it might be a good idea to change the Buddy Club Picnic to a weekend camping trip. We could learn how to put up   tents   and how to find our way through a forest. Many of the older students know how to do this already, and I think they would like to teach the younger students. I want to say again how much I enjoy the club. When I'm older, I will make friends with younger students. Then, I can tell them all about school life and growing up.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. If you build a campfire, you start with a large stack of sticks and logs. As the fire burns, the stack slowly shrinks. By the end of the evening, all that is left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way. What do you think happened? The truth is that the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Although matter was changed, it was not created or destroyed. Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved. You may wonder how it can be conserved if something is now missing? Assume you had measured the mass of the wood before you burned it. Assume you had also trapped the gases released by the burning wood and measured their mass and the mass of the ashes. What would you find? The ashes and gases combined have the same mass as the wood you started with. This example illustrates the law of conservation of mass.

Sydney was sneaking some snacks. 2. Addison heard Sydney's parents at the door. Options: (a) be told Addison can't stay (b) be punished (c) be praised for their friend Step 1: Analyze the options Option (a) implies that Sydney's parents may be upset about Addison being there, possibly due to the sneaking of snacks or simply being unaware of their presence. Option (b) suggests that Sydney may get punished for sneaking snacks, which may be against the house rules or being done at an inappropriate time. Option (c) involves Sydney being praised for having a friend like Addison, which may indicate that Sydney's parents approve of their friendship or appreciate Addison's honesty. Step 2: Evaluate the options Option (a) seems less likely, as there is no direct connection between Addison hearing Sydney's parents and them being asked to leave. Option (b) could happen if Sydney's parents are strict and enforce consequences for breaking house rules.

Is it healthy to spend the first six hours of every day, seven days a week, on Quora, reading, writing and editing, instead of making money?","output":"To determine if these questions have the same meaning, let's analyze them step by step. 1. Identifying the main topics in each question: - Question 1: The harm in taking antibiotics haphazardly over 2 weeks instead of every six hours. - Question 2: The healthiness of spending the first six hours of every day, seven days a week, on Quora, reading, writing, and editing, instead of making money. 2. Identifying similarities: - Both questions are asking about the potential negative consequences of irregular actions (haphazard antibiotic use and spending excessive time on Quora) compared to more conventional, structured alternatives (proper antibiotic scheduling and making money). 3. Identifying differences: - Question 1 is focused on the misuse of antibiotics and the potential harm caused by incorrect dosing. - Question 2 is centered on the allocation of time, questioning whether it is healthy to dedicate significant time to Quora rather than focusing on income generation.

Answer the following question: Given the following passage  \\"Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears.

Article: U.S. authorities have charged the alleged owner of today’s most visited illegal file-sharing website with criminal copyright infringement and have seized domain names associated with the website.      Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Zachary T. Fardon of the Northern District of Illinois, Executive Associate Director Peter T. Edge of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and Chief Richard Weber of the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) made the announcement.      Artem Vaulin, 30, of Kharkiv, Ukraine, was arrested today in Poland and is charged by criminal complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago, with one count of conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement, one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and two counts of criminal copyright infringement. The United States will seek to extradite Vaulin to the United States.      “Vaulin is charged with running today’s most visited illegal file-sharing website, responsible for unlawfully distributing well over 1 billion of copyrighted materials,” said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell. “In an effort to evade law enforcement, Vaulin allegedly relied on servers located in countries around the world and moved his domains due to repeated seizures and civil lawsuits. His arrest in Poland, however, demonstrates again that cybercriminals can run, but they cannot hide from justice.”      “Copyright infringement exacts a large toll, a very human one, on the artists and businesses whose livelihood hinges on their creative inventions,” said U.S. Attorney Fardon. “Vaulin allegedly used the Internet to cause enormous harm to those artists. Our Cybercrimes Unit at the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Chicago will continue to work with our law enforcement partners around the globe to identify, investigate and prosecute those who attempt to illegally profit from the innovation of others.”      “Artem Vaulin was allegedly running a worldwide digital piracy website that stole more than 1 billion in profits from the U.S. entertainment industry,” said Executive Associate Director Edge. “Protecting legitimate commerce is one of HSI’s highest priorities. With the cooperation of our law enforcement partners, we will continue to aggressively bring to justice those who enrich themselves by stealing the creative work of U.S. artists.”      “Investigating cyber-enabled schemes is a top priority for CI,” said Chief Weber. “Websites such as the one seized today brazenly facilitate all kinds of illegal commerce. Criminal Investigation is committed to thoroughly investigating financial crimes, regardless of the medium. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to unravel this and other complex financial transactions and money laundering schemes where individuals attempt to conceal the true source of their income and use the Internet to mask their true identity.”      According to the complaint, Vaulin allegedly owns and operates Kickass Torrents or KAT, a commercial website that has enabled users to illegally reproduce and distribute hundreds of millions of copyrighted motion pictures, video games, television programs, musical recordings and other electronic media since 2008. The copyrighted material is collectively valued at well over 1 billion, according to the complaint. The complaint alleges that KAT receives more than 50 million unique visitors per month and is estimated to be the 69th most frequently visited website on the internet.      In addition, a federal court in Chicago ordered the seizure of one bank account and seven domain names associated with the alleged KAT conspiracy.      According to the complaint, KAT has consistently made available for download movies that were still in theaters and displayed advertising throughout its site. KAT’s net worth has been estimated at more than 54 million, with estimated annual advertising revenue in the range of 12.5 million to 22.3 million, according to the complaint. The complaint alleges that the site operates in approximately 28 languages. KAT has moved its domains several times due to numerous seizures and copyright lawsuits, and it has been ordered blocked by courts in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Denmark, Belgium and Malaysia, according to the complaint. KAT has allegedly operated at various times under the domains kickasstorrents.com, kat.ph, kickass.to, kickass.so and kat.cr, and relied on a network of computer servers located around the world, including in Chicago.      Several motion pictures currently available for download and sharing on KAT are still showing in theatres, including “Captain America: Civil War,” “Now You See Me 2,” “Independence Day: Resurgence” and “Finding Dory,” according to the complaint. The complaint alleges that Vaulin, who used the screen name “tirm,” was involved in designing KAT’s original website, oversaw KAT’s operations and, during the latter part of the conspiracy, Vaulin allegedly operated KAT under the auspices of a Ukrainian-based front company called Cryptoneat.      The charges and allegations contained in the complaint are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty.      HSI and IRS-CI investigated the case with substantial assistance from the International Organized Crime Intelligence and Operations Center, the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center, the Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs and the Polish Border Guard and National Prosecutor’s Office.      Senior Counsel Ryan K. Dickey of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys William E. Ridgway and Devlin N. Su of the Northern District of Illinois are prosecuting the case. The Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs also provided significant assistance in this case. ||||| Further Reading Who knew? MPAA concerned online pirates are exposed to malware Federal authorities announced on Wednesday the arrest of the alleged mastermind of KickassTorrents (KAT), the world’s largest BitTorrent distribution site. As of this writing, the site is still up.      Prosecutors have formally charged Artem Vaulin, 30, of Ukraine, with one count of conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement, one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, and two counts of criminal copyright infringement.      Like The Pirate Bay, KAT does not host individual infringing files but rather provides .torrent and .magnet links so that users can download unauthorized copies of TV shows, movies, and more from various BitTorrent users.      According to a Department of Justice press release sent to Ars, Vaulin was arrested on Wednesday in Poland. The DOJ will shortly seek his extradition to the United States.      “Vaulin is charged with running today’s most visited illegal file-sharing website, responsible for unlawfully distributing well over 1 billion of copyrighted materials,” Assistant Attorney General Caldwell said in the statement. “In an effort to evade law enforcement, Vaulin allegedly relied on servers located in countries around the world and moved his domains due to repeated seizures and civil lawsuits. His arrest in Poland, however, demonstrates again that cybercriminals can run, but they cannot hide from justice.”      DMCA ignored all day long      According to the 50-page affidavit authored by Jared Der-Yeghiayan, Vaulin and KAT claimed that they respected the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, but they did not. Der-Yeghiayan is a special agent with Homeland Securities Investigations and also was a key witness in the trial of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht.      When Hollywood and other film studios filed a notice-and-takedown for a potential DMCA violation, KAT would respond this way:      Greetings,      Your request has been reviewed, but cannot be processed due to one (or      more) of the following reasons:      1) The Claim wasn't written in English language;      2) You provided no evidence showing that you are the copyright holder      or that you are acting on behalf of the copyright holder;      3) You provided no evidence showing that the content is legally      copyrighted;      4) There were more then [sic] 30 torrents mentioned in the Claim email;      5) Your content is hosted on a different website.

You can find more detailed information regarding the DMCA email      layout via the following article - https://kat.cr/dmca/      Respectfully,      KAT team      Keeping mum      Der-Yeghiayan also estimated KAT's annual advertising revenue as being more than 16 million per year as of 2016.      In the complaint, the HSI agent also describes how an undercover IRS agent purchased an ad on KAT in March 2016 at the rate of 300 per day. The KAT representative, \\"Mr. White,\\" provided details for a Latvian bank but warned the American buyer to \\"make sure that you don’t mention KAT anywhere.\\"      After a successful five-day ad buy, the undercover IRS agent again tried to buy another ad. Mr. White told him that the existing \\"faster download\\" ads were all sold out but that he could buy a pricier banner ad at 1,000 to 3,200 per day.      By May, Mr. White informed the undercover agent of new banking details, this time in Estonia. Through the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) process, US investigators were able to easily obtain those bank records.      HSI and the IRS looked into the historical hosting records of KAT and found that for about 3.5 years, ending in January 2016, the operation was hosted out of Chicago, Illinois, which explains why the case is now being prosecuted out of the Northern District of Illinois. The site also used a Canadian hosting service—the two American agencies also used MLAT to get an image of the Canadian server.      Finally, Der-Yeghiayan also described how Apple provided a copy of Vaulin's e-mail account (tirm@me.com), which included other incriminating information that establishes probable cause of a criminal conspiracy. He concluded by noting that the Costa Rican and Filipino authorities have been alerted and that HSI and the IRS would be using the MLAT process to try to seize the kat.cr and kat.ph domains, among others. ||||| The U.S. Government has arrested the alleged owner of KickassTorrents, the world's largest torrent site. The 30-year-old Ukrainian was arrested in Poland today and is charged with criminal copyright infringement and money laundering. In addition, a federal court in Chicago has ordered the seizure of several KAT domain names.      With millions of unique visitors per day KickassTorrents (KAT) has become the most-used torrent site on the Internet, beating even The Pirate Bay.      Today, however, the site has run into a significant roadblock after U.S. authorities announced the arrest of the site’s alleged owner.      The 30-year-old Artem Vaulin, from Ukraine, was arrested today in Poland from where the United States has requested his extradition.      In a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago, the alleged owner is charged with conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and two counts of criminal copyright infringement.      The complaint further reveals that the feds posed as an advertiser, which revealed a bank account associated with the site.      It also shows that Apple handed over personal details of Vaulin after the investigator cross-referenced an IP-address used for an iTunes transaction with an IP-address that was used to login to KAT’s Facebook account.      “Records provided by Apple showed that [email protected] conducted an iTunes transaction using IP Address 109.86.226.203 on or about July 31, 2015. The same IP Address was used on the same day to login into the KAT Facebook,” the complaint reads.      In addition to the arrest in Poland, the court also granted the seizure of a bank account associated with KickassTorrents, as well as several of the site’s domain names.      Commenting on the announcement, Assistant Attorney General Caldwell said that KickassTorrents helped to distribute over 1 billion in pirated files.      “Vaulin is charged with running today’s most visited illegal file-sharing website, responsible for unlawfully distributing well over 1 billion of copyrighted materials.”      “In an effort to evade law enforcement, Vaulin allegedly relied on servers located in countries around the world and moved his domains due to repeated seizures and civil lawsuits. His arrest in Poland, however, demonstrates again that cybercriminals can run, but they cannot hide from justice.”      KAT’s .com and .tv domains are expected to be seized soon by Verisign. For the main Kat.cr domain and several others, seizure warrants will be sent to the respective authorities under the MLAT treaty.      At the time of writing the main domain name Kat.cr has trouble loading, but various proxies still appear to work. KAT’s status page doesn’t list any issues, but we assume that this will be updated shortly.

Q:I read this background article the other day: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma.  I am facing a new situation today: Two farmers are having a conversation at a bar about how their soil is doing. Jeff takes a sip of his beer and says that he just discovered that his soil is hypoxic. Brandon is trying to get the attention of the bartender so he can order another martini. Upon hearing Jeff's remark about his soil, Brandon states that the soil on his own farm is not hypoxic. Brandon is relieved when he notices the bartender is finally walking over to them.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Does Jeff's soil have more or less toxic compounds than Brandon's? A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article, it can be inferred that Jeff's soil would likely have more toxic compounds than Brandon's soil. Since Jeff's soil is hypoxic, meaning it has low oxygen levels, anaerobic bacteria would become more active in his soil. These anaerobic bacteria use alternative electron acceptors such as nitrate, manganese, and sulfate, which can lead to the formation of toxic compounds. In contrast, Brandon's soil is not hypoxic, suggesting that it has adequate oxygen levels, and thus, fewer toxic compounds would be formed due to lower activity of anaerobic bacteria."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The protesters, supporters of ex-Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski's VMRO party, are demanding new elections. Politics in the former Yugoslav republic has been deadlocked since an inconclusive election in December. But the crisis goes back further, to a phone-tapping scandal two years ago. Mr Zaev has created a coalition with ethnic Albanian parties, but his attempts to form a government have been blocked by the president. Macedonian nationalists have been protesting on the streets since Mr Zaev tried to form the coalition. Ethnic Albanians make up around a quarter of the country's population. The people who stormed parliament were angered by the coalition's decision to elect Talat Xhaferi as speaker. They fear moves to improve the status of Albanians threaten Macedonian unity. Some of the 200 protesters were masked. Witnesses saw broken glass on the floor and traces of blood in hallways. Police fired stun grenades to disperse protesters and allow politicians to exit the parliament building. A statement from the US Embassy in Macedonia, published on Twitter, said: \\"We condemn the violence in the strongest possible terms. \\"It is not consistent with democracy and is not an acceptable way to resolve differences.\\" The secretary general of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, tweeted that he was \\"shocked\\" by the \\"attacks\\". \\"All parties should respect democratic process and engage in dialogue, not violence,\\" he wrote. \\"Violence has NO place in Parliament. Democracy must run its course,\\" tweeted European Union Commissioner Johannes Hahn. Skopje has also seen regular protests against the coalition by demonstrators who believe it will damage the country's national unity. Macedonia came close to civil war in 2001 after an Albanian uprising. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"A big fight happened in the parliament building in Macedonia, which is a country in Europe. At least 10 people got hurt, including an important person named Zoran Zaev. The people fighting were supporters of a different political party and they want new elections. This problem started because of some disagreements between political parties and a scandal from two years ago. The people who started the fight were not happy that someone they didn't like was elected as speaker. The police had to use special noisy and bright grenades to make the protesters leave the building. Important people from other countries said that they didn’t like the violence and that people should talk about their differences instead of fighting. This fighting reminded people of a time when the country almost had a big war in 2001."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: Process:  - The blood sugar drops in a body - Cells in the pancrease release glucagon - The liver in response turns the glucagon into glucose - And releases it into the blood - The blood sugar levels are restored.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less blood sugar happens, how will it affect less glucose in blood.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"The process you have outlined describes the body's response to low blood sugar levels, also known as hypoglycemia. Under normal circumstances, the body regulates blood sugar levels through a series of feedback loops involving various organs and hormones. Perturbations, or disturbances, in this process could have consequences for an individual's health and well-being. In your proposed hypothesis, a situation arises where there is less blood sugar than normal, which leads to less glucose being present in the blood. To better understand the impact of this perturbation, let's first examine the individual steps described in the blood sugar regulation process: 1. Blood sugar levels drop in the body: This can occur for various reasons, such as fasting, increased physical activity, or due to medications for diabetes management. 2. Cells in the pancreas release glucagon: In response to the decrease in blood sugar levels, alpha cells in the pancreas are stimulated to secrete the hormone glucagon. 3. The liver turns glucagon into glucose: Glucagon's primary function is to signal the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose through a process known as glycogenolysis.  4. Liver releases glucose into the blood: The newly produced glucose is then released by the liver back into the bloodstream, aiming to increase blood sugar levels. 5. Blood sugar levels are restored: The rise in glucose levels signal the cessation of glucagon release, and this process of regulation will continue until a state of normal blood sugar concentration is reached. Now, let's consider the effects of your proposed perturbation - less blood sugar leading to less glucose in the blood: In the case of a persistent reduction in blood glucose levels, the body will respond using the process described above to adjust and maintain adequate blood sugar concentrations. However, if there is a sustained perturbation in this finely balanced process, it could lead to some potential consequences: 1. Direct impact on blood sugar regulation: If the body is unable to produce enough glucose to maintain blood sugar levels, it could result in a state of persistent hypoglycemia. This may cause symptoms such as dizziness, weakness, confusion, irritability, and in extreme cases, even unconsciousness or seizures. It is worth noting that the body has other mechanisms to produce glucose, such as gluconeogenesis, where new glucose is produced from non-carbohydrate precursors like amino acids and lactate. However, these processes may not fully compensate for substantially decreased blood sugar levels. 2. Indirect impact on other biological processes: Persistently low blood sugar levels could also have indirect effects on the body's overall functioning. For example, since glucose is a primary energy source for the brain, reduced glucose availability could impair cognitive functions, leading to difficulties with concentration and decision-making. Furthermore, chronic hypoglycemia could have negative implications for cellular metabolism, growth, and repair mechanisms, potentially affecting various organs and systems in the body. In conclusion, a sustained perturbation in blood sugar levels leading to less glucose in the blood could have both direct and indirect consequences on the blood sugar regulation process and the body's overall functioning. Proper monitoring and maintaining blood sugar levels within normal ranges are crucial for avoiding any disturbances in this delicate balance and ensuring optimum health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Aaron Alston manages to make this a much more interesting and exciting novel by including more space battles, and a slightly more realistic plot than the last book (Wedge suddenly deciding that the New Republic needs a squadron full of washouts??).

The word \\"medicine\\" is derived from Latin \\"medicus\\", meaning \\"a physician\\". Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.  - Situated at 16 rue Bonaparte in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, the Académie nationale de médecine (National Academy of Medicine) was created in 1820 by king Louis XVIII at the urging of baron Antoine Portal. At its inception, the institution was known as the Académie royale de médecine (or \\"Royal Academy of Medicine\\"). This academy was endowed with the legal status of two institutions which preceded it  the Académie royale de chirurgie (or \\"Royal Academy of Surgery\\"), which was created in 1731 and of the Société royale de médecine (or \\"Royal Society of Medicine\\"), which was created in 1776.  - Albert Besson ( 1896 -- 1965 ) was a French hygienist , physician and member of the French Académie Nationale de Médecine .  - A physician, medical practitioner, medical doctor or simply doctor is a professional who practises medicine, which is concerned with promoting, maintaining, or restoring health through the study, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, injury, and other physical and mental impairments. Physicians may focus their practice on certain disease categories, types of patients and methods of treatmentknown as specialitiesor they may assume responsibility for the provision of continuing and comprehensive medical care to individuals, families, and communitiesknown as general practice. Medical practice properly requires both a detailed knowledge of the academic disciplines (such as anatomy and physiology) underlying diseases and their treatmentthe \\"science\\" of medicineand also a decent competence in its applied practicethe art or \\"craft\\" of medicine.  - The 6th arrondissement of Paris is one of the 20 arrondissements (administrative districts) of Paris, France.

Write some highlights for the following article: A list of billionaires, bankers and lobbyists who received £12,000-a-table access to David Cameron and other senior Cabinet ministers was published for the first time last night. The documents revealed that almost 450 attendees at last summer’s glittering Tory fundraising dinner had a combined wealth of more than £11billion. They sat at tables costing up to £12,000 each alongside Mr Cameron, Home Secretary Theresa May, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and London Mayor Boris Johnson. Known as the 'homeless billionaire', Nicolas Berggruen is famous for not having a home despite his vast wealth. The 52-year-old founder and president of Berggruen Holdings, a private investment company, was seated very near to the Prime Minister at last summer's glittering Tory fundraising dinner. It is not known how much was raised from the 2013 event, but Electoral Commission figures show that since the ball, those present have donated £5million to the Conservatives. Of this, £1.1million was registered in the week after the event. Table sales raised at least £250,000, with cheaper tickets going for £400. The guest list for the private event last summer at Old Billingsgate Market in Central London included six billionaires and 15 people with a personal wealth above £100million. Documents seen by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism showed there were 73 financiers, 47 retail and property tycoons, ten people in oil, gas and mining and 19 attendees working in public affairs and PR. One guest was Vladimir Putin’s judo partner Vasily Shestakov, who was introduced to the Prime Minister. The Russian president’s aide had the job of improving Russia’s reputation in the UK. The revelation will give further ammunition to Labour, which wants to paint the Conservatives as the party of the rich. The Tory fundraising dinner is an annual event and this year’s will be held next Wednesday at the Hurlingham private members’ club in West London. The main sponsor was Shore Capital, an investment bank led by Howard Shore, who has donated £450,000 to the Conservatives personally and through his companies. The documents revealed that almost 450 attendees at last summer's even at Old Billingsgate Fish Market had a combined wealth of more than £11billion. They sat at tables costing up to £12,000 each alongside David Cameron, Home Secretary Theresa May, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and London Mayor Boris Johnson. He booked three ‘premier tables’ and on one hosted David and Samantha Cameron. The table also included investor Nicolas Berggruen, Slovenian tycoon Darko Horvat and property magnate Sir John Ritblat. Mr Shore’s company told The Guardian: ‘Shore Capital supported the event and made a financial contribution, as they believe that the Conservative Party, led by the Prime Minister, are the best party to govern the country.’ Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said: ‘These events are not transparent at all. ‘They are made to be private, cosy affairs where you pay for attention from a senior political figure and if you are seeking to influence the government you might have the opportunity to do so. ‘We are vulnerable as a country to people getting private access to ministers for not too much money.’ A Tory spokesman said: ‘All donations to the Conservative Party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and  comply fully with Electoral Commission rules.’ Mr Johnson shared a table with Andrei Borodin, an exiled Russian banker who is wanted by the Kremlin to face charges of ‘aggravated swindling’ over an alleged £220million bank fraud. Mrs May was placed with Lord De La Warr, director of Cluff Natural Resources which is exploring a process called coal gasification in Warwickshire. Mr Hammond shared a table with the Saudi Arabian head of the Arab British Chamber of Commerce, Afnan Al-Shuaiby, and the table was paid for by Lord Clanwilliam, a PR adviser who works for the government of Bahrain, which has faced criticism of its human rights record. Paul Staines, who runs the Guido Fawkes website, was sat at a table with Sir Michael Hintze, a top Tory donor and manager of hedge fund CQS. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles shared a table with nightclub owner Peter Stringfellow. Sir Michael has donated £3,181,473 to the Tories, while Mr Shore has given £499,330 and Mr Stringfellow  £39,340. Jon Ashworth, Labour’s spokesman for the Cabinet Office, said: ‘These reports further lift the lid on a Party which is bankrolled by and stands up for a privileged few. ‘The Tories did all they could to keep this list secret and now we know why. It shows a party reliant on a select group of super-rich donors – the same group who’ve been given a tax cut by David Cameron’s Government while everyone else pays more.’","output":"A report has revealed that prominent billionaires, bankers, and lobbyists were granted access to former Prime Minister David Cameron and other senior Cabinet members at a £12,000-a-table Tory fundraising dinner in the summer of 2013.

Former ‘Bachelorette’ villain: My reputation gets me laid JJ Lane didn’t win Kaitlyn Bristowe’s heart on “The Bachelorette,” but he’s scored a lot more behind closed doors. “You know what’s insane, I get laid off perception,” the reality star told the Post at Flock U’s Biggest Group Date Ever event on Valentine’s Day. “People think what they see on TV [is what you’re really like].” Since appearing on ABC’s long-running series, Lane has gotten lucky with the ladies compared to his Super Bowl-winning posse, including Owen Daniels and Brandon McManus of the Denver Broncos. “I’ll go out with my buddies who are successful,” Lane said, “Knowshon Moreno is one, Owen Daniels, Brandon McManus, Super Bowl champions, and people like, ‘JJ! Oh my gosh, can I take a picture?’ Like, sure, you can take a picture, but this guy won the Super Bowl.” While he doesn’t rule out another stint on “Bachelor in Paradise” should a certain single mom smitten with Ben Higgins join the cast (“I want to know that girl,” he said. “I would go only for one reason. I would walk the f–k away if Amanda wasn’t there.”), Lane shared that it’s getting difficult to find Mrs. Right (now). “Once you go on a TV show, it’s so hard to fall in love because nobody is genuine and it’s very hard to trust anyone,” he explained. Other than that “Bachelor in Paradise” possibility, he said of reality TV, “I’m done, I’m retired.” As for Lane’s pal Higgins, the father of one is convinced that the current “Bachelor” will find his wife in front of the cameras, calling him “the best ‘Bachelor’ ever.” “Ben is the only ‘Bachelor’ in my opinion that I feel is truly trying to find a wife. And he trusts the process,” Lane said. “If you’re in that process, and you’re exposed to those girls over a certain period of time, you’re going to fall in love 100 percent.” After narrowing down a pool of 25 ladies to the final four, it’s only a matter of time before the future Mrs. Higgins is revealed.

Available options: (a). they are born light-skinned people (b). light-skinned Europeans have mutation in the gene for melanin production (c). they have fewer activities outside (d). they pay much attention to protecting their skin Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Can people change their skin color1 without suffering like pop king Michael Jackson? Perhaps yes. Scientists have found the gene that determines skin color1.     The gene comes in two versions, one of which is found in 99 percent of Europeans. The other is found in 93 to 100 percent of Africans, researchers at Pennsylvania State University report in the latest issue of science.     Scientists have changed the color1 of a dark-striped zebrafish to uniform gold by inserting a version of the pigment gene into a young fish. As with humans, zebrafish skin color1 is determined by pigment cells, which contain melanin  . The number, size and darkness of melanin per pigment cell determine skin color1.     It appears that, like the golden zebrafish, light-skinned Europeans also have a mutation   in the gene for melanin production. This results in less pigmented skin. However, Keith Cheng, leader of the research team, points out that the mutation is different in human and zebrafish genes.     Humans acquired dark skin in Africa about 1.5 million years ago to protect bodies from ultra-violet rays of the sun , which can cause skin cancer. But when modern humans leave Africa to live in northern latitudes, they need more sunlight on their skin to produce vitamin D. So the related gene changes, according to Cheng.     \\"Asians have the same version of the gene as Africans, so they probably acquired their light skin through the action of some other gene that affects skin color1,\\" said Cheng.     The new discovery could lead to medical treatments for skin cancer. It also could lead to research into ways to change skin color1 without damaging it like chemical treatment did on Michael Jackson. ks5u Question: The reason why Europeans are light-skinned is probably that   _ Answer: A:","output":"The reason why Europeans are light-skinned is probably that light-skinned Europeans have a mutation in the gene for melanin production (option b). This mutation results in less pigmented skin, which was advantageous for humans who migrated from Africa to northern latitudes, where more sunlight exposure was required for the production of vitamin D. This adaptation allowed for better health outcomes in regions with less intense sunlight. While the specific mutation may differ between humans and zebrafish, the researchers' findings suggest that the genetic mechanism underlying skin color variation is quite similar across species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Daniel Constantine Marino Jr. (born September 15, 1961) is a former American football quarterback who played seventeen seasons for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL). The last quarterback of the quarterback class of 1983 to be taken in the first round, Marino held or currently holds dozens of NFL records associated with the quarterback position. Despite never being on a Super Bowl-winning team, he is recognized as one of the greatest quarterbacks in American football history. Best remembered for his quick release and powerful arm, Marino helped the Dolphins become consistent postseason contenders, leading them to the playoffs ten times and one Super Bowl appearance in XIX, although a title victory ultimately eluded him during his career. On Sunday, September 17, 2000, at halftime of the Dolphins-Baltimore Ravens game at Pro Player Stadium, Dan Marino's jersey number of 13 was retired. The only other Dolphins jersey number retired at the time was Bob Griese's #12. Since then #39, Larry Csonka, has been retired as well. Marino joined the Dolphins Honor Roll the same day. In a year of accolades from the franchise he led for many years, the Dolphins also installed a life-size bronze statue of Marino at Pro Player Stadium (now Hard Rock Stadium) and renamed Stadium Street to Dan Marino Boulevard.  In 2003, Marino was honored for his outstanding NCAA career at Pitt with an induction into the College Football Hall of Fame. In early 2004, Marino briefly returned to the Miami Dolphins as Senior Vice President of Football Operations, but resigned from the newly created position only three weeks later, saying that the role was not in the best interest of either his family or the Dolphin organization. Marino was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005, one of only four Dolphins to be elected in their first year of eligibility (Jim Langer, Paul Warfield, Jason Taylor). He was inducted into the Hall of Fame on August 7, 2005 and was introduced by his oldest son, Daniel. During his induction speech, Dan threw \\"one last pass\\" to former teammate Mark Clayton, who was sitting in the audience.  Marino was an analyst for CBS's Sunday pregame show The NFL Today, from 2002-2013. On February 18, 2014 it was announced that he was leaving the show.

On Thursday, June 8, 2017, the FDA said it has asked Endo Pharmaceuticals to stop selling its reformulated, extended-release painkiller, Opana ER. (Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP)      For the first time, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is asking that a pharmaceutical company withdraw a currently marketed opioid pain medication because of the drug’s potential for abuse.      The FDA is asking Ireland-based Endo Pharmaceuticals to stop selling reformulated Opana ER, or oxymorphone hydrochloride, because the risks outweigh any benefits of pain control, the FDA said in a statement Thursday. Endo has global headquarters in Dublin but a U.S. base in Malvern, Pa.      The request comes as the United States finds itself in the middle of what the federal Department of Health and Human Services describes as an “unprecedented opioid epidemic.” More people died in 2014, the most recent year for which data is available, from drug overdoses than any other year on record and more than 60% of those deaths involved an opioid, the federal government says.      As word of the FDA request circulated, shares of Endo International dipped almost 13% to 11.99 on Thursday.      The FDA said in its statement that if Endo does not meet its request, it will take steps to withdraw approval of the drug, prescribed when someone needs a long-term pain medication. Endo reformulated Opana ER in a way that the company said would curb the potential for abuse, but an FDA advisory committee voted 18-8 (with one abstention) in mid-March that the benefits of the reformulated version no longer outweigh risks of the drug.      “The abuse and manipulation of reformulated Opana ER by injection has resulted in a serious disease outbreak,” Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. “This action will protect the public from further potential for misuse and abuse of this product.”      FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement: “We are facing an opioid epidemic – a public health crisis – and we must take all necessary steps to reduce the scope of opioid misuse and abuse.”      Emily Walden of Kentucky lost her 21-year-old son to an Opana overdose in 2012 and traveled to Maryland to give an emotional testimony at the FDA hearing in March.      “I had a gut feeling it was going to be a big deal,” Walden said of the meeting.      At that time, her ultimate goal was for the FDA to request Opana’s removal from the market, but her expectations were low.      “I really did not think that the FDA would follow through,” Walden said Thursday. Now she hopes the FDA will continue to evaluate other opioids and clinical trials.      She said she had huge concerns about Gottlieb after his appointment, considering his ties to the pharmaceutical industry, but she’s taking this as a sign of good things to come.      Walden said she has requested meetings with Gottlieb as well as Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, but hasn’t had any luck yet.      “I hope that the commissioner will meet with people like me — parents who have been affected — and get a full picture, not just the pharmaceutical side,” she said.      Endo said in a statement released Thursday that it is evaluating the FDA request, but also pointed out that during the mid-March meeting, more than half of the advisory committee members said they preferred that Opana ER stay on the market but with added restrictions to prevent abuse.

The company also said that when taken as prescribed, the drug “has a favorable risk-benefit profile.”      The FDA first approved Opana ER in 2006. In 2012, Endo released a newly formulated version intended to make the drug resistant to abuse by snorting or injecting. The FDA, however, found that “data did not show that the reformulation could be expected to meaningfully reduce abuse.\\"      Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2sZuaGn ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The FDA said Thursday that Opana ER, an extended release form of the opioid drug oxymorphone made by the drug company Endo, was being crushed up and injected by people seeking to abuse it.

This is the first time the agency has taken steps to remove a currently marketed opioid pain medication from sale due to the public health consequences of abuse.”      The company is pushing back, saying the drug is safe and effective. It's not a gentle request. The FDA says if Endo doesn’t voluntarily pull the drug from the market, it will withdraw approval.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says opioid overdoses have hit record highs, killing more than 40,000 people in 2015 — more than the 32,000 who died in road accidents.

The FDA said that reformulation made things worse.      “The FDA’s decision is based on a review of all available postmarketing data, which demonstrated a significant shift in the route of abuse of Opana ER from nasal to injection following the product’s reformulation,” it said.      “Injection abuse of reformulated Opana ER has been associated with a serious outbreak of HIV and hepatitis C,” it added.

(AP) — U.S. regulators want a narcotic painkiller involved in the opioid epidemic off the market amid data showing people continue to abuse it.      The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday it has asked Endo Pharmaceuticals to stop selling its reformulated, extended-release painkiller, Opana ER, after concluding the drugs's risks outweigh its benefits.      It's the first time the FDA has asked a drugmaker to remove an opioid painkiller from the market. The agency said it has seen a \\"significant shift\\" from people crushing and snorting Opana ER to get high to injecting it.      Endo said in a statement it's \\"reviewing the request and is evaluating the full range of potential options.\\"      Wall Street responded quickly with a sell-off, and Endo shares plunged 13.4 percent to 11.93 in trading after U.S. markets closed.      The FDA move comes after advisers, reviewing the safety of Opana ER at a March hearing, voted 18-8 against keeping it on the market.      Besides contributing to overdoses, abuse of Opana ER was blamed for a 2015 outbreak of HIV and hepatitis C in southern Indiana linked to sharing needles, according to the FDA.      \\"We are facing an opioid epidemic - a public health crisis, and we must take all necessary steps to reduce the scope of opioid misuse and abuse,\\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement. \\"We will continue to take regulatory steps when we see situations where an opioid product's risks outweigh its benefits.\\"      About 2 million Americans are addicted to prescription opioids, and 91 die every day from overdosing on a painkiller or much-cheaper heroin.      Endo first got U.S. approval for its extended-release opioid, Opana ER, in 2006. It reformulated that drug in 2012 and claimed the changes made it harder to manipulate physically or chemically to abuse it. Endo tried to persuade FDA officials that the new formulation was abuse-resistant, which likely would have given the product a marketing advantage in the crowded, lucrative category of opioid painkillers.      The FDA didn't agree, refusing to let Endo market the new formulation as abuse deterrent when it granted approval for sales several years ago.      If Endo doesn't comply with the FDA's request to stop selling Opana ER, the agency can hold a hearing and start a formal process for rescinding its approval.      According to the FDA, there are no generic versions of the reformulated Opana ER on the market. However, generic versions of both the original Opana ER and the original immediate-release version, called oxymorphone ER, are on sale.      Those generic products might also face action by the FDA, which said it is \\"assessing the latest available data on abuse patterns.\\"      Endo Pharmaceuticals makes generic pills and specialty drugs, which generally are expensive medicines for complex disorders. It's part of Endo International plc, which is based in Dublin, Ireland, and has U.S. headquarters in the Philadelphia suburb of Malvern.

Given the following passage  \\"Traditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death. In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has drastically narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.\\",  answer the following question.

Sarah asked Katrina to help them learn to play the guitar because","output":"Sarah had always admired Katrina's exceptional skill with the instrument. For years, Sarah had watched her friend effortlessly play the most complex tunes and compose her own melodies on the guitar. This deep appreciation for Katrina's talent had inspired Sarah to take up the instrument herself, and she couldn't think of anyone better to help her learn than her close friend. Katrina, being a kind and supportive friend, readily agreed to assist Sarah in her musical journey. They decided to meet three times a week for instruction and practice sessions. Before commencing the lessons, they came up with a course outline that would suit Sarah's learning pace, breaking down the skills required into manageable chunks. The first few lessons were centered around understanding the basic principles of guitar playing. Initially, Sarah was taught about the various parts of the guitar, such as the strings, the frets, the fretboard, the soundhole, and the bridge. Developing a thorough understanding of these elements in the beginning would provide a foundation for Sarah's future growth as a guitar player. Katrina also emphasized the importance of proper posture and holding the guitar correctly while playing. This was an essential aspect that many beginners overlooked, leading to bad habits and difficulty in making progress down the line. Sarah learned and practiced the correct way of sitting with the guitar and positioning her hands for both strumming and picking. Next, they focused on learning and practicing various chords, starting with the open chords like A, Am, E, Em, D, Dm, G, C, and F. Katrina explained the musical theory behind the chords to give Sarah a comprehensive understanding. In each practice session, Sarah would strum and switch between chords, gradually building up muscle memory and finger strength. To make the practice sessions more enjoyable, Katrina introduced Sarah to popular songs with simple chord progressions that they could play together. Another important aspect of guitar playing Katrina emphasized was rhythm and timing. Sarah was taught to use a metronome to ensure that her strumming patterns and tempo were accurate. They experimented with different time signatures, rhythms, and strumming techniques to sharpen Sarah's tempo awareness and versatility in playing various styles. As weeks turned into months, Katrina gradually introduced more advanced concepts, such as fingerstyle guitar, scales, barre chords, and improvisation. Sarah was also taught various techniques like hammer-ons, pull-offs, and slides, which are essential for playing lead guitar. To expand her musical knowledge, Sarah started learning music theory, focusing on the circle of fifths and chord progressions, which allowed her to comprehend the structure of more complicated songs. Throughout the whole process, Katrina consistently provided Sarah with constructive feedback, encouragement, and the support needed to overcome challenges and setbacks. Learning to play the guitar can be a frustrating and slow process, but due to Katrina's empathetic and patient guidance, Sarah felt motivated to continue striving toward her musical goals. Over time, Sarah's hard work and dedication, combined with Katrina's expertise and mentorship, led to significant improvements in her guitar skills. From a beginner who knew nothing about guitar playing, Sarah blossomed into an intermediate guitarist capable of playing songs she once thought were impossible. The bond between the two friends grew even stronger as a result of this shared passion. With a newfound love for her instrument and growing confidence in her skills, Sarah began to envision herself not just as someone who could play other people's songs but as a musician who could create her own melodies and compositions. Under Katrina's guidance, she started exploring songwriting and music production. As Sarah's musical journey continued, their friendship thrived, and both women found joy in learning and growing together, creating a bond that transcended music itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the two facts above, what is an example of a tetrapod vertebrate that produces amniotic eggs.? Answer:","output":"An example of a tetrapod vertebrate that produces amniotic eggs, given the facts provided, is the Green Iguana (Iguana iguana). This species belongs to the reptile class, which comprises tetrapod vertebrates that lay amniotic eggs. As a lizard, the Green Iguana exemplifies how these characteristics apply to this specific group of reptiles. The Green Iguana is a large, arboreal lizard native to Central and South America. It can grow up to 2 meters (6.5 feet) in length, including its tail, and has a distinctively vibrant green coloration. Adapted to life in the rainforest, Green Iguanas have strong limbs for climbing trees and a prehensile tail to help with balance and navigation. Green Iguanas reproduce via oviparity, which means they lay eggs rather than give birth to live young. The eggs that they lay are amniotic in nature, providing a protective and nurturing environment for the developing embryo. The amniotic membrane not only retains vital fluids, but also facilitates gas exchange, allowing the embryo to receive oxygen and expel waste products, like carbon dioxide. In general, amniotic eggs provide a vital advantage to terrestrial animals, as they reduce dependency on water bodies for reproductive purposes. Additionally, as a prerequisite to being classified as a tetrapod vertebrate, the Green Iguana has a backbone and four limbs. This structural feature allows the animal to bear its weight and move in different environments, like trees and rocks, increasing its ability to find suitable habitats, forage for food, and escape predators. In conclusion, the Green Iguana is an excellent example of a tetrapod vertebrate that produces amniotic eggs, showcasing the defining characteristics of reptiles in general and lizards in particular. Its unique adaptations for arboreal life, coupled with its reproductive strategies, reflect how these traits have played a crucial role in the successful evolution and diversification of reptiles as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Japan's navy has dispatched its largest destroyer reportedly tasked with escorting U.S. military ships... (Associated Press)      SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A contentious U.S. anti-missile system in southeastern South Korea is now operating and can now defend against North Korean missiles, a South Korean official said Tuesday.      The Terminal High Altitude Defense system set up at a converted golf course in Seongju has \\"early capability\\" to respond to North Korea's nuclear and missile threat, Defense Ministry spokesman Moon Sang Gyun said. He didn't say when Washington and Seoul expected THAAD to be operating fully.      The deployment has triggered anger from Seongju residents who fear North Korea may target their town and who worry about rumored health hazards linked to THAAD's powerful radar.      People also debate whether the security benefits of THAAD would outweigh drawbacks if relations worsen with China, which sees the system as a threat, and they have been angered by President Donald Trump's statement that he would make South Korea pay 1 billion for the system.      The United States and South Korea say THAAD is crucial to counter North Korea's weapons advances. The North conducted two nuclear tests last year alone, which experts say would have improved its knowledge for making nuclear warheads small enough to fit on missiles, and has been speeding up its development of new missiles, including solid-fuel rockets that can be fired from mobile launchers on land and from submarines.      President Donald Trump says he isn't ruling out military action against North Korea but has also expressed openness to a future meeting with North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un, offering unusual praise for the third-generation dictator amid the nuclear tensions.      \\"If it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, I would absolutely, I would be honored to do it,\\" Trump told Bloomberg News. In an interview with CBS' \\"Face the Nation\\" that aired Sunday, Trump said Kim was obviously a \\"pretty smart cookie\\" as he took power in his 20s and held it despite \\"a lot of people\\" trying to take it away.      The THAAD battery had originally been scheduled to enter operation by the end of the year. When completed, it will consist of six truck-mounted launchers that can fire up to 48 interceptors toward incoming missiles detected by the system's x-band radar.      Critics question whether the United States and Seoul's caretaker government are rushing to set up THAAD before an election May 9 that will bring a change in the government in Seoul, which became necessary after Park Geun-hye was impeached and ousted from the presidency in a corruption scandal.      Front-runner Moon Jae-in, a liberal who calls for engagement with North Korea, has said he would reconsider THAAD if he becomes president.      North Korea conducted another missile test on Saturday, its third launch in April alone, which reportedly failed soon after launch, and its Foreign Ministry said Monday the country will speed up measures to bolster its nuclear program \\"at the maximum pace.\\"      A statement circulated by North Korea's U.N. Mission says the government is ready to respond to any option taken by the United States. ||||| THAAD missile defense system now operational in S.Korea      Washington (AFP) - A controversial missile defense system whose deployment has angered China is now operational in South Korea, a US defense official said Monday.      Washington and Seoul agreed to the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery deployment in July in the wake of a string of North Korean missile tests.      \\"It has reached initial intercept capability,\\" the official told AFP on condition of anonymity.      This initial capability will be augmented later this year as additional hardware and components arrive to complete the system, officials said.      THAAD's deployment in South Korea has infuriated China, which fears it will weaken its own ballistic missile capabilities and says it upsets the regional security balance.      The THAAD system, which is being installed on a former golf course in the southern county of Seongju, is designed to intercept and destroy short- and medium-range ballistic missiles during their final phase of flight.      Beijing has imposed a host of measures seen as economic retaliation against the South for the THAAD deployment, including a ban on tour groups.      Retail conglomerate Lotte, which previously owned the golf course, has also been targeted, with 85 of its 99 stores in China shut down, while South Korea's biggest automaker Hyundai Motor has said its Chinese sales have fallen sharply.      The THAAD deployment comes as tension soars on the Korean peninsula following a series of missile launches by the North and warnings from the administration of US President Donald Trump that military action is an \\"option on the table.\\"      - Who should pay -      Further complicating matters, Trump stunned Seoul last week when he suggested South Korea should pay for the 1 billion THAAD system.      \\"I informed South Korea it would be appropriate if they paid. It's a billion-dollar system,\\" Trump was quoted as saying in a published report.      \\"It's phenomenal, shoots missiles right out of the sky.\\"      Seoul retorted that under the Status of Forces Agreement that governs the US military presence in the country, the South would provide the THAAD site and infrastructure while the US would pay to deploy and operate it.      Thomas Karako, the director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted that South Korea's sole THAAD battery does not quite have the range to cover the entire country.      But he called it an important first step.      \\"This is not about a having a perfect shield, this is about buying time and thereby contributing to the overall credibility of deterrence,\\" Karako told AFP.      \\"South Korea with THAAD helps communicate to the North that today is not a good day to attack. It doesn't mean that they could not do a lot of damage -- they would -- but it strengthens the overall posture.\\"      In a surprise development, Trump on Monday said he would not rule out meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, under the right conditions.      \\"If it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, I would, absolutely. I would be honored to do it,\\" Trump told Bloomberg News. ||||| Summary:","output":"The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system in southeast South Korea is now operational and able to defend against North Korean missiles, according to South Korea's defence ministry spokesman Moon Sang Gyun.

LABOR HISTORY SLIGHTED, EXPERTS SAY As the nation marked Labor Day and the labor movement observed what it calls the centennial of American labor, experts were saying that American labor history has been highly neglected in schools, that labor's historic sites are often not marked or maintained and that labor history has often been accorded second-class status. Labor history has, for the most part, not been taught as a part of American history, said Herbert G. Gutman, professor of American history at City University of New York. Rather, he said, the focus has been on the nation's founding fathers, presidents, diplomats, politics and wars. Philip S. Foner, another labor historian, said labor history, when it did receive attention, was generally placed ''in terms of strikes and violence.'' American educators have essentially attempted to see working-class people ''as organizing to protect themselves and then entering the mainstream of civilization and that is the end of it,'' Mr. Gutman explained. 'No Sense of Labor History' ''There is no sense of labor history,'' said Studs Terkel, for many years an observer of the labor movement and working-class people. And this partly explains, he suggested, why the labor movement is in such trouble today. ''Working people themselves have no understanding of their past,'' he said, ''no idea where the minimum wage or the eight-hour day came from. There is no past.'' Some developments in recent years are praised by labor experts, however. A series of highly praised movies have explored essentially unknown or long forgotten events or movements. ''Northern Lights'' was a portrayal of the agrarian protest movement of the upper Middle West in the 1920's. ''With Babies and Banners'' was a study of wives and children of autoworkers who conducted the Flint, Mich., sit-down strike of 1936-37. ''The Wobblies'' was a remembrance of the Industrial Workers of the World. ''Harlan County, U.S.A.'' was a study of striking coal miners in Kentucky. State Organizations Emerging In addition, several state organizations have sprung up that are patterned after the Illinois Labor History Society. That group has published histories of such events as the Haymarket incident in 1896 in Chicago, in which a bomb killed seven police officers and four workers. The group also has published information on key sites of the 1894 Pullman strike, when the American Railway Union struck, unsuccessfully, after the company cut wages. A group active in a similar vein is District 1199 of the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees in New York. Under its ''Bread and Roses'' project, the group has produced plays and musicals for hospital workers and a study of the 1912 textile workers' strike in Lawrence, Mass. Finally, the history of the labor movement seems, in the last 10 years or so, to have gained more acceptance from universities, the labor movement and historians themselves, according to David Brody, professor of American history at the University of California at Davis. Second-Class Area of Stu dy Yet, even with these trends, the study of labor history often remains a second-class area of scholarship and understanding, the experts said. In the late 19th century, when history emerged as a profession, historians often constituted a ''gentleman's club,'' and there was little, if any, interest in working-class movements, Mr. Gutman said. ''We study the history of successful things,'' he said, adding that workers and their movements often were treated with a ''condescension of silence.'' Mr. Foner argued that the Haymarket incident and similar events ''were portrayed as sheer disasters for working people and America.'' Instead, he suggested, such events, while unsuccessful at the time, were the base on which the American union movement was built. No Monuments for Victims Mr. Foner said historic sites were neglected because the battles were often perceived as losses by labor, and ''monuments are not erected to victims.'' The A.F.L.-C.I.0 also believes that labor history is often neglected by historians and educators. A 1966 study by the federation of textbooks in use in Los Angeles County said that not ''a single labor topic,'' except the disputes between industrial and craft unions, ''was adequately described'' in the majority of the textbooks. In 1979, in a study published in the Harvard Educational Review, Jean Anyon, professor of education at Rutgers University, said American history books suggested that all workers had achieved middle-class status and that strikes generally were fruitless. Mr. Gutman and Mr. Foner said the A.F.L-C.I.O. itself was incorrect in describing this year's celebration, marking the founding in 1881 of the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions, as the centennial of not only the merged federation but of the American labor movement as well. ''The A.F.L. always took the position that there was nothing before it and that it represented the labor movement,'' Mr. Foner said. History Needed Mr. Brody suggested that a reason why labor seemed more open to study was that it was trying to provide a legitimacy for the labor movement, in the face of declining union memberships and a conservative government in Washington. ''It needs this history of itself,'' he said. Mr. Gutman said it was important for historians to present studies of workers and their movements, not merely descriptions of institutions. He said such labor figures as Samuel Gompers, Eugene V. Debs, William D. Haywood and Terence V. Powderly subscribed to the view that the conditions of the moment were not necessarily permanent. This view, he said, has largely been ''washed out'' of the labor movement, and unless it returns, labor will have trouble maintaining its role in American life. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"This text talks about how labor history has been neglected in American schools and not given enough importance. This has led to many people not knowing about the struggles and achievements of the working class. Some experts believe this is one reason why the labor movement is facing troubles today. There have been some attempts to bring attention to labor history through movies and state organizations, but it still remains a second-class area of study. Experts argue that events and movements from labor history should be seen as an important part of American history, rather than just focusing on successful things or violent strikes. They say it is important to teach about the history of workers and their movements to help the labor movement maintain its role in American life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Worst Vegas stay!!! Where do I even begin with the crappiest hotel experience?  We stayed here over Columbus Day weekend for a friend's 30th Bday celebration. We got a king suite with an adjoining two queen room in the Paradise Tower.   Strike 1: They advertised a pullout couch and there was NO pullout couch. We called for a rollaway which they wanted to charge 20 a night. Excuse me? False advertising and I have to pay for it?! Called three times until finally got the rollaway in the room delivered.   Strike 2: Asked for Nonsmoking room but the room reeked of smoke which did numbers on my allergies. I know I'm in Vegas, but I don't have to breath that crap while I sleep.  Strike 3: the shower did not drain and water pooled up to my ankles. Called maintenance to repair and yet again they didn't show. Left for Pool/Brunch 4 hrs later returned with it still clogged. Called second time and finally they fixed it after waiting around 30 min before we could get ready for dinner.   Strike 4: There is no room in the fridge for your own refreshments and a fridge is again 20 a day.  Seriously for a suite what good is an in room bar without a fridge? For the price of the room it should be available. Guess they don't want you not buying THEIR drinks.  Strike 5: As a hotel guest we should get free admission to the day pool parties at least on a guest list. Nope still have to pay- seriously? Marquee Day Club offers this to their hotel guests why can't Hard Rock?  Strike 6: the TV cable was so horrible and kept cutting out couldn't play any music stations from that and there was no Auxillary input to plug in our own music thru the TV speakers.   When we complained to the reception they only comped us one resort fee wow a whopping 22.50.    I have stayed multiple times at the Hard Rock San Diego which is newer and has better rooms.

A:","output":"To determine if Stephen Spender and Mary Stewart wrote about the same themes, I will first research and identify common themes found in their works.  Step 1: Research about Stephen Spender and his work Stephen Spender was a British poet, essayist, and critic. He was born in 1909 and passed away in 1995. Some of the notable works of Stephen Spender include his poetry collections \\"Twenty Poems\\" (1930) and \\"The Orators\\" (1932). His writing mainly tackled topics such as war, social inequality, and freedom of expression. His works also expressed leftist political ideals. Step 2: Research about Mary Stewart and her work Mary Stewart was a British novelist, born in 1916 and passed away in 2014. Her works mainly belong to the genres of romantic suspense and historical fiction. Some of the notable works of Mary Stewart include \\"The Crystal Cave\\" (1970), \\"The Hollow Hills\\" (1973), and \\"The Wicked Day\\" (1983). Her writing often integrated elements of mystery, adventure, and romance. Step 3: Compare the themes in their works Comparing the themes in the works of Stephen Spender and Mary Stewart, it becomes evident that their focus was quite different. While Spender's work primarily dealt with social, political, and philosophical themes, Stewart's work was more focused on crafting suspenseful stories with romance and adventure. Conclusion: Based on the information I gathered, Stephen Spender and Mary Stewart did not write about the same themes. Spender's themes were mainly centered around war, social inequality, and freedom of expression, while Stewart's themes focused on aspects of romantic suspense and historical fiction, often weaving tales of mystery and adventure. Their works cater to different genres and literary styles, and therefore, they address different thematic concerns."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The maid wanted to use the mop to clean the floor but the  Select from the following. -- mop was too small.. -- floor was too small.. Answer:","output":"The maid wanted to use the mop to clean the floor, but the mop was too small, which made it incredibly difficult for her to efficiently cover the expansive area in the room, requiring her to expend a large amount of time and energy in order to make the floor spotless and free from any dirt, grime, or dust that may have accumulated on the surface over time. Despite her best efforts, the maid soon realized that continuing to use this undersized mop would inadvertently slow down her progress, and potentially result in a subpar cleaning job that would not meet the high standards set by her employer. In order to rectify this unforeseen issue, the maid considered a variety of potential solutions that she could utilize to properly clean the floor in a timely manner. First, she contemplated the possibility of acquiring a larger mop that could cover a broader area of the floor with each swipe, thereby speeding up the cleaning process and allowing her to meet the expectations of her employer. Alternatively, she could assess other cleaning tools and methods at her disposal, such as a vacuum cleaner or a broom, which may prove to be more effective in addressing the unique challenges presented by the room's size. Upon weighing the pros and cons of each option, the maid came to the conclusion that she would need to acquire a larger mop in order to fulfill her duties effectively and satisfy her employer's stringent cleanliness requirements. With this decision in mind, she promptly headed to the nearest supply store, where she carefully perused the available selection of mops, searching for one that would be more appropriately suited for the task at hand. Upon finding a larger, more durable mop with a wider head and highly absorbent material, the maid purchased the item and returned to the room in need of cleaning. Armed with her new, upgraded mop, she was able to tackle the task with renewed vigor and efficiency, making quick work of the previously daunting floor space and leaving it immaculate, much to the delight and satisfaction of her employer. In the end, the maid's resourcefulness and adaptability enabled her to overcome the challenges posed by her initial cleaning tool, demonstrating her dedication to her work and her commitment to always providing the highest level of service to those who relied on her expertise and skill. With her newfound knowledge and upgraded cleaning equipment, the maid was now poised to tackle any cleaning job that came her way, no matter how large or seemingly insurmountable it may be."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The sentence \\"Nastavte globální oprávnění uživatele\\" translates to \\"Set global user permissions\\" in English.  In the context of a computer system or software, setting global user permissions refers to configuring the access rights and privileges granted to individual users across the entire system. This determines what actions users are allowed to perform, such as reading, writing, or modifying files and data. A detailed process for setting global user permissions depends on the particular operating system or software being used. Below, I will provide a general overview of the steps involved in setting global user permissions: 1. Identify user roles: Establish different roles for users, representing their responsibilities and activities within the system. Common roles may include administrators, managers, and basic users. 2. Define access levels: Set up specific access levels, such as read, write, and modify, that can be applied to different resources within the system, such as files, directories, and databases. 3. Assign access levels to user roles: Tie the access levels to the user roles, so each role will have a specific set of privileges depending on its responsibilities. 4. Create user accounts: Set up user accounts for each individual who will access the system, and assign each user a role (or roles) to define their permissions. 5. Implement access controls: Ensure that the system properly enforces access controls, protecting sensitive data and functionality from unauthorized access. This may involve configuring firewalls, access control lists, and other security measures. 6. Monitor and audit: Regularly review and update user accounts, user roles, and access levels to ensure that permissions remain appropriate and secure. Track user activities, review logs, and audit permissions to detect any security issues or violations. 7. Maintain documentation: Keep thorough and up-to-date documentation for all user accounts, user roles, access levels, and permissions assignments. This can help with troubleshooting and make it easier to make changes or updates to the system. By following these steps, you can establish a robust and secure set of global user permissions for a computer system or software application. Remember, though, that each operating system and software platform has its own methods and tools for setting permissions, so be sure to consult the appropriate documentation."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Q:Information:  - The Notting Hill Carnival is an annual event that has taken place since 1966 on the streets of Notting Hill, and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, London, England, each August over two days (the August bank holiday Monday and the preceding Sunday). It is led by members of the British West Indian community, and attracts around one million people annually, making it one of the world's largest street festivals, and a significant event in British culture. In 2006, the UK public voted it onto the list of icons of England. Despite its name, it is not part of the global Carnival season preceding Lent.  - The Elim Pentecostal Church is a UK-based Pentecostal Christian denomination.  - Portobello Road is a street in the Notting Hill district of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in west London. It runs almost the length of Notting Hill from south to north, roughly parallel with Ladbroke Grove. On Saturdays it is home to Portobello Road Market, one of London's notable street markets, known for its second-hand clothes and antiques. Every August since 1996, the Portobello Film Festival has been held in locations around Portobello Road.  - Kensington Temple is a large Pentecostal church in the Notting Hill area of London , England . It is pastored by Reverend Colin Dye , and is the largest church in its denomination , the Elim Pentecostal Church .  - A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity, identified by traits such as a name, organisation, leadership and doctrine. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church or sometimes fellowship. Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine; issues such as the nature of Jesus, the authority of apostolic succession, eschatology, and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations  often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties  are sometimes known as \\"branches of Christianity\\" or \\"denominational families\\".  - Notting Hill is an affluent district in West London, located north of Kensington within the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea as well as Westminster. Notting Hill is known for being a cosmopolitan neighbourhood, hosting the annual Notting Hill Carnival and Portobello Road Market.  - Carnival (see other spellings and names) is a Western Christian festive season that occurs before the liturgical season of Lent. The main events typically occur during February or early March, during the period historically known as Shrovetide (or Pre-Lent). Carnival typically involves a public celebration and/or parade combining some elements of a circus, masks, and a public street party. People wear masks and costumes during many such celebrations, allowing them to lose their everyday individuality and experience a heightened sense of social unity. Excessive consumption of alcohol, meat, and other foods proscribed during Lent is extremely common. Other common features of carnival include mock battles such as food fights; social satire and mockery of authorities; the grotesque body displaying exaggerated features, especially large noses, bellies, mouths, and phalli, or elements of animal bodies; abusive language and degrading acts; depictions of disease and gleeful death; and a general reversal of everyday rules and norms.

The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - The Synod of Whitby (664 A.D.) was a Northumbrian synod where King Oswiu of Northumbria ruled that his kingdom would calculate Easter and observe the monastic tonsure according to the customs of Rome, rather than the customs practised by Irish monks at Iona and its satellite institutions. The synod was summoned at Hilda's double monastery of Streonshalh (Streanæshalch), later called Whitby Abbey.  - Wilfrid (originally spelled Wilfrith; c. 633  c. 709) was an English bishop and saint. Born a Northumbrian noble, he entered religious life as a teenager and studied at Lindisfarne, at Canterbury, in Gaul, and at Rome; he returned to Northumbria in about 660, and became the abbot of a newly founded monastery at Ripon. In 664 Wilfrid acted as spokesman for the Roman position at the Synod of Whitby, and became famous for his speech advocating that the Roman method for calculating the date of Easter should be adopted. His success prompted the king's son, Alhfrith, to appoint him Bishop of Northumbria. Wilfrid chose to be consecrated in Gaul because of the lack of what he considered to be validly consecrated bishops in England at that time. During Wilfrid's absence Alhfrith seems to have led an unsuccessful revolt against his father, Oswiu, leaving a question mark over Wilfrid's appointment as bishop. Before Wilfrid's return Oswiu had appointed Ceadda in his place, resulting in Wilfrid's retirement to Ripon for a few years following his arrival back in Northumbria.  - Ripon is a cathedral city in the Borough of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is located at the confluence of two tributaries of the River Ure, the Laver and Skell. The city is noted for its main feature, Ripon Cathedral which is architecturally significant, as well as the Ripon Racecourse and other features such as its market. The city itself is just over 1,300 years old.  - Gaul (Latin: \\"Gallia\\") was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands, Central Italy and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC.  - The Holy Island of Lindisfarne is a tidal island off the northeast coast of England. It is also known just as Holy Island. It constitutes the civil parish of Holy Island in Northumberland. Holy Island has a recorded history from the 6th century AD. It was an important centre of Celtic Christianity under Saints Aidan of Lindisfarne, Cuthbert, Eadfrith of Lindisfarne and Eadberht of Lindisfarne. After the Viking invasions and the Norman conquest of England, a priory was reestablished. A small castle was built on the island in 1550.  - York is a historic walled city at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss in North Yorkshire, England. The municipality is the traditional county town of Yorkshire to which it gives its name. The city has a rich heritage and has provided the backdrop to major political events in England throughout much of its two millennia of existence. The city offers a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural and sporting activities making it a popular tourist destination for millions.

Trump is facing an early test with fellow Republicans over U.S.... (Associated Press)      NEW YORK (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump is facing an early test with fellow Republicans over U.S. relations with Russia, as lawmakers seek to investigate a CIA assessment that Russia interfered in the November election and issue warnings over the incoming president's potential pick for secretary of state.      Trump said Sunday the recent CIA assertion that Russian hacking had sought to help his candidacy was \\"ridiculous,\\" and he praised ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, who has emerged as the leading contender to lead the State Department.      But two key Senate Republicans — John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a leading Trump critic — joined with two Democrats in seeking a bipartisan investigation into the Kremlin's activities during the election. And McCain, the party's 2008 presidential nominee, questioned whether Trump should nominate Tillerson, citing the executive's longstanding business ties with Moscow.      \\"It's a matter of concern to me that he has such a close personal relationship with Vladimir Putin,\\" McCain said of Tillerson. \\"And obviously they've done enormous deals together.\\" In an interview with CBS' \\"Face the Nation,\\" McCain said, \\"That would color his approach to Vladimir Putin and the Russian threat.\\"      Russia expects to figure prominently at the start of a week in which Trump is expected to name more members of his Cabinet, which also has vacancies in the departments of Energy, Agriculture and Veterans Affairs. Trump is also planning a news conference on Thursday to outline how he intends to separate himself from his sprawling business enterprise.      During his campaign, Trump weathered turbulent relations with fellow Republicans but has since forged a more united front with GOP lawmakers since his November victory over Hillary Clinton.      The CIA recently concluded with \\"high confidence\\" that Russia sought to influence the U.S. election on behalf of Trump, raising red flags among lawmakers concerned about the sanctity of the U.S. voting system and potentially straining relations at the start of Trump's administration.      In a wide-ranging interview with \\"Fox News Sunday,\\" Trump dismissed those concerns as little more than partisan griping. \\"I think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country. And frankly, I think they're putting it out. And it's ridiculous,\\" Trump said.      The incoming president said he did not necessarily oppose calls from President Barack Obama for an inquiry into the 2016 campaign hacking but said it should not be solely focused on a single culprit.      \\"If you're gonna to do that, I think you should not just say 'Russia.' You should say other countries also, and maybe other individuals,\\" he said. The White House has said the probe would focus on any breaches by other countries along with hacking committed in previous elections.      Trump's decision-making on whom to select for secretary of state has stretched out over several weeks. He has been considering former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a one-time vocal Trump critic, Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, who leads the Foreign Relations Committee, and Tillerson, the oil industry executive who met twice with Trump during the past week.      In the television interview, Trump pointed to Tillerson's deep relations with Moscow as a selling point. As ExxonMobil's head, he maintained close ties with Russia and was awarded by Putin with the Order of Friendship in 2013, an honor for a foreign citizen.      \\"A great advantage is he knows many of the players, and he knows them well. He does massive deals in Russia. He does massive deals for the company,\\" Trump said, while also citing Corker and Romney.      \\"These are all very different types of people,\\" he said. \\"But when you ask me about Rex, I mean, he's a world-class player. There's no question about it.\\" By Sunday afternoon, Tillerson had still not been formally offered the job, according to a person with knowledge of the process who spoke on condition of anonymity.      Democrats have warned that plucking Tillerson for State would put the leader of the world's largest oil company in a pivotal role on issues like climate change and the future of the Keystone XL pipeline. They also question whether he would apply diplomatic pressure on Russia's conflict with Ukraine.      Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., said the developments \\"raise serious questions about whether the incoming administration will adequately stand up to Russia's aggression.\\"      The prospect of Tillerson also received a cool reception from some Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which would consider his nomination.      Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who unsuccessfully challenged Trump for the GOP nomination, wrote on Twitter, \\"Being a 'friend of Vladimir' is not an attribute I am hoping for from a (hashtag)SecretaryOfState.\\"      Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he would reserve judgment. The committee also includes Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., a Trump detractor during the campaign.      Russia's influence has also been seized upon by a small group of Democratic electors who call themselves the \\"Hamilton Electors\\" and are trying to persuade electors to back another Republican because they contend Trump is unfit to be president.      Trump won 306 electoral votes in the election, a comfortable margin to make him the next president when the electoral college meets Dec. 19. But the Hamilton Electors want the CIA and FBI to provide more details on Russia's influence before that date.      \\"We believe that we should do our job faithfully as electors and not just rubber stamp the election,\\" said Michael Baca, a Democratic elector from Colorado who co-founded the group.      ___      Associated Press writers Laurie Kellman in Washington and Alex Sanz in Atlanta contributed to this report. ||||| Legislators overseeing the CIA and other intelligence agencies have told the Guardian they will be vigilant about reprisals from Donald Trump over an internal assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to ensure Trump’s victory.            Donald Trump says CIA charge Russia influenced election is 'ridiculous' Read more      Fears of retaliation rose within US intelligence agencies over a tense weekend that saw Trump publicly dismiss not only the assessment but the basic competence of the intelligence apparatus.      “When the president-elect’s transition team is attempting to discredit the entire intelligence community [IC], it has never been more important for the IC and Congress to guard against possible political pressure or retaliation against intelligence analysts,” Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, told the Guardian.      Like his Democratic colleagues on the panel, Wyden is pressing Barack Obama for additional public disclosures revealing Russian electoral interference. Such pressure has placed the CIA and other intelligence agencies between the incoming president to whom they will soon answer and a chorus of legislators, mostly but not exclusively Democrats, who consider the Russia hack a national emergency.      It is not possible to gauge precisely how deep fears of retaliation run within the intelligence world. Two currently serving intelligence officers told the Guardian this weekend they had not heard their colleagues express such concerns.      One noted that civil-service laws prevented Trump from launching a purge, but also called attention to a report that Trump is combing through the energy department bureaucracy to identify people “who have attended climate change policy conferences”.      Former intelligence officers told the Guardian they considered retaliation by Trump to be all but a certainty after he is sworn into office next month. Trump still has several appointments to make at the highest levels of the intelligence apparatus, picks which are likely to be bellwethers for the new president’s attitudes toward the agencies.      There is not just smoke here. There is a 10-alarm fire, the sirens are wailing, the Russians provided the lighter fluid Glenn Carle, former CIA officer      “There is not just smoke here. There is a blazing 10-alarm fire, the sirens are wailing, the Russians provided the lighter fluid, and Trump is standing half-burnt and holding a match,” said Glenn Carle, a retired CIA officer and interrogator.      “The facts hurt, Trump won’t like the truth, and he will without question seek to destroy those individuals or organizations that say or do anything that he thinks harm his precious grandiosity.”      After congressional Democrats called for additional briefings and public disclosures about an intelligence consensus that Russia made a deliberate decision to intervene in the election, Barack Obama ordered a new review of the evidence.      On Friday, the Washington Post reported that intelligence sources believe the Russians decided to penetrate the Democratic National Committee’s digital networks with the goal of aiding Trump, not merely to spread uncertainty about the outcome of the election.      In response, Trump attacked the credibility of the intelligence agencies on which he will rely for early warning of security emergencies and geopolitical developments. His transition team said in a statement: “These are the same people who said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.”      Adam Schiff, the leading Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said Trump “cannot abide the idea that Russian hacking helped his campaign” and was lashing out in a manner that undermined confidence in his handling of intelligence.      “If Trump is willing to disregard sound intelligence now, and demean the hard-working and patriotic Americans who produced it, I fear what he will do as president when confronted with unpleasant truths,” Schiff said.      “Will he accept the best insights of our agencies, or punish them for daring to contradict his assumptions?”      Trump’s clash with the CIA comes at a moment of acute turmoil within intelligence circles. Obama officials jeopardized the tenure of National Security Agency chief Mike Rogers in a seemingly thwarted bureaucratic reorganization of the US surveillance and cybersecurity apparatus. Congressional sources have told the Guardian they expect to hold a public hearing on the issue in January.      Should Trump go through with the reshuffle, it will leave him appointing an NSA director as well as a director of national intelligence, after James Clapper announced his resignation last month. Trump has also been noncommittal about retaining the FBI director, James Comey, whose bureau houses significant sympathy for Trump.      Congressional Republicans are in an uncomfortable position, between a president of their own party and Russia, a traditional adversary.      Devin Nunes, a California Republican who chairs the House intelligence committee, said on Saturday Russian electoral hacking was “no surprise”. He also blamed Obama for coming late to the threat out of “delusions of ‘resetting’ relations with Russia” – a policy that Trump is also pursuing.      On Sunday, anti-Trump GOP hawks Lindsey Graham and John McCain offered a different path, joining with leading Democratic senators Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed to plead for a bipartisan inquiry into the alleged Russian hacking, which they said endangered the country.      “We have an obligation to inform the public about recent cyberattacks that have cut to the heart of our free society,” the senators said in a joint statement.      “Democrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks.”      Also on Sunday, Elijah Cummings, the Maryland Democrat on the investigations-heavy House oversight committee, pressured the Republican committee chairman, Jason Chaffetz, and speaker of the house Paul Ryan to “join us now in our effort to launch a robust and truly bipartisan investigation of Russian interference in our election that puts our nation’s interests over the interests of any political party”.      FBI covered up Russian influence on Trump's election win, Harry Reid claims Read more      Carle, the retired CIA officer, said Trump’s temperament had played into Russia’s hands and put the president-elect on a collision course with the CIA.      He said: “Look, in my professional assessment as an intelligence officer, Trump has a reflexive, defensive, monumentally narcissistic personality, for whom the facts and national interest are irrelevant, and the only thing that counts is whatever gives personal advantage and directs attention to himself.      “He is about the juiciest intelligence target an intelligence office could imagine. He groans with vulnerabilities. He will only work with individuals or entities that agree with him and build him up, and he is a shockingly easy intelligence ‘target’ to manipulate.”      Were Trump an intelligence officer himself, Carle said, “he would be removed and possibly charged with having accepted the clandestine support of a hostile power to the harm of the United States”.      A senior intelligence official who was not cleared to talk to reporters supported the push to declassify additional material on the “serious matter” of the alleged Russian electoral interference, since “it happened on our watch”. ||||| Correction: An earlier version of this column stated incorrectly that Donald Trump's electoral college victory was the seventh largest of the past 10 presidential elections. It ranked eighth of the past 10 elections. This version has been updated.      The president-elect has gone to Michigan, Iowa, North Carolina and Ohio, and saluted workers at an Indiana plant where he says he saved more than 1,000 jobs.      The president-elect has gone to Michigan, Iowa, North Carolina and Ohio, and saluted workers at an Indiana plant where he says he saved more than 1,000 jobs.      The CIA’s finding that Vladimir Putin’s Russia actively intervened in our election to help Donald Trump explains why many of us are not simply disappointed or unhappy that Trump won. We are genuinely alarmed. And Trump’s cavalier response to these fears only deepens them.      When The Post revealed the CIA’s conclusions about Russia, Trump’s response was to insult the CIA, tell a lie about the size of his victory and act as if an election still very fresh in our minds were some sort of historical event dating back to the Pilgrims.      The statement put out by Trump’s transition team, so obtuse and so arrogant, needs to be cited in full: “These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It’s time to move on and ‘Make America Great Again.’”      That Trump would happily trash our own CIA to get Putin off the hook is disturbing enough — and, by the way, there were dissenters in the CIA on Iraq. That he would ignore the risks our intelligence agents take on so many fronts to protect us is outrageous.      CIA officials told senators it is now “quite clear” that electing Donald Trump was Russia’s goal. In an interview on Fox News Sunday on Dec. 11, President-elect Trump denied the CIA's assessment. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)      [Let’s get the facts right on foreign involvement in our elections]      Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, was genuinely disturbed over how a pampered and privileged man so readily threw our intelligence officers under the bus to make a political point. “Perhaps, once he has taken office,” Schiff said, “Mr. Trump will go to CIA and look at the rows of memorial stars in the lobby — each representing a fallen officer — and reflect on his disparagement of the intelligence community’s work.”      Oh, yes, and about his having won “one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history”? In the past 10 elections, Trump’s electoral college take ranks eighth.      The CIA finding is all the more worrisome because of how Trump has willingly served as a Putin apologist. On NBC in September, for example, Trump sounded very impressed with Putin’s power when he declared: “The man has very strong control over a country.” Well, yes, an autocrat whose opponents often turn up dead does exercise “very strong control.” Trump went on to declare that Putin had been a leader “far more than our president has been a leader.” I don’t know about Trump, but I think most Americans would rather live under Barack Obama.      A further cause for concern: Trump and his top lieutenant Stephen K. Bannon have openly allied themselves with the far-right forces in Europe that Putin has championed. In a timely article for the Atlantic, “Russia and the Threat to Liberal Democracy,” Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, speaks of a “romance between far-right, anti-immigrant European parties” and Putin. A Trump romance with Putin fits neatly into this narrative — which is precisely why Trump should want to dispel our fears rather than aggravate them. Diamond declared: “We stand now at the most dangerous moment for liberal democracy since the end of World War II.” Why are we afraid? Because Trump gives us reason to worry he will not be on the right side of this fight.      [‘Lessons learned’ about Russia]      Nor was it reassuring that a day after the story about the CIA’s finding broke, Trump’s inner circle leaked that his likely choice as secretary of state was Rex Tillerson, the ExxonMobil chairman and chief executive who had negotiated oil deals with Putin. For Tillerson’s efforts, Putin awarded him Russia’s Order of Friendship. “Friends and associates said few U.S. citizens are closer to Mr. Putin than Mr. Tillerson,” the Wall Street Journal reported.      Is it paranoid to want to know whether Tillerson’s ties to Putin are why he is at the top of Trump’s list to be our top diplomat? Is it out of line to wonder, given Trump’s lack of transparency about his finances, what role Russia has played in his business empire? After all, his son Donald Trump Jr. said in 2008 that “Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets” and added: “We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.” Now more than ever, we need to know exactly what he was talking about.      Trump’s circle will deride Democrats who ask such questions, but it will not be so easy for them to dismiss Republicans such as Sens. John McCain and Lindsey O. Graham. Those of us profoundly worried about a Trump presidency would be a little less anxious if more Republicans joined them in responding to this challenge not as partisans but as patriots.

In an interview with Fox News’ Eric Shawn, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations questioned why FBI Director James Comey said during the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s private server that there was no direct evidence of foreign intelligence service penetration, but Russian cyber fingerprints were found in the alleged presidential election hacks.      Story Continued Below      “It is not at all clear to me, just viewing this from the outside, that this hacking into the [Democratic National Committee] and the Republican National Committee] computers was not a false flag,” Bolton said. “So the question has to be asked, why did the Russians run their smart intelligence service against Hillary’s server, but their dumb intelligence service against the election?” Bolton did not mention that Comey’s statement might have meant there was no foreign intrusion into Clinton’s server.      Shawn then asked Bolton — who has been mentioned as a possible appointee in Donald Trump’s State Department — whether he was accusing someone in “the administration or in the intelligence community” of the alleged false flag.      “We just don’t know,” Bolton said. “But I believe that the intelligence community has been politicized in the Obama administration to a very significant degree.”      A “false flag” is a term for a cover-up or distraction orchestrated by the government or other powerful figures.      Shawn continued to push Bolton, asking why intelligence officials would politicize the hack and would “go so far to something that could damage the very issue of our republic and what we for 200-plus years have stood for.”      “The whole thing has been called into question, which is why the notion of some kind of independent investigation becomes extremely important,” Bolton said. “I do think it’s critical to answer the question that I posed: If you think the Russians did this, then why did they leave fingerprints?”      Last week, The Washington Post published a report saying the intelligence community believes that Russia was favoring Trump in the presidential race.      President Barack Obama has requested a review of the situation. A bipartisan group of senators — John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed — has also called for an independent investigation of alleged Russian meddling in the U.S. election.      During the interview, Bolton said he had concerns about Obama trying to get the review wrapped up by Jan. 20. He said he thinks the burden of the review will fall on Mike Pompeo, Trump’s nominee for director of the CIA.      “He doesn’t bring any baggage to this; I would look to him to head up an investigation across the entire intelligence community,” Bolton said.      Bolton said that if the claims about Russia were true, the U.S. “should retaliate.”      “It is unacceptable for the American Constitution to be assaulted by foreigners in that way. So it is absolutely critical as well that we get the facts right on this, and I don’t think we have anywhere enough in the public domain to know what the facts are,” he said.      Asked by Shawn about people who might be bothered by the false flag claim, Bolton said there needs to be more information about how the intelligence community came to its conclusion.      “We would want to know who else might want to influence the election and why they would leave fingerprints that point to the Russians,” Bolton said. “That’s why I say until we know more about how the intelligence community came to this conclusion, we don’t whether it’s Russian-inspired or a false flag.” ||||| WASHINGTON — American spy and law enforcement agencies were united in the belief, in the weeks before the presidential election, that the Russian government had deployed computer hackers to sow chaos during the campaign. But they had conflicting views about the specific goals of the subterfuge.      Last week, Central Intelligence Agency officials presented lawmakers with a stunning new judgment that upended the debate: Russia, they said, had intervened with the primary aim of helping make Donald J. Trump president.      The C.I.A.’s conclusion does not appear to be the product of specific new intelligence obtained since the election, several American officials, including some who had read the agency’s briefing, said on Sunday. Rather, it was an analysis of what many believe is overwhelming circumstantial evidence — evidence that others feel does not support firm judgments — that the Russians put a thumb on the scale for Mr. Trump, and got their desired outcome.      It is unclear why the C.I.A. did not produce this formal assessment before the election, although several officials said that parts of it had been made available to President Obama in the presidential daily briefing in the weeks before the vote. But the conclusion that Moscow ran an operation to help install the next president is one of the most consequential analyses by American spy agencies in years. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"The alleged interference by the Russian government in the 2016 US presidential election to ostensibly favor Donald Trump has created a furore that continues to rumble on.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - The earth develops cracks deep beneath the surface - The cracks get very long and big in some places - The earth places pressure against the rocks on both sides of the cracks - The pressure causes the rocks to press against each other very hard - The cracks continue to develop - The earth moves against itself on both sides of the cracks - The pressure and movement around the cracks causes the rocks to crumble in some places - A lot of energy is released - The energy causes seismic waves - The seismic waves move the earth in an earthquake.  Question: suppose earth does not crack happens, how will it affect MORE/STRONGER earthquakes.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"If the earth does not develop cracks deep beneath its surface, it would lead to fewer and potentially weaker earthquakes. To understand this, it’s important to comprehend the role that these cracks, also known as faults, play in the occurrence of earthquakes.  Faults are fractures in the Earth's crust where two tectonic plates meet and may move relative to each other. The movement of these tectonic plates leads to the buildup of stress and strain in rocks surrounding the fault lines. When the stress reaches a breaking point, the stored energy is suddenly released in the form of seismic waves, which we experience as earthquakes. Now, considering the scenario where the Earth does not develop cracks or fault lines, there would be a few possible outcomes: 1. Tectonic plate movement may be severely hindered, leading to a significant reduction in stress buildup. This would mean that the number of earthquakes would decrease, and the ones that do occur may be of lower intensity (Option B: Less). 2. In the absence of faults, the stress and energy accumulated within the Earth's crust might still exist but be distributed more uniformly throughout the planet. This could potentially reduce the chances of major earthquakes from taking place while also leading to the occurrence of smaller earthquakes spread across a wider geographical area (Option B: Less). 3. However, it's also possible that without the presence of faults to relieve stress at specific locations, the energy within the Earth's crust would continue to accumulate until it reaches catastrophic levels. In this scenario, when an earthquake finally occurs, it could be a single event of considerably higher magnitude than those typically experienced around fault lines. This potential situation cannot be definitively ruled out, but it is less likely than the first two scenarios. Ultimately, without the development of cracks or fault lines, the Earth would likely experience fewer and potentially weaker earthquakes. This is supported by the understanding that faults are responsible for the displacement of tectonic plates and the release of energy in the form of seismic waves. So, the most supported answer is Option B: Less."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Just shaved my beard off in order to avoid facial tan lines, although it's almost guaranteed that I'll get burnt today  How would the sentiment of this tweet be described? Choices:  (1). negative  (2). positive","output":"The sentiment of this tweet can be described as a mix of positive and negative, although it leans more towards the positive (2). The negative aspect of the sentiment emerges from the mention of facial tan lines and the near certainty of getting burnt today. These elements suggest that the individual is unhappy with or concerned about the appearance of tan lines on their face, as well as the potential sunburn associated with exposure to the sun. On the other hand, the sentiment carries a more positive tone due to the proactive measure taken by the individual - shaving their beard to avoid facial tan lines. This action demonstrates that they have a plan in place to minimize their concerns regarding tan lines. Additionally, as it's a tweet, it could also be seen as a light-hearted or tongue-in-cheek commentary on their situation, which adds a positive or humorous twist to the sentiment. In summary, although the tweet contains elements of both positive and negative sentiment, the overall tone leans more towards the positive, as the individual is taking action to address their concern and potentially providing a humorous outlook on the situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Using data of the British Department of Environment on pesticides on fruit collected from supermarkets,scientists thought that each day some children would get a poisonous level of pesticides. The research,published on Sunday,says the government repeatedly claims that the levels of pesticide are safe because,instead of measuring individual apples, researchers buy 10,crush them and take an average reading to see if they are safe. This is the internationally agreed method of checking remains. But government figures show that the pesticide is not averagely spread across the batch ,and one or two apples could contain 90% or more of the pesticide in the batch. It used mathematical modeling to measure exposure  to pesticides for children aged between 18 months and four years old. The pesticides involved can destroy children's hormones and some are suspected  of causing cancer. The good news for British fruit growers is that samples grown in this country had lower _ level than imported fruit,so buying home-produced fruit will reduce the danger,said Emily Diamand,one of the Earth's senior food researchers and one of the authors of the report.

Here are possible answers to this question: - burn - changes color with seasons - turn brown - continue to grow - eat water  I believe the correct choice is \\"continue to grow\\", here's why: A:","output":"You are correct – the option \\"continue to grow\\" is the most accurate answer. When grass is provided with ample water and sunlight, it undergoes a process called photosynthesis. In this process, chlorophyll within the grass blades absorbs sunlight and uses it to convert water and carbon dioxide from the air into glucose and oxygen. Glucose is the source of energy for the grass, allowing it to grow and flourish.  This growth takes place in cells at the base of the blades and the roots. The combination of light, water, and nutrients from the soil all contribute to healthy grass growth. Brown or burnt grass usually indicates a lack of one or more of these essential factors.  In summary, when grass is given enough water and sunlight, it will efficiently perform photosynthesis and continue to grow stronger and healthier."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which student read more about a greater frequency of collisions?  Hint: Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases. Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information, it can be concluded that Sean, who studied the influence of temperature on chemical reactions, read more about a greater frequency of collisions. This is because raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction due to the increased movement and speed of reactant particles. As a result, there is a greater frequency of collisions and a higher likelihood of overcoming the activation energy barrier to form products. Therefore, Sean's studies on temperature effects directly relate to the concept of a greater frequency of collisions in chemical reactions."},{"instruction":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

The Vienna Boys' Choir (German: Wiener Sangerknaben) or Vienna Choir Boys is a choir of boy sopranos and altos based in Vienna, Austria. It is one of the best known boys' choirs in the world. The boys are selected mainly from Austria, but also from many other countries. The choir is a private, not-for-profit organization. Gerald Wirth became the choir's artistic director in 2001. However, since then, the choir has come under pressure to modernize and has faced criticism of their musical standards, leading to a split with the Vienna State Opera. The choir has for the first time had to advertise for recruits after a rival choir school was established by Ioan Holender, director of the opera company. He complained of both falling standards and poor communication with the choir. He said that the State Opera sometimes trained boys for particular stage roles, only to find out on the day of performance that they were unavailable as they had gone on tour with the choir. Some boys were attracted to the rival choir school by the prospect of a more relaxed atmosphere and of performance fees being paid directly to them.  The Vienna Boys' Choir has sought to update its image, recording pop music selections and adopting an alternative uniform to the sailor suits used since the 1920s, allowing the boys to dance as they sing. After Eugen Jesser died in May 2008, Walter Nettig became the choir's president. Gerald Wirth has been the artistic director since 2001, and he also became the choir's president in 2013.  In 2010, following sexual abuse allegations from two former choristers stemming from the late 1960s and early 1980s, the Vienna Boys' Choir opened a confidential phone and e-mail hotline to allow others to come forward. Eight possible victims came forward saying they were abused, either by staff or other choir members.","output":"This text is about the Vienna Boys' Choir (German: Wiener Sangerknaben), a choir of boy sopranos and altos based in Vienna, Austria."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Despite the extraordinary feat, it did not take long for Internet users to unleash their typical trolling behavior, poking fun at the accomplishment with memes and Twitter hashtags. While there is a certain amount of humor in the online mockery, it is crucial to focus on the importance of the mission and how it adds to humanity's understanding of our universe. The Philae Probe's Decade-Long Mission Operated by European Space Agency (ESA), the Philae probe was launched in March 2004. After a decade in space, the lander reached its destination, Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, on November 12, 2014. The successful landing on a moving comet, a first for humanity, reflected the dedication and talent of countless scientists in an extraordinary international collaboration. Through its scientific instruments, Philae has collected valuable data and images to better comprehend the structure, composition, and history of comets. These insights are essential to understanding the origins of our solar system and the conditions existing at its birth. The mission is a crucial step forward in expanding our knowledge of the universe and our place within it. Unexpected Reaction: Memes and Mockery The Internet community, known for its propensity to create memes and jokes out of significant events, took little time to begin mocking the Philae probe's achievement. Soon after news of the successful landing surfaced, Twitter users began to use hashtag #LesserCometMilestones, highlighting less impressive accomplishments that humanity has yet to conquer. Some Twitter users sarcastically marveled at humanity's capability to land on a speeding comet but still not master the art of fixing a chipped tooth or creating everlasting cellphone batteries. Others took jabs at society's fascination with seemingly trivial matters, such as celebrity gossip and reality television shows, while downplaying the historic nature of the comet landing. The Need to Recognize and Celebrate Groundbreaking Achievement While the online response to Philae probe's landing on Comet 67P can be seen as mild sarcastic humor, it is essential to recognize the significance of such a scientific breakthrough. The Internet's propensity to overlook the importance of milestones like this landing is a reflection of society's sometimes skewed priorities. Philae's successful comet landing is a testament to humanity's determination and innovation in unlocking the mysteries of the universe. As we continue to explore the cosmos, it is crucial to focus on the remarkable achievements our scientists bring forth and to acknowledge their far-reaching implications for our understanding of the world around us. We have come so far in our quest to understand our place in the cosmos, and the landing of Philae probe on comet 67P is a prime example of this progress. Conclusion While the Internet may be a platform for humor and quick responses to world events, it is essential to separate the jokes from the reality of Philae's achievement. The historic landing on comet 67P is not just a scientific milestone, but a symbol of hope in our ongoing quest for knowledge, driving us to seek answers to some of the most vital existential questions. The monumental achievement should be embraced and celebrated, not just mocked by Internet users, reminding us that the cosmos and the mysteries it harbors are still very much a part of us all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

USA fends off Trinidad & Tobago for unconvincing win in World Cup qualifying Updated OCT 16, 2014 2:21a ET The United States women’s national team cleared its first hurdle toward the 2015 Women’s World Cup, but not by much, as it eked out a 1-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago in their 2014 CONCACAF Women’s Championship opener here on Wednesday night. Abby Wambach’s deft 55th minute header was the difference. The tournament, which will send three teams directly to Canada next summer and puts a fourth in a home-and-away playoff with Ecuador, gave the towering favorites immediate trouble in a vexing contest. For all their firepower and superior means, the Americans -- who practice year-round with elite coaches in state-of-the-art facilities, whereas the Trinidadians get just a week before tournaments on a shoestring budget -- had significant issues breaking through their opposition. Service, in the end, tended to fall short. And if it didn’t, the finishing did. “It’s a learning process with this group,” said USA head coach Jill Ellis, who has installed a new playing system and philosophy in recent months which has yet to fully take root. “We’re asking certain things of them. But sometimes when things don’t happen right away you get tight.” For the USA’s failings, however, Trinidad and Tobago was also entitled to a good deal of credit for its spirited performance. “If the people knew the plight that we’ve had and the struggles that we’ve had,” said head coach Randy Waldrum. “I’m extremely proud of the way the team played tonight.” The first half was one of both dominance and frustration for the Americans. They put Trinidad and Tobago under suffocating pressure, pinging the ball around deep in the opposing half. Distribution was quick and largely crisp – they completed 165 passes to Trinidad’s 28. The Trinidadians only ventured out on the rare breakaway and never got terribly close to endangering goalkeeper Hope Solo. But for a few brief flurries, the Socca Princesses contained the USA surprisingly well. As advertised, they sat deep and defended with a sound organization and sturdy physicality. Megan Rapinoe ran the show for the Americans early on, twice feeding Alex Morgan in dangerous positions within the first three minutes. A defender whiffed on her low cross to Wambach, doing enough to throw her off the chance. Rapinoe’s corner kick at Christen Press was headed right at goalkeeper Kimika Forbes. All of those chances materialized in the first quarter of an hour. It would be until late in the half before the Americans made another charge of note. Carli Lloyd ripped a shot at Forbes’ near post, which she pushed wide. On the ensuing corner, Press miss-hit her effort and Wambach tried to head it on backward, with no luck. On the brink of halftime, Rapinoe hit a very long shot, which dinked off the bottom of the cross bar before going out off of Forbes. Wambach was then denied on the goal line with the header off the corner. Following the intermission, the USA cranked up the pressure further, hoping to crush any budding hopes of T&T pulling off some kind of historic upset. Wambach immediately knocked down a ball for Morgan, but she pummeled her shot over. Wambach then nodded a Megan Klingenberg cross just wide before seeing Forbes save her one-on-one effort, after which Rapinoe blasted the rebound many yards over the mostly-open goal. At length, the Americans broke the surprising resistance. Morgan ran at goal and, once she was deep into the box, took the ball wide. She chipped it to Wambach at the far post. Forbes got a touch to it, but not enough to prevent it from looping to the tall American striker. The world-record holder for international goals took her time to judge the angles as the ball arced toward her and nodded the ball through the scampering defenders and into the net. The relief was palpable as otherwise stoic head coach Jill Ellis rose to her feet on the bench, looked skyward and pumped both fists. “From our perspective, it was frustrating,” said Wambach. “Their goalie basically stood on her head, she had a fantastic game. She kept them in the game until the end. We just couldn’t break them down. We were, on the final chance, the final pass, just a little bit off.” The Americans would conjure many more chances, but they refused to give themselves some breathing room. Wambach was denied one-on-one again by the outstanding Forbes, who was surely the player of the game. Sydney Leroux also found herself denied by Forbes. Trinidad, for their part, grew surer in their attacks and carved out some looks of their own. The score, in the end, was far tighter than it needed to be, given that the Americans outshot their opponents 28 to 6 and put 10 shots on goal to Trinidad’s one. “We have to fix the problems, we have to fix the issues that made it so difficult for us to score goals,” said Wambach. In the end the job was done. And that’s all that the points column in the Group A standings will reflect. What was this article about?","output":"The article is about the United States Women's national soccer team's match against Trinidad and Tobago in the 2014 CONCACAF Women's Championship opener. The U.S. team secured a narrow 1-0 victory, with Abby Wambach scoring the only goal in the 55th minute. The match was crucial for both sides, as this championship tournament would determine the teams representing the region at the 2015 Women's World Cup. Despite the superior resources and level of play exhibited by the American team, Trinidad and Tobago proved to be a difficult and well-organized opponent. The match was hard-fought, and the U.S. faced challenges in penetrating the opposition's defense. However, the U.S. team emerged victorious, albeit with a less convincing performance than expected. U.S. head coach Jill Ellis acknowledged the learning process her team was undergoing, with a new playing system and philosophy that had yet to be fully implemented. On the other side, Trinidad and Tobago's head coach Randy Waldrum expressed his pride in his team's spirited performance, considering their limited resources and preparation time prior to the tournament. Throughout the match, the U.S. created numerous scoring opportunities but struggled with finishing. In the end, their narrow victory can be attributed to both Wambach's timely goal and several impressive saves by Trinidad and Tobago's goalkeeper, Kimika Forbes. The article concludes that while the U.S. team's performance might not have been as dominant as expected, they still managed to secure the win and move forward in the tournament with valuable points added to their Group A standings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Christianity Answer:","output":"Title: The Light of Redemption Setting: The movie is set in a small, secluded village named 'Arkona' in a remote region of Eastern Europe in the 9th century, which practices a pagan religion. The villagers live in harmony with nature and are deeply rooted in their traditions. They are unaware of the wider world and its growing influences. Plot: The story begins with the arrival of a mysterious stranger named 'Edric' in Arkona. Edric is a former Viking warrior who has been traveling the world and spreading Christianity since he had a life-changing encounter with a Christian monk. As Edric settles into the village and witnesses their pagan rituals, he feels a strong calling to help the villagers find salvation and redemption through Christianity. In his attempts to convert the villagers, Edric faces numerous obstacles, including the suspicion and hostility of the village elders, who see his beliefs as a threat to their way of life. They are especially threatened by Edric's rapidly growing bond with 'Liliana', the daughter of the village chief. Liliana is an intelligent and curious young woman who is drawn to Edric's message and begins to question her own beliefs. Eventually, they fall in love, which further complicates Edric's mission to bring Christianity to the village. Throughout the movie, Edric works tirelessly to gain the trust of the villagers by helping them solve their problems, heal their sick, and improve their lives through the teachings of Christianity. He does this while constantly grappling with his own doubts, fears, and internal conflicts. As the movie progresses, the village faces a series of significant events, including a severe drought and a deadly disease outbreak. Edric leads the villagers through these trials, emphasizing the power of faith and prayer. Their success in overcoming adversity eventually softens the villagers' hearts, and they begin to embrace Christianity. However, the movie takes a dark turn when the village's pagan priests feel threatened by the rapid spread of Christianity and conspire to regain power. They frame Edric for a gruesome crime, leading to his arrest and imminent execution. In a climactic sequence, Liliana bravely confronts her father and the village elders, pleading for Edric's life and revealing the priests' conspiracy. The chief reluctantly investigates the matter and, in a shocking twist, discovers that the priests were indeed behind the crime to maintain their grip on the village. He has the priests arrested and professes his newfound faith in Christianity. Edric is freed, and the village eventually converts to Christianity, ushering in a new era of unity and prosperity. The movie ends with Edric and Liliana getting married in the village's first Christian church, symbolizing the triumph of faith and love over fear and superstition. Their love story serves as an anchor for the greater story of spiritual transformation, showing that redemption can be found even in the most isolated corners of the world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - Dustin Miller (born May 2, 1977), best known by his stage name D-Loc, is an MC in the rap rock group Kottonmouth Kings and rap group Kingspade. The group was signed to Suburban Noize. Miller has been a part of the Kottonmouth Kings since they were the P town Ballers (PTB) in 1994.

The encoding material sits atop a thicker substrate (usually polycarbonate) which makes up the bulk of the disc and forms a dust defocusing layer. The encoding pattern follows a continuous, spiral path covering the entire disc surface and extending from the innermost track to the outermost track. The data is stored on the disc with a laser or stamping machine, and can be accessed when the data path is illuminated with a laser diode in an optical disc drive which spins the disc at speeds of about 200 to 4,000 RPM or more, depending on the drive type, disc format, and the distance of the read head from the center of the disc (inner tracks are read at a higher disc speed). Most optical discs exhibit a characteristic iridescence as a result of the diffraction grating formed by its grooves. This side of the disc contains the actual data and is typically coated with a transparent material, usually lacquer. The reverse side of an optical disc usually has a printed label, sometimes made of paper but often printed or stamped onto the disc itself. Unlike the 3-inch floppy disk, most optical discs do not have an integrated protective casing and are therefore susceptible to data transfer problems due to scratches, fingerprints, and other environmental problems.  - , formerly known as , is a Japanese multinational electronics corporation headquartered in Kadoma, Osaka, Japan.  - Sony Corporation is the electronics business unit and the parent company of the Sony Group, which is engaged in business through its four operating components  electronics (video games, network services and medical business), motion pictures, music and financial services.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. What does Mr. Lomax's reanimated corpse need to hear in order to move?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Larry Wilson and Richard Parker are at a Manhattan morgue where they see their deceased CEO Bernie Lomax. Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle, so he can get some of Bernie's possessions including Bernie's credit card. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel, the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the US2 million that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes they're lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt. Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the 2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry and Charles (Tom Wright)—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents. They prepare in a bathroom at a sleazy porno theater for the voodoo ceremony, but having lost the sacrificial chicken, they use a pigeon instead. This limits Bernie's ability to walk toward the hidden money: he only moves when he hears music. At the 42nd St-Grand Central subway station, Henry and Charles soon abandon him to chase a man who stole their boombox.

Q:Oil is formed by layers of sediment pushing down on decomposing algae, and fossil fuels like coal and oil are ancient biomass fuel. Given these facts, what is a product of layers of sediment pushing down on decomposing algae over time among the following options: - Fungus  - Greenhouse gases  - Fossil fuels  - Calcium carbonate  - salinity  - Sand  - contamination  - Water A:","output":"A product of layers of sediment pushing down on decomposing algae over time among the given options is fossil fuels.  Fossil fuels are hydrocarbon deposits formed through geological processes acting on the remains of ancient biomass for millions of years. These geological processes typically involve a combination of heat, pressure, and time acting upon deceased plants, such as algae, and, in some cases, animal remains. Algae, for instance, were abundant in the prehistoric oceans and sequestered large amounts of carbon on the ocean floor when they died. Over millions of years, layers of sediment accumulated on top of these dead organisms, exerting tremendous pressure and causing their carbon content to become concentrated. There are three main types of fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas. Coal forms from the remains of terrestrial plants in swampy environments, while oil and natural gas form primarily from marine organisms, including algae. Throughout an extended period, the heat and pressure from these layers of sediment convert organic matter into different hydrocarbons. Oil, a liquid fossil fuel, is created when organic-rich sediment is subjected to heat and pressure over millions of years. This process results in the formation of a substance called kerogen, which ultimately transforms into crude oil at even higher temperatures and pressures. The crude oil then migrates through porous rocks, such as sandstone, and accumulates in reservoirs where it can be extracted and refined to produce various petroleum products like gasoline, diesel, and lubricants. In conclusion, among the given options, fossil fuels are the product of layers of sediment pushing down on decomposing algae over time. The process of forming fossil fuels takes millions of years and is the result of heat, pressure and time acting upon ancient organic materials, including algae.

Thank you for the kind words and support. pic.twitter.com/6B2dO6OvOx — RMCH Charity (@RMCHcharity) May 25, 2017      The queen issued a statement quickly after the attack, saying, “The whole nation has been shocked.”      “I know I speak for everyone in expressing my deepest sympathy to all who have been affected by this dreadful event and especially to the families and friends of those who have died or were injured,” the statement read. ||||| Queen Elizabeth made a surprise visit to a children’s hospital that is treating many of the young victims of the horrific tragedy that followed the Ariana Grande concert on Monday, telling one patient that the suicide bombing was “dreadful” and “very wicked.”      The monarch arrived at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital at around 11:20 a.m. Thursday, shortly after Britain had fallen silent for a minute in tribute to the dead and injured as well as their families and loved ones.      Queen Elizabeth told 14-year-old Evie Mills, who received the concert tickets a birthday present, and her parents, “It’s dreadful. Very wicked. To target that sort of thing,” The Telegraph reports.      The Queen reassured them that “everyone is united” following the attack.      She then told the teen that she thought Ariana Grande was a “very good singer,” adding: “She sounds very, very good.”      The Queen also met with Millie Robson, 15, who wore an Ariana Grande T-shirt as her surprise guest asked if she enjoyed the concert prior to the attack. The teen then shared that she had won VIP passes and met the pop star backstage.      The royal visitor wished Millie a quick recovery.

Emily Murrell, 12, missed the Queen’s visit due to a surgery. Her mother Ruth, who was also recovering in the hospital after being hit with shrapnel when the bomb went off, said her daughter would be disappointed.      Queen Elizabeth also met 12-year-old Amy Barlow and her mother, Kathy.      Twenty-two people died, many of them teens and children, and around 75 were injured in the attack at Manchester Arena on Monday.

The Queen also met the head of the National Health Service trust and the chief nurse and the chief executive.      “The awful thing was that everyone was so young. The age of them,” she told one member of the staff.      The hospital is one of the most important in the U.K. and treats 200,000 people a year.      REX/Shutterstock      REX/Shutterstock      WATCH: Homeless Manchester Man Helped Those in Need Following The Suicide Bombing at Ariana Grande Concert      In a statement signed Elizabeth R. and issued by Buckingham Palace on Tuesday, the monarch said: “The whole nation has been shocked by the death and injury in Manchester last night of so many people, adults and children, who had just been enjoying a concert.      “I know I speak for everyone in expressing my deepest sympathy to all who have been affected by this dreadful event and especially to the families and friends of those who have died or were injured.”      And she praised those who rushed to help. “I want to thank all the members of the emergency services, who have responded with such professionalism and care,” her statement added. “And I would like to express my admiration for the way the people of Manchester have responded, with humanity and compassion, to this act of barbarity.”      The deadly explosion occurred around 10:33 p.m. local time near the ticket office outside Manchester Arena, Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said. Investigators suspect the attack was carried out by Salman Abedi, 22, who detonated an improvised explosive device and died at the scene, Hopkins said.      According to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors militant communication, ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack. ||||| In a few simple words during a visit to the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital to meet the young victims of the terrorist bombing, the Queen encapsulated the horror of an attack that has left the nation reeling.      “It’s dreadful, very wicked, to target that sort of thing,” the Queen said to 14-year-old schoolgirl Evie Mills, who she met lying on her hospital bed with a teddy by her side, and a blanket shrouding her injured chest and legs.      The Queen later added as she toured the children's ward viewing at first hand the carnage of Monday night's attack: “the awful thing was that everyone was so young.”      During her 65 years of reign, the Queen has occasionally made visits to hospital to help lead the nation in moments of national grieving.      She did so after the 7/7 terror attacks in London and also to meet servicemen and women injured fighting for their country.      But never have so many children been among the victims. There are 14 inpatients remaining at the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital following the attack, including five in critical care.      Among those continuing to recover from their injuries in the hospital was Millie Robson, 15, from Co Durham, who was still wearing her Ariana Grande concert t-shirt that she had specially chosen for the concert at the Manchester Arena. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Queen Elizabeth II visited a children's hospital in Manchester to meet with young survivors of the terrible event that happened after an Ariana Grande concert.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? exposé , the film ( at 80 minutes ) is actually quite entertaining .","output":"To determine whether the following phrase is considered positive or negative, let's break down the sentence and analyze the individual elements or words that give it a connotation. Phrase: \\"Exposé, the film (at 80 minutes) is actually quite entertaining.\\" 1. \\"Exposé\\" - This word suggests a revealing film, which can be neutral, absent any further context. 2. \\"the film (at 80 minutes)\\" - This part provides information about the duration of the film, which is also neutral.  3. \\"is actually\\" - The word \\"actually\\" often acts as a surprise or contradiction to a pre-conceived notion. It can imply that despite any potential doubts, the information that follows is reassuring, potentially making the statement positive. 4. \\"quite entertaining\\" - This part describes the film in a positive way, as \\"entertaining\\" is a complimentary adjective. Based on the analysis, the phrase \\"exposé, the film (at 80 minutes) is actually quite entertaining\\" contains both neutral and positive words. However, the core sentiment expressed in this sentence is positive, as it explicitly describes the film as \\"quite entertaining.\\" Therefore, the overall connotation of the phrase can be considered positive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close Movie plot: Nine-year-old Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn), who suffers from Asperger syndrome, is the son of German American Thomas Schell (Tom Hanks).[5] Thomas would often send Oskar on missions to do something involving one of his riddles. The last riddle he ever gives Oskar is proof that New York City once possessed a Sixth Borough. In a flashback, Thomas and Oskar play a scavenger hunt to find objects throughout New York City. The game requires communication with other people and is not easy for the socially awkward Oskar who is told \\"If things were easy to find, they wouldn't be worth finding\\". On September 11, 2001, Oskar and his classmates are sent home from school early while his mother Linda (Sandra Bullock) is at work. When Oskar gets home, he finds five messages from his father on the answering machine saying he is in the World Trade Center. When Thomas calls for the sixth time, although Oskar is present to answer this call, he is too scared to answer. The machine records a sixth message which stops when the building collapses. Oskar knows his father has been killed and falls to the floor. He replaces the answering machine with a new one and hides the old one so his mother will never find out. A few weeks after what Oskar calls \\"the worst day,\\" he confides in his German grandmother and they become closer. Oskar's relationship with his mother worsens since she cannot explain why the World Trade Center was attacked and why his father died. Oskar tells his mother he wishes it had been her in the building, not his father, and she responds, \\"So do I\\". After, Oskar says he did not mean it, but his mother doesn't believe him. A year later, Oskar finds a vase in his father's closet with a key in an envelope with the word \\"Black\\" on it. He vows to find what the key fits. He finds 472 Blacks in the New York phone book and plans to meet each of them to see if they knew his father. He first meets Abby Black (Viola Davis), who has recently divorced her husband.

The child's mother, an unmarried washerwoman named Sarah (Debbie Allen), is discovered, and brought to their home. When she learns that the police intend to charge Sarah with child abandonment and attempted murder, Mother (Mary Steenburgen) intervenes and takes Sarah and her child into the home, despite Father's objections. Some time later, Coalhouse Walker arrives at the house in search of Sarah, driving a new model T-Ford and acting in a brash manner unlike the subservient attitude expected of the African American community at the time.

While the afternoon sun cast its golden rays upon the vivid flora of the garden, the gardener trudged along a meandering footpath, diligently pushing his rickety wooden cart. The wheels creaked, bearing the weight of the water barrels nestled comfortably within. Weary yet resolute, he wiped the sweat from his brow, determined to complete the task at hand. The garden, a true masterpiece of nature, was a labor of love for the humble gardener. Its variety of flowers, from elegant roses to whimsical daffodils, lent their colors to the landscape, gently painting it with life. Ornately carved hedges danced in the subtle breeze, their delicate green details evoking a symphony of shapes. Majestic trees, some towering tall while others gracefully curved, provided a serenade of leaves as their branches swayed above. At the heart of this Eden, a serene pond awaited the gardener's attention. Its tranquil waters, teeming with fish of every hue, served as an oasis for his hardworking hours, offering relief and solace. On this particular day, the pond had started to decline, its water levels having dipped slightly due to gradual evaporation and thirsty creatures who ventured close to drink. Aware that the pond's inhabitants and surrounding flora relied on its nourishing waters, the gardener saw it as his duty to refill the gem of his garden. As he approached the pond, his hands steadied the cart's wooden frame, careful not to spill a single drop. One by one, he stretched his sinewy arms, grasping the barrels with vigor and pouring their contents into the waiting pond. The water splashed gently upon the surface, merging with the shimmering hues of reds, blues, and yellows reflected on the watery canvas. He watched as the water level slowly began to rise, revitalizing the pond's ecosystem. A school of fishes near the edge darted into deeper waters, their scales sparkling like tiny prisms in the sunlight. Dragonflies zipped about, skimming the water's surface as their wings caught wind, seeking out newfound hideaways amongst the reeds. Even the chorus of frogs, once silenced by the vanishing water, serenaded the gardener with excitable croaks, grateful for the restored depth. As the gardener emptied the final barrel, the water in the pond reached its usual level. His eyes scanned the fullness of the pond, a gratified smile gracing his weary face. The garden had once again returned to its harmonious balance, a vibrant symphony of colors, sounds, and life. Knowing his task had been accomplished, the gardener took a moment to savor the view, allowing the satisfaction from a job well done to wash over him. With renewed determination, he pushed the now-empty cart away from the pond, already planning his next gardening endeavor. As the sun dipped lower in the sky, the gardener continued to tend to his beloved creation, ensuring the beauty and health of the garden was safeguarded for both current and future generations to enjoy. For the gardener knew that his work was not just a responsibility, but a calling, fulfilling his soul and breathing life into his small piece of paradise."},{"instruction":"Q: Title: So far so good Review: Great production, great workout and inspiring on so many levels.

Here is a hypothesis: Think about all the stupid things. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"In order to examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, it's essential to first understand their individual meanings and potential implications. Premise: \\"Stop thinking stupid thoughts.\\" This statement suggests an instruction or advice to halt or avoid engaging in thoughts that are considered to be \\"stupid\\" or irrational. It implies that the person receiving this advice has, in the past, engaged in such thoughts and the speaker believes this practice should cease or at least be minimized. As a premise, it sets a foundation for a potential conclusion. Hypothesis: \\"Think about all the stupid things.\\" This statement proposes that one should engage in thoughts about irrational or \\"stupid\\" things. Unlike the premise, it actively encourages the contemplation of these types of thoughts. A hypothesis typically proposes an idea that may be explored or tested, but in this case, it seems to contradict the premise. Now, let's analyze if the premise supports the hypothesis or if the truth of the premise leads to the truth of the hypothesis. The premise and hypothesis seem to be contradicting each other. If we assume the premise is true, which means we should stop thinking about stupid things, it does not support the hypothesis that encourages us to think about all the stupid things. As a result, one cannot conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be true as well. To better illustrate this using formal logic, let's assign variables to the statements: 1. Premise: ¬P (the negation of thinking stupid thoughts, i.e., stop thinking stupid thoughts) 2. Hypothesis: Q (think about all stupid things) We want to determine if the following argument is valid: 1. ¬P (premise) 2. Therefore, Q (conclusion, which is the hypothesis in this case) To evaluate the validity of this argument, we can construct a truth table for the possible values of P and Q. Let's assume 'T' stands for true and 'F' stands for false. P | Q | ¬P - | - | -- T | T | F T | F | F F | T | T F | F | T As we can see, there is no row in the truth table where ¬P (the premise) being true leads to Q (the hypothesis) being true. In other words, the truth of the premise does not necessitate the truth of the hypothesis. In conclusion, it is not possible to determine that if the premise \\"Stop thinking stupid thoughts\\" is true, then the hypothesis \\"Think about all the stupid things\\" is also true, as the two statements contradict one another, and the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Repeat this setence, but with the correct capitalization.","output":"But we need to develop common basic standards for electric charging points across the EU - otherwise, you could find yourself crossing from France to Germany without being able to refuel. In recent years, the European Union has been working towards a more sustainable future, with electric vehicles (EVs) playing a central role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. With the increased demand for EVs, it has become evident that a harmonized approach is necessary for the development and deployment of supporting infrastructure, like electric charging points. The lack of common basic standards for electric charging points can create several issues. Firstly, it hinders the seamless cross-border travel for EV users, as they may not be able to recharge their vehicles when moving from one country to another, leading to logistical difficulties and inconveniences. Secondly, the absence of standardization may result in higher costs for both installation and maintenance of these charging points, as businesses and governments may have to adopt different technologies and systems to suit their specific needs. In this context, the development of common basic standards for electric charging points across the EU offers numerous benefits: 1. Improved connectivity: A standardized system would ensure that all EVs, regardless of their brand or country of origin, can recharge at any charging point in the EU, eliminating the need for drivers to carry multiple charging adapters or memberships with different charging networks. 2. Reduced costs: By implementing a uniform standard, economies of scale can be realized, potentially lowering the costs related to installation, maintenance, and usage of electric charging points. This is particularly relevant for governments and businesses that are contributing to the expansion of charging infrastructure. 3. Enhanced innovation: With a common framework in place, manufacturers and service providers can focus on improving efficiency, speed, and customer experience instead of dealing with compatibility issues. This could, in turn, stimulate further innovation and competition in the EV charging market. 4. Regulatory compliance: Creating common basic standards would simplify regulatory compliance for industry participants, as they would only need to adhere to a single set of rules and requirements rather than dealing with multiple inconsistent standards. 5. Greater consumer confidence: Lastly, standardization would boost consumer confidence in electric mobility, as it eliminates the concern of limited charging options while traveling within the EU. To achieve these benefits, the EU could pursue a collaborative approach by engaging stakeholders, including automakers, charging point operators, standards organizations, and government bodies. This would help in developing a comprehensive strategy encompassing technical specifications, communication protocols, and user authentication methods, ensuring seamless interconnectivity and ease of use across the EU's electric charging network. In conclusion, the development and adoption of common basic standards for electric charging points across the EU is of paramount importance to facilitate the growth of electric vehicles, promote a shift towards cleaner transportation, and contribute to a greener, more sustainable future for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This has been a decision that has not only sparked massive protests across the country, but it has also driven enraged demonstrators to ransack the President's office. In a country where churning political waters have been an unsettling norm for the past few years, the pardon granted by the Macedonian president has become a lightning rod for accumulated frustration. Political instability, disillusionment, and skepticism about the Macedonian government have found an expressive outlet in the protests that have enveloped the country following President Ivanov's pardon. The wire-tapping scandal initially brought the already vulnerable political setup in Macedonia under increased scrutiny and pressure. The scandal revealed what was referred to as a potentially 'massive invasion of privacy,' with thousands of conversations being illegally recorded by the government. To many, the pardon has acted as a smokescreen, protecting those at the helm of this controversial affair from facing due punishment. President Ivanov's decision to excuse these political figures has been comprehended as a gross display of impunity. It conveyed to protesters the underlying message that individuals in positions of power could evade justice, a scenario that couldn't be more perilous for a country yearning for political stabilization and transparent leadership. The protesters' decision to break into and vandalize the President's office further underscores their level of resentment and disapproval. Such drastic measure reflects the people's deep-felt sense of betrayal and disappointment. Demonstrators come across as individuals who, feeling unheard and unhappy with the status quo, have taken it upon themselves to make a bold and unequivocal statement against the pardoning action. International observers and human rights organizations express concern over both the act of pardoning the implicated politicians and the violent demonstrations. There has been emphasis on the importance of justice and order in Macedonia, both by holding those responsible for the wire-tapping scandal to account, and by protesters voicing their dissent in peaceful and democratic ways. The incident has also caught the attention of the EU and the US, both prompting for the restoration of the rule of law and democracy in Macedonia. There are fears that the ongoing friction could destabilize the Balkan region, already a hotbed for political and sociological tensions. It is also hinted that this incident could potentially push Macedonia further away from its aspiration towards European integration. Whether President Ivanov's controversial decision to pardon the figures involved in the wire-tapping scandal will prove to be the final straw for the Macedonian people, or whether it is merely another episode in the unfurling political drama of the country, remains to be seen. But one thing is clear - the Macedonian masses have shown through these protests that they are not ready to stand silent in the face of perceived grave injustices. The ransacking of the President's office suggests a need for a profound and immediate change in the nation's political establishment. It is a wake-up call to the ruling elites, a sign that there are only so many indiscretions and alleged acts of corruption that they can brush under the proverbial carpet before the public takes matters into its own hands. The future of Macedonia hangs in the balance, as the unfolding events will undoubtedly play a significant role in shaping its political landscape. Thus, the situation deserves the utmost attention from the international community and a speedy and satisfactory resolution for its citizens who are ardently yearning for justice and democracy."},{"instruction":"Given a disfluent sentence, modify the sentence to it to its equivalent fluent form, preserving the meaning of the sentence.

Title: Pathology Movie plot: The intro shows a camera recording faces of corpses, with their mouths being moved by medical students. Med school student Teddy Grey (Milo Ventimiglia) graduates top of his class from Harvard and joins one of the nationâs most prestigious pathology programs. There, a rivalry develops between a group of interns and Teddy. They invite him into their group, which entertains itself with a secret after-hours game at the morgue of who can commit the perfect undetectable murder. Eventually the group's leader, Jake Gallo, realizes that Teddy is sleeping with his girlfriend, Dr. Juliette Bath. When Teddy catches several members of the group in lies, he realizes that what initially seemed like vigilante killings are, in actuality, just innocent people murdered for sport. Teddy's fiancÃ©e Gwen arrives to stay with him in his apartment. Gallo, angered by Juliette's infidelity, kills her for the next game. However, just as they are about to begin the autopsy on Bath (in the meantime plotting Teddy's death), Gallo realizes that the gas has been left on in the room, resulting in a massive explosion as one of the group lights a meth pipe, killing everyone but Teddy who was not in the room. Gallo realizes what is about to happen and survives. Teddy is seen walking away from the explosion. Later, Gallo manages to kill Gwen in what he believes to be the \\"perfect murder\\". Upon completing his autopsy report on his murdered fiancÃ©e, Teddy is knocked out by Gallo and then is forced to trade verbal barbs with him. Teddy uses some of Gallo's own rhetoric against him in reverse psychology fashion, after which fellow pathologist Ben Stravinsky frees Teddy and together they kill Gallo in exactly the same way that he killed Teddy's fiancÃ©e. In the process, they vivisect Gallo. Answer:","output":"Teddy and Ben Stravinsky kill Gallo."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here is a more detailed answer: Hepatitis C is a viral infection caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which mainly affects the liver. It is primarily transmitted through blood-to-blood contact with an infected person. Transmission can occur due to: 1. Sharing needles, syringes, or other drug injection equipment. 2. Receiving contaminated blood transfusions, blood products, or organ transplants, especially before 1992, when widespread screening of blood supplies began. 3. Accidental needlestick injuries in healthcare settings. 4. Sharing personal items, such as razors or toothbrushes, that may have come into contact with the infected person's blood. 5. Having tattoos or piercings done with non-sterile equipment. 6. Mother-to-child transmission during childbirth, although this is less common. 7. Unprotected sexual contact with an infected person, though this is much less common than other transmission methods. Hepatitis C cannot be transmitted through casual contact, such as hugging, shaking hands, or sharing food. To avoid Hepatitis C infection, it is essential to practice good personal hygiene, avoid sharing personal items that may come into contact with blood, and take other preventive measures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"To prepare a steak on the grill, follow these steps: Step 1: Select and prepare the steak Choose a high-quality steak with good marbling (fat distribution) for better flavor and tenderness. Common cuts for grilling include ribeye, New York strip, or filet mignon. Let the steak reach room temperature by removing it from the refrigerator about 30-60 minutes before grilling. This helps it cook evenly. Step 2: Preheat the grill Clean the grill grates to remove any residue or debris. Then, preheat the grill to medium-high heat, around 400-450°F (204-232°C). Preheating ensures a good sear and prevents the steak from sticking to the grill grates. Step 3: Season the steak While the grill is preheating, season the steak. Since steak has a rich, meaty flavor, simple seasoning with salt and freshly ground black pepper is usually enough. Apply a generous amount to both sides of the steak, patting it in gently to ensure it adheres. Step 4: Oil the grill grates To prevent the steak from sticking, lightly oil the grill grates using a high smoke point oil such as vegetable or grapeseed oil. Dip a paper towel into the oil and, using tongs, rub it over the heated grates. Step 5: Grill the steak Place the seasoned steak on the preheated grill grates. Let it cook undisturbed to create a nice sear and grill marks. For medium-rare, cook the steak for about 3-4 minutes per side. For medium, cook about 4-5 minutes per side. Adjust the cooking time according to your desired steak doneness. Step 6: Check for doneness Use a meat thermometer to verify the internal temperature of the steak. For medium-rare, aim for 130-135°F (54-57°C), and for medium, shoot for 135-140°F (57-60°C). Grill temperatures can vary, so using a thermometer helps ensure accurate results. Step 7: Rest the steak Once the steak reaches the desired internal temperature, remove it from the grill and let it rest on a cutting board or plate for about 5-10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute within the steak, resulting in a more tender and flavorful bite. Step 8: Slice and serve After resting, slice the steak against the grain and serve it with your favorite side dishes. Enjoy your grilled steak!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Action on Sugar analysed 131 hot drinks and found a third contained at least as much sugar as a can of Pepsi or Coca-Cola, which contains nine teaspoons. The charity said in some of the worst cases the drinks contained 20 or more teaspoons of sugar. Coffee shop chains Starbucks, Costa and Caffe Nero said they were committed to reducing sugar content in their drinks. The drinks assessed included flavoured coffees such as mochas and lattes, hot fruit drinks and hot chocolates from coffee shops and fast food chains. The charity found that 98% of the drinks tested would receive a red nutritional value label for high sugar content. The recommended maximum intake of added sugar per day for those aged 11 and over is about 30g or seven teaspoons, the NHS says. Starbucks' venti Grape with Chai, Orange and Cinnamon Hot Mulled Fruit was found to have the highest sugar content of the drinks tested, with 25 teaspoons of sugar per serving, the campaign group said. Costa's massimo eat-in Chai Latte was found to contain 20 teaspoons of sugar and Starbucks' venti White Chocolate Mocha with Whipped Cream was found to have 18. KFC's mocha and Starbucks' Signature Hot Chocolate both had 15 teaspoons of sugar per serving while Caffe Nero's drink-in Caramelatte had 13. The group's researcher Kawther Hashem called on coffee shop chains to reduce the amount of sugar in their drinks, improve their labelling and scrap extra-large serving sizes. \\"These hot flavoured drinks should be an occasional treat, not an everyday drink,\\" she said. \\"They are laden with an unbelievable amount of sugar and calories and are often accompanied by a high sugar and fat snack.\\" She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she was \\"surprised\\" by the results, and said the campaign group had tested only the larger portion sizes on offer. Case study: Mark Cresswell from London \\"I used to drink a large white cafe mocha with caramel and vanilla syrup, cream on top, caramel and chocolate drizzle at Starbucks - approximately three times a day, seven days a week. \\"I did this for about a year. At the time, I knew this drink had lots of sugar and fat, but I wasn't aware of just how much. \\"At one point the assistant manager refused to serve me because they were concerned of the health impact. The rest of the staff continued to serve me. \\"I drastically cut back on these sugary drinks after I was diagnosed with a very high cholesterol level and liver problems three years ago. \\"I still have high cholesterol now and was recently diagnosed with a fatty liver - which means it is not working properly - not from alcohol but from sugar. \\"While I believe we should all take responsibility for our health, I do feel that coffee shops which allow their customers to customise their drinks to extreme levels are not helping.\\" Professor Graham MacGregor, Action on Sugar chairman, said the group's report highlighted \\"yet again another example of scandalous amounts of sugar added to our food and drink\\". \\"No wonder we have the highest rates of obesity in Europe,\\" he said. A Starbucks spokeswoman said the chain had \\"committed to reduce added sugar\\" by 25% by the end of 2020 in its \\"indulgent drinks\\". \\"We also offer a wide variety of lighter options, sugar-free syrups and sugar-free natural sweetener and we display all nutritional information in-store and online,\\" she said. Kerry Parkin, Costa's head of communications, said the chain had already taken \\"significant steps\\" to reduce the sugar content of its drinks. The company would be setting salt and sugar reduction targets for 2020, she said. A Caffe Nero spokeswoman said: \\"We have already made changes to reduce the sugar content of some of our iced drinks for summer 2016 by over 10%. \\"In addition, we offer sugar free syrups for many drinks, and all nutritional information is available on our website so that customers can make an informed choice.

The early scenes of the film show him filming his conversation in the hospital with his dying grandfather. Through the eyes of Simon we see the grandfather as a caring, wise man, while through the perspective of his uncle we see the racist, backwards side. Simon's grandfather hated Simon's father and claims that he intended to kill Simon's mother in the car crash when, as Simon finds out at the film's conclusion, he had an eye condition. This condition prevented him from being able to drive at night, as the glare from oncoming headlights would blind him. The evening of the car crash reveals a different side of the story, causing the memories of each character to meet head on, connecting disparate stories of each character to unite in an Egoyanesque conclusion.Simon's family narrative is cleverly knit into a news story presented to Simon by his high school French teacher as a translation exercise. An article is read by the teacher about an attempted bombing of an aircraft by a man who put explosives in his pregnant wife's luggage. Simon gets the idea to translate the story and write it from the perspective of the child in the woman's womb. The teacher encourages Simon to develop his story as a drama exercise, however Simon presents it to the class and to the world via the Internet as if he really was that child. The teacher's silence, as we find out later, is owing to her relationship with Simon's late father who died, with his mother, in a car crash when he was still a child. The narrative of the car crash and the attempted bombing of the plane become intertwined as a way for the characters to deal with their past experiences, which they have all been trying to deny.The film is about a search for identity in a digital age where the truth is oftentimes irrelevant. Simon's story of his suicide bomber father is met on the Internet with sympathy, anger, and even support as we see a skinhead on webcam telling Simon that his father was a hero....

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the title of Nielsen's third cantata? , can you please find it?   Nielsen's two operas are very different in style. The four-act Saul og David (Saul and David), written in 1902 to a libretto by Einar Christiansen, tells the Biblical story of Saul's jealousy of the young David while Maskarade (Masquerade) is a comic opera in three acts written in 1906 to a Danish libretto by Vilhelm Andersen, based on the comedy by Ludvig Holberg. Saul and David received a negative press when it was premiered in November 1902 and did no better when it was revived in 1904. By contrast, in November 1906 Masquerade was a resounding success with an exceptional run of 25 performances over its first four months. Generally considered to be Denmark's national opera, in its home country it has enjoyed lasting success and popularity, attributable to its many strophic songs, its dances and its underlying \\"old Copenhagen\\" atmosphere.Nielsen wrote a considerable number of choral works but most of them were composed for special occasions and were seldom reprised. Three fully-fledged cantatas for soloists, orchestra and choir have, however, entered the repertoire. Nielsen composed Hymnus amoris (Hymn of Love), Op. 12 (1897) after studying early polyphonic choral style.  Writing in the newspaper Dannebrog, Nanna Liebmann referred to the work as \\"a decisive victory\\" for Nielsen, and Angul Hammerich of Nationaltidende welcomed its improved clarity and purity. But the Berlingske Tidende reviewer H.W. Schytte thought Nielsen had been pretentious presenting the lyrics in Latin rather than Danish. Søvnen (The Sleep), Op. 18, Nielsen's second major choral work, sets to music the various phases of sleep including the terror of a nightmare in its central movement which, with its unusual discords, came as a shock to the reviewers at its premiere in March 1905. Fynsk Foraar (Springtime on Funen), Op. 42, completed in 1922, has been cited as the most Danish of all Nielsen's compositions as it extols the beauty of Funen's countryside. Answer:","output":"The title of Nielsen's third cantata is \\"Fynsk Foraar\\" (Springtime on Funen), Op. 42, which was completed in 1922.

If you are familiar with the antics of Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown & Root and Blackwater overseas you are already halfway home to fully appreciating the satire of Cusack's latest piece. Cusack plays a corporate hit-man named Brand Hauser who finds himself in Turiquistan organizing a trade show in the newly liberated country as his cover while waiting to get access to his latest target. While there he finds himself intrigued by the anti-establishment reporter played by Marisa Tomei and pursued by the over-sexualized pop star played by Hilary Duff. We are introduced to Hauser's past, which includes a tragedy that has haunted him ever since and the corporate assistant named Marsha Dillon who actually is running the entire operation for him (and played hilariously by Joan Cusack). While some moments are played suitably over the top, they aren't always the moments you expect and the little touches often catch you by surprise. All the principals turn in solid performances. Duff's accent comes and goes but otherwise she does a very nice job and goes a long way to dispel her Disney image. Tomei is funny but understated while the Cusack's own nearly every scene they are in. To be fair, they are given good material. The writers turn in a good script with enough twists and turns and visual gags to keep you giggling throughout all the way to the predictable conclusion.

Pick out any shriveled or irregular beans and discard them.","output":"Ok, after we soak the beans overnight and rinse them, here's what we'll do next: 1. Put the beans in a big pot: Carefully pour the rinsed beans into a large pot. Remember we removed those not-so-good beans, so we only have the nice and clean beans!  2. Add lots of water: Pour enough water into the pot so that it covers the beans by about 2 inches. Just like when you take a nice bath, the beans need enough water to swim around.  3. Turn on the heat: Ask an adult to help you set the stove to medium heat. We want our beans to cook slowly and gently, not too fast.  4. Add some flavor friends: You can make your beans taste even better by adding some salt, chopped onions, garlic, or maybe some diced carrots. Just choose the ones you like! 5. Let it simmer: When the water starts to bubble a little bit, it’s time to turn the heat down to low. This way, our beans can cook slowly. Put a lid on the pot but leave a little gap open so steam can escape.  6. Check on the beans: You'll need to cook the beans for 1.5 to 2 hours, but you should check them every 30 minutes to make sure they have enough water. If the water is getting low, add some more to the pot.  7. Test if the beans are soft: After about 1.5 hours, take out a bean with a spoon and blow on it to cool it down. Give it a gentle squish with your fingers or taste it. If it's soft and ready to eat, it's done! If not, just let the beans cook a bit longer. 8. Enjoy your delicious beans: Once the beans are soft and cooked, you can ask an adult to help you turn off the stove. Scoop the beans into a bowl and enjoy them as a side dish or add them into your favorite recipe! Remember, always ask an adult for help when using the stovetop or dealing with hot pots and pans.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Sami Mokbel. Sportsmail understands Manchester City's director of football Txiki Begiristain was in Porto on Thursday to watch French centre half Eliaquim Mangala in action. Read the full story on the £20m-rated centre back HERE. Manchester City want to buy British this  summer as they struggle to keep hold of their homegrown stars. The club are identifying summer targets to satisfy Premier League rules on homegrown players, with Southampton full back Luke Shaw, Everton midfielder Ross Barkley and Nottingham Forest defender Jamaal Lascelles in their sights. City nominated nine homegrown players in their squad at the start of the season but face losing several of them this summer. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Roberto Martinez on Ross Barkley's ability. Midfielder: Ross Barkley. Full-back: Luke Shaw. Defender: Jamaal Lascelles. Wonderkid: Ross Barkley (L) has been earning rave reviews for Everton, including this goal against Newcastle. Luke who's talking: Southampton defender Shaw has also been linked with Manchester United and Chelsea. Best defence: Nottingham Forest's Jamaal Lascelles could be needed to replace departing homegrown players. And, although the 2012 Premier League. champions are closing in on £20m-rated Porto centre back Eliaquim. Mangala, don't expect too many more exports in the summer. Central defender Joleon Lescott will leave when his contract expires. Likewise, Micah Richards is not prepared to sign a new, five-year deal. Richards has struggled for games under Manuel Pellegrini, yet the club are keen to keep him and Sportsmail understands the right back has been offered an increase on his £80,000-a-week deal to stay. Feeling unwanted: City defender Joleon Lescott (R) is expected to leave at the end of the season. Not about the money: Micah Richards has been offered an increase to stay but wants more playing time. What shall we do? Youngsters Jack Rodwell and Deryck Boyota are also considering their futures. Premier League clubs must include no more than 17 non-homegrown players over the age of 21 in their squads of 25. Homegrown players are defined as players trained by their club, or another in the same country, for at least three years between 15 and 21. There is no obligation to put a certain number of them in a match-day squad.Why were the rules brought in?There was concern that the richest clubs would stockpile the best players to the detriment of developing their own youngsters. The 25-year-old’s contract does not expire until the end of next  season, but City may look to sell him in a cut-price deal this summer to avoid losing him for nothing in 2015. Liverpool, Arsenal and AC Milan are monitoring the situation. Dedryck Boyata, who qualifies as homegrown even though he is  Belgian, has also been offered a new deal despite playing only one  league game this season. However, the defender is understood to be hugely reluctant to  re-sign given his lack of playing time and is also likely to leave.  City chiefs will open talks with James Milner — whose contract expires next season — before the World Cup, but the England  forward wants assurances over his playing time before agreeing to an extension. Play me! James Milner wants assurances before he commits to a new contract at the Etihad. Stunted growth: Rodwell has struggled to displace stars like Vincent Kompany since moving from Everton. Pecking order: Alex Nimely may be tempted to move with the likes of Sergio Aguero ahead of him. The future of striker Alex Nimely, 22, is also unclear given that his contract expires this summer, while Jack Rodwell is known to be considering his future at the Etihad Stadium. Midfielder Gareth Barry, on loan at Everton, will definitely be leaving while Serbia defender Matija  Nastasic will be counted as an overseas player next season, having turned 21 last month. Behind the scenes, the potential lack of homegrown talent is a  concern and buying British is likely to be a necessity for City. Sporting director Txiki Begiristain is well aware of the problem and City’s network of scouts are  working hard to identify targets. One of ours: Matija Nastasic will be considered a homegrown player next season having turned 21 last month. Sticking with Toffees? Gareth Barry is certain to leave after spending the season on loan with Everton. Warning signs! Scott Sinclair (L) was offloaded after barely featuring during his short spell at City. However, persuading the likes of Shaw, 18, Barkley, 20, and Lascelles, 20, that they can fulfil their  footballing potential at City might prove a further stumbling block. You only need look at how some City buys have fared to understand why they might be cautious. Scott Sinclair and Rodwell arrived from Swansea and Everton respectively in 2012 but have struggled to make an impact. Sinclair has been shipped out on loan to West Bromwich Albion while Rodwell has found first-team  football hard to come by, partly due to injury, and has made only seven Premier League starts. Head to head: Jose Mourinho (L) and Manuel Pellegrini could be competing for the same players next season. Old guard: John Terry (top), Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole (R) are some of Chelsea's hew homegrown stars. Chelsea are also keeping abreast of the homegrown market. Manager Jose Mourinho could name only a 22-man squad in September after reaching his full quota of 17 overseas players. At the time, John Terry, Gary Cahill, Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard and Ryan Bertrand were the only homegrown players at his disposal — meaning he had to forego three squad places. Chelsea, like City, will be in the market for all the best English talent this summer, including Shaw and Barkley. And that means only one thing: sky-high prices. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article is about Manchester City, a football club, looking to buy British players in the summer. They are doing this because some of their current homegrown players might leave the club and they need to follow the Premier League rules that include having a certain number of homegrown players in their team.

Add p to both sides of the equation: 11*p + 24 + p = -p + p Combining like terms, we get: 12*p + 24 = 0 2. Next, we want to get rid of the constant term (24) on the left side of the equation, to have only the term with the variable p on the left side. To do this, subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: 12*p + 24 - 24 = 0 - 24 Simplifying, we get: 12*p = -24 3. Now, we want to isolate p on the left side. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of p (which is 12): 12*p / 12 = -24 / 12 Cancelling the common terms, we get: p = -2 So, the value of p that solves the equation 11*p + 24 = -p is p = -2."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Available options: (A). yes (B). no","output":"(A). Yes The Anglo-Irish War (also known as the Irish War of Independence) indeed ended in 1921 with a stalemate, leading to the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which established the Irish Free State. This conflict took place from January 21, 1919, until July 11, 1921, between the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the British security forces in Ireland. The IRA was a military organization advocating for an independent Irish Republic, free from British rule. The Anglo-Irish Treaty, signed on December 6, 1921, by representatives of the British government and Irish delegates, including Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith, sought to establish peace in a politically divided Ireland. The terms of the treaty recognized the Irish Free State as a self-governing Dominion within the British Empire, similar to Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The Irish Free State was granted effective internal independence while remaining constitutionally linked to the British Crown. The signing of this treaty resulted in the partition of Ireland into two separate entities. The 26 southern counties formed the Irish Free State, while the remaining six northeastern counties (an area known as Northern Ireland) chose to remain part of the United Kingdom, reflecting the predominantly unionist, Protestant majority in this region that favored continued British rule. Although the agreement ended the conflict and marked a significant step in the Irish struggle for independence, it also generated intense disagreement and division among the Irish population. Opponents of the treaty argued that they could not accept any compromise short of creating a fully independent, united Ireland. This opposition eventually led to the Irish Civil War (1922-1923) between pro-treaty and anti-treaty factions, causing further strife and hostility in the country. To sum up, your given statement is a good and accurate answer to the question, as it highlights the key aspects of the end of the Anglo-Irish War. This includes the stalemate, the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, and the establishment of the Irish Free State as a Dominion within the British Empire, with an internal autonomy yet constitutionally linked to the British Crown."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Select from:  -Trim the ends, rinse in cold water, cut sprouts in half, toss with sugar and place them in a preheated oven  on a baking sheet.  -Trim the ends, rinse in cold water, cut sprouts in half, toss with oil and place them in a preheated oven  on a baking sheet.","output":"The second option, trim the ends, rinse in cold water, cut sprouts in half, toss with oil and place them in a preheated oven on a baking sheet, makes more sense to accomplish the goal of cooking brussels sprouts. This method ensures that the sprouts are prepared and cooked properly, resulting in a delicious and healthy dish.  Here's a more detailed explanation of the process: 1. Preparation: - Begin by selecting fresh Brussels sprouts with a bright green color and firm texture. Avoid any that have yellowing leaves or soft spots. - Rinse the sprouts under cold water to remove any dirt or debris. - Trim the ends of the Brussels sprouts by cutting off about 1/4 inch of the stem. This helps them cook evenly and removes any tough parts. - Peel off any loose, discolored, or damaged outer leaves. These are typically not very appetizing and may not cook properly. - Cut the sprouts in half lengthwise; this allows them to cook more quickly and evenly, and also maximizes their surface area for caramelization. 2. Toss with oil and seasoning: - Place the halved Brussels sprouts in a mixing bowl. - Drizzle with olive oil, approximately 1 to 2 tablespoons, depending on the quantity of Brussels sprouts. This will help them cook evenly and develop a delicious, crispy texture. - Season with salt and pepper to taste. You can also add additional seasoning options like garlic powder, onion powder, or crushed red pepper flakes for more flavor variety. - Toss everything together until the sprouts are well coated in oil and seasonings. 3. Cooking: - Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). This high temperature will cook the sprouts quickly, preserving their nutrients and creating a crispy exterior. - Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil to make clean-up easier. - Arrange the Brussels sprouts in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet, ensuring each piece has plenty of space. Crowding them may lead to uneven cooking and prevent caramelization. - Roast in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the sprouts are tender and have developed a golden brown color on the outside. You can flip the sprouts halfway through cooking to ensure even browning on both sides. 4. Serving and additional options: - Once the roasted Brussels sprouts are out of the oven, you can serve them as a delicious side dish or add them to salads. - For additional flavor, consider adding balsamic glaze, grated Parmesan cheese, or toasted pine nuts before serving. This method is preferred over the first option, which involves tossing the Brussels sprouts with sugar. While sugar can sometimes be used to help the caramelization process, it is uncommon to use it with Brussels sprouts and may result in a final dish that is overly sweet and potentially less healthy. Tossing the sprouts with oil is a more traditional and sensible method, giving the finished dish a crispy exterior and well-cooked interior."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: A local district attorney says that the probe into Sandra Bland's death after a traffic stop is being treated \\"like a murder investigation,\\" despite preliminary information indicating that she committed suicide.      Bland was arrested July 10 after a traffic stop and died three days later in her cell, sparking questions about the manner of her death and outrage. An autopsy found that she died by asphyxiation and that she used a plastic trash bag to hang herself from a partition in her cell.      \\"This is being treated like a murder investigation,\\" Waller County District Attorney Elton Mathis said Monday evening. \\"I want fingerprints run. I want...DNA tests run on the trash bag.\\"      He also called for \\"any other valid scientific testing that we have so we can say with certainty what happened in her cell.\\"      \\"There are too many questions that still need to be resolved,\\" Mathis added.      The case is being run by the Texas Rangers and is being supervised by the FBI, Mathis said. But local church pastors say they and Bland’s relatives believe the case should be investigated by Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the Department of Justice.      Her relatives have called for an independent autopsy to be completed as well, with the results expected by Tuesday.      The DA's statement about the case came as Capt. Brian Cantrell, of the Waller County Sheriff's Office, gave a more detailed account of what happened after Bland's arrest as their department released three hours of footage from inside the jail.      Cantrell said that Bland was taken to Waller County Jail after refusing medical attention on the scene after a confrontation with police.      There, she was placed in a cell alone because she was deemed a \\"high risk\\" inmate to the safety of others based on the nature of the charge against her, Cantrell said.      On the morning of Monday, July 13, jailers checked on Bland and she said she was \\"fine,\\" according to Cantrell.      The jailer also said that she could use a phone that was located in the cell using a PIN number. There were no records of a call being made, Cantrell said.      Just before 9 a.m., when jailers returned to see if she wanted to go to the recreation hall, they found her hanging from the privacy portion of her cell.      According to Cantrell, they then put her on the ground to administer CPR.      Preliminary information from the medical examiner's office indicated that she died from self-inflicted asphyxiation, Cantrell said.      \\"The death of Miss Bland was a tragic incident, not one of... criminal intent,\\" Cantrell told reporters. He also expressed the department's \\"sincere condolences\\" for the death.      In the wake of the incident, all trash bag liners were removed from the cells at the jail. No jailers have been disciplined as of yet.      Dash cam footage of the traffic stop may be released Tuesday, Cantrell said.      Mathis said that Bland appeared to be \\"very combative\\" during the traffic stop.      \\"It was not a model traffic stop and it was not a model person that was stopped,\\" Mathis told reporters, referring to whether or not Bland was compliant.      He noted that the dash cam footage may not clarify what happened because much of the activity takes place in Bland's car, of which there was a limited view.      Supporters of Bland, a 28-year-old woman and Black Lives Matter activist who was arrested July 10 and found dead in her cell three days later, said today they have already seen the dash-cam video that they say shows an officer dragging Bland out of her car and chastising her for smoking in her vehicle.      \\"She has the right to smoke in her car. That is her right,\\" the Rev. Jamal Harrison Bryant of Baltimore, who has been working to raise awareness of the case, said at a news conference in Texas this morning.      Mathis said that the assertion that Bland was pulled out of her car window was untrue.      Byrant said “there are many questions that must be answered.”      “We are not satisfied with the explanation that she committed suicide,” he said.      “We are in a state of emergency here in Texas. We are not afraid of ISIS, we're afraid of the police.” ||||| Authorities in Texas have released a video covering the three hours before Sandra Bland was found dead in her jail cell. NBC Chicago's Phil Rogers reports. (Published Monday, July 20, 2015)      Texas authorities on Monday released a three-hour video taken from outside a jail cell where an Illinois woman arrested during a traffic stop was found dead.      The video from a motion-operated camera shows there was no activity for 90 minutes in the hallway leading to the cell where authorities say 28-year-old Sandra Bland was found hanged on July 13, three days after her arrest.      Video Footage Shows Hours Leading Up to Illinois Woman's Jail Cell Death      The video from a motion-operated camera shows there was no activity for 90 minutes in the hallway leading to the cell where authorities say 28-year-old Sandra Bland was found hanged on July 13, three days after her arrest. NBC Chicago's Regina Waldroup reports. (Published Monday, July 20, 2015)      Authorities also said dashcam video of Bland's arrest is expected to be released Tuesday. Waller County District Attorney Elton Mathis said Monday the video is consistent with information the officer has provided about the traffic stop. The Texas Department of Public Safety has said Bland was arrested after she allegedly kicked an officer.      But Mathis cautioned that the dashcam video shows only restricted views of the stop in Prairie View, Texas.      The Chicago-area black woman's death at the Waller County jail in Hempstead, about 60 miles northwest of Houston, comes amid increased national scrutiny of police after a series of high-profile cases in which blacks have been killed by officers. The FBI and the Texas Rangers are investigating.      \\"This investigation is still being treated just as it would be a murder investigation,\\" Mathis said.      Bland's death been ruled a suicide by the Harris County Medical Examiner's Office, a finding that supporters and relatives dispute. Bland's family and others have called for a Justice Department probe and an independent autopsy.      \\"This was not a case of suicide, but homicide,\\" Rev. Jamal Bryant, of the Empowerment Temple AME Church of Baltimore, said earlier Monday. He said he was in Hempstead at the Bland family's request.      DPS has said the trooper who stopped Bland violated traffic stop procedures and the department's courtesy policy, but hasn't elaborated further. The trooper is on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation.      Bland may have been trying to text or email in the moments after she was pulled over for an improper lane change, Mathis said Monday.      \\"Sandra Bland was very combative,\\" the district attorney said. \\"It was not a model traffic stop ... and it was not a model person that was stopped on a traffic stop. I think the public can make its own determinations as to the behaviors that are seen in the video.\\"      The video from the jail released Monday shows no activity in the hallway leading to Bland's cell for about 90 minutes until an officer goes to check on her.      It shows a deputy reacting to what she sees while looking in the cell, triggering a frenzy of activity involving other deputies. An EMT crew arrives with a wheeled stretcher. The video does not show the inside of her cell or even her cell door. Deputies and medical personnel are seen coming and going, but a body isn't visible.      Capt. Brian Cantrell, head of the sheriff's department criminal investigation division, said the video was motion sensitive, indicating if nothing is taking place after a certain amount of time, it turns off. He said the FBI has been given hard drives to determine if there's been any manipulation.      Cantrell said a guard checked with Bland about two hours before she was found dead and Bland told her, \\"I'm fine.\\" About an hour later, she asked to make a telephone call from her cell and was advised the phone was on a wall in the cell, according to Cantrell.      There is no record of her ever making a phone call, he said.      Mathis also said jail records show Bland was offered a medical checkup but declined.      Cantrell declined to describe Bland's death in detail. He described the plastic garbage bag used as a ligature by extending his hands about 5 to 6 feet apart.      The bags, he said, had been approved by a jail inspector, but have since been removed from all cells.      Relatives and friends have insisted she was upbeat and looking forward to a new job at Prairie View A&M University, the school where she graduated in 2009. She was in the area to interview for the job and accepted it.      Mathis also said the dashcam video doesn't provide a complete view. The trooper's dash cam shows a view forward toward Bland's car, but not inside and not to the side, where she wound up on the ground after authorities said she kicked the officer.      \\"It doesn't show how she got on the ground,\\" Cantrell said.      Copyright Associated Press / NBC Chicago ||||| HEMPSTEAD, Tex. — The authorities on Monday offered new details of the final hours of the life of a Chicago-area woman who was found hanged in a jail cell in Texas three days after she was arrested during a traffic stop.                              A Waller County sheriff’s official described a timeline for the jail cell of the woman, Sandra Bland, that started early in the morning of July 13, when she refused a breakfast tray around 6:30 a.m., until a jailer found her hanging shortly after 9 a.m. For about 90 minutes during that period, there was no movement by jail officials in the hallway leading to her cell, according to a video that the authorities released from a camera inside the jail.      “This investigation is still being treated just as it would be a murder investigation,” the Waller County district attorney, Elton Mathis, said. He said the case is likely to be turned over to a grand jury expected to be impaneled in August.      Mr. Mathis said he expected investigators to release a dashboard camera video of Ms. Bland’s arrest on Tuesday.      “There are too many questions that need to be resolved,” Mr. Mathis told reporters, saying that the Bland family “does make valid points” that Ms. Bland seemed to “have a lot of things going on in her life for good.”      Capt. Brian Cantrell of the Waller County Sheriff’s Office said that Ms. Bland replied “I’m fine” when a jailer was conducting rounds shortly after 7 a.m. and later inquired about how to make a phone call. But shortly after 9 a.m., a female jailer saw Ms. Bland hanging in her cell and summoned help. Other officers and emergency medical personnel tried unsuccessfully to administer CPR.      The death of Ms. Bland has set off protests and calls for a federal investigation from her relatives and supporters, who have sharply disputed the official ruling by the Harris County medical examiner that her death was a suicide. They said Ms. Bland, who was black, was a vocal opponent of police brutality, and they have requested an independent autopsy.      United States Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Texas Democrat, on Monday urged the Justice Department to investigate the death.      Photo      “Someone’s child died; some young woman died that this family loves, and we owe them an explanation,” Ms. Jackson Lee said in asking Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch to begin an inquiry. “I cannot sense under the facts that I know now that a 28-year-old young woman, excited about a new job, posed a threat to anybody in Waller County, including any law enforcement officer.”      The Texas Department of Public Safety has said the Texas Rangers and the F.B.I. are also investigating the case.      Hempstead, the county seat of Waller County, is about 60 miles northwest of Houston. Ms. Bland had come to the county from her home in Naperville, Ill., for a job at Prairie View A&M; University.      Ms. Bland was arrested on July 10 in Waller County by an officer with the Department of Public Safety on a charge of assaulting a public servant. She had been pulled over for failing to signal a lane change.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      A lawyer for the family, Cannon Lambert, told NBC News that the dashcam video showed that the encounter between Ms. Bland and the state trooper became confrontational after she refused the officer’s demand to put out a cigarette.      The authorities said she hanged herself with a plastic bag, resulting in death by self-inflicted asphyxiation.      A handful of supporters of Ms. Bland gathered Monday in sweltering midday heat outside the Waller County Sheriff’s Office, which holds the jail cell where she died, continuing a vigil that began last week. Brandi Holmes of Houston held a sign reading, “What happened to Sandy Bland?” Another sign read, “State police profiling — you stopped her for what.”      The Rev. David Madison, president of the A.M.E. Ministers Alliance in Houston, said the demonstrators were united behind the calls for a Justice Department investigation.      “We’re not accepting the report of death suicide,” said the minister, who is pastor of the Greater Ward A.M.E. Church in Houston. “Sandra Bland had just moved from Chicago to Houston to start a new job. You don’t come all the way to Houston just to kill yourself.”      The death has fueled additional tensions over the treatment of African-Americans in police custody and comes roughly three months after the death of Freddie Gray, 25, an unarmed African-American in Baltimore who died from injuries sustained while being transported in a police van.      Photo      Ms. Jackson Lee was among a bipartisan group of Houston-area officials who were in Hempstead over the week to express concern about the case and meet with members of Ms. Bland’s family. The group included Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican; State Senator Rodney Ellis, a Houston Democrat; and State Senator Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican from Brenham. ||||| Summary:","output":"Sandra Bland, a 28-year-old woman and Black Lives Matter activist, was arrested after a traffic stop on July 10 and died three days later in her cell, raising questions about the manner of her death. Waller County District Attorney, Elton Mathis, has said that the investigation into Bland's death is being treated \\"like a murder investigation,\\" despite preliminary information suggesting she may have committed suicide. An autopsy found that Bland died by asphyxiation, using a plastic trash bag to hang herself from a partition in her cell. The case is being run by the Texas Rangers and supervised by the FBI; however, local church pastors and Bland's relatives believe that the case should be investigated by Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the Department of Justice.

His Sudanese father was killed by a car bomb when he was a child. As an adult, Samir is first seen operating as an arms dealer. While negotiating a deal with Omar in Yemen he is arrested and thrown into a Yemeni jail. Later, Samir and Omar become friends, and when Omar's people arrange an escape, they take Samir with them.  They meet Fareed, a lieutenant in the al-Nathir terrorist organization.  FBI Special Agent Roy Clayton suspects Samir has been radicalized and begins tracking him. Joining al-Nathir, Samir uses the skills he learned as a Special Forces Engineer Sergeant with the U.S. Army Special Forces to bomb the U.S. consulate in Nice, France.  It is revealed that Samir is working under deep cover for a US intelligence contractor, Carter; Samir is devastated when he learns that despite Carter's covert efforts, innocent people perished in the consulate bombing.   Impressed with Samir, Fareed introduces him to leader Nathir, who discloses a plot to place suicide bombers on 50 buses in the U.S. during Thanksgiving and instructs Samir to act as liaison to each of the al-Nathir sleeper bombers.  Later, Carter unwittingly interrupts a meeting between Samir and Omar, and is killed by Omar. Samir reveals his deep cover to Agent Clayton, who tracks him to Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. While on board a cargo ship to Marseille, France, Samir kills Nathir and Fareed, and tells an enraged Omar that by targeting innocents they betrayed Islam.

In 1951, with secret means of communications established, Wolters sent his first letter to Speer in five years.  He suggested that Speer move ahead with his memoirs.  In January 1953, Speer began work on his draft memoirs, and over the next year lengthy missives, sometimes written on tobacco wrappings or candy wrappers but most often on toilet paper, made their way to Wolters' office in Coesfeld.  Marion Riesser, who had continued as Wolters' secretary as he began private architectural practice, transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive, and the draft totalled 1,100 pages.  Wolters objected that Speer called Hitler a criminal in the draft, and Speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were the memoirs ever to be published.  Wolters had come to believe that reports of Nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten, that Hitler had not been given credit for the things he did right and that Germany had been harshly treated by the Allies.In the mid-1950s, Wolters quarrelled with Kempf who effectively dropped out of the network for a number of years, adding to the burden on Wolters and Riesser.  While Speer's pleas for his former associate and his former secretary to work together eventually brought about a healing of the breach, this was to some degree superficial as Kempf was aware that Wolters, even then, disagreed with Speer's opinions.  Wolters questioned Speer's readiness to accept responsibility for the Nazi regime's excesses and did not believe Speer had anything to apologise for, though the strength of his feelings on this point was kept from Speer—but not from Kempf and Riesser.Wolters was tireless in his efforts on behalf of Speer and his family to such an extent that his son, Fritz, later expressed feelings of neglect.

Context: SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer. Question: What is probably true about Puskas?

After the fight, promoter Billy Wolfe wanted Young to become a professional wrestler. She left home two years later to wrestle professionally.

According to Dave Meltzer of The Wrestling Observer, historians have been unable to find any records that she began in 1939 and that her first match was most likely in 1941. Meltzer wrote, \\"In reality, Young is believed to have competed in seven decades, matching the record held by Lou Thesz. [...] You really couldn't call [her] 2010 match anything resembling a pro wrestling match, even giving as much leeway as possible.

Q: Generate an appropriate title for the given text. The generated title must be short and include the main topic of the text. The preferred titles are under fifteen words. By Natalie ShermanBusiness reporter, New York When the pandemic hit the US in March, Sarah Sherman, owner of Hopper Real Estate in Eastham - a holiday home rental business on the Cape - saw her summer season erased with cancellations. But by mid-July, her business had revived - despite the number of cases in the country setting records. At one point, she scored more than 16 bookings in just two days - a number unheard of in a typical year. \\"It's definitely feeling like summer,\\" she says. The return of visitors was a major relief to Ms Sherman and business owners like her across Cape Cod, a peninsula that juts off Massachusetts into the Atlantic Ocean that was made famous as the summer playground of the Kennedys. Cold and grey in the winter, it is dependent economically on the summer months, when its population doubles and families from across the northeast pour in to sunbathe, cycle and gorge on lobster and fried clams. As the country went into lockdown, reservations \\"just stopped\\", she recalls. \\"We were like, 'Oh my god, what is going to happen?'\\" \\"We didn't know whether there was going to be a summer.\\" That worst case scenario didn't materialise. Families with second homes de-camped for extended stays earlier in the year than usual. Renters soon followed, as a long spring in lockdown created pent-up demand, particularly for places like the Cape, to which most visitors travel by car. By the 4 July holiday weekend - typically one of the busiest in the year - occupancy rates at hotels were above 90%. But as case counts rise elsewhere in the country, Ms Sherman says it is too early to say if the area's economy has escaped. \\"As we watch the rest of the country spike, we're like, 'If that happens here, that could close down the rest of our summer really quickly.'\\" Consumer spending stalls Ms Sherman's concerns are widely shared. Economists have warned that consumer spending in the US appears to be stalling, even in places, like Massachusetts, which have so far escaped a sharp rise in cases. Spending has flattened across the country since the 4 July holiday, and remains down more than 6% since January, according to data from a team of researchers at Harvard University, who found the pullback has been driven by wealthy families and led to significant job loss at businesses in neighbourhoods that cater to such a clientele. For a place like the Cape, which relies on tourist dollars, the economic impact is likely to be significant, says Karen Dynan, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Wealthy families are more likely to have been spared job and income cuts, which could help spending bounce back when people feel safe again. But it's not clear how many businesses will be able to survive until then, she says. \\"We're just beginning to see the longer term harm to the economy,\\" she says. 'Not as busy' Many restaurants and other stores are offering off 20% or more, as visitors shop and dine out less. At Scargo Cafe in Dennis, takeaway and outdoor tables have helped to maintain business, but with a nearby cinema and theatre closed, co-owner David Troutman says it's nothing like a typical summer, when people pack three deep at the bar and wait for an hour to be seated. Many of his 73 staff are working part-time and he didn't hire extra seasonal help. \\"Whether it's a good economy or bad economy or the pandemic, [second-home owners] going to come down here no matter what,\\" he says. \\"But people are unquestionably afraid to come into the building .... It's certainly not as busy.\\" The subdued tone is especially evident in Provincetown, a small town on the tip of the Cape whose art galleries and restaurants are typically jammed with visitors. Mike Carroll, owner of the Schoolhouse Gallery, says he has reduced public hours and cut back his staff from three to one, opting to handle most things himself. \\"It's really good to have a to-do list every day because the news is not good,\\" he says. \\"Our visitor population will be down, business will definitely be down and the seasonal aspect of it will definitely make it more acute.\\" New economy? That's what longtime Cape Cod vacationer Zoe Fishman fears. Though her family has retreated to its second home on the Cape almost every weekend since March - much earlier than usual - activities have been largely limited to beach-going and pool-time at the grandparents'. And she knows that will take a toll. \\"There are definitely major changes to how we spend,\\" says the paediatrician, who described her economic outlook as \\"dismal\\". \\"I hope that next summer will be a summer of a lot of new restaurants. I hope that we'll see a new sort of economy,\\" she says. \\"But I think what we're probably going to see next summer is a lot of empty places.\\" A:","output":"Cape Cod Tourism Amid Pandemic Uncertainty"},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

You will also want to beware of weed whaling. 2. You can use a 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) sprig, or just a combination of cuttings. Cutting from a real fica plant usually doesn't require you to cut it whole, but some varieties of artificial ficus do. 3. You don't want the sprig to be a brand new shoot, but it also shouldn't be too old either. Look for a sprig with no damage and healthy, green leaves. 4. The main benefit to a cutting is that it won't rip or damage its leaves. Mature sweet ficus varieties have a long stem and the stem should be somewhat inward.Choose from options above and answer: What most naturally follows? How to grow a ficus benjamina  Select a healthy sprig for cutting.  The easiest way to grow a new ficus is with a cutting from an established plant. The best cutting will be a small sprig that's at least 6 inches (15 cm) long, and with a few leaves on it. Answer:","output":"Growing a ficus benjamina, also known as a weeping fig or simply ficus, is a rewarding experience due to its lush foliage and easy adaptability to various indoor conditions. Following the selection of a suitable sprig, certain steps need to be taken to ensure the successful growth and propagation of the cutting. Here are the subsequent steps: 1. Prepare the cutting: Once you have selected a healthy sprig, carefully remove it from the parent plant using a clean, sharp pair of pruning shears or a knife. Make a diagonal cut at the base of the stem to maximize the surface area for rooting. Remove any leaves from the lower half of the cutting to prevent them from touching the soil or water when planted, as this may cause rot. 2. Rooting the cutting: There are two methods for rooting ficus benjamina cuttings - in water or in a potting mix.    a. Water rooting: Place the cut end of the stem in a container filled with clean water. Ensure that no leaves are submerged in the water. Place the container in a warm and brightly lit spot, avoiding direct sunlight. Change the water every few days to prevent bacterial growth. Roots should begin to appear within 2 to 4 weeks.        b. Soil rooting: Dip the cut end of the stem in a rooting hormone, which can be found at a local nursery or garden center, to encourage root growth. Plant the cutting in a moist, well-draining potting mix, such as a mixture of peat moss, perlite, and vermiculite. Rooting in soil generally takes longer than water rooting but may result in a stronger root system. 3. Provide a nurturing environment: Regardless of the rooting method, ensure that the cutting is placed in a warm environment with consistent temperatures between 65-75°F (18-24°C). Additionally, provide bright, indirect light to support growth, and avoid placing the cutting in areas with drafts or temperature fluctuations. 4. Transplant to a pot: Once the cutting has established roots, carefully transplant it into a pot containing well-draining, high-quality potting mix. Choose a pot that is only slightly larger than the root ball, as ficus plants prefer snug pot conditions. Ensure that there are drainage holes in the pot to prevent waterlogged soil. 5. Care and maintenance: Ficus benjamina requires consistent, moderate watering, allowing the top inch of soil to dry out before watering it thoroughly. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so always check the soil moisture levels before watering. Fertilize the plant with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer). With attentive care and following these steps, your ficus benjamina cutting will grow into a thriving, attractive houseplant that will enhance your living space with its verdant foliage."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Wrestling Society X (WSX) was a short-lived professional wrestling-based television series produced in 2006 by Big Vision Entertainment.

Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - The OderNeisse line is the international border between Germany and Poland. It was drawn at the Potsdam Conference in the aftermath of the Second World War and is primarily delineated along the Oder and Lusatian Neisse rivers in Central Europe, meeting the Baltic Sea to the north, just west of the Polish seaports of Szczecin and winoujcie (German: \\"Stettin\\" and \\"Swinemünde\\"). All prewar German territory east of the line and within the 1937 German boundaries (23.8% of the former Weimar Republic) were placed under International Law Administrative status, with most of it being made part of newly-Communist Poland. The small remainder, consisting of the territory surrounding the German city of Königsberg (now renamed Kaliningrad, in honour of Soviet head of state Mikhail Kalinin) in northern East Prussia, was allocated to the Soviet Union (as Kaliningrad Oblast of the Russian SFSR, today the Russian Federation) after the war (pending the final World War II peace treaty for Germany). The vast majority of the native German population in these territories fled, or was killed or expelled by force. The OderNeisse line marked the border between the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and Poland from 1950 to 1990. East Germany confirmed the border with Poland in 1950, while West Germany, after a period of refusal, finally accepted the border (with reservations) in 1970. In 1990 the newly reunified Germany and the Republic of Poland signed a treaty recognizing it as their border.  - West Berlin was a city that existed in the period between the end of the Berlin Blockade on 12 May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990 as a political enclave surrounded by East Berlin and East Germany. It was east of the Inner German border and only accessible by land from West Germany by narrow rail and highway corridors. It consisted of the American, British, and French occupation sectors established in 1945 and shared economic, political, legal, and sporting systems with West Germany, but was not \\"de jure\\" part of it. It had a special and unique legal status because its administration was formally conducted by the Western Allies. East Berlin, \\"de jure\\" occupied and administered by the Soviet Union, was the \\"de facto\\" capital of East Germany. The Berlin Wall, built in 1961, physically divided East and West Berlin until it fell in 1989.  - North Korea, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK ), is a country in East Asia, in the northern part of the Korean Peninsula.

In the early 1950s , the Soviets took the SKS carbine out of front - line service and replaced it with the AK - 47 ; however , the SKS remained in second - line service for decades . It is still used as a ceremonial firearm today . The SKS was widely exported , and was also produced by some former Eastern Bloc nations as well as China , where it was designated the \`\` Type 56 Carbine '' , East Germany as the Karabiner S and in North Korea as the \`\` Type 63 '' . The SKS is currently popular on the civilian surplus market as a hunting and marksmanship semi-automatic rifle in many countries , including the United States , Canada , and New Zealand . Its age and numbers make it very inexpensive to purchase . The SKS was the second firearm after the RPD chambered for the 7.62 × 39mm M43 round , which was later used for the AK - 47 .  - Calgary is a city in the Canadian province of Alberta. It is situated at the confluence of the Bow River and the Elbow River in the south of the province, in an area of foothills and prairie, about east of the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies.

He is most famous for developing the AK-47 assault rifle and its improvements, the AKM and AK-74, as well as the PK machine gun.  - The AK-47, or AK as it is officially known (also known as the Kalashnikov) is a selective-fire (semi-automatic and automatic), gas-operated 7.62×39 mm assault rifle, developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov. It is officially known in the Soviet documentation as \\"Avtomat Kalashnikova\\".  - East Germany, formally the German Democratic Republic or GDR, was an Eastern Bloc state during the Cold War period. From 1949 to 1990, it administered the region of Germany that was occupied by Soviet forces at the end of World War IIthe Soviet Occupation Zone of the Potsdam Agreement, bounded on the east by the OderNeisse line. The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin, but did not include it; as a result, West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR. The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet Zone, while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones. East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948, and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949. Soviet forces, however, remained in the country throughout the Cold War. Until 1989, the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party (SED), though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation, the National Front of Democratic Germany.   - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing.

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - The Warsaw Pact, formally the Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation, and Mutual Assistance and sometimes, informally, WarPac. was a collective defense treaty among the Soviet Union and seven other Soviet satellite states in Central and Eastern Europe in existence during the Cold War. The Warsaw Pact was the military complement to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CoMEcon), the regional economic organization for the communist states of Central and Eastern Europe. The Warsaw Pact was created in reaction to the integration of West Germany into NATO in 1955 per the London and Paris Conferences of 1954, but it is also considered to have been motivated by Soviet desires to maintain control over military forces in Central and Eastern Europe.  - The Eastern Bloc was the group of communist states of Central and Eastern Europe, generally the Soviet Union and the countries of the Warsaw Pact. The terms Communist Bloc and Soviet Bloc were also used to denote groupings of states aligned with the Soviet Union, although these terms might include states outside Central and Eastern Europe.  - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits.

The CPC is the sole governing party of China, although it coexists alongside eight other legal parties that comprise the United Front; these parties, however, hold no real power or independence from the CPC. It was founded in 1921, chiefly by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao. The party grew quickly, and by 1949 the CPC had driven the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) government from mainland China after the Chinese Civil War, thus leading to the establishment of the People's Republic of China. The CPC is currently the world's second largest political party with a membership of 88.76 million as of 2016 (while the Indian Bharatiya Janata Party appears to have remained the largest with a membership of 110 million as of the previous year, 2015).

Continue writing the following text. The child took to playing music on the guitar instantly but ignored the game because the","output":"fascination with the guitar was far greater than any digital entertainment could offer. The child, named Alex, had always shown an interest in music from a young age, attracted to the melodic tunes and the rhythmic vibrations that emanated from various musical instruments. As Alex plucked the strings of the guitar, the sounds produced transported him into a world, so real and yet surreal, that he couldn't help but explore it further. Intrigued by this newfound passion, he was drawn towards the rich history of the guitar and its diverse use across different genres of music, from classical to rock, folk to modern pop. Alex's parents, witnessing this zealous interest in music, decided to encourage his talent by enrolling him in guitar lessons with a local tutor. The tutor, Mr. Hudson, was an accomplished musician who had a wealth of experience and knowledge about various musical instruments, especially the guitar. He was mesmerized by Alex's raw talent and helped him hone his skills, teaching him the intricacies of the renowned instrument. While embracing the journey of learning the guitar, the nuances of the strings and chords gradually unfolded to Alex. As he progressed, the agility of his fingers improved remarkably, creating harmonious melodies that left listeners spellbound. Not only did his technical prowess on the guitar develop, but his understanding of musical theory, composition, and songwriting grew exponentially as well. The passion for music built within him generated a sense of commitment that led to hours of practice each day, pushing his boundaries and testing the limits of his abilities. Playing and exploring various musical styles, from blues to jazz and beyond, Alex quickly became multifaceted in his guitar playing. One day, during a local open-mic event, Alex stepped onto the stage for the first time, with nerves tingling and heart pounding, taking his guitar as his only companion. As the crowd hushed, he began to play, transporting everyone to the magical and enchanting world he had discovered within the confines of his room. His performance, imbued with raw emotion and sheer talent, earned thunderous applause, affirming his potential as a musician. That moment marked the beginning of a journey that transformed Alex from a passionate hobbyist into a dedicated musician, no longer just dabbling in the world of music but now committing himself wholeheartedly. Collaborating with fellow musicians and forming a band, Alex continued to perform at various venues, garnering a loyal fan base that reveled in the soulful melodies he and his bandmates created. Over the years, the band experimented with different styles and sounds, creating a unique blend of music that resonated with their growing audience. As their popularity surged, they began receiving invitations to perform at music festivals across the country, gaining recognition within the industry. This newfound attention opened doors to record deals, allowing the band to release music that reached a wider audience and solidified their place in the music world. Despite the success and the life-altering journey, Alex never lost touch with the love for music that had initially drawn him to the guitar. He continued to approach his craft with the same passion and dedication, constantly pushing himself to learn and evolve as a musician. The simple act of picking up the guitar had unexpectedly led him down a path he never would have imagined, and yet, it had shaped his life in ways he could never have dreamed of. The game, a mere distraction when compared to the magical allure of the guitar, had remained untouched, as if it knew that it could never match the wonders that a gloriously-plucked melody could bring. The once modest ambition of just playing for fun had been replaced with the pursuit of a lifetime - an everlasting journey of passionate music creation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A: It was the third time that the Portuguese government had requested external financial aid from the IMF—the first occasion occurred in the late 1970s following the Carnation's Revolution.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: Yes, the answer provides insight into the number of times Portugal has requested external financial support, which is three times. Portugal requested assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the first time in the late 1970s after the Carnation Revolution, and the answer specifies that the most recent occasion was the third time the country sought help. To add further details, Portugal has experienced three significant instances when it required external financial support: 1. Late 1970s: After the Carnation Revolution of April 25, 1974, Portugal faced ongoing economic turmoil, which led to the first request for external assistance from the IMF in 1977. The country received loans amounting to 830 million, subsequently participating in several economic adjustment programs to improve its financial situation. 2. Late 1980s: The second instance occurred in the late 1980s when Portugal faced a balance of payment crisis and increasing deficits. The government again requested financial aid from the IMF, receiving the assistance in 1983, primarily due to its financial struggles and economic challenges. 3. Eurozone Crisis in 2011: The third and most recent request for external financial support came during the 2010-2011 European debt crisis. Like many European countries, Portugal experienced difficulties as the sovereign debt crisis grew. In April 2011, Portugal requested financial assistance from the European Union (EU) and the IMF. This resulted in a bailout package totaling €78 billion, comprising €52 billion from the EU and €26 billion from the IMF. Portugal subsequently underwent a strict austerity program to recover from its financial troubles. These three instances demonstrate the various times Portugal has reached out for external financial support to stabilize its economy and address critical financial challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"who is the first to study rituals from the passage\\"  Context: \\"Subsequent to these developments, Randall Collins (2004) formulated his interaction ritual theory by drawing on Durkheim's work on totemic rituals that was extended by Goffman (1964/2013; 1967) into everyday focused encounters. Based on interaction ritual theory, we experience different levels or intensities of emotional energy during face-to-face interactions. Emotional energy is considered to be a feeling of confidence to take action and a boldness that one experiences when they are charged up from the collective effervescence generated during group gatherings that reach high levels of intensity.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"Emile Durkheim. According to the context provided, Durkheim's work on totemic rituals marked the initial efforts to study rituals. His work was later extended by Erving Goffman, and subsequently utilized by Randall Collins, who formulated the interaction ritual theory. Durkheim was a pioneering sociologist whose studies form the foundation of the sociology of religion, focusing on the social influence on individual practices and beliefs including the study of rituals. However, it was Goffman and Collins who extended and applied this work specifically to everyday focused encounters and the concept of emotional energy during face-to-face interactions. Goffman discussed everyday routines and ordinary social interactions, shedding light on the importance of these common rituals in societal context, whereas Collins built on this to specifically examine the relationship between interaction, emotional energy, and collective effervescence generated during group gatherings. So, in the historical chronology of the study of rituals captured in this passage, Durkheim was indeed the first."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The aircraft carrier dramatically changed naval combat in World War II, because air power was becoming a significant factor in warfare. The advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. They had higher range and precision than naval guns, making them highly effective. The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940 when HMS Illustrious launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at their base in Taranto, signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers. World War II in the Pacific Ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. The 1941 Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of HMS Glorious by German battleships during the Norwegian campaign in 1940.\\"?

During the 1980s, there was increasing pressure on both the Polish and Soviet governments to release documents related to the massacre. Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky. On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by the Polish association Families of Katyń Victims, to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. A mass was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid. One mourner affixed a sign reading \\"NKVD\\" on the memorial, covering the word \\"Nazis\\" in the inscription such that it read \\"In memory of Polish officers killed by the NKVD in 1941.\\" Several visitors scaled the fence of a nearby KGB compound and left burning candles on the grounds.

It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: tilt up from bay to close up with moving traffic and pedestrians .","output":"The most important words in the sentence \\"tilt up from bay to close up with moving traffic and pedestrians\\" are: 1. Tilt up: These words describe the action that needs to be performed. \\"Tilt up\\" refers to a specific type of camera movement in which the camera angle is adjusted in an upward direction, capturing a vertical view of the scene. This action is commonly used in photography and videography to create a unique and artistic perspective, transition between scenes, or reveal aspects of the environment. 2. Bay: \\"Bay\\" describes the location from which the camera will perform the tilting action. A bay typically refers to a body of water partially enclosed by land, often with a wide opening to the sea or ocean. By mentioning \\"bay,\\" the sentence implies that the camera angle initially captures a view of the bay area, and then transitions to the close up of moving traffic and pedestrians. 3. Close up: Located after the tilting action, \\"close up\\" refers to the intended shot of the camera, presumably focusing on the more intricate details of the scene. A close-up shot is used in photography or film to emphasize specific elements, such as facial expressions, objects, or actions. In this sentence, \\"close up\\" suggests that the emphasis will shift from the bay to nearby moving traffic and pedestrians. 4. Moving traffic: \\"Moving traffic\\" indicates the subject matter to be captured within the close-up shot after the tilting action. This phrase implies that there is ongoing activity involving vehicles on streets or roads. By emphasizing the movement, the sentence suggests that dynamic aspects of the scene, such as the motion of cars, buses, or motorcycles, will be focused on in this visual portrayal. 5. Pedestrians: \\"Pedestrians\\" are also part of the close-up shot following the tilt-up action. These are people walking along streets, sidewalks, or other public spaces, co-existing with moving traffic. Including pedestrians in this sentence highlights the human aspect of the scene and adds a sense of everyday life and activity to the visual. In summary, the most important words in the sentence are \\"tilt up,\\" \\"bay,\\" \\"close up,\\" \\"moving traffic,\\" and \\"pedestrians,\\" as they respectively describe the core action, initial setting, intended focus, and primary subjects of the scene."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The story that follows is the narrative of a letter from Howard Graham, an American armaments engineer, to his wife Stephanie. While journeying to the Soviet port of Batumi to return to the United States to complete his business with the Turkish Navy, Graham and his wife stop in Istanbul and are met by Kopeikin, a Turkish employee of Graham's company, who under the pretense of discussing business, takes Graham to a nightclub to introduce him to dancer Josette Maretl and her partner Gogo. Banat tries unsuccessfully to kill Graham during a magic act, shooting the magician instead. Graham is brought to the headquarters of the Turkish secret police for questioning, where Colonel Haki blames the assassination attempt on German agents seeking to delay the re-arming of Turkish ships. The colonel shows Graham a photograph of Banat, who he says was hired by a Nazi agent named Muller. Haki then orders Graham to travel secretly to Batumi aboard a tramp steamer, while Haki personally oversees the safe overland transit of Stephanie.  Graham's fellow passengers include Josette and Gogo; Kuvetli, an ingratiating Turkish tobacco salesman; Professor Haller, an apolitical German archeologist; and the henpecked Matthews and his French wife. Josette sees that Graham is frightened, and not knowing that he is married, tries to become close to him. At an interim port call, Graham is made aware of the arrival of a new passenger by the annoying clamor of a gramophone, while Haller warns him that Kuvetli is not who he claims to be. At dinner Graham recognizes Banat and tries to persuade the ship's captain and purser to put him ashore, but they believe that he is crazy.

At the White House on Wednesday, Trump continued to speak cautiously about the coming summit, even while praising the North Korean leader for the prisoner release. “Everything can be scuttled,” Trump told reporters. “A lot of things can happen — a lot of good things can happen, [and] a lot of bad things can happen.” North Korea on Wednesday granted amnesty to three Americans of Korean descent. They had been accused of espionage or trying to overthrow the government, charges widely seen as bogus. Pyongyang has detained at least 16 Americans over the past two decades, often attempting to use them as bargaining chips. All were eventually released, although Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old college student, died shortly after returning to the United States last year. A White House statement Wednesday praised North Korea’s latest prisoner release as a “positive gesture of goodwill” ahead of the Trump-Kim summit, which is expected to take place as soon as next month. South Korea’s presidential office said Pyongyang’s decision was a “very positive” sign for a successful North Korea-U.S. meeting.  The freeing of the prisoners coincided with a visit to Pyongyang by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who declined to say whether the release was a U.S. precondition for holding talks with the North. “I don’t know the answer to that,” Pompeo told reporters on the flight home. “It would have been more difficult [had the prisoners not been released]. ... I’m glad that we don’t have to confront that.” It’s not clear what, if anything, the U.S. gave up in exchange for the prisoners. It’s not even clear a concession was needed, since North Korea has for decades sought the presumed legitimacy provided by a summit with a sitting U.S. president. after the story ends does Pyongyang take more prisoners? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - Probably Pyongyang only takes 1 or 2 more prisoners - Probably Pyongyang stops taking prisoners - Probably Pyongyang continues to take many prisoners - not enough information Answer:","output":"- not enough information"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We should have arrived at Liverpool at 9:19, but due to a typical London fog, the train had to move along so slowly that it was not until 10:30 that it got there. In spite of our late arrival, Joan, my wife's sister, decided that she would go to see the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London while we went shopping. It was only after her sister had disappeared into the fog that my wife realized that we hadn't decided where we should meet for lunch. Since I had our three tickets for the concert in my pocket, this was indeed a problem. There seemed to be nothing we could do except taking a taxi to the Tower of London, and try to find her there. Needless to say, we didn't find her. It was now one o'clock, and the concert began at 2:30. \\"Perhaps she will think of waiting outside the concert hall,\\" suggested my wife hopefully. By this time the fog was so thick that road traffic had to stop, and the only way to get there was by underground railway. Hand in hand we felt our way along the road to where we thought the nearest station should be. An hour later we were still trying to find it. Just as I was about to lose my temper completely when we met a blind man tapping his way confidently through the fog. With his help we found Tower Hill tube station just fifty yards down the road. By now it was far too late even to try to get to the concert hall before the performance began at 2:30, so we decided to return to Cambridge. It took seven long hours instead of the usual two to make that journey. Nor were we able to get any food and drink on the train. Tired and hungry we finally reached home at ten, opening the door to the sound of the telephone bell.

Answer:","output":"This review depicts the product, \\"Steal this Book\\" by Abbie Hoffman, in an unflattering light. The reviewer expresses disappointment and a sense of depression after the initial novelty of owning the book wore off. The main criticism stems from the belief that the content is outdated and not applicable to today's context. The reviewer begins by using a somewhat sarcastic tone when mentioning that the book is \\"Carried by wannabe-Anarchists everywhere.\\" This statement implies that the individuals who carry this book around may be trying to project an image of rebellion or activism, but they may not be genuinely invested in the ideologies that the book promotes. The primary disappointment expressed in the review is that the content of the book is outdated. The reviewer acknowledges that \\"Steal this Book\\" might have been helpful when it was first published in 1971, but it is not practical or useful in the present day. However, it is important to note that this criticism is based on the reviewer's opinion, and others may have different perspectives on the book's relevance in modern times.  Moreover, the reviewer's dissatisfaction is exacerbated by the fact that they cannot use \\"hardly any of the stuff\\" written about in the book. This further emphasizes that the book does not meet their expectations, and consequently, they consider it a disappointment. In summary, the review portrays \\"Steal this Book\\" in an unflattering light due to the belief that the content is outdated and not applicable in today's society. The reviewer also seems to imply that owning the book may be more about projecting an image rather than the act of genuinely embracing the ideas it presents.

I loved so much about this movie...the time taken to develop the characters, the attention to detail, the superb performances, the stunning lighting and cinematography, the wonderful soundtrack... It has a combined intensity and lightness of touch that won't work for anyone who wants the typical fast-paced action flick. If we lived in Elizabethan days, I'd say this movie's a bit like a Shakespearean tragedy. But since we don't, let's say it's more like a Drama-Suspense movie. The plot is simple, but the story is complex. The movie is intelligent in the way relationships and issues are explored. Much of the story is shown rather than told, which I find makes it more subtle and moving - and which also works well for a story based on a comic book (or graphic novel). At times I felt I was actually there in the 1930s, part of this story - there was such a realistic yet dream-like quality in the style of its telling. I don't often prefer movies to the books they were based upon, but in this case I do. (Though I did enjoy the book too.) I've bought the DVD, which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insightful commentary. (I also took my little cousin, who's a little younger than the boy in the movie, to see it after I saw it for the first time, because he has issues at home and I wanted to use this as a way of starting a discussion on father-son issues with him.

Bolivia, officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia (), is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range.  The largest city and principal economic and financial center is Santa Cruz de la Sierra, located on the Llanos Orientales (Tropical lowlands) mostly flat region in the East of Bolivia. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is Paraguay) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Bolivia is geographically the largest landlocked country in the Americas, but remains a relatively small country in economic and military terms.  Before Spanish colonization, the Andean region of Bolivia was part of the Inca Empire, while the northern and eastern lowlands were inhabited by independent tribes. Spanish \\"conquistadors\\" arriving from Cuzco and Asunción took control of the region in the 16th century. During the Spanish colonial period Bolivia was administered by the Royal Audiencia of Charcas. Spain built its empire in great part upon the silver that was extracted from Bolivia's mines.  After the first call for independence in 1809, 16 years of war followed before the establishment of the Republic, named for Simón Bolívar, on 6 August 1825. Since independence, Bolivia has endured periods of political and economic instability, including the loss of various peripheral territories to its neighbors, such as Acre and parts of the Gran Chaco. It has been landlocked since the annexation of its Pacific coast territory by Chile following the War of the Pacific (1879–84), but agreements with neighboring countries have granted it indirect access to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

Context: Coming off their easy home win over the Bears, the Vikings flew to the desert for a Week 13 Sunday Night duel with the defending NFC champion Arizona Cardinals. In the first quarter, Minnesota got on the board with quarterback Brett Favre completing a 3-yard TD pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe. It was originally ruled an incomplete pass as Shiancoe stepped out of bounds, but Minnesota challenged and won based on the fact that Shiancoe had both feet in bounds and the referee counted Shiancoe's third step, thereby making the original ruling on the field to be overturned. The Cardinals then responded with quarterback Kurt Warner finding wide receiver Anquan Boldin on a 2-yard TD pass. In the second quarter, Arizona took the lead with Warner finding Boldin again on a 39-yard TD pass. The Vikings responded with kicker Ryan Longwell nailing a 25-yard field goal. However, the Cardinals took the lead at halftime when Warner completed a 34-yard TD pass to wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald. In the third quarter, Arizona increased their lead when kicker Neil Rackers kicked field goals of 31 and 30 yards. In the fourth quarter, Arizona kicker Neil Rackers nailed a 29-yard field goal. However, the Vikings tried to rally with Favre hooking up with rookie wide receiver Percy Harvin on a 31-yard TD pass. The Vikings tried an onside kick, which they did not recover and Arizona ran out the clock to seal their win. With only their second loss of the season, the Vikings not only fell to 10-2, but they lost starting linebacker E. J. Henderson to a season-ending broken leg. Question: How many yards was the differential between the longest touchdown and the longest field goal? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, we need to find the longest touchdown and the longest field goal in the game and then subtract the length of the longest field goal from the longest touchdown. Longest touchdown: Kurt Warner's 39-yard TD pass to Anquan Boldin. Longest field goal: Ryan Longwell's 25-yard field goal. Now, we subtract the two numbers: 39 (longest touchdown) - 25 (longest field goal) = 14 yards So, the difference between the longest touchdown and the longest field goal is 14 yards."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Einstein's brain had extraordinary folding patterns in several regions, which may help explain his genius, newly uncovered photographs suggest.      The photographs, published Nov. 16 in the journal Brain, reveal that the brilliant physicist had extra folding in his brain's gray matter, the site of conscious thinking. In particular, the frontal lobes, regions tied to abstract thought and planning, had unusually elaborate folding, analysis suggests.      \\"It's a really sophisticated part of the human brain,\\" said Dean Falk, study co-author and an anthropologist at Florida State University, referring to gray matter. \\"And [Einstein's] is extraordinary.\\"      Snapshots of a genius      Albert Einstein was the most famous physicist of the 20th century; his groundbreaking theory of general relativity explained how light curves due to the warping of space-time.      When the scientist died in 1955 at age 76, Thomas Harvey, the pathologist who autopsied him, took out Einstein's brain and kept it. Harvey sliced hundreds of thin sections of brain tissue to place on microscope slides and also snapped 14 photos of the brain from several angles.      Harvey presented some of the slides, but kept the photos secret in order to write a book about the physicist's brain.      The pathologist died before finishing his book, however, and the photos remained hidden for decades. But in 2010, after striking up a friendship with one of the new study's co-authors, Harvey's family donated the photos to the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Washington, D.C. Falk's team began analyzing the photos in 2011. [See Photos of Einstein's Brain]      More brainy connections      The team found that, overall, Eintsein's brain had much more complicated folding across the cerebral cortex, which is the gray matter on the surface of the brain responsible for conscious thought. In general, thicker gray matter is tied to higher IQs.      Many scientists believe that more folds can create extra surface area for mental processing, allowing more connections between brain cells, Falk said. With more connections between distant parts of the brain, one would be able to make, in a sense, mental leaps, drawing upon these faraway brain cells to solve some cognitive problem.      The prefrontal cortex, which plays a key role in abstract thought, making predictions and planning, also had an unusually elaborate folding pattern in Einstein's brain.      That may have helped the physicist develop the theory of relativity. \\"He did thought experiments where he'd imagine himself riding alongside a beam of light, and this is exactly the part of the brain one would expect to be very active\\" in such thought experiments, Falk told LiveScience.      In addition, Einstein's occipital lobes, which perform visual processing, showed extra folds and creases.      The right and left parietal lobes also looked very asymmetrical, Falk said. It's not clear how those features contributed to Einstein's genius, but that brain region is key for spatial tasks and mathematical reasoning, Falk said.      The jury is still out on whether Einstein's brain was extraordinary from birth or whether years of pondering physics made it special.      Falk believes both played a role.      \\"It was both nature and nurture,\\" she said. \\"He was born with a very good brain, and he had the kinds of experiences that allowed him to develop the potential he had.\\"      But most of Einstein's raw ability probably came from a trick of nature rather than a lifetime of hard work, said Sandra Witelson, a researcher at McMaster University who has done past studies of Einstein's brain. In 1999, her work revealed that Einstein's right parietal lobe had an extra fold, something that was either hardwired into his genes or happened while Einstein was still in the womb.      \\"It's not just that it's bigger or smaller, it's that the actual pattern is different,\\" Witselson said. \\"His anatomy is unique compared to every other photograph or drawing of a human brain that has ever been recorded.\\"      Follow LiveScience on Twitter @livescience.

(AP) — For much of the past three decades, pit bulls have been widely regarded as America's most dangerous dog — the favorite breed of thugs, drug dealers and dog-fighting rings, with a fearsome reputation for unprovoked, sometimes deadly attacks.      Hostility toward \\"pits\\" grew so intense that some cities began treating them as the canine equivalent of assault rifles and prohibited residents from owning them.      But attitudes have softened considerably since then as animal activists and even television shows cast the dogs in a more positive light. The image makeover has prompted many states to pass new laws that forbid communities from banning specific breeds. And it illustrates the power and persistence of dog-advocacy groups that have worked to fend off pit bull restrictions with much the same zeal as gun-rights groups have defeated gun-control measures.      \\"Lawmakers are realizing that targeting dogs based on their breed or what they look like is not a solution to dealing with dangerous dogs,\\" said Lisa Peterson, a spokeswoman for the American Kennel Club.      Seventeen states now have laws that prohibit communities from adopting breed-specific bans. Lawmakers in six more states are considering similar measures, and some cities are reviewing local policies that classify pit bulls as dangerous animals.      Pit bull advocates hail the changes as recognition that breed-specific laws discriminate against dogs that are not inherently aggressive or dangerous unless they are made to be that way by irresponsible owners.      The dogs' foes complain that their message is being drowned out by a well-funded, well-organized lobbying effort in state capitols. The debate puts millions of pit bull owners up against a relatively small number of people who have been victimized by the dogs.      Ron Hicks, who sponsored a bill in the Missouri House to forbid breed-specific legislation, said he was surprised when nobody spoke against his proposal last month at a committee hearing.      \\"I figured a few parents would be there who would bring tears to my eyes,\\" the Republican said. \\"Would it have changed my opinion or what I believe in? No.\\"      A version of Hicks' legislation was endorsed by a House committee last month and needs to clear another committee before a full House vote. The state Senate is considering a comparable bill, as are lawmakers in Utah, South Dakota, Washington, Vermont and Maryland.      In Kansas, the communities of Bonner Springs and Garden City repealed their pit-bull bans earlier this year.      Summer Freeman did not know there was a ban when she moved to Bonner Springs last year after a divorce. She panicked when an animal-control officer discovered her pet and told her she had 15 days to get rid of the dog named Titan or move out of town.      \\"I think of him like my son,\\" she said. \\"He's my dog-son, I guess you could say. He's at my hip all the time. He's just a big baby that wouldn't hurt a fly.\\"      Freeman was forced to leave Titan at a shelter in Lawrence for nine months until she successfully fought to overturn the law in January.      For dog owners and pit bull opponents alike, the battle is as deeply personal as any gun-control or religious issue. Each side accuses the other of lying, exploiting emotions and using bullying tactics.      Pit bull owners insist their dogs are harmless, loving family members that shouldn't be blamed for something they didn't do. To opponents, they are a volatile breed whose genetics drive them to kill more than two dozen people in the U.S. each year, many of them young children.      Popular television shows such as \\"Pit Boss\\" and \\"Pit Bulls and Parolees\\" on Animal Planet glorify the animals and minimize the tragedies that occur when pit bulls turn on humans, pit bull opponents say.      \\"Everything is telling us these animals are safe if you raise them right,\\" said Jeff Borchardt, an East Troy, Wis., man whose 14-month-old son was mauled to death a year ago by two pit bulls that tore the child from the arms of their owner, who was baby-sitting. \\"My son's dead because of a lie, because of a myth. My life will never be the same.\\"      The two dogs that killed Borchardt's son had lived with their owner since soon after they were born, were well-cared for and had no history of aggressive behavior, he said. Both had been spayed or neutered.      That contradicts the contention that only mistreated, neglected or abused pit bulls attack people.      Colleen Lynn, founder of DogsBite.org, pointed to a friend-of-the-court brief her organization submitted in a 2012 case in which the Maryland Court of Appeals declared pit bulls \\"inherently dangerous.\\"      \\"Appellate courts agree with us. Doctors and surgeons agree with us. That is credibility right there,\\" Lynn said. \\"We also have the support of three divisions of the U.S. military, huge, massive bodies in the U.S. government.\\"      The Marines, Army and Air Force all have banned dangerous dogs — including pit bulls and rottweilers — from their bases because of the \\"unreasonable risk\\" they pose to safety, Lynn said.      On the other side stand the American Bar Association and National Animal Control Association, which oppose breed-specific laws because they are discriminatory against a type of dog that isn't really a single breed.      Three main breeds — Staffordshire bull terrier, American pit bull terrier and American Staffordshire terrier — along with mixes of those breeds are generally considered pit bulls. But many muscular, square-jawed, boxer-type dogs often are misidentified as pit bulls, making breed-specific bans hard to enforce.      And because fatal pit bull attacks are a rarity compared with other causes of death such as auto accidents, dog advocates argue that breed-specific bans amount to legislative overkill.      \\"All communities deserve comprehensive dog laws that demand responsible dog ownership and that hold reckless owners accountable when their poor decisions wind up getting other dogs or other people hurt,\\" said Ledy Vankavage, a top lobbyist for the Best Friends Animal Society.      Don Bauermeister, assistant city attorney for Council Bluffs, Iowa, led the effort to pass a local pit bull ban that took effect in 2005. He recalled first reading about the issue in the July 27, 1987, issue of Sports Illustrated, which carried a full-cover shot of an angry pit bull baring its teeth. Across the top, it said \\"BEWARE OF THIS DOG.\\"      After the Council Bluffs ban went into place, the number of pit bull attacks that resulted in hospitalization plummeted from 29 in 2004 to zero the past few years — proof, Bauermeister said, that breed-specific bans work.      The opposition to pit bull bans, he added, is a sign that many American pet owners have lost touch with reality.      \\"Fifty years ago, you could take a sick animal behind a barn and put it out of its misery,\\" he said. \\"That's just the way it was done. Now they would investigate you for doing that. The emotional irrationality of Americans and their dogs has never been worse than it is today.\\" ||||| 1. WHAT IS BREED-SPECIFIC LEGISLATION?      2. WHAT BREEDS OF DOGS HAVE BEEN TARGETED BY BSL?      3. WHAT POSITION DO LEGAL, ANIMAL-RELATED, AND NON-ANIMAL RELATED ORGANIZATIONS TAKE ON BSL?      4. AREN'T CERTAIN BREEDS OF DOGS MORE LIKELY TO INJURE OR BITE THAN OTHERS?      5. DOES BSL REDUCE DOG BITES?      6. HOW COSTLY IS IT TO IMPLEMENT AND ENFORCE BSL?      7. WHAT IS THE TREND IN BSL?      8. WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO REDUCE DOG BITE-RELATED INCIDENTS IN A COMMUNITY?      Q: What is breed-specific legislation?                  A: Breed-specific legislation (BSL), also referred to as breed-discriminatory legislation (BDL), is a law or ordinance that prohibits or restricts the keeping of dogs of specific breeds, dogs presumed to be specific breeds, mixes of specific breeds, and/or dogs presumed to be mixes of one or more of those breeds. The most drastic form of BSL is a complete ban; but BSL also includes any laws or governmental regulations that impose separate requirements or limitations, including but not limited to: mandatory spay-neuter, mandatory muzzling, liability insurance requirements, special licensing and additional fees, mandatory microchipping or tattoos, owner / walker age requirements, property posting requirements, confinement and leash requirements, breed-specific pet limits, sale or transfer notification requirements, restrictions on access to certain public spaces with the dog [e.g.: public parks, school grounds], required town-issued items [e.g.: fluorescent collar; vest], training requirements, requirement that photos of the dog and/or owner be kept on town file. BSL, in all of its forms, results in the destruction of many pet dogs.                  Q: What breeds of dogs have been targeted by BSL?                  A: Various breeds have been or currently are targeted by BSL. Until the law was repealed in 2009, Italy regulated the keeping of 17 breeds. In the United States, jurisdictions have either banned or put discriminatory restrictions on one or all of the following: Akita, “Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldogs”, Alaskan Malamute, “American Bandogge”, American Bulldog, American Staffordshire Terrier, American Pit Bull Terrier, Belgian Malinois, Bullmastiff, Bull Terrier, Cane Corso, Chihuahua, Chow Chow, Dalmatian, Doberman Pinscher, Dogo Argentino, “Fila Brasileiro”, German Shepherd Dog, Miniature Bull Terrier, Neapolitan Mastiff, \\"Pit bull\\" (please note that \\"pit bull\\" is not a breed of dog), Perro de Presa Canario, Rottweiler, Shar Pei, Siberian Husky, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, “Tosa Inu”, and wolf-hybrids. These ordinances also target dogs suspected of being mixes of one or more of the named breeds.                  Q: What position do legal, animal-related, and non-animal related organizations take on BSL?      A: All of the following organizations do not endorse BSL:      American Animal Hospital Association, American Bar Association, American Dog Owner's Association, American Humane Association, American Kennel Club, American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, American Veterinary Medical Association, American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior, Association of Pet Dog Trainers, Australian Veterinary Association, Best Friends Animal Society, British Veterinary Association, Canadian Kennel Club, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Federation of Veterinarians in Europe, Humane Society of the United States, International Association of Canine Professionals, National Animal Control Association, National Animal Interest Alliance, National Association of Obedience Instructors, Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (UK & Australia), United Kennel Club, and the White House Administration. In addition, many state and local-level veterinary medical associations and humane organizations oppose BSL.                  Q: Aren't certain breeds of dogs more likely to injure or bite than others?                  A: There is no evidence from the controlled study of dog bites that one kind of dog is more likely to bite a human being than another kind of dog. A recent AVMA survey covering 40 years and two continents concluded that no group of dogs should be considered disproportionately dangerous.[1] Additionally, in a recent multifactorial study published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association on the exceptionally rare events of dog bite-related fatalities, the researchers identified a striking co-occurrence of multiple, controllable factors in these cases.[2] Breed was not identified as a factor.      Q: Does BSL reduce dog bites?                  A: No. BSL has not succeeded in reducing dog bite-related injuries wherever in the world it has been enacted.                  • An analysis published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association explains one reason that BSL could not be expected to work even if particular breeds could be identified as high risk. The authors calculated the absurdly large numbers of dogs of targeted breeds who would have to be completely removed from a community in order to prevent even one serious dog bite-related injury. For example, in order to prevent a single hospitalization resulting from a dog bite, the authors calculate that a city or town would have to remove more than 100,000 dogs of a targeted group. To prevent a second hospitalization, double that number. [3]            • Denver, CO enacted a breed-specific ban in 1989. Citizens of Denver continue to suffer a higher rate of hospitalization from dog bite-related injuries after the ban, than the citizens of breed-neutral Colorado counties. [4]                  A study published in the Journal of Veterinary Behavior , compared medically treated dog bites in Aragon, Spain for 5 years prior to and following enactment of Spain’s “Law on the legal treatment of the possession of dangerous animals” (sometimes referred to Spain’s Dangerous Animal Act) (2000). The results showed no significant effect in dog bite incidences when comparing before and after enactment of the BSL. [5]            • The Netherlands repealed a 15-year-old breed ban in 2008 after commissioning a study of its effectiveness. The study revealed that BSL was not a successful dog-bite mitigation strategy because it had not resulted in a decrease in dog bites. [6]            • The Province of Ontario in Canada enacted a breed ban in 2005. In 2010, based on a survey of municipalities across the Province, the Toronto Humane Society reported that, despite five years of BSL and the destruction of \\"countless\\" dogs, there had been no significant decrease in the number of dog bites. [7] ||||| In the 13-year period of 2005 through 2017, canines killed 433 Americans. Pit bulls contributed to 66% (284) of these deaths. Combined, pit bulls and rottweilers contributed to 76% of the total recorded deaths. | More » ||||| Why Breed-Specific Legislation Doesn’t Work      Targeting types or breeds of dogs won't stop dog bites or protect people      The HSUS opposes laws and ordinances aimed at forbidding or regulating dog ownership based solely on breed or type of dog. Breed-specific legislation (BSL) does not enhance public safety or reduce dog bite incidents. Rather, such laws, regulations, and ordinances are costly to enforce and harm families, dogs, and communities.      The HSUS supports finding real and effective strategies for safe, humane community dog management and believes BSL is a distraction from that goal—it wastes valuable resources and charges a moral cost in the process.      Missing the scope of the problem      Most breed-specific laws are created as a misguided response to a dog bite incident or attack. There are a number of reasons BSL does not protect citizens from dog bites, including:      There is no credible evidence to demonstrate that any particular breed or type is overrepresented among biting dogs. Professional animal expert organizations, including the American Veterinary Medical Association, have found that no breed is more dangerous than another.      to demonstrate that any particular breed or type is overrepresented among biting dogs. Professional animal expert organizations, including the American Veterinary Medical Association, have found that no breed is more dangerous than another. Identifying breeds is often subjective and unreliable . For example, the term “pit bull” usually encompasses three separate breeds, along with any mixes of those breeds. Any medium-sized dog with short hair and a squarish muzzle could meet most people’s visual perception of a “pit bull” dog—including hound mixes, retriever mixes, and other dogs with no “pit bull” ancestry. Clearly, the larger the dog, the greater the potential damage if he or she bites, but no one breed or type is more genetically programmed to bite than others.      .

As a result, there’s no scientific data that proves breed-specific measures have ever been effective at eliminating dog bites.      .

As a result, there’s no scientific data that proves breed-specific measures have ever been effective at eliminating dog bites. Underfunded animal-control agencies bear the brunt of the burden, as BSL creates unrealistic mandates that take dogs out of homes and into shelters. These shelters then must endure the burden of housing—and often euthanizing—family dogs who posed no bite risk.      Understanding the real risk factors      Though breed or type don't affect a dog’s behavior, there are a variety of other factors and influences that do, including:      The dog’s hormones .

No two dogs will ever react exactly the same way to a given circumstance. The person’s ability to recognize warning signs. Dogs who bite usually give some kind of warning, whether subtle or overt. If people ignore or misunderstand such warnings, dogs may feel the need or urge to bite.      Developing a proactive solution      Our society coexists with almost 80 million dogs—living in 40% of American households—so it’s vital that communities have preventative, effective dog-bite solutions that are backed by stakeholders and lawmakers. Such solutions involve understanding the real risk factors for bites, helping minimize those risk factors, and ensuring that bites are handled effectively and uniformly to eliminate future risk.      Dog bite incidents will decline when all dog owners are given access to critical services such as veterinary care, spaying and neutering resources, training and behavior assistance, and other socialization and health information. Proactive strategies aimed at preventing bites from happening in the first place—paired with appropriate enforcement-based responses to bite incidents—create a safer, more humane approach to managing dogs in communities. ||||| Official The White House Response to Ban and outlaw Breed Specific Legislation (BSL) in the United States of America on a Federal level!      Breed-Specific Legislation Is a Bad Idea      Thanks for your petition.      We don't support breed-specific legislation -- research shows that bans on certain types of dogs are largely ineffective and often a waste of public resources.      In 2000, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at twenty years of data about dog bites and human fatalities in the United States. They found that fatal attacks represent a very small proportion of dog bite injuries to people and that it's virtually impossible to calculate bite rates for specific breeds.      The CDC also noted that the types of people who look to exploit dogs aren't deterred by breed regulations -- when their communities establish a ban, these people just seek out new, unregulated breeds. And the simple fact is that dogs of any breed can become dangerous when they're intentionally or unintentionally raised to be aggressive.      For all those reasons, the CDC officially recommends against breed-specific legislation -- which they call inappropriate. You can read more from them here.      As an alternative to breed-specific policies, the CDC recommends a community-based approach to prevent dog bites. And ultimately, we think that's a much more promising way to build stronger communities of pets and pet owners.      Tell us what you think about this response and We the People. ||||| Janelle Holland rescued her pit bull Triumph (she calls him \\"T-Diddy\\") nine years ago. He was found at age 2 and had been used as a fighting dog before Janelle got him. Janelle says the dog is great with people and very friendly. (Photo: Steve Hebert for USA TODAY)      Three decades after officials in more than 700 cities throughout the country began passing bans and other restrictions to keep pit bulls out of their communities, state and local governments are increasingly reconsidering their approach to what not so long ago was America's most vilified pet.      Since June, at least nine communities in the Midwest have overturned pit bull bans that were on the books. Last week, Hallsville, Mo., became the latest to lift its ban after a family successfully appealed to the City Council for a change in law when it learned the family dog was a pit bull mix.      Over the past two years, more than 100 municipalities across the USA have overturned bans and other restrictions that target dogs in the pit bull family, the generic term commonly used to describe the American pit bull terrier, Staffordshire bull terrier and many mixed-breed dogs with square-shaped heads and bulky builds.      More communities could soon follow suit.      The unified government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kan., is considering lifting a pit bull ban that has been on the books for nearly a quarter-century, as part of a comprehensive overhaul of its animal control policies.      The push in Kansas City (pop. 148,000) comes as Roeland Park, Kan. (pop. 6,800) recently began reviewing its ban on pit bulls. The nearby community of Bonner Springs announced this year that it was lifting its ban.      Advocates argue the bans have been ineffective in reducing dog bites and led to millions of dogs being euthanized. They say too often animal control officials, law enforcement and the media misidentify offending dogs as pit bulls.      \\"The only ones that are being affected by these bans are responsible dog owners,\\" said Janelle Holland, a pit bull owner who was forced to leave Roeland Park more than a decade ago after learning she was violating the ban.      There's been action on the statewide level as well.      This year, South Dakota and Utah joined 17 other states in passing laws to prevent local governments passing \\"breed-specific legislation,\\" or BSL, making it illegal for cities to pass bans targeting pit bulls or any other breed. (The South Dakota law went into effect in July, and Utah's prohibition on pit bull bans will be law on New Year's Day.)      Breed-specific legislation began spreading in communities throughout the country in the mid-1980s after a surge in fatal dog bitings, including a disproportionate number of incidents initially attributed to pit bull-type dogs.      The pit bull was popular in illegal dogfighting rings, and the breed developed a reputation as a favorite accessory of drug dealers and gangsters.      This month, residents in the Denver suburb of Aurora, Colo., voted by a 2-to-1 ratio in a referendum to keep their pit bull ban on the books. The Aurora vote follows a vote in 2012 in Miami-Dade County, where voters opted to keep the ban by a similarly wide ratio.      Fourteen-month-old Daxton Borchardt was fatally mauled last year by two pit bulls. (Photo: Jeff Borchardt)      Jeff Borchardt, an East Troy, Wis.-man whose 14-month-old son, Daxton, was fatally mauled last year by two pit bulls while being cared for by a babysitter, says government leaders should look to the Aurora and Miami examples before overturning bans.      \\"There's this pro-pit-bull movement that tries to paint these dogs as nanny dogs and sweet, lovely and kind,\\" Borchardt said. \\"It's disgusting, it's dangerous, and it's irresponsible.\\"      Some groups, including the American Veterinary Medical Association, the Humane Society and the American Bar Association, have suggested governments would be better off focusing attention on problem animals in a community rather than banning any particular breed of dog.      The push to end pit bull bans got a boost last year, when the Obama administration — in response to opponents of such laws petitioning the White House — said it was opposed to breed-specific legislation.      Stakeholders on opposite sides of the issue cast aspersions about the evidence the others use to back their arguments. A lack of recent government or third-party data on pit bull bites further muddies the national conversation.      The National Canine Research Council, which opposes breed-specific legislation, points to a 2013 study it partly funded that suggests a dog's environment has more to do than its breed with the likelihood of a dog making a deadly attack.      The study, published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, of 256 dog bite-related fatalities from 2000-2009 found co-occurring factors in more than 80% of the deadly incidents, such as the absence of an able-bodied person to stop the attack, a history of abuse or neglect of the dog and the failure by owners to neuter the dogs.      \\"It's becoming more and more obvious that breed-specific legislation doesn't improve public safety,\\" says Janis Bradley, director of communication for the NCRC. \\"Its purpose is to reduce injuries from dog bites, but there is no municipality or state where it's enacted where they've been able to show that it's accomplished this.\\"      The Center for Disease Control, which opposes BSL, notes that fatal attacks represent a tiny fraction of about 4.7 million dog bites Americans suffer annually and that it's difficult to accurately calculate bite rates for specific breeds.      DogsBite.org, a group that advocates in favor of BSL, points to its own research, culled from news reports of dog-bite-related fatalities, that shows 74% of incidents from 2005 to 2013 involved a pit bull or Rottweiler.      Colleen Lynn, founder of DogsBite.org, dismisses the suggestion from the CDC and others that BSL doesn't work.      \\"It's not designed to reduce all dog bites,\\" said Lynn, who said pit bulls are an inherently aggressive animal. \\"It's breed-specific and meant to reduce pit bull maulings and fatalities.\\"      Even as dozens of American communities abandon BSL, some ponder its merits.      This year, Riverside, Ala., a community about 40 miles outside of Birmingham, weighed enacting a pit bull ban after a 5-year-old boy was fatally mauled by neighbor's pit bull. City officials opted against it.      Mayor Rusty Jessup said he would prefer not to have any pit bulls in his community of 3,000. Jessup said he didn't think his community could enforce such a ban or even positively determine the breeds of dogs.      \\"We were just afraid that we were going to get situations where we're trying to enforce this and people are saying, 'That dog's not a pit bull, it's a boxer,'\\" Jessup said. \\" And doggone it, who are we going to have to make that determination?\\"      Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1uHILDO ||||| AURORA | By a 2-to-1 margin, Aurora voters say they don’t want pit bulls to return to the city, based on early returns.      With more than 70,000 votes counted across Adams and Arapahoe counties so far, voters have overwhelmingly said no to Aurora ballot question 2D, which would lift the city’s 9-year-old ban on the dogs.      In Arapahoe County, 68 percent of voters said no. In Adams County, 63 percent voted against lifting the ban.      The issue has been extremely contentious for years in Aurora, but especially since the city council pitched the question to voters. The issue has drawn national attention, from both critics and proponents of the ban.      Colleen Lynn, a supporter of breed bans and founder of the group dogsbite.org, said she was happy with the outcome in Aurora, but a bit surprised by the margin of victory for the ban.      “I didn’t expect it to be this big,” she said.      Lynn said that while pit bull supporters are often very public and vocal in their support for the breed, there are many people who oppose the breed but don’t want to speak publicly about it.      “We believe that the majority of Americans do not want to live next door to a pit bull period. And that is usually a very silent majority,” she said.      Lynn said that’s why her group supports ballot measures like Aurora, because they give people a chance to privately voice their concerns about the animals.      Under the city’s current rules, three breeds of dogs commonly recognized as pit bulls — American pit bull terriers, American Staffordshire terriers and Staffordshire bull terriers — are banned within the city limits. When city council first enacted the ban in 2005, there were 10 breeds barred from the city, but council in 2011 softened the ban to just three breeds and gave owners a chance to have their dog DNA-tested to prove whether they were in fact a banned breed.      Dogs who were already in the city at the time of the ban were allowed to stay if their owners paid a registration fee and followed certain restrictions.      According to the city’s numbers, about 90 registered pit bulls remain in the city, down from about 500 when the ban took effect. The city has euthanized more than 1,100 restricted-breed dogs since the ban.      Opponents of the ban have argued that the law should focus on irresponsible dog owners as opposed to specific breeds.      But supporters of banning the dogs, which include the city’s Animal Care Division, have said pit bulls are more dangerous than other breeds and should be barred from Aurora. Plus, opponents say, because Denver and other cities have similar bans, Aurora would become a dumping ground for dogs barred from other cities. ||||| Breed-specific legislation (BSL) targets specific breeds of dogs that are wrongly thought to all be dangerous – most frequently \\"pit bull types\\" – and places stricter regulations on these dogs or even makes ownership of them illegal. Several cities, towns and states across the United States and Canada have adopted breed-specific measures in an attempt to prevent dog bites in their communities. However, while BSL may look good on the surface, it is not a reliable or effective solution for dog bite prevention.      The AVMA is opposed to breed-specific legislation.      Any dog can bite      According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), more than 4.5 million people in the United States are bitten by dogs each year, and more than 800,000 receive medical attention for dog bites, with at least half of them being children. It is no exaggeration to say that dog bites pose a significant health risk to our communities and society.      The issue of dangerous dogs, dog bites and public safety is a complex one. Any dog can bite, regardless of its breed. It is the dog's individual history, behavior, general size, number of dogs involved, and the vulnerability of the person bitten that determines the likelihood of biting and whether a dog will cause a serious bite injury. Breed-specific bans are a simplistic answer to a far more complex social problem, and they have the potential to divert attention and resources from more effective approaches.      The problem with breed-specific legislation      AVMA's Policy on Dangerous Animal Legislation states: \\"The AVMA supports dangerous animal legislation by state, county, or municipal governments provided that legislation does not refer to specific breeds or classes of animals. This legislation should be directed at fostering safety and protection of the general public from animals classified as dangerous.\\"      There are several reasons why breed-specific bans and restrictions are not a responsible approach to dog bite prevention:      Breed-specific laws can be difficult to enforce, especially when a dog's breed can't easily be determined or if it is of mixed breed.      Frequently, breed-specific legislation focuses on dogs with a certain appearance or physical characteristics, instead of an actual breed. \\"Pit bulls\\" are the most frequent targets of breed-specific legislation despite being a general type rather than a breed; other breeds also are sometimes banned, including Rottweilers, Dobermans and boxers. However, it is extremely difficult to determine a dog's breed or breed mix simply by looking at it. A study conducted by Maddie's Fund, a national shelter initiative, showed that even people very familiar with dog breeds cannot reliably determine the primary breed of a mutt, and dogs often are incorrectly classified as \\"pit bulls\\". Because identification of a dog's breed with certainty is prohibitively difficult, breed-specific laws are inherently vague and very difficult to enforce.      Breed-specific legislation is discriminatory against responsible owners and their dogs.      By generalizing the behaviors of dogs that look a certain way, innocent dogs and pet owners suffer. BSL can lead to the euthanasia of innocent dogs that fit a certain \\"look,\\" and to responsible pet owners being forced to move or give up dogs that have never bitten or threatened to bite. Furthermore, dogs that are considered to be of a \\"dangerous breed\\" may already be serving the community in positions such as police work, military operations, rescue purposes, and as service animals. Contrary to being a liability, these animals are assets to society; however they, too, suffer due to misinformation and breed-based stereotypes.      Breed bans do not address the social issue of irresponsible pet ownership.      Dogs are more likely to become aggressive when they are unsupervised, unneutered, and not socially conditioned to live closely with people or other dogs. Banning a specific breed can give a community a false sense of security, and deemphasize to owners of other breeds the importance of appropriate socialization and training, which is a critical part of responsible pet ownership. In enacting breed-specific legislation, cities and states will spend money trying to enforce ineffective bans and restrictions rather than implementing proven solutions, such as licensing and leash laws, and responding proactively to owners of any dog that poses a risk to the community.      It is not possible to calculate a bite rate for a breed or to compare rates between breeds because the data reported is often unreliable. This is because:      The breed of a biting dog is often not known or is reported inaccurately. The actual number of bites that occur in a community is not known, especially if they don't result in serious injury. The number of dogs of a particular breed or combination of breeds in a community is not known because it is rare for all dogs in a community to be licensed. Statistics often do not consider multiple incidents caused by a single animal. Breed popularity changes over time, making comparison of breed-specific bite rates unreliable. However a review of the research that attempts to quantify the relation between breed and bite risk finds the connection to be weak or absent, while responsible ownership variables such as socialization, neutering and proper containment of dogs are much more strongly indicated as important risk factors.      A better solution to dog bite prevention      Animal control and legislative approaches to protecting a community from dangerous dogs should not be based on breed, but instead on promoting responsible pet ownership and developing methods to rapidly identify and respond to owners whose dogs present an actual risk.      The AVMA recommends the following strategies for dog bite prevention:      Enforcement of generic, non-breed-specific dangerous dog laws, with an emphasis on chronically irresponsible owners Enforcement of animal control ordinances such as leash laws, by trained animal care and control officers Prohibition of dog fighting Encouraging neutering for dogs not intended for breeding School-based and adult education programs that teach pet selection strategies, pet care and responsibility, and bite prevention      AVMA's report A Community Approach to Dog Bite Prevention (PDF) highlights tangible steps that veterinarians can take alongside state and local leaders to implement effective dog bite prevention programs in their community.

However, attitudes towards pit bulls have shifted over the years, helped by animal activists and television shows that have cast the dogs in a more positive light. This has led to new laws in many states that forbid communities from banning specific breeds, illustrating the power of dog-advocacy groups. At present, 17 states have laws that prohibit communities from adopting breed-specific bans, with lawmakers in six more states considering similar measures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands.

However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians. While Christianity was not a great success in China, it made local headway, evidenced today by the numerous Catholic churches in Macau's historic center. Intermarriage with the local Chinese created a community of Macanese, whose culture can still be seen in Macau's architecture and cuisine.

One day, Sean meets \\"Duke\\" Wayne (George Wendt), who introduces Sean to his boss, a shady developer named Ray Matthews (Daniel Baldwin). Ray hires Sean as a spy, and orders him to follow Eric Gatley (Ron Livingston), an accountant who has been investigating Ray's company. Problems start when Ray, while drunk, offers Sean 13,000 to kill Eric. Sean accepts his offer and, although ambivalent, ends up killing Gatley by breaking into his house and beating him to death. When Sean goes to collect his pay, however, he is double-crossed and when he insists that they pay him, he is kidnapped and taken to Ray's secluded farm. It emerges that Matthews never had any intention of paying Sean for the killing, for he only wanted to use and eliminate him. But Sean survives from having a bullet put in his head then reveals that he had taken Gatley's work file of evidence and hidden it along with his documentation of events leading to the murder. When torture fails to make him disclose the whereabouts of the file, Sean is then brutally beaten about the head with golf clubs many times by Ray and his henchmen daily for weeks, in an effort to destroy his memory. After suffering a heavy amount of trauma, Sean escapes, killing Duke, and finds his way to a downtown homeless shelter where Gatley's widow, Susan (Kari Wuhrer), takes him under her wing, oblivious to his role in her personal tragedy. After she nurses him back to normal, he feels he has been reborn and they become lovers and he moves into her house. But after a few weeks, Susan finds his file describing the murder and, enraged, physically attacks him. Defending himself, Sean accidentally kills her.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: There are many indicators of dilation that don’t require inserting your fingers into your vagina. This can be especially helpful if you are in a lot of pain or discomfort. Most women will make some type of sound when they’re in labor. Listening to what types of sounds you’re making can cue you into how much you’re cervix has dilated. The following sounds can accompany the various stages of labor and cervical dilation:  At 0-4 centimeters dilated, you may not be making much noise and can talk through a contraction with little effort. At 4-5 centimeters, it may be difficult to nearly impossible to talk. Your noises may still be quiet. Between 5-7 centimeters, you may make louder and staccato noises. It should be nearly or completely impossible to talk through contractions. Between 7–10 centimeters (2.8–3.9 in), you may be making very loud noises and shouldn’t be able to talk through a contraction. If you’re a silent laborer, you can also check your dilation. Tell someone to ask you a question at the start of a contraction. The less you are able to say a sentence, the farther along your dilation is. Childbirth is an inherently emotional experience for the woman in labor. Watching what emotions you’re experiencing can cue you into how far your cervix is dilated. You may have the following emotions during labor:  Happiness and laughter between 1-4 centimeters Smiley and laughing at little things between contractions between 4-6 centimeters Irritation at jokes and small talk around 7 centimeters until birth. Many people will notice certain scents when a woman gets to between 6 and 8 centimeters dilated. The smell of labor is deep, heavy, and dusky—not musky. If you notice a distinct change to these scents in the smell of the room in which you’re laboring, your cervix may be between 6 and 8 centimeters dilated. Some women may see a stringy mucus discharge at 39 weeks that is tinged pink or brown with blood. This bloody show may continue through the early stages of labor. At 6-8 centimeters dilated, however, a lot of blood and mucus may be present. Looking for these substances can indicate that you’re somewhere between 6-8 centimeters dilated. The purple line is located in your natal cleft, or what some people call the butt crack. This line can be a measure of how far you’re dilated, with it reaching the top of your cleft at full dilation. You may need someone to help you examine your purple line. Recognize that in the early stages of labor that the purple line will be closer to the anus. As your labor progresses, it will creep up between your buttocks. At full dilation, the purple line will extend to the top of your natal cleft. Many women experience physical signs of dilation that are visible without a vaginal examination. In general, many will feel like they have the flu as they get close to 10cm and/ or the pushing phase. Scanning your body for these signs and symptoms can help you figure out how much your cervix has dilated. In most, cases, a combination of these signs can indicate how you’re your cervix is dilated.  Feeling like you have to vomit, having a flushed face and feeling warm to the touch can mean you’re about 5 centimeters dilated. You may also tremble uncontrollably. Vomiting alone may be the result of emotions, hormones, or fatigue. Seeing if your face is flushed with no other signs can be a good indicator that you’re 6-7 centimeters dilated. Be aware that trembling uncontrollably without any other signs can indicate fatigue or fever. See if you’re curling your toes or standing on your toes, which is a sign you’re between 6 and 8 centimeters dilated. Check your buttocks and upper thighs for goosebumps, which is a good sign that you’re at 9-10 centimeters. Recognize that having involuntary bowel movements is also a sign of full dilation. You may also see or feel the head at your perineum. As your baby descends into the birth canal, you will feel pressure at different points along your back. The more you dilate, the farther down your back the pressure will be lower. It will generally move from the rim of your pelvis down to your tailbone.","output":"When a woman is having a baby, her body goes through changes called dilation. Dilation is how wide the cervix (the opening to the womb) becomes so the baby can come out. There are different ways to tell how much the cervix has dilated without looking inside the body.  One way is by listening to the noises the woman makes when she is in labor. If she can talk easily during contractions, she may not be very dilated, but if she cannot talk and makes louder noises, she might be closer to giving birth.  Another way is by observing her emotions and how she reacts to things. At first, she might be happy and laughing, but as she gets closer to giving birth, she may be more irritated and serious. During labor, some women might notice a change in their body scent, or see some blood and mucus. This can be a sign that they are getting closer to giving birth too. There is also something called the \\"purple line\\" at the back that moves up as the dilation increases.  Some women might feel flu-like symptoms, feel really warm, or get goosebumps; these can also be signs of how much the cervix is dilated. Finally, as the baby moves down, the woman will feel pressure in her back which might help her know how close she is to giving birth."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Based on their last three projects, these 10 stars are not. We used data gathered from our Celebrity 100 research and Box Office Mojo to calculate how much, on average, each star's last three films earned at the box office per dollar of pay. Think of it like a star return on investment number. ||||| Poor Eddie Murphy desperately needs a comeback. Remember back in the day when he was so funny on Saturday Night Live and in movies like Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop? His voice work has helped make movies like Shrek and Mulan tolerable for adults, and even his family-friendly movies, like Norbit and Dr. Dolittle, were good for some chuckles.      But lately, Murphy's career has just collapsed. Imagine That, A Thousand Words and Meet Dave were colossal flops. Last year's Tower Heist, which was supposed to be something of a return to form for the comedian, failed to wow at the box office, earning 153 million on an estimated budget of 75 million. (In order to even come close to turning a profit, a movie has to earn twice its production budget in ticket sales, plus the millions spent on marketing.) Murphy then backed out of hosting the Oscars, which didn't help his reputation.      His string of flops lands Murphy at the top of our Most Overpaid Actors list for 2012. We estimate that for every 1 Murphy was paid for his last three films, they returned an average of 2.30 at the box office.      To compile our list, we used data on actors' earnings gathered for our Celebrity 100 list. Box office grosses and budget estimates are from Box Office Mojo. We looked at the last three films each actor starred in over the last three years that opened in more than 2,000 theaters, calculating the return on investment for the studios who pay his (or her) salary.      Ranking second behind Murphy is a newcomer to our list: Katherine Heigl. For every dollar she was paid on her last three movies, they earned an average of 3.40.      After hits like Knocked-Up, 27 Dresses and The Ugly Truth, Heigl's quote shot up to the 12 million range. Unfortunately, the films she's made at that price point have failed to deliver. Her most recent film, One For The Money, earned only 37 million on an estimated 40 million budget. Heigl needs to step away from the expensive star vehicles and rebuild her career. Her next release is the ensemble pic The Big Wedding, which hits theaters in April. Featuring Robert DeNiro, Susan Sarandon and Amanda Seyfried, the movie could give Heigl a chance to show how funny she can be when the pressure is off.      In past versions of our overpaid actors roundup, we looked at each actor's films over the last five years. This year, we cut back to the last three years to give the list a more contemporary focus.      That dropped Drew Barrymore from the top 10, but not because she has anchored any smashes lately. Barrymore was our worst-performing actor last year -- her films earned only 40 cents for each 1 she was paid. However she hasn't starred in three big releases over the last three years. We don't count ensemble films where there is no clear star like Barrymore's 2009 film He's Just Not That Into You, which was actually a hit.      Reese Witherspoon ranks third on our list with an average 3.90 return for every 1 she was paid. Witherspoon is one of the most popular actresses in Hollywood, but her choices lately have been questionable, like 2010's How Do You Know. With a ridiculously high budget of 120 million -- a big chunk of which went to salaries for Witherspoon and big-name co-stars Paul Rudd, Jack Nicholson and Owen Wilson -- the romantic comedy never had a chance of turning a profit. It grossed just 49 million at the box office, making it one of the worst-performing films of 2010.      Her most recent film, This Means War, didn't help much. The 65 million action comedy did OK, earning 157 million worldwide, but it wasn't enough to get Witherspoon off of our most overpaid list.      Sandra Bullock makes a surprise entry in fourth place with a 5 return for every 1 she was paid. In 2009 Bullock starred in one of the biggest films of the year, The Blind Side. Not only did it earn 310 million at the box office globally, it was made for just 30 million, making it one of the most profitable films of the year. It was also a big earner for Bullock, who had a profit-sharing deal on the project. But her two other films of the last three years were stinkers: All About Steve and Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close. [Bullock's representatives insist that Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close should not have been included in our calculations for the actress because she was not the star of the film. If you took that film out and added in The Proposal, her return on investment number would be much higher.]      Rounding out the top five is Jack Black, whose films returned only 5.20 for every 1 he was paid. Last year's comedy The Big Year barely registered at the box office. Big-name stars like Black, Steve Martin and Owen Wilson couldn't overcome poor reviews and a less than sexy topic -- birdwatching. It earned only 7 million.      Follow me on Twitter at DorothyatForbes.

Sometimes, actors' movies don't earn as much money as expected, which makes them overpaid in comparison to the profit. For example, Eddie Murphy's movies didn't do well lately, so he is currently considered the most overpaid actor in Hollywood. On the other hand, some actors, like Sandra Bullock, have had very successful movies which make them worth the investment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships rather than sociopolitical hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine immigrant and labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a life that was not consistent with the theme Rockwell depicted in his version of Freedom From Want. Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, and his name was thereafter well recognized. The essay was lost by The Post, and Bulosan, who had no carbon copy, had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar in Tacoma.Freedom From Want had previously been less entwined in the standard liberalism philosophies of the western world than the other three freedoms (speech, fear, and religion); this freedom added economic liberty as a societal aspiration. In his essay, Bulosan treats negative liberties as positive liberties by suggesting that Americans be \\"given equal opportunity to serve themselves and each other according to their needs and abilities\\", an echo of Karl Marx's \\"from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs\\".  In the final paragraph of the essay, the phrase \\"The America we hope to see is not merely a physical but also a spiritual and intellectual world\\" describes an egalitarian America.  In a voice likened to Steinbeck's in works such as The Grapes of Wrath, Bulosan's essay spoke up for those who struggled to survive in the capitalist democracy and was regarded as \\"haunting and sharp\\" against the backdrop of Rockwell's feast of plenty.

In which reaction will the sodium hydroxide dissolve faster?  Justin is conducting a chemical experiment involving sodium hydroxide. A key part of the reaction is ensuring that the sodium hydroxide is dissolved in water before adding the other materials. Justin adds the sodium hydroxide to reaction A, and sets the heat to high. Justin can't use high heat for his second reaction, though, because the electricity supply is too weak to have both burners on high. Because of this, Justin adds the sodium hydroxide to reaction B and sets the heat to low.  Hint: When you add sugar to a cold drink, you may stir it to help the sugar dissolve. If you don’t stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube. That’s because granulated sugar has much more surface area than a cube of sugar. You can see videos of all three factors at these URLs Answer:","output":"The sodium hydroxide will dissolve faster in reaction A, where the heat is set to high.

If An elephant-ride, which allows you to swing through the jungle and grassland while reclining on a cushioned howdah, is a great joy., can we conclude that \\"On top of the elephants, there is a cushioned howdah for the rider.\\"?","output":"Yes, based on the given statement, \\"An elephant-ride, which allows you to swing through the jungle and grassland while reclining on a cushioned howdah, is a great joy,\\" we can conclude that \\"On top of the elephants, there is a cushioned howdah for the rider.\\" From the statement, it can be derived that the elephant-ride experience involves swinging through different terrains such as jungles and grasslands. The rider is described to be reclining on a cushioned howdah, which implies that the howdah is an integral part of the elephant-ride experience and serves as a comfortable seating arrangement for the rider. A howdah is a seat or carriage traditionally used on the back of an elephant as a form of transportation, used mostly in the past by the aristocracy or for hunting purposes. However, in this context, the howdah is being used for the purpose of swinging through the jungle and grassland landscape, providing an enjoyable experience to the rider. Moreover, the statement specifies that the howdah is cushioned, which suggests that it has been designed to provide additional comfort and support to the rider while they traverse the landscape. This further reinforces the idea that the elephant carries a cushioned howdah on its back for the rider's enjoyment and relaxation during the ride. In conclusion, based on the initial statement, it is reasonable to infer that on top of the elephants, there is a cushioned howdah for the rider that serves as a comfortable seat, enabling the rider to swing through the jungle and grassland while experiencing great joy.

He appreciated the advantages of democracy: \\"It is an invaluable gift, if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords.\\" Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God. To further protect the rights of ordinary people, Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Thus he and his followers resisted political absolutism and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy.

Question: What bet does Christian make? Movie title: Latter Days Movie plot: Elder Aaron Davis (Steve Sandvoss), a young Mormon missionary from Pocatello, Idaho, is sent to Los Angeles with three other missionaries to spread the Mormon faith.

Question: \\"What is the major flaw of the witness system?\\"  Context: \\"Jehovah's Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization. The religion has been criticized for its \\"two witness rule\\" for church discipline, based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17, which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing. In cases where corroboration is lacking, the Watch Tower Society's instruction is that \\"the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah's hands\\". A former member of the church’s headquarters staff, Barbara Anderson, says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation, \\"which is an impossibility\\". Anderson says the policies \\"protect pedophiles rather than protect the children.\\" Jehovah's Witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children, adding that the best way to protect children is by educating parents; they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The major flaw of the witness system within the Jehovah's Witnesses organization, specifically regarding the \\"two witness rule\\" for church discipline, lies in its potential to conceal or inadequately address cases of sexual abuse. This rule stems from the interpretation of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17, which require sexual abuse allegations to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing. Consequently, in cases where there is no corroboration, the Watch Tower Society instructs elders to \\"leave the matter in Jehovah's hands,\\" rather than pursuing further investigation or involving law enforcement. Critics argue that this policy, in effect, necessitates another witness to an act of molestation—an inherent impossibility. By relying on this rule, the organization may inadvertently protect the perpetrators of abuse rather than the victims. Former members, such as Barbara Anderson, claim that these policies contribute to concealing instances of sexual abuse and ultimately fail to protect the children within the organization. Jehovah's Witnesses maintain that they prioritize the protection of children through education and by fostering a close-knit community. They argue that focusing on parental involvement and steering clear of activities that separate children from parents serves as the best means for ensuring child safety. Nonetheless, the \\"two witness rule\\" remains a contentious issue, as it may hinder the proper resolution of sexual abuse cases and potentially foster a culture of concealment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Undoubtedly, Hannah Montana: The Movie will appeal to Cyrus' core audience, but the chances of this sanitized, prepackaged effort expanding her fan base is about nil. 2. There's nothing subtle or unexpected about Hannah Montana: The Movie. But its intended audience of prepubescent girls probably won't mind. Still, it's hard not to wish the same wholesome message could be conveyed with a bit more finesse and originality. 3.

Cyrus has maintained an honorably wholesome image, and this feature-length spinoff of the sitcom does nothing to hurt it. But it also does nothing to help Cyrus or the audience evolve. 8.
