Goal: To color leather Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?  1. Use a sharpie; 2. Use a stain;...I think the answer is","output":"2. Use a stain. While both methods can be used to color leather, using a leather stain (also called leather dye) is generally more reasonable and effective for accomplishing the goal of coloring the leather. Let's examine the differences between the two methods and explore why using a stain is the better option. 1. Using a Sharpie Sharpies are permanent markers that contain quick-drying ink. They can be used to color various surfaces, including leather. However, there are several drawbacks to using a Sharpie for this purpose: - Limited color options: Sharpies come in a limited range of colors compared to leather stains, restricting your ability to get the exact shade or finish you desire. - Inconsistent application: Applying ink from a Sharpie onto the leather surface can be uneven and streaky, leading to an unprofessional and amateurish finish. - Fading and rubbing off: Sharpie ink tends not to adhere well to leather and can fade or rub off over time, particularly when exposed to water, sunlight, or regular use. - Potential damage: Sharpies contain solvents that can potentially damage the leather, particularly if it has not been prepped and conditioned beforehand. 2. Using a Leather Stain Leather stains, also known as leather dyes, are specifically formulated to penetrate and color leather surfaces. They have several advantages over using a Sharpie: - Wide range of colors: Leather stains come in a vast array of colors, allowing you to achieve the exact shade and finish you want for your leather piece. - Consistent application: Leather stains are applied using a sponge, brush, or airbrush, resulting in a more even and consistent application without streaks or blotches. - Durability: Leather stains are specifically designed to bond with the leather's fibers and are resistant to fading, wear, and water damage. This ensures a long-lasting, professional-looking result. - Condition-enhancing properties: Many leather stains also contain conditioners and protectants that help nourish and preserve the leather, ensuring its durability and longevity. Before applying a leather stain, it is essential to prepare the leather properly. This may involve cleaning the surface, removing any existing finish or protective coating, and ensuring the leather is dry and ready for dyeing. Once you've applied the stain, it's crucial to follow up with a leather sealer or finish to protect the newly colored surface and maintain its vibrancy and durability. In conclusion, while both Sharpies and leather stains can be used to color leather, using a stain is generally more reasonable and yields better results. Leather stains provide a wider range of colors, better application consistency, increased durability, and added conditioning properties to enhance the quality and longevity of the leather piece."},{"instruction":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  and the situation: Two neighboring towns from Texas produced their food in different ways.

Answer the following question: Which town played its part in causing a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ? The answer is:","output":"Gold town played its part in causing a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. Since Gold town used fertilizers and pesticides in their agricultural practices, these chemicals were likely washed away by rain and carried through runoff into nearby rivers. These rivers eventually drain into the Gulf of Mexico, bringing the fertilizers (rich in nitrogen) with them. The excess nitrogen promotes the growth of algae, leading to algal blooms that consume carbon dioxide and eventually die. Decomposers break down the dead algae, using up the oxygen in the water, and thereby creating a dead zone where little to no aquatic life can survive due to the low oxygen levels. On the other hand, Silver town, which practiced sustainable agriculture without the use of fertilizers or pesticides, did not contribute to the creation of a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dutch daredevil Wim Hof, known as the 'iceman', led a group of 26 people to the summit of the world's highest free standing mountain - Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. In just 48 hours the group climbed all 5,895m (19, 340ft) without succumbing to hypothermia or altitude sickness - an achievement considered impossible by experts. Clearly, they were in peak condition. Wim Hof (right) led a group of climbers to the peak of Mount Kilimajaro in Tanzania - wearing just their shorts. Eleven of the team climbed the mountain dressed just in shorts and without tops - to arrive unhurt at the mountain's peak, where the temperature is a brutal -20C. Before the project started, the Dutch Mountaineering and Climbing Federation and expedition medics considered this impossible. The success rate of reaching Uhuru Peak in a regular mountaineering expedition is 41 per cent. Kilimanjaro is the world's highest free-standing mountain at 5895m. Hardy: The scantily clad climbers during the long trek to the top. At the summit the amount of oxygen is less than 50 per cent of the amount of oxygen at sea level - usually for a climber going up, it takes five to seven days to acclimatise. Altitude sickness can occur from 3000m upwards and usually starts with headaches, dizziness and confusion. In extreme cases cerebral edema - brain swelling - and even death may occur. Whim believes a combination of training focus, breathing and training at low temperatures made it possible for the participants to gain control over altitude sickness. Wim Hof shows off his muscle power during the trek to the top of the Tanzanian mountain. The participants of this expedition, aged between 29 and 65 years, were without any real mountaineering experience and some suffered conditions such as rheumatism, asthma and chrones disease. Wim Hof, who sat in an ice bath for one hour 13 minutes to break the world record, said: ‘Until now the world thought that only I was capable to conquer extreme cold and altitude. ‘These heroes have shown that everybody is able to do what I am doing.

She had son Tripp that year and has since spoken about abstinence and the challenges of life as a young single mother.      Van Flein said Bristol Palin will be selective in the speeches she gives.      He said he believes she's interested in expanding her message beyond teen pregnancy to include her experiences on the campaign trail and in the media spotlight; her parenting approach; and her outlook on life.

I always have stayed away from hospitals. People died or were born. But now I thought I might get some idea if I went down to where it was all happening, the being born and the dying. Mostly the dying. It was the dying that interested me. I sat on a bench in a sort of waiting room. I wanted to call it a green room; it wasn't a place where the patients would wait to be called by the doctor; it was a place where the relatives would wait while the patient was in their room. It had a coffee bar, and comfortable couches, with trendy, muted colors on the walls and floor. Everything was clean and modern without being cold, a homogenized balancing act designed to keep everyone calm during their stressful time. It was a green room; patients were \\"guests\\"; their families were \\"guests\\" as well. Here was where the families would sit and be feted while they waited to be called out to perform, to smile and encourage or to don faces of appropriate mournfulness. The old ones would put on smiles, the young ones would look sad. I think I went there because it seemed to me that it was the place richest in emotional impact. It reeked of spent emotions, and the emotions were made all the stronger, here in the green room, by the efforts at suppression--the muted walls and gourmet coffees and scones, the overstuffed loveseats and couches, as if those in grief should not be permitted to sit on benches or folding chairs. It absolutely reeked of hush and hidden feeling. It was worse than a church. It was worse than a highschool hallway. It was more universal, more basic, something even the children could comprehend.

Ayaan Hirsi Ali (; Dutch: [a:'ja:n 'hi:rsi 'a:li] ( listen); born Ayaan Hirsi Magan, 13 November 1969) is a Somali-born Dutch-American activist, feminist, author, scholar and former politician. Hirsi Ali arrived in the Netherlands in 1992. That year she had travelled from Kenya to visit her family in Dusseldorf and Bonn, Germany and gone to the Netherlands to escape an alleged arranged marriage. Once there, she requested political asylum and obtained a residence permit. She used her paternal grandfather's early surname on her application and has since been known in the West as Ayaan Hirsi Ali. She received a residence permit within three or four weeks of arriving in the Netherlands.  At first she held various short-term jobs, ranging from cleaning to sorting post. She worked as a translator at a Rotterdam refugee center which, according to a friend interviewed in 2006 by The Observer newspaper, marked her deeply.  As an avid reader, in the Netherlands she found new books and ways of thought that both stretched her imagination and frightened her. Sigmund Freud's work introduced her to an alternative moral system that was not based on religion. During this time she took courses in Dutch and a one-year introductory course in social work at the De Horst Institute for Social Work in Driebergen. She has said that she was impressed with how well Dutch society seemed to function. To better understand its development, she studied at Leiden University, obtaining an MSc degree in political science in 2000.  Between 1995 and 2001, Hirsi Ali also worked as an independent Somali-Dutch interpreter and translator, frequently working with Somali women in asylum centers, hostels for abused women, and at the Dutch immigration and naturalization service (IND, Immigratie en Naturalisatiedienst). While working for the IND, she became critical of the way it handled asylum seekers. As a result of her education and experiences, Hirsi Ali speaks six languages: English, Somali, Arabic, Swahili, Amharic, and Dutch. how many languages does she speak","output":"Ayaan Hirsi Ali is fluent in six languages: English, Somali, Arabic, Swahili, Amharic, and Dutch. Her language skills have been instrumental in her work as an interpreter and translator, as well as in her activism, authorship, and political career. Throughout her educational and professional experiences in the Netherlands and later in the United States, Hirsi Ali has been able to effectively communicate and share her ideas, perspectives, and experiences across various cultures and linguistic communities. Her multilingualism has been valuable in her advocacy for women's rights, human rights, and the reform of Islam, as it allows her to engage with a diverse range of individuals and organizations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I can use this background: Curds are a dairy product obtained by coagulating milk in a process called curdling. The coagulation can be caused by adding rennet or any edible acidic substance such as lemon juice or vinegar, and then allowing it to coagulate. The increased acidity causes the milk proteins (casein) to tangle into solid masses, or curds. Milk that has been left to sour (raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic acid bacteria) will also naturally produce curds, and sour milk cheeses are produced this way. Producing cheese curds is one of the first steps in cheesemaking; the curds are pressed and drained to varying amounts for different styles of cheese and different secondary agents (molds for blue cheeses, etc.) are introduced before the desired aging finishes the cheese. The remaining liquid, which contains only whey proteins, is the whey. In cow's milk, 90 percent of the proteins are caseins.  Now, I have a new situation: Dan likes to experiment with different food items. Today, he wants to make curds out of milk and see how it differs from plain milk. For his experiment he collected three bottles of milk, bottle A, bottle B, and bottle C. Bottle A and bottle B milk are pasteurized, but bottle C milk is just raw milk. He kept the bottle A milk intact, but made curd out of bottle B and bottle C milk.  Answer this question please: Which milk would be coagulated, bottle A or bottle B? The answer to this question is:","output":"Bottle B would be coagulated. In the situation described, Dan made curd out of bottle B and bottle C milk. Bottle A milk was kept intact and not subjected to any curdling process. Therefore, the milk in bottle B has been coagulated, whereas the milk in bottle A remains in its original, uncoagulated state."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It's impossible to say While \\"New World\\" is certainly a notable film in Park Hoon-jung's career, it is impossible to definitively say whether this is the work he is best known for without an overview of his entire body of work and the reception of his other films/projects. The film is an important piece in his career, and being the first entry in a planned trilogy does add to its significance. However, to say Park Hoon-jung is \\"best known\\" for \\"New World\\" requires a broader analysis and understanding of his prominence within the industry and the reception of his other works. Park Hoon-jung is a South Korean screenwriter, film director and producer, who began his career as a screenwriter before transitioning to directing. Over his career, he has been involved in the creation of various films and projects. To establish whether \\"New World\\" is his most notable work, one would need to assess each of his projects in terms of their critical acclaim, box office success, cultural impact, and overall recognition within the film industry. Some other works by Park Hoon-jung include films like \\"I Saw the Devil\\" (2010), which he wrote, and \\"The Witch: Part 1. The Subversion\\" (2018), which he directed. Both of these films have also garnered attention and acclaim, and it is possible that he is also well-known for these works.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Your gifts and talents will help you succeed, but they can only do so if you know what they are. You need to be self-aware enough to use and hone the gifts you already have.  Start by thinking about the areas in which you excel. What comes easiest to you? In which subjects did you always do well in school? What do you breeze through at work? Ask your friends, family, and co-workers for feedback. Often, they can see talents that you're blind to. For instance, maybe you have a natural ability to talk anyone into anything. You may not even notice that ability, yet it's a skill that comes in handy in many fields. You could ask your friends, \\"I'm trying to become more self-aware. Can you tell me what you think my strengths and weaknesses are?\\" It's also equally important to know your challenges, so you can work on those areas. Listen when you do receive feedback from others, either solicited or unsolicited, as that will help you learn where you can grow. For example, if a friend says, \\"You're starting another new project? What happened to the last one?\\" you may realize that you aren't following through on your projects. Studies have shown that kids who are praised for their effort rather than for the result are more likely to develop a growth mindset. That's because they become focused on the process rather than the the end result. You can use that to your own benefit by rewarding yourself for your hard work, rather than just the end result.  For every designated length of time that you work on something, reward yourself with a fun break or treat. This can help keep your focus on the effort. Or if you tried a new recipe at home, something you find difficult, you probably would normally tell yourself, \\"That's so delicious!\\" While that's not bad necessarily, you should also think about the process, telling yourself, \\"I'm proud of myself for trying out a new recipe and working so hard on it.\\" A qualified counselor or therapist can help you identify negative thinking patterns and other roadblocks toward developing a growth mindset. A therapist can make an assessment of your personal relationships, your professional development, and personal experiences. They can also give you \\"tools\\" to combat negative thoughts, improve your self esteem, and offer support when you experience setbacks.","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of self-awareness in identifying and utilizing one's gifts and talents for success, suggesting strategies to discover personal strengths and weaknesses, develop a growth mindset, seek feedback from others, focus on effort rather than outcomes, rewarding oneself for hard work, and considering professional help such as counseling or therapy to overcome negative thought patterns and develop a more robust positive mindset for personal and professional growth."},{"instruction":"Lee decided to make a cake for the holiday coming up.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Starr was inducted into the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame in 2002, joining an elite group including Buddy Rich, William F. Ludwig Sr. and William F. Ludwig Jr. On 29 November 2002 (the first anniversary of Harrison's death), he performed \\"Photograph\\" and a cover of Carl Perkins' \\"Honey Don't\\" at the Concert for George held in the Royal Albert Hall, London. Early the following year, he released the album Ringo Rama, which contained a song he co-wrote as a tribute to Harrison, \\"Never Without You\\". Also in 2003, he formed Pumkinhead Records with All-Starr Band member Mark Hudson. The label was not prolific, but their first signing was Liam Lynch, who produced a 2003 LP entitled Fake Songs.Starr served as an honorary Santa Tracker and voice-over personality in 2003 and 2004 during the London stop in Father Christmas's annual Christmas Eve journey, as depicted in the annual NORAD tracks Santa program. According to NORAD officials, he was \\"a Starr in the east\\" who helped guide North American Aerospace Defense Command's Santa-tracking tradition. His 2005 release Choose Love eschewed the star-guests approach of his last two studio albums but failed to chart in the UK or the US. That same year, Liverpool's City Council announced plans to demolish Starr's birthplace, 9 Madryn Street, stating that it had \\"no historical significance\\". The LCC later announced that the building would be taken apart brick by brick and preserved.Starr released the album Liverpool 8 in January 2008, coinciding with the start of Liverpool's year as the European Capital of Culture. Hudson was the initial producer of the recordings, but after a falling out with Starr, he was replaced by David A. Stewart. Starr performed the title track at the opening ceremony for Liverpool's appointment, but thereafter attracted controversy over his seemingly unflattering comments about his city of birth. Later that year, he was the object of further criticism in the press for posting a video on his website in which he harangued fans and autograph hunters... The answer to this question is:","output":"George \\"Never Without You\\" was written as a tribute to George Harrison, a former bandmate of Ringo Starr in The Beatles. The song was featured on Starr's album \\"Ringo Rama\\" and was released in 2003, following Harrison's death in 2001."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

However, it is important to note that this description pertains to the flag used by Libya from 1977 to 2011, during the period of Muammar Gaddafi's leadership. The flag was also known as the \\"Green Banner of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.\\" The Libyan flag from 1977 to 2011 was unique in its simplicity, as it was the only national flag in the world that consisted of a single color and had no other emblems, insignias, or design elements. The green color on the flag symbolized various aspects of Libyan society and culture, including Islam, which is the predominant religion in the country. Green is also a color associated with the Gaddafi-led political ideology of the Jamahiriya, which was a system that aimed to combine elements of socialism, Arab nationalism, and direct democracy. Additionally, green in the flag was intended to represent Gaddafi's \\"Green Book,\\" a political manifesto authored by Gaddafi outlining his vision for a utopian socialist society in Libya. The Green Book served as the main guiding document for the policies and principles of the Libyan government during this period. In 2011, the iconic green flag was replaced amidst the Libyan Civil War and the eventual fall of Gaddafi's regime. Libya's new flag was introduced by the National Transitional Council, which took over the governance of the country after the end of the conflict. The current flag of Libya consists of three horizontal stripes: red on top, black in the middle, and green at the bottom. At the center of the black stripe, there is a white crescent and star, which are symbols of Islam. This design reverts to the flag used by the Kingdom of Libya from 1951 to 1969 and is meant to signify a return to the values of unity, freedom, and independence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who is left to his thoughts? from the following article ?  The film opens with an English schoolteacher, Gwen Mayfield, packing up her belongings at a mission school in colonial Africa. The local witch doctors have led a rebellion, and they reach the school before she is able to escape—the shaman wearing a body mask. Gwen screams, and the scene dissolves to the opening credits. The next scene is back home in England, where Gwen meets with the apparently Reverend Alan Bax for a job interview. We discover that Gwen suffered a nervous breakdown from whatever she experienced at the hand of the rebels when the school was attacked. Alan is impressed by Gwen and hires her to be the new head teacher at the small private school he and his sister, well-known journalist Stephanie Bax, run for the local children in the village of Heddaby. Upon moving into the teacher's cottage, Gwen asks her maid, Valerie Creek, where she might find the rectory. Valerie is confused—she knows there is no rectory—until Gwen explains she would like to thank Mr. Bax. \\"Oh, you mean the Baxes' house!\\" she says, and shows her the way after tea. At the house, Gwen meets Stephanie and mentions she tried to look for the church on the way but couldn't find it. Stephanie explains there isn't any church, and no \\"Reverend Alan Bax\\"—but that the pretence is completely harmless. Alan shows Gwen the old church, now a ruin, as he walks her home. He confesses to her that he is not really a priest—\\"I wanted to enter the Church, but I failed.\\" He notes that he does not try to persuade anyone or officiate, but sometimes wears the priestly collar \\"for security.\\" Gwen tries to find out more about why the old church was left a ruin but Alan mysteriously turns silent and seems to be unable to move, so she says good night and leaves him to his thoughts.

Danny felt sick and went to the doctor where he found out he had been infected with hepatitis B. Paul was ok and didn't require medical attention.  But I can use this background: Hepatitis B is a disease of the liver. It is caused by a virus called hepatitis B, which can be passed through sexual activity. Hepatitis B causes vomiting. It also causes yellowing of the skin and eyes. The disease goes away on its own in some people. Other people are sick for the rest of their lives. In these people, the virus usually damages the liver. It may also lead to liver cancer. Medicines can help prevent liver damage in these people.

The paragraph states that Judith Miller is a reporter who was jailed for refusing to reveal the identity of a US-government source, who had identified Valerie Plame, a member of the CIA. The information only establishes her as a journalist and implies her involvement in a particular news story related to the US government and the CIA. It is important to note that journalists and reporters often cover stories that involve government actions, sources, and classified information. But being involved in such coverage does not necessarily imply that they themselves are government employees. To determine if Judith Miller works for the US Government, we would need additional information about her role, employer, and professional history. For instance, if she were a reporter for a private media organization, it would imply that she does not work for the US Government. Conversely, if she were employed by a government-run media agency or held an official position as a press practitioner within a government department, then we could infer that she works for the US Government.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Given the background: Individuals living in large groups may be safer from attack because the predator may be confused by the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of the predator.  and the situation: Two packs of lions were hunting large herbivores.  The Simba pack was ambushing wounded individual prey animals, while the Mobutu pack followed large groups of zebras and other grazers.  Answer the following question: Which pack had more difficulty targeting prey animals? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information and the situation provided, it is likely that the Mobutu pack would have more difficulty targeting prey animals than the Simba pack. The main reasons for this conclusion are as follows: 1. Confusion due to large group size: As mentioned in the background information, individuals living in large groups are generally safer from predators due to the confusion effect. The Mobutu pack is following large groups of zebras and other grazers, making it more challenging for them to target a single animal efficiently. In contrast, the Simba pack is ambushing wounded individual prey animals, which are easier to target as they are isolated. 2. Disruptive coloration of zebra stripes: The striped patterns of the zebras are known to have a disruptive effect on predator focusing abilities. When zebras are in a group, their stripes create an optical illusion, making it difficult for predators like lions to focus on a single zebra or determine where one zebra begins and another ends. The Mobutu pack is primarily following herds of zebras, so they are more likely to experience the confusing effects of the zebra stripes. The Simba pack, on the other hand, is targeting wounded individual animals, which may not necessarily be zebras, thus avoiding the disruptive effects of the zebra stripes. 3. Motion dazzle effect: When zebras move rapidly, their stripes tend to create a flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of the predator. This effect further increases the difficulty in targeting individual zebras for the Mobutu pack, as they are following herds of fast-moving grazers. The Simba pack, however, targets wounded individuals who may not be able to move as fast, thus not provoking the same motion dazzle effect. Considering these factors, the Mobutu pack, which is focusing on hunting large groups of zebras and other grazers, is more likely to face challenges in efficiently targeting individual prey animals compared to the Simba pack, which is targeting wounded, isolated prey animals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: John Q Movie plot: A woman is driving dangerously down a winding road, recklessly passing cars until she comes upon a slow moving Mack truck. As she goes to pass, her car is clipped by a truck going in the opposite direction, then slammed full-force by the Mack, killing her. Meanwhile, John Quincy Archibald and his wife Denise witness their young son Michael collapse at his baseball game and take Michael to the hospital. After a series of tests at the hospital, John is informed by Dr. Raymond Turner and Rebecca Payne, the hospital administrator, that his son has an enlarged heart and will need a heart transplant to live. The procedure is very expensive: 250,000 (at a minimum), with a down payment of 75,000 (30%) required to get Michael's name on the organ donor list. John tells them he is insured, but after looking through his policy, they tell him that because the company he works for dropped John from full-time to part-time, his health insurance has been changed, and the new policy does not cover the surgery, which leaves John and Denise to raise 75,000 on their own. The family tries to raise the money but are only able to come up with a third of the necessary payment. The hospital tires of waiting and releases Michael; Denise urges John to do something. Unwilling to let his child die, John walks into the hospital ER with a handgun, gathers eleven hostages, and sets demands: his son's name on the recipient list as soon as possible. The hostage negotiator, Lt. Frank Grimes, stands down to let John cool off. Meanwhile, John and the eleven hostages learn more about each other. They begin to understand John's situation and support him a little as he ensures each of them receive the treatment they came to the emergency room for.

Given the following context:  San Francisco—officially known as the City and County of San Francisco—is a consolidated city-county, a status it has held since the 1856 secession of what is now San Mateo County. It is the only such consolidation in California. The mayor is also the county executive, and the county Board of Supervisors acts as the city council. The government of San Francisco is a charter city and is constituted of two co-equal branches. The executive branch is headed by the mayor and includes other citywide elected and appointed officials as well as the civil service. The 11-member Board of Supervisors, the legislative branch, is headed by a president and is responsible for passing laws and budgets, though San Franciscans also make use of direct ballot initiatives to pass legislation. The members of the Board of Supervisors are elected as representatives of specific districts within the city. Upon the death or resignation of mayor, the President of the Board of Supervisors becomes acting mayor until the full Board elects an interim replacement for the remainder of the term. In 1978, Dianne Feinstein assumed the office following the assassination of George Moscone and was later selected by the board to finish the term. In 2011, Edwin M. Lee was selected by the board to finish the term of Gavin Newsom, who resigned to take office as Lieutenant Governor of California. Lee (who won 2 elections to remain mayor) was temporarily replaced by San Francisco Board of Supervisors President London Breed after he died on December 12, 2017.

Step 2: Compare TNPSC Group 2 posts to IT professional positions IT professionals work in diverse roles, such as software developers, systems analysts, and IT managers. Salaries for IT professionals vary based on experience, job role, and location. Generally, the salaries can range from INR 3 LPA to over INR 20 LPA or more in India. Comparing the TNPSC Group 2 posts with IT professional positions, it may not be accurate to consider them equal because they involve different sectors, responsibilities, and career growth opportunities.

Option A (post office) is not suitable because post offices are used for mailing and receiving packages, not for purchasing books. 4. Option B (music store) is relevant to Jeremy's interest, as music stores often provide books, and other educational materials related to music. 5. Option C (assay office) is not suitable as they are more related to the certification and evaluation of precious metals, and not to music. 6. Option D (butcher shop) is not relevant since butcher shops sell meat products, not music materials. 7. Option E (doctor's office) is not applicable, as doctor's offices are used for medical consultations, not for purchasing books on music. Based on the analysis of each option, the common-sense choice for Jeremy to find books on mastering a music scale is option B, the music store."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: On the Waterfront Context: Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) once dreamt of being a great prize fighter, but now works at the docks of Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb) , the corrupt boss of the dockers union. He witnesses a murder by a couple of Johnny's thugs, but won't betray Friendly, who is both his brother's (Rod Steiger) boss and a long-time friend of his family.What he sees at the docks repulses Terry. In an economically depressed environment in which many are out of work, more gather by the docks each morning hoping to secure work for that day than can be hired, placing Johnny Friendly and his forces in a position to exploit them. Those who complain of the working conditions or wages one day don't work the next day, or are placed in harm's way. Consequently, most tolerate being abused.After befriending both the sister (Eva Marie Saint) of the murdered man and the local priest (Karle Malden), Terry gradually becomes a man of deeper morality, and starts to speak of acts against Friendly, who will soon go on trial. Terry finds his breaking point when his brother is murdered by Friendly's thugs, and causes him to entertain thoughts of testifying against Friendly. Still, he struggles to find the courage to do so, until the priest persuades him to.Once he betrays Friendly, Terry is without the work that always came his way when he and his brother were trusted and valued associates. Still, he confronts Friendly by the docks and when all the dock workers are witness to the brutal beating of Terry by Friendly, they refuse to work unless Terry is also allowed to work. This is the catalyst for a new tone of understanding between the workers and the dock bosses.Terry had neither wanted nor intended to be a hero, but, as a man of principle, he had become not only a hero, but a symbol of the workers' intolerance of exploitation by the dock bosses.===================================Terry Malloy, a former boxer, works as a stevedore on the urban waterfront near New York City.

Lurz, an industrialist with an office in a Berlin high-rise, informs his American headquarters that the company has difficulty selling its security-related computer systems to the West German government in Bonn. Nevertheless Lurz has hatched a secret plan to boost sales. Meanwhile Susanne, Lurzâs secretary, receives a phone call with the message: The world as will and idea. This is a code phrase among a secret group of thirty-something middle-class leftists and would-be terrorists to which she belongs. The phrase has been taken from the central work of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation.

Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.  - United States President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, while attending the play \\"Our American Cousin\\" at Ford's Theatre as the American Civil War was drawing to a close. The assassination occurred five days after the commander of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, General Robert E. Lee, surrendered to Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant and the Union Army of the Potomac.  - The Appalachian Mountains, often called the Appalachians, are a system of mountains in eastern North America. The Appalachians first formed roughly 480 million years ago during the Ordovician Period. It once reached elevations similar to those of the Alps and the Rocky Mountains before naturally occurring erosion. The Appalachian chain is a barrier to east-west travel, as it forms a series of alternating ridgelines and valleys oriented in opposition to most roads running east or west.  - Andrew Johnson (December 29, 1808 July 31, 1875) was the 17th President of the United States, serving from 1865 to 1869. Johnson became president as he was vice president at the time of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. A Democrat who ran with Lincoln on the National Union ticket, Johnson came to office as the Civil War concluded. The new president favored quick restoration of the seceded states to the Union. His plans did not give protection to the former slaves, and he came into conflict with the Republican-dominated Congress, culminating in his impeachment by the House of Representatives. The first American president to be impeached, he was acquitted in the Senate by one vote.  - Tennessee (\\"Tanasi\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States. Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, and Arkansas and Missouri to the west. The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms the state's western border. Tennessee's capital and second largest city is Nashville, which has a population of 654,610. Memphis is the state's largest city, with a population of 655,770.  - Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809  April 15, 1865) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the 16th President of the United States from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865. Lincoln led the United States through its Civil Warits bloodiest war and perhaps its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis. In doing so, he preserved the Union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the economy.  - The President of the United States (POTUS) is the elected head of state and head of government of the United States.

But the decision is getting mixed reviews in Syria. Rebels in brigades fighting around Aleppo have told CNN that the move is a miscalculation. Their argument goes something like this: \\"The U.S. and the West in general have given us next to no help while we've witnessed thousands die at the hands of Bashar al-Assad's heavy weaponry and dominance of the skies. \\"Al-Nusra Front is one of many groups that are fighting the","output":"Assad regime, and while we may not agree with their extremist ideology, they are currently a necessary ally in defeating the government forces.

On the other hand, supporters of the move say that it is crucial to make a clear distinction between moderate rebel groups fighting for democracy and those tied to extremist, terrorist organizations. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the U.S. State Department's decision will depend on whether it incites divisions among the Syrian opposition or leads to more collaborative efforts to defeat Assad's forces and bring about a better future for Syria.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Answer 1: No, winds are not always higher pressure air. Winds are caused by differences in air pressure, and they flow from areas of high pressure to those of low pressure. The difference in pressure is what drives the wind movement. When the difference in pressure is greater, the wind speed increases too. It is important to note that wind is a naturally occurring and dynamic process that depends on various factors such as the Earth's rotation, differences in temperature and humidity, and other regional and local factors that contribute to the creation of pressure differences. Answer 2: To remove the designer's name from the posts you share on Facebook, you need to edit the theme code in the backend of your website. The process might differ depending on the platform and theme you are using, but the general idea is to find the source code responsible for displaying the designer's name and remove or hide it from display. Please follow these steps to attempt this removal: 1. Log in to your website admin panel. 2. Navigate to the theme editor or the area where you can access the theme files. 3. Look for the file responsible for displaying the information in your shared posts. This could be a header.php, footer.php, or a variety of other files depending on your theme structure. You could use the \\"Find\\" feature to narrow down the location of the designer's name in the source code. 4. Once you find the designer's name, either delete the relevant code snippet or hide it by wrapping it with CSS style display property, such as: \`<span style=\\"display:none;\\">Designer's Name</span>\` 5. Save your changes and refresh your website to make sure the designer's name is removed or hidden. 6.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How does the sentence end? It was more likely that Michael would get diabetes than Randy because","output":"It was more likely that Michael would get diabetes than Randy because Michael had a combination of risk factors, genetic predisposition, and lifestyle habits that significantly increased his likelihood of developing the condition. Firstly, Michael's family had a strong history of type 2 diabetes. Both his parents and a few of his siblings were diagnosed with the condition in their adult years. Genetics plays a crucial role in determining an individual's susceptibility to diabetes, and a strong family history can considerably increase that risk. Secondly, Michael's body mass index (BMI) had been consistently high since his teenage years. Obesity is a significant risk factor for type 2 diabetes. As a person's BMI increases, so does their risk of developing the disease. In Michael's case, his BMI was consistently over 30, putting him in the obese category and further increasing his chances of diabetes. In addition, Michael led a predominantly sedentary lifestyle which contributed to his weight gain and overall health. He often took the elevator instead of the stairs, spent long hours in front of screens at work, and rarely engaged in physical exercise. A sedentary lifestyle can lead to insulin resistance, a condition in which the body is unable to utilize insulin properly. Insulin resistance is a significant contributor to the development of type 2 diabetes. Poor dietary choices also put Michael at a higher risk of developing diabetes. He frequently indulged in high-calorie, high-carbohydrate, and high-fat foods, such as fast food, sugary snacks, and processed meals. These types of food can cause blood sugar levels to spike, putting additional stress on the body's insulin-producing cells. Over time, this can lead to the development of diabetes. Moreover, Michael was a heavy smoker and engaged in excessive alcohol consumption. Both cigarette smoking and excessive alcohol intake are independent risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Smoking can lead to increased inflammation and oxidative stress, which can contribute to the development of insulin resistance. In the case of alcohol, excessive consumption can lead to weight gain, and it can also harm the pancreas, the organ responsible for producing insulin. Contrastingly, Randy was at a lower risk for diabetes, as he led a healthier lifestyle. He maintained a healthy weight, engaged in regular physical activity, and his diet consisted of balanced meals with whole grains, lean proteins, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. Moreover, Randy was a non-smoker and consumed alcohol in moderation. While he may not be entirely exempt from developing diabetes, his combination of genetic and lifestyle factors significantly reduced his likelihood in comparison to Michael. In conclusion, Michael's increased likelihood of developing diabetes in comparison to Randy was due to a combination of genetic factors, an unhealthy diet, obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, and unhealthy habits such as smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. It is essential to recognize and manage these risk factors to prevent the onset of diabetes and maintain overall health and wellbeing."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: Given a sentence, fill out the missing word with a 'no' or a number (between zero and ten).

I remember seeing this when it was released, in a theater in Palo Alto, and not expecting much. I mean -- an Australian movie? But it finally got to me. Here's a scene. Richard Chamberlain is sitting cross legged on the floor of a shabby apartment in Sidney, facing an Australian aborigine elder named Charlie. Chamberlain: \\"You were outside my house last night. You frightened my wife. Who are you?\\" And Charlie at a deliberate pace replies, \\"Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you?. . . . Are you a fish? Are you a snake? Are you a man? . . . . Who are you? Who are you? Who are you?\\" It's a stunning scene, shot all in close ups, with Chamberlain's blandly handsome face filling the screen in opposition to Charlie's black, broad-nosed, bearded visage. The two guys couldn't be more different and this film is the story of how Chamberlain accidentally stumbles from his humdrum lawyerly existence into the inexplicable, almost unspeakable, mysteries of Charlie's world. I don't think I'll go on much about the plot. It's kind of an apocalyptic tale. But I must say, whoever did the research on Australian aboriginal belief systems should get an A plus. They've got everything in here, from pointing the bone to the dream time, a kind of parallel universe in which dreams are real. It's an extremely spooky movie without any musical stings or splendiferous special effects. Charly's world simply begins to intrude into Chamberlain's dreams, for reasons never made entirely clear. If there's a problem with the script, that's it. Nothing is ever made entirely clear. Does Chamberlain, who seems to have some extraordinary rapport with the aborigines, die in the last wave? Do the aborigines? Does the entirety of Sidney? The basic premise is a little hard to accept too, though granted that this is a fantasy. The aborigines are invested with the kind of spiritual power that Americans bestow on American Indians, whereas the fact is that mythology is mythology and while one may be more complex or satisfying -- more elegant and beautiful, if you like -- mythology is still an attempt to transcend an ordinary, demanding, and sometimes disappointing physical existence. The mysticism of Charlie is more convincing that the miracles of Moses in Cecil B. DeMille's \\"The Ten Commandments,\\" but they're brothers under the skin. But I don't care about that. Taken as a film, this one is pretty good, and it's especially important for marking the celebrity of the director, Peter Weir, and the Australian film industry. This was the first of a great wave of films from the antipodes, some of them raucous, like \\"Mad Max,\\" and some subtle and dramatic, like \\"Lantana.\\" I like Weir's stuff, which resembles Nicholas Roeg's in being pregnant with subliminal dread. Try \\"Picnic at Hanging Rock\\" for an example of how to make a truly chilling movie with not a drop of blood. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"This review thought positively of the movie. It praises the stunning scenes, the performances of the actors, the research on Australian aboriginal belief systems, and the spooky atmosphere without relying on special effects.

Mandarin Chinese is spoken across most of northern and southwestern China. It has more native speakers than other forms of Chinese.  Xie does not translate directly into English, but when spoken as xiè xie, it means \\"Thanks\\" and \\"'xiè xie nǐ\\" means \\"Thank you.\\" A rough pronunciation of xiè xie is syeh-syeh. The first xiè starts high and drops by the end. The second xie is a neutral tone, meaning it is said lightly and without any emphasis. In simplified Chinese characters, xiè xie is 谢谢. In traditional Chinese characters, it would be 謝謝。 Other \\"thank you\\" sayings involving xie xie include \\"xiè xiè nín de bāng zhù,\\" (谢 谢 您 的 帮 助) a formal way of saying \\"thanks for your help,\\" and \\"xiè xiè nǐ bāng wǒ,\\" (谢谢 你 帮 我) a casual way of saying \\"Thanks for your help. This phrase translates roughly into “where, where!”  The Chinese culture values humility, and saying “thank you” in response to a compliment can come off as being a little arrogant. By saying “where, where,” you are essentially deflecting the compliment. Within the U.S. culture, it would be similar to saying “shucks.” A rough pronunciation of this response would be na-ha-lee na-ha-lee.  In simplified Chinese characters, this response is written as 哪里哪里. In traditional Chinese characters, it would be 哪裡哪裡. As with nǎlǐ, nǎlǐ, responding with bù, bù, bù is a way to politely deflect compliments.  This response is similar to saying \\"no, no, no\\" in English. The number of times you say \\"bù\\" can vary depending on how strong your denial needs to be. The greater the compliment, the stronger the denial. A rough pronunciation of bù, bù, bù would be bhoo bhoo bhoo. Write bù in Chinese as 不.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Shape and Structure of Erythrocytes As an erythrocyte matures in the red bone marrow, it extrudes its nucleus and most of its other organelles. During the first day or two that it is in the circulation, an immature erythrocyte, known as a reticulocyte, will still typically contain remnants of organelles. Reticulocytes should comprise approximately 1–2 percent of the erythrocyte count and provide a rough estimate of the rate of RBC production, with abnormally low or high rates indicating deviations in the production of these cells. These remnants, primarily of networks (reticulum) of ribosomes, are quickly shed, however, and mature, circulating erythrocytes have few internal cellular structural components. Lacking mitochondria, for example, they rely on anaerobic respiration. This means that they do not utilize any of the oxygen they are transporting, so they can deliver it all to the tissues. They also lack endoplasmic reticula and do not synthesize proteins. Erythrocytes do, however, contain some structural proteins that help the blood cells maintain their unique structure and enable them to change their shape to squeeze through capillaries. This includes the protein spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein element. Erythrocytes are biconcave disks; that is, they are plump at their periphery and very thin in the center (Figure 18.6). Since they lack most organelles, there is more interior space for the presence of the hemoglobin molecules that, as you will see shortly, transport gases. The biconcave shape also provides a greater surface area across which gas exchange can occur, relative to its volume; a sphere of a similar diameter would have a lower surface area-to-volume ratio. In the capillaries, the oxygen carried by the erythrocytes can diffuse into the plasma and then through the capillary walls to reach the cells, whereas some of the carbon dioxide produced by the cells as a waste product diffuses into the capillaries to be picked up by the erythrocytes. Capillary beds are extremely narrow, slowing the...   Q: As an erythrocyte matures in the red bone marrow, it extrudes its nucleus and most of its other what?

It is one of the most important natural and historical areas in Florida. Paynes Prairie is located near Gainesville. It is large, 21,000 acres. This protected land is called a preserve. The Florida Park Service manages the preserve. The Paynes Prairie basin was formed when limestone dissolved and the ground settled. It is covered by marsh and wet prairie vegetation. There are areas of open water. During brief periods it has flooded enough to be considered a lake. Except for that, the basin has changed little through time. Man has lived on Paynes Prairie a very long time. He lived there as far back as 10,000 B. C. At one time, the Seminoles lived there. The prairie is thought to have been named after King Payne, a Seminole chief. During the late 1600s, the largest cattle ranch in Florida was on Paynes Prairie. Today, Paynes Prairie is preserved land. It is occupied by visitors and Florida Park Service employees. Willam Bartram visited Paynes Praire. Bartram was the first person who portrayed (described) nature through personal experience as well as scientific observation. He lived 200 years ago. He visited Paynes Prairie in 1774. At that time he described it. He called Paynes Prairie the \\"great Alachua Savannah.\\" Most of the animal life, which Bartram described, is still here. A large number of sandhill cranes, hawks and waterfowl are here in winter. The animal _ is increased by the presence of pine flatwoods, hammock, swamps and ponds. The Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park is open year round. The Florida Park Service works hard so that the park will appear as it did in the past. It offers many opportunities for recreation. At the park you can camp and picnic. You can hike and bike. You can boat and fish. You can ride on horse trails. And you can see lots of nature and wildlife. You can see Florida as it was in the early days. Paynes Prairie is a part of our Florida history. It is an example of our Florida natural resources. It is a place for recreation. Paynes Prairie...

Carlsen finishes the historic victory with a 6.5 to 3.5 score, having won twice as black and once as white.      Magnus Carlsen is only 22, so because of his youth there's a lot of talk about \\"the passing the torch\\" to a new generation of players.      At 43, Anand is from of the era of Kasparov (50) and other greats from the '90s. But to just focus on the age of the players misses the even bigger symbolism, which is that we're entering a totally new post-modern era of human chess.      In the old days, high-level chess was a swashbuckling game filled with daring piece sacrifices and head-spinning multi-move combinations where the winner would pull off wins seemingly out of nowhere.      Here's a beautiful game from 1857, where the American player Paul Morphy (playing as black) sacrificed his queen on his way to a crushing victory. You can quickly click the arrow buttons below to play through the game fast, and see how Morphy dominated his opponent despite his lack of a queen.      This era of chess is also known as the \\"romantic\\" era. Between the daringness and drama of this, it's not hard to see why.      As the study of chess became more rigorous, these wild games became more and more rare at the highest level, as daring (but theoretically weak) combinations became more easy to repel.      That doesn't mean chess players stopped winning games via jaw-dropping combinations.      This 1956 match between Donald Byrne and Bobby Fischer is sometimes called The Game Of The Century. Fischer was just 13 (!!) when he won by sacrificing his queen on move 17, only to win 24 moves later.      Sadly (for fans) these kind of ridiculous-looking games have gotten more rare.      Modern chess champions have won by building crushing, airtight, positional superiorities against their opponents, grinding them down and forcing a resignation. The chess is amazing, although frequently less of a high-wire act.      Which brings us to the current match between Carlsen and Anand.      After the first two games of the best-of-12 series, we lamented that the tournament was off to a disastrous start. The first two games were totally boring draws, with neither player comfortable going off \\"book.\\" In other words, the players spend so much time studying positions (and their opponents' play) with computers that by the time the players get to the table, much of the gamesmanship is already finished. There's a lot of hesitation to uncork a novelty on the board if it isn't something that's been backed up by hours of analysis by software programs (which at this point are better at chess than actual humans).      Since those first two games, things have gotten more exciting, which is obvious as Carlsen has won three games. But the manner of the victories is interesting and tells us something important. In each game, Anand had decent chances to draw, but made some late-game blunder that gave Carlsen the victory.      In today's match, actually, Anand playing as white had the initiative with a strong pawn position bearing down on Carlsen's castled king. But Anand blundered at the end, allowing Carlsen to gain an extra queen, without a clear chance to mate. Anand definitely had winning chances and probably could have drawn, but he screwed up.      // var cbeOptions = { layout: \\"1\\", room: \\"cbtest-wcc1\\", game: \\"09-Anand_Viswanathan-Carlsen_Magnus\\", annotations: true }; //      Live chess broadcast powered by ChessBomb and Chessdom      This is, essentially how all the decisive games have gone. There's a chance for a draw, and Anand cracks under the pressure, while Magnus plays flaw-free chess. Magnus is just crushing Anand on the psychological game. And he does it in multiple ways. For one thing, if you've been watching the game you see that Magnus frequently just gets up and walks away from the table after he moves, which has to be unnerving.      Also this is fascinating, from Tyler Cowen (via Kottke):      Second, Carlsen is demonstrating one of his most feared qualities, namely his \\"nettlesomeness,\\" to use a term coined for this purpose by Ken Regan. Using computer analysis, you can measure which players do the most to cause their opponents to make mistakes. Carlsen has the highest nettlesomeness score by this metric, because his creative moves pressure the other player and open up a lot of room for mistakes. In contrast, a player such as Kramnik plays a high percentage of very accurate moves, and of course he is very strong, but those moves are in some way calmer and they are less likely to induce mistakes in response.      This is our new era of post-modern chess. It's not about uncorking crazy, romantic brilliancies. And it's not about achieving crushing, positional victories. It's about being as cool as a computer while your opponent does things that are, well, human. ||||| The Chess World Championship is currently underway in Chennai, India. Through nine games, challenger and world #1 Magnus Carlsen is leading reigning world champ and world #8 Viswanathan Anand by the score of 6-3. It seems as though Carlsen’s nettlesomeness is contributing to his good fortunes.      Second, Carlsen is demonstrating one of his most feared qualities, namely his “nettlesomeness,” to use a term coined for this purpose by Ken Regan. Using computer analysis, you can measure which players do the most to cause their opponents to make mistakes.

Or perhaps Carlsen’s just inspired by the lovely chess set they’re using? Either way, he needs just one draw in the remaining three games to win the Championship. Or putting it another way, Anand has to win all three of the remaining games to retain the title. ||||| World number one Magnus Carlsen toppled local favourite Viswanathan Anand in Chennai to add the world chess championship title to his already impressive resume on Friday.      A draw in the crucial 10th game after 65 moves of play gave the young Norwegian an unassailable lead in the 12-match contest and put an end to Anand’s hopes of retaining the FIDE title he’s held since 2007.      Carlsen, about a week shy of his 23rd birthday, led 6-3 before Friday’s game and needed just a draw to become the first champion from the West since American Bobby Fischer’s reign ended in 1975.      “I really hope that this could have positive effects for chess both in Norway and worldwide,” Carlsen said at the post-match news conference.      Anand, who has slumped to eighth in the rankings, did not win a game in a series billed as the “War of the Wizards”. In this battle of youth and experience that kicked off on Nov. 9, both players started out with draws before the Norwegian won the fifth and sixth games to pull ahead. Anand drew the next two games before Carlsen prevailed in the ninth.      On Friday, Anand was playing with black pieces — a disadvantage as white moves first — and could not make much headway in a game that lasted nearly five hours.      The world title was the one accomplishment that had eluded Carlsen, often called the “Mozart of chess”. He earned the right to challenge Anand by virtue of winning the candidates’ tournament in April.      The baby-faced Norwegian wasn’t even born when Anand became India’s first grandmaster in 1988 and was just 10 when Anand won the first of his five world titles in 2000.      A grandmaster since he was 13, Carlsen now has the highest rating in the history of the game, breaking chess great Garry Kasparov’s record this year. He became the world’s number one at age 19, the youngest player ever to do so.      Kasparov, who coached Carlsen for a while, described him as “a type of Harry Potter” destined “to leave a deep mark” on the game.      A household name in India, Anand is widely credited with firing up the nation’s passion for chess more than two decades ago. Friday’s result was a disappointment for the 43-year-old, who had been the undisputed world champion since 2007.      “This year, I’ve had a lot of problems with mistakes creeping into my game,” Anand said at the post-match news conference.      “(Losing) the fifth game was a heavy blow,” he said, adding that it was time for him “to take stock”.      The 2013 championship, played on a glass-encased, soundproof stage at five-star hotel in Chennai, drew unprecedented media interest, despite reams of newsprint and TV coverage devoted to Sachin Tendulkar’s swansong series happening concurrently in cricket-crazy India.      More than 100 million TV viewers in India and Norway watched the chess championship broadcast, organisers said on the championship website.      This year, the chess title comes with a cash prize of 1.5 million for Carlsen while Anand will receive around 1 million.

Carlsen finished with a 6.5 to 3.5 score, winning twice as black and once as white. At only 22 years old, Carlsen's victory has sparked conversations about \\"the passing of the torch\\" to a new generation of players. Anand, at 43 years old, is from the era of Kasparov and other great players from the 1990s. However, focusing merely on the age difference overlooks the larger symbolism: the arrival of a new post-modern era in human chess.  In the past, high-level chess games were filled with daring piece sacrifices and multi-move combinations, with winners often emerging unexpectedly. This was known as the \\"romantic\\" era of chess. However, as the study of chess became more rigorous, these wild games gradually decreased at the highest level, as daring combinations were more easily defended. While stunning combinations still occurred, they became rarer. Modern chess champions have typically achieved victory by building crushing positional advantages against their opponents, gradually wearing them down and forcing a resignation. However, the current match between Carlsen and Anand represents a turning point. In each game, Anand made a late-game blunder, allowing Carlsen to seize the win. Carlsen has displayed exceptional psychological skills, forcing Anand into uncomfortable positions and capitalizing on his mistakes. Carlsen's playstyle emphasizes pressuring his opponent with creative moves, opening up opportunities for errors. This approach, combined with his unshakeable demeanor, highlight the dawn of a new era in post-modern chess. The focus has shifted from risky combinations and positional dominance to maintaining the cool efficiency of a computer while forcing your opponent to reveal their human flaws."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The most significant early research of Early Netherlandish art occurred in the 1920s, in German art historian Max Jakob Friedländer's pioneering Meisterwerke der Niederländischen Malerei des 15. und 16. Jahrhunderts. Friedländer focused on the biographical details of the painters, establishing attribution, and examining their major works. The undertaking proved extremely difficult, given the scant historical record of even the most significant artists. Fellow-German Erwin Panofsky's analysis in the 1950s and 1960s followed and in many ways challenged Friedländer's work. Writing in the United States, Panofsky made the work of the German art historians accessible to the English-speaking world for the first time. He effectively legitimized Netherlandish art as a field of study, and raised its status to something similar to the early Italian renaissance. Panofsky was one of the first art historians to abandon formalism. He built on Friedländer's attempts at attribution, but focused more on social history and religious iconography. Panofsky developed the terminology with which the Netherlandish paintings are usually described, and made significant advances identifying the rich religious symbolism especially of the major altarpieces. Panofsky was the first scholar to connect the work of Netherlandish painters and illuminators, noticing the considerable overlap. He considered the study of manuscripts to be integral to the study of panels, though in the end came to view illumination as less significant than panel painting – as a prelude to the truly significant work of the northern artists of the 15th and 16th centuries.Otto Pächt and Friedrich Winkler continued and developed on Panofsky's work. They were key in identifying sources of iconography and ascribing attribution, or at least differentiating anonymous masters under names of convenience. The paucity of surviving documentation has made attribution especially difficult, a problem compounded by the workshop system.

Get aboard if you want to learn more about this underground transportation system. This is an unusual form of transportation, because it is a tunnel that trains travel through and not an actual form of transportation. The Chunnel is actually the English nickname for the Channel Tunnel. In French,it is called le tunnel sous la Manche. It is a rail tunnel beneath the English Channel at the Straits of Dover. It connects Cheriton in Kent, England with Sangatte in northern France. It is the second longest rail tunnel in the world. Did you know that the British and the French had a race while they were building the Chunnel? The race was to see who could get to the middle of the tunnel first. The British won by a little bit. It took 15,000 workers over seven years to dig the tunnel. The tunnel was finished in 1994. The completed Chunnel cost about 21 billion. But it all paid off, because it became very popular, very quick. Millions of people use it. Now it is getting even more popular. There are three complete tunnels in the Chunnel. The two outside ones are the passenger trains. The small inner one is a guidance train. The guidance train is not used for transportation. Each track is exactly parallel to each other. There are four different train systems in the Chunnel. The Eurostar is a high speed passenger service that connects London, Paris, Brussels and Lille. The Eurotunnel shuttle is a rail ferry service. These shuttles carry cars and vans. These are railcars that allow drivers to drive their vehicles on and off. There are also two Eurotunnel goods service trains. Now you know more about the Chunnel.

Does the sentence \\"In the 20th century after decades of intense warfare and political turmoil terms such as \\"Near East\\", \\"Far East\\" and \\"Middle East\\" were relegated to the experts, especially in the new field of political science.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"Where did the new wave of diplomats often come from?\\"","output":"No, the given sentence does not provide a valid answer to the question \\"Where did the new wave of diplomats often come from?\\" The sentence primarily discusses how terms like \\"Near East,\\" \\"Far East,\\" and \\"Middle East\\" became specialized terminology used by experts, particularly in the field of political science, as a result of 20th-century warfare and political turmoil. To provide a valid answer to the question, we should focus on the factors and sources that contributed to the emergence of new diplomats. A more useful response to that question might look something like this: The new wave of diplomats during the 20th century often came from a variety of educational backgrounds and professional experiences, as the complex international political landscape necessitated a wider range of expertise and skills. Two primary factors contributing to this new wave of diplomats were the end of colonialism and the emergence of newly independent nations, as well as the rise of international organizations and institutions aimed at fostering collaboration and communication among countries. Firstly, the end of World War II and the process of decolonization that followed led to the birth of many new countries around the world. These newly independent nations required diplomatic representatives to engage with other countries and international organizations, promoting their interests and fostering cooperation on various issues. Consequently, many of the new wave diplomats were individuals who had either been involved in national liberation struggles or who possessed knowledge, experience, and connections relevant to their country's position in the global arena. Secondly, the establishment of international institutions and organizations such as the United Nations, World Trade Organization, and the International Monetary Fund called for professional diplomats who had a deep understanding of global politics, economics, and law. Accordingly, the new wave of diplomats often originated from backgrounds in academia, law, business, or military service, utilizing these diverse skills to navigate the intricate sphere of international diplomacy effectively. In summary, while the sentence about the usage of terms like \\"Near East,\\" \\"Far East,\\" and \\"Middle East\\" provides insight into the complexity of 20th-century geopolitics, it does not directly address the origins of the new wave of diplomats. A valid response to the question should focus on the changes in the political landscape and the increased need for skilled professionals with diverse backgrounds capable of managing international relations and representing their countries in a rapidly evolving global environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The only noticeable difference between the two sentences is that the first one does not specify the location, while the second one indicates that the event occurred in Baghdad.

In a tent out in the vast cornfields, a young boy, claiming that the Old Testament-era Canaanite God whom he calls \\"He Who Walks Behind the Rows\\" had spoken to him in his dreams, telling the other children that the sinful and blasphemous adults are the reason for their recent troubles (making a comparison to the corruption in Sodom and Gomorrah). The boy preacher tells the children that they must kill everybody age 19 and over in town; leading them to found a death cult with a prime rule that, once reaching the age of nineteen, one must be sacrificed to the cult's God.Twelve years later in the year 1975, a constantly bickering couple consisting of Vietnam veteran Burt (David Anders) and his wife Vicky (Kandyse McClure) are driving along a back road near Gatlin, Nebraska, planning on celebrating their second honeymoon in California, when a boy named Joseph (Ramington Jennings) stumbles out of the roadside corn and in front of their car. Accidentally running Joseph over, Burt assesses his body and realizes the boy's throat was slashed. After wrapping and placing Joseph's body in the trunk, Burt tells Vicky to wait for him while he looks around with shotgun in hand. Among the corn, Burt finds Joseph's bloodied suitcase and takes it with him back to the car. He and Vicky drive off in search of aid, not realizing they were being watched by Isaac (Preston Bailey), the nine-year-old boy preacher and current cult leader, and his most loyal follower, the 18-year-old warrior Malachai (Daniel Newman).After hearing a group of children giving an evangelical sermon over the radio, Burt and Vicky reach an abandoned gas station before deciding to go to Gatlin after finding the phones non-functional.

Answer:","output":"\\"Whispers of the Cornfield: The Cult of Sinful Harvest\\" The movie title, \\"Whispers of the Cornfield: The Cult of Sinful Harvest\\" captures the essence of the chilling premise that revolves around a small town consumed by a child-led death cult, with the cornfields as the central backdrop. The title primarily highlights the tale of a mysterious, ancient deity called \\"He Who Walks Behind the Rows,\\" whose whispers instigate the grotesque acts that take place in the seemingly serene cornfields.  The words \\"sinful harvest\\" in the title refer to the twisted interpretation of the Old Testament the cult leader, Isaac, uses to justify the murders of adults aged 19 and over and to demonstrate his edgy perspective on Sodom and Gomorrah. This provocative title also embodies the chilling feeling of horror that runs through the story as Burt and Vicky, the bickering couple, become entwined with these sinister happenings, exposing the viewers to a profoundly unsettling scenario.

She had just moved into the neighborhood and her grandmother brought her down to meet me. I hid behind my mother and she hid behind her grandmother,scared to look at each other. Soon we lost the shyness and started playing with each other. In the 7th grade ,I first lost touch with her. She was going through family problems and I _ her to be with the cooler people. None of my new friends liked her as much as I did because they knew she had problems. However, every summer we would always sit at each other's house, watch soap operas and talk about all the boys we like. It was last year when I noticed the problem. I guess I was too doveted in high school to realizeshe needed someone there. Anyway ,she made a new best friend and so did I. Then I didn't know why, but she started cutting herself! She then was diagnosed with clinical depression .At first, I was very upset, but we still stayed in touch. I wanted to be there with new her best friend basically deserted her and people were calling her crazy. Yesterday she came to me and said,\\"I never knew what a best friend was until you, the only person, would stop me cutting. I appreciate your help so much, and you didn't even know you were helping me.\\" We both cried. And I guess a kind of lesson from my life so far is never to give up on your friends. Even if they aren't as cool as others, or people think they are crazy, they need someone there. If you desert them, you will only be guilty yourself. Question: Judy was diagnosed with clinical depression. The most probable cause is  _  . Options: A: She was too devoted in high school B: She was too shy to solve her family problems C: She couldn't learn how to make new friends D: She went through family problems and her friends deserted her A:","output":"The most probable cause of Judy's clinical depression, given the context of the article, is D: She went through family problems and her friends deserted her. The article outlines an intimate portrait of two friends growing up together, but it also highlights instances of miscommunication, abandonment, and societal pressures that Judy experienced. Analyzing the options, Option A indicates the cause being Judy being too devoted in high school. However, it was mentioned in the article that she was having family issues from 7th grade, which suggests that her struggles had an earlier onset than just her high school experience. Option B suggests that Judy was too shy to solve her family problems. Whilst this option might partially address the root cause to the issue, the article did not fully stress on her shyness as a contributing factor to her depression. It's also important to note that it's highly likable that dealing with family problems is beyond the control of young teenagers, shy or not.  Option C states that she couldn't learn how to make new friends. However, the text recounts that even after losing touch in the 7th grade, they made new respective friends which invalidates this option. Option D, on the other hand, encapsulates the significant hardships Judy underwent. The article explicitly states her struggle with family problems and being deserted by her friends. It's important to note that losing close connections like family and friends could potentially trigger feelings of loneliness and rejection, which may play a significant role in sparking or worsening depressive symptoms. Hence, given the available context, option D seems to be the most plausible cause of her clinical depression. It's crucial to remember that several factors could lead to mental health disorders like depression, including biological, psychological, and environmental aspects. It is not just one reason that could lead to depression, it usually a mix of multiple interlinked reasons.

He said a letter from the boss of Serco to David Cameron suggested \\"collusion\\" between business and Downing Street. The letter mentioned how support for EU membership could be \\"mobilised\\" - and also discussed further privatisation of the prison estate. Mr Cameron, meanwhile, has suggested the head of so-called Islamic State may be pleased with a vote to Leave. Speaking in London, the prime minister said Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of so-called Islamic State in Iraq, \\"might be happy\\" in the event of a Leave vote in June, remarks which Mr Johnson said were a \\"bit too much\\". In other EU developments ahead of the 23 June referendum: Vote Leave has seized upon a leaked letter, published in the Daily Mail, from Rupert Soames - the head of the outsourcing firm Serco - to the prime minister on 8 February, in which he refers to a meeting with Mr Cameron the week before. Mr Soames, whose brother is the pro-EU Tory MP Nicholas Soames, wrote he was working with Lord Rose - chair of the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign group - and Lord Chadlington, a long-term ally of Mr Cameron's - with a view to contacting some of the UK's largest firms to persuade them to highlight the perceived risks of leaving the EU in annual reports released before the 23 June poll. \\"Thank you for a very useful meeting last week,\\" he wrote. \\"There were two points I thought I might follow up on. \\"The first is how to mobilise corporates to look carefully at the risks Brexit represents... All public companies are required to set out in their Annual Report an analysis of key risks. During the Scottish referendum campaign, we managed to garner a lot of publicity as a series of companies formally stated in their annual reports that independence for Scotland was a major risk.\\" In his letter, Mr Soames also raised the issues of prison reform and the case for greater private sector involvement in the running of prisons. Serco currently operates six adult prisons in the UK and one juvenile training centre. The letter was written on the same day Mr Cameron made a speech promising the \\"biggest shake-up of prisons since the Victorian era\\", including piloting six \\"reform prisons\\" to tackle high levels of violence and re-offending. Vote Leave said the letter showed Downing Street \\"had been doing deals with businesses to exaggerate the risk of a vote to leave the EU\\". Mr Johnson, the former mayor of London who is now a leading Tory Leave campaigner, said it showed the PM's efforts to renegotiate the EU's membership had been the \\"biggest stitch-up since the Bayeux Tapestry\\". \\"Everybody is allowed to make their point but it is important that we look at what is really going on,\\" he said on a trip to Stafford. \\"When you have what looks like collusion between Downing Street and big Remain-supporting businesses. On the surface, it seems to be suggesting that in exchange for support to remain, there is consideration to be given to the exchanging of lavish public sector contracts. \\"I think we need to a full explanation of what is going on without delay.\\" Britain Stronger in Europe said Mr Johnson was \\"shouting out conspiracy theories\\" when he had been a strong supporter of Serco while he was in charge of London. It accused him of \\"stunning hypocrisy\\" over outsourcing and other EU-related issues. Both No 10 and Serco said they would not comment on the details of a leaked letter. The company, which had a turnover of Â£3.5bn last year and more than Â£100m in contracts with EU institutions, has said before that leaving the EU would be a risk to its business. Speaking to business leaders in London, Mr Cameron said they should \\"feel free\\" to speak out on either side of the argument and not be cowed by the politicised nature of the debate. \\"The British public deserve to hear from business, large and small, about what they think,\\" he said. \\"I don't want anyone to wake up on 24 June and feel they were not given the facts and the figures.\\" The Leave campaign, he suggested, was \\"losing the argument\\" and there was a \\"clear consensus\\" that quitting the EU would be damaging for both the economy and security. Meanwhile, the CBI has mobilised dozens of businesses to write to employees explaining why they want to remain ahead of the 23 June poll. Carolyn Fairbairn, the organisation's director general, said the move was \\"not about telling people how to vote\\" but rather an effort by \\"responsible business leaders\\" to explain to staff the effect Brexit would have on their companies and their livelihoods.

The current action: they are still under the same roof while they work out the details. The hypothesis states:   A. The current action: They are under the same roof while working out the details.   B. The suggested reason: To avoid causing any more financial distress than necessary. So, in both cases the reason for being under the same roof is the same, to avoid unnecessary financial distress. And the action is also the same in both, that they are living under the same roof. Consequently, the hypothesis \\"We are still under the same roof while we work out the details so that we don't cause any more financial distress than necessary\\" is indeed true based on the premise \\"Because we see no sense in causing more financial distress than necessary, we are still under the same roof while we work out the details.\\" This is because both the premise and hypothesis contain the same elements of reasoning and action and correlate in their cause and effect relationship."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The paragraph offers information on the cast, crew, and release date of the film but does not provide any specific details about the audience turnout, particularly on Thanksgiving. To ascertain the accuracy of the claim that moviegoers flocked to the theaters on Thanksgiving to watch A Merry Friggin' Christmas, one would need access to more data regarding the box office performance of the movie, specifically on Thanksgiving day and its surrounding time frame. Factors such as marketing efforts, movie reviews, and competing film releases could also play an essential role in gauging audience turnout. Furthermore, Thanksgiving occurs on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States, making it consistently later than the November 7th release date of the film. While it is possible that people might watch the movie on Thanksgiving after its initial release earlier in the month, there is still no data provided to support the hypothesis.

Statue of Liberty from World Trade Center In July 1986 I was honored to be a part of a group of photographers from the Los Angeles Times to report on the Liberty Weekend festivities in New York City. To refresh your memory, Liberty Weekend was a huge outdoor party for the people of New York to reopen and rededicate the Statue of Liberty and celebrate its centenary. Photographers from our group were positioned all over New York. Iris Schneider was across the Hudson River in New Jersey, Gary Friedman was on Governors Island, Bob Greiser and Bob Chamberlin were roaming the streets throughout the city and I was assigned to be atop the World Trade Center. Our photo editors had no idea how acrophobic – fearful of heights – I am. So trying to be a good team member, I faced my fears with a candy bar and made the daily trek to this very tall, 110-story building. For nearly a week I toted several cases containing 300 and 600 mm telephoto lenses, several camera bags, two tripods, clamps and a monopod through the subways and into the tower basement. In the basement there were great little deli stands selling sandwiches and bagels, amid an amazing little underground city with shops. I was in awe of this place. Once inside the building, I had to use three sets of very fast elevators to get to the rooftop. Each day I walked past the busy offices filled with people. The views were spectacular and this building felt powerful. Once I made it to the rooftop, I took a deep breath, commanded my knees to stop knocking and carved out a little spot against a very sizable railing with a view across the Hudson that seemed to go on forever. The Statue of Liberty looked very small from my vantage point. For several days I made my trek to the rooftop of the tallest building in New York. A pile of candy bars couldn’t make my acrophobia go away. One day while I was arriving with my gear, I was gripped with fear and anger when I saw several New York cops standing on the ledge of the building while they laughed and took pictures of each other — yikes! One false move and they were dead. Unfortunately, as soon as I got my camera out, they jumped down so I couldn’t record the moment. I was horrified, but I guess my fears started to melt a little that day. On the evening of July 3, 1986, President Reagan pushed the ceremonial button to reopen and reilluminate the Statue of Liberty, followed by a very long and illustrious fireworks show. We were still shooting film in those days and had to use some very long shutter speeds to capture the bursts, and to expose for the ships in the harbor. I didn’t notice it at the time, but the very tall tower was swaying in the breeze a little. All of my cameras and telephoto lenses were either locked down with tripods or clamped to the railings. I used a cable release, and there was movement in many of the frames. Very spooky. The next day, July 4, tall ships, warships and private sailing vessels from all over the world cruised past the Statue Of Liberty during Operation Sail. By now, most of my fears had gone away and a series of memorable moments filled that void. The beautiful sights on the Hudson River and the harbor below me were captivating and historic. On my final evening, I paused for a few minutes in a quiet place near the subway to study the map, just to make sure I was getting on the correct train, when a familiar voice broke the silence. Maybe I was in a state of delirium from lack of sleep and hard work, or maybe it was all the candy bars and coffee, but a voice that sounded like Kermit the Frog asked, “Pardon me sir, do you know which train will take me uptown … [to a certain street] ?” I turned around to see who this person was – who went with the very Muppet-sounding voice – and it was Jim Henson himself. I stumbled for a moment and told him I was sorry. “I come from Los Angeles, and I have no idea.… I’m trying to get back to my hotel,” I said. With that, Henson said goodbye and disappeared into a group of people. Photojournalists live vicariously. We step in and out of people’s lives and capture moments in time, saving them on film and in digital formats. For a week in 1986, I walked past the desks and offices filled with countless men and women working in the World Trade Center towers. I bought food in the basement shops. I stood on the rooftop and witnessed the beauty of a celebration. I watched, witnessed and never thought for a moment how fate would play its hand 15 years later. Recently I scanned and saved a series of pictures from the negatives and slides from Statue of Liberty Weekend that I had stored and saved in a three-ring binder. The fears that I overcame on that rooftop were renewed, but the beauty of the Statue of Liberty and the values it stands for are still strong. My long days and nights working on the rooftop of the World Trade Center have become another very strange but amazing memory to file away with so many others.

Summarize: Anderson missed the 241-run first-Test win with a calf strain but is likely to replace Chris Woakes for the match at Newlands, which begins on Saturday. \\"My thought is you'd probably go with him, so fingers crossed he comes to us and says his body's feeling good,\\" said England coach Trevor Bayliss. South Africa pace bowler Dale Steyn misses out with a shoulder injury. Steyn, ranked as the number one Test bowler in the world, twice left the field during the first Test in Durban and will be replaced by Kagiso Rabada. Another Proteas pace bowler, Kyle Abbott, faces a fitness test on Friday, while wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock could be included to allow AB de Villiers to concentrate solely on batting. Anderson worked hard in the nets during the Durban Test, building up to a full six-over spell in the middle on Wednesday morning. The 33-year-old, England's leading Test wicket-taker, has 18 victims in five Tests in two previous tours of South Africa. Without him, England were still able to bowl South Africa out for 214 and 174 in the first Test in Durban, with Moeen Ali taking six wickets in the match, Steven Finn six and Stuart Broad five. Broad took the first over in both innings in Durban and former England spinner Graeme Swann has backed the Nottinghamshire seamer to lead the attack even when Anderson returns. \\"Jimmy's performance would not be affected by not being the official leader of the attack,\\" Swann told BBC Radio 5 live. \\"I'd say we are going to hand that to Stuart now because we are looking for leaders and future captains in this team. \\"Stuart Broad is a good option for that. Jimmy is world class and we can wrap him in cotton wool from now on, not play him in every Test match, not in everything. \\"It may sound ridiculous that our highest wicket-taker ever is stripped of a role, but this is just to pump up Stuart's tyres. Jimmy is still the best bowler.\\" Bayliss has welcomed the impact made by Nick Compton, who made 85 and 49 at Durban in his first Test since May 2013. There were suggestions that the 32-year-old Middlesex batsman's intense nature was the reason he was dropped after only nine Test appearances, even though he scored two centuries in that time. \\"I'm not going to judge anyone on what went before,\\" Bayliss said. \\"Everyone is allowed to get better and so far around the squad Nick has been fantastic, fitted in really well with the squad, and obviously batted very well. \\"What Nick has proven at the moment is that, of the guys around, he's in our best top three. \\"In Test cricket there is a role for someone who is able to get through those tough periods and make hundreds. We'd take that with our team at the moment, a lot of guys that play shots in the middle order. \\"If those guys can bat around Cook and Compton that could be the way ahead for us.\\" South Africa are without a win in their last seven Tests, which equals their longest sequence without a victory since their re-admission to international cricket in 1991. De Kock, who averages 33 from his six Tests, the last of which was in July, could return to keep wicket having made a hundred in the recent round of domestic four-day matches to follow a half-century against England for South Africa A. De Villiers dropped two catches behind the stumps during England's second innings of the first Test and there have been concerns over the star batsman's workload. Skipper Hashim Amla has made only 94 runs in his last eight Test innings but has stated his desire to remain as captain. \\"I've enjoyed every minute of it and it's just been disappointing not to get the runs,\\" he said. \\"In the middle of a Test series like this there is more hunger to get runs on the board.\\" South Africa (from): H Amla (c), Q De Kock (wkt), AB De Villiers (wkt), K Abbott, T Bavuma, JP Duminy, F Du Plessis, D Elgar, M Morkel, C Morris, D Piedt, Rabada, R Rossouw, S Van Zyl, H Viljoen.

Umpires: A Dar (Pak), B Oxenford (Aus) Third umpire: R Tucker (Aus) Match referee: R Madugalle (Sri Lanka) Summary:","output":"Here's a little simpler version of the story:  Anderson didn't play in the first game because his calf muscle was hurting, but now he feels better and he'll probably replace Chris Woakes in the next game, which will start on Saturday. The coach of England's team, Trevor Bayliss, seems quite hopeful about it.  A player from South Africa's team, Dale Steyn, won't play because he hurt his shoulder. He's really good at the game, but he'll be replaced by Kagiso Rabada. Another player from South Africa's team, Kyle Abbott, will have a test on Friday to see if he's fit enough to play, and Quinton de Kock might also get to play, which means AB de Villiers will only have to bat.  Even without Anderson, England's team was able to win against South Africa by getting all their players out twice in the first game, with Moeen Ali, Steven Finn and Stuart Broad playing well. Even when Anderson comes back, people say Stuart Broad should still be the one to lead the team.  Nick Compton, who scored a lot of runs in the first game, is being praised by the coach. Compton hasn't played a game since May 2013, but even then, he did really well.  South Africa hasn't won a game in their last seven games, which is a big deal since they're usually a really good team. De Kock might get to play as a wicketkeeper (the one who catches the ball behind the batsman) because he's good at the game and they think AB de Villiers has too much work to do. Their captain, Hashim Amla, hasn't scored a lot recently, but he wants to keep being the captain.  That's pretty much it!

Present-day Powder River County was probably first entered by Europeans in the early 1800s in the form of French fur trappers. In the summer of 1865, the United States government sent over 2,000 U.S. soldiers into the Powder River country to combat Native Americans from the Cheyenne people, Lakota people, and Arapaho people tribes. From September 1-15, 1865, the Powder River Expedition (1865) battled Native Americans in the Powder River Battles (1865) near the future site of Broadus. On March 17, 1876, the Battle of Powder River occurred in the south-central part of the county, about  southwest of Broadus. In June 1876 six companies of the 7th Cavalry Regiment (United States) led by Major Marcus Reno marched along the Powder River nearly to the mouth of the Little Powder before turning west toward the Battle of Little Bighorn. On November 1, 1878, Powderville, Montana became the first establishment in the county, as the Powder River Telegraph Station, on the Fort Keogh to Deadwood, South Dakota telegraph line. On April 5, 1879, the Mizpah Creek Incidents began near the Powderville telegraph station in the extreme northern part of the county. In the early 1880s, a large area of Southeastern Montana became Custer County, Montana, including the present area encompassed by Powder River County. In February 1900, the Broadus post office was established, named after the Broaddus family. In October 1918, publication of a newspaper, the Broadus Independent (now called the Powder River Examiner), began in Broadus, and is still published today.

This is not a cheap hobby, but don't be too extravagant with your budget when looking for a bike. In the 300-600 price range, you can expect to get a bike you need to put a little money and work into. Options: 1. Also, saving won't cost you too much. Save money in case the bike you have is not the right one for you. 2. If you spend less than that, you will be harnessed a bike that needs a lot of work, effort, and money. Also, don't spend you entire budget on the bike, as there will always be unexpected costs. 3. So before applying, write a short description of the bike. Have a friend look at it and ask for an approximate price. 4. The next time you decide to buy your bike, you need to determine how much you will be willing to spend on it. Advertising your bike in the local papers can help you save some money. The answer is:","output":"2. If you spend less than that, you will be harnessed a bike that needs a lot of work, effort, and money. Also, don't spend your entire budget on the bike, as there will always be unexpected costs. Option 1 is incorrect because it suggests that saving won't cost too much, but it doesn't relate to the fact that the chosen bike might not be the right one for the user. Option 3 is not appropriate since it talks about writing a description and getting an approximate price from a friend, which doesn't add any value to the context of choosing a budget. Option 4 is wrong because it talks about advertising the bike in local papers, which is not related to setting a budget for buying a first dirtbike. That's why option 2 is the correct choice, detailing the importance of not spending the entire budget on the bike and considering the additional expenses that might come along."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Barrie?","output":"Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure is the animated film that features a main character originating from a play by J.M. Barrie. It is a direct-to-video movie that is part of Disney's Tinker Bell film series, based on Disney's adaptation of the character Tinker Bell from J.M. Barrie's 1904 play, \\"Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up,\\" and its 1911 novelization, \\"Peter and Wendy.\\" The character Tinker Bell originated from these works by Barrie, where she played a pivotal role as a fairy companion of Peter Pan in the fictional realm of Neverland. This animated film, released in 2009, was a sequel to Disney's 2008 movie \\"Tinker Bell,\\" and followed Tinker Bell's journey as she embarked on a grand quest to find a lost treasure. The narrative took Tinker Bell on an adventure filled with friendship, discovery, and self-realization through her interactions with new characters and selfless acts for the benefit of her world, known as Pixie Hollow. Tinker Bell, being the main character of the film, originated from the works of J.M. Barrie, and has since then become a recognizable and well-loved fictional icon in her own right, separate from her connection to Peter Pan. On the other hand, Summer Wars is a 2009 Japanese animated science fiction film, directed by Mamoru Hosoda and produced by Madhouse, which has no connection to J.M. Barrie's works or Tinker Bell. The story revolves around a young mathematician, Kenji Koiso, who becomes involved in a complex virtual world called OZ, where users from around the globe interact with each other and engage in various activities. As a rogue artificial intelligence threatens to wreak havoc, Kenji and other characters must work together to prevent catastrophe both in the digital world and real-life consequences. In conclusion, Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure is the 2009 animated film that showcases a main character, Tinker Bell, that originated from a play by J.M. Barrie. It is inspired by Barrie's \\"Peter Pan\\" and the world he created with Neverland and its inhabitants.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First question: How anonymous is the Anonymous hacker group? The Anonymous hacker group is a loosely affiliated and decentralized international network of \\"hacktivists\\" who perform cyberattacks on various government, corporate, and individual targets. Due to its organization structure and how participants operate within it, the group is somewhat anonymous. However, the degree of anonymity varies depending on several factors: 1. Modes of communication: Anonymous participants often use secure and encrypted communication channels, such as encrypted email services, virtual private networks (VPNs), proxy servers, or the Tor Network. These methods make it more difficult for law enforcement and other entities to track them. 2. Operational security (OPSEC): The anonymity of the hacker group is directly linked to the level of operational security employed by its participants. Those that practice good OPSEC, like using pseudonyms, avoiding sharing personal information, and using secure operating systems like Tails, are more likely to remain anonymous. 3. Skill level of participants: Some participants in Anonymous are highly skilled in computer security, cryptography, and other techniques that help maintain anonymity online. Those with less knowledge in these areas may be more susceptible to being identified. 4. Law enforcement and counterintelligence efforts: Even though Anonymous is somewhat anonymous, participants are not immune to being caught. Many instances have occurred where individuals associated with Anonymous have been arrested, prosecuted, and convicted. Second question: How is Anonymous (Hacker Group) so successful? Anonymous' success can be attributed to a combination of factors: 1. Decentralized nature: The group is a loosely connected network without any known official leadership, which makes it difficult for authorities to pinpoint any specific individual or core group responsible for their actions. This decentralized structure also allows for operational flexibility. 2. Collective power: Because Anonymous attracts people from different parts of the world with diverse skills and expertise, the group can tackle a wide range of targets with varying degrees of difficulty. Their collective efforts increase efficiency and effectiveness. 3. Grassroots activism: Anonymous is often motivated by a sense of activism, fighting against perceived injustice, or espousing certain political or social ideologies. This resonates with a wide audience and encourages more people to participate or support their efforts. 4. High-profile targets: The group has successfully targeted high-profile organizations and individuals, such as governments, corporations, and churches, which further amplifies their message and increases public awareness of their actions. 5. Media attention: Anonymous often uses striking visuals, such as the Guy Fawkes mask, and melodramatic language to grab public attention and increase its visibility. This media attention can contribute to the group's success and inspire supporters. To answer your last question, no, these two questions are not asking the same thing. While both questions deal with the Anonymous hacker group, they address different aspects. The first question focuses on the degree of anonymity that its members can achieve, while the second question explores the reasons behind the group's success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Twitter was buzzing Thursday morning with news that several airlines are flying doctors and nurses to Haiti free of charge to help with relief efforts there in the wake of Tuesday's devastating earthquake. The only problem: The rumors are false, an American Airlines spokesman says. \\"Last night's hoax on Twitter about American and JetBlue flying doctors and nurses to Haiti for free was just that -- a hoax. We don't know who is responsible, but it's a very low thing to do,\\" airline spokesman Tim Smith said in e-mails sent Thursday. Twitter users also circulated a rumor that UPS would ship for free any package under 50 lbs. to Haiti. In a blog post Wednesday on UPS's Web site, a spokeswoman debunked the rumor and said that destruction of Haiti's roads and communications networks \\"means our own shipping services to Haiti are on hold.\\" And I think that's where these rumors are coming from,\\" OPTIONS: - American spokeswoman Alison Croyle said. - American Airlines spokeswoman Alison Croyle said. - CNN spokeswoman Alison Croyle said. - Haiti spokeswoman Alison Croyle said. - JetBlue spokeswoman Alison Croyle said. - Tim Smith spokeswoman Alison Croyle said. - Twitter spokeswoman Alison Croyle said. - UPS spokeswoman Alison Croyle said.","output":"American Airlines spokeswoman Alison Croyle said. Explanation: The correct answer is \\"American Airlines spokeswoman Alison Croyle said\\" because the paragraph is discussing the false rumors about American Airlines and JetBlue flying doctors and nurses to Haiti for free.

Lyra Belacqua, an orphan raised in a college in Oxford, England, and her dÃ¦mon Pantalaimon (Pan) witness a Magisterium agent poison her uncle's bottle of Tokay. Lyra then warns her uncle, Lord Asriel, who instructs her to remain in hiding. Lyra watches Asriel give a presentation regarding Dust, a particle that the Magisterium has forbidden the mention of. The college gives Asriel a grant to fund a northern expedition. At dinner, Lyra meets Mrs. Coulter, who insists on taking Lyra north as her assistant. Before Lyra leaves, the Master of the college entrusts her with the only remaining alethiometer, a compass-like artifact that reveals the truth. The Magisterium has destroyed all the others. He instructs her to keep it secret, especially from Mrs. Coulter. At Mrs. Coulter's house in a city that resembles a futuristic London, Lyra mentions 'dust', a type of mysterious particle. This puts Mrs. Coulter on edge and she warns Lyra never to mention it again, and also insists that she leave the bag containing the aleithiometer. Mrs. Coulter's dÃ¦mon (a golden monkey) attacks Pan, causing Lyra to give in. Lyra and Pan discover that Mrs. Coulter is head of the General Oblation Board, the \\"Gobblers\\", who have been kidnapping local children.

A teaching assistant has escaped jail after sending lewd texts and naked photos of herself to a 14-year-old pupil. Shelley Trinder, 30, sent hundreds of sexually explicit messages to the male student at a school where she worked in Telford, Shropshire, a court heard. She also sent him a series of naked photos - including an image of herself using a sex toy. Spared jail: Shelley Trinder, 30, sent hundreds of sexually explicit messages to a teenage pupil, Shrewsbury Crown Court (pictured) heard. She has been handed a 20-month jail sentence, suspended for two years. The mother of two admitted one charge of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity at Shrewsbury Crown Court on Friday. However, she has now been spared jail after a judge handed her a 20-month sentence, suspended for two years. Trinder began sending Facebook messages to children at the school in 2011, before singling out the teenage boy, the court heard. Contact: Trinder sent the student lewd texts every day, saying she was 'horny' and describing what sexual acts she wanted to do to him (file picture) She then gave the pupil her Blackberry pin number and sent him a topless photo of herself - with only her arms covering her breasts. She later messaged the boy a nude image of the lower half of her body, before sending him a photo of herself using a sex toy. Trinder also sent the student lewd texts every day - saying she was 'horny' and describing what sexual acts she wanted to do to him, the court heard. Raj Punia, prosecuting, said the school had spoken to Trinder about her behaviour in July 2011 after discovering she was chatting to pupils on Facebook. 'She was warned she would be putting her job at risk if she continued,' she said. 'In November it was brought to the attention of the authorities that there were inappropriate activities going on. 'She gave him (teenage boy) the pin number for her Blackberry phone so he could text her for free. 'He. sent her a message saying \\"hi\\" and instead of ignoring the message or. telling him it was inappropriate to text her, she encouraged this. contact. 'One night in August 2011 she sent him a message saying she was out drinking and said she was \\"horny\\".' Sentencing Trinder, Judge Robin Onions described her as 'totally unsuited' to a career in teaching. 'The school appears to have acted completely properly and warned her and she just ignored the warnings,' he said. Dismissed: Telford and Wrekin Council (pictured), which employed Trinder, said she was fired in March 2012. 'He was a remarkably vulnerable pupil and she was clearly sexually attracted to him. 'In many ways this is a classic grooming case, but they did meet and didnâ€™t have sexual contact. 'If there had been any contact, she would have gone into custody and it would have been measured in years. 'This young lady is remarkably immature and totally unsuited to a career in teaching. If she does anything like this again it will be prison.' Trinder has been banned from working with children for life and placed under a sexual offences prevention order for seven years. She has also been handed a two-year supervision order with 10-year notification requirements and a three-month curfew. Speaking after the case, Nigel Newman, a spokesman for Telford and Wrekin Council which employed Trinder, said the teaching assistant was fired in March last year. He said: 'The individual was suspended from her employment with the council as a support assistant in February 2012 as soon as we were made aware of the allegation arising from the incident which led to her being charged by police. 'Following this, disciplinary proceedings were held which resulted in her dismissal from her job with the council in March 2013.'

Article: Bowing is a very important custom in Japan. Unlike people in many other countries, they greet each other by bowing instead of shaking hands. It is impolite not to return a bow to whoever bows to you. Bowing has many functions in one. It expresses the feeling of respect, thanks, regret, and so on. You can bow when you say, \\"thank you\\", \\"sorry\\", \\"hello\\", \\"goodbye\\", \\"congratulations\\", \\"excuse me\\", \\"good morning\\", and more. Bowing seems simple, but there are different ways of bowing. Bowing techniques vary from a small nod of the head to a long, 90-degree bow. It depends on the social position or age of the person you bow to. If your opposite is of higher social position or older than yourself, you are supposed to bow deeper and longer than him or her.

Options are:  + Energy for cell processes is released..  + Oxygen is released for photosynthesis..  + Cells undergo decomposition..  + Nutrients are excreted to prevent the buildup of body fat..","output":"The correct answer to the question is: Energy for cell processes is released. Cellular respiration is a series of metabolic processes that take place within the cells of living organisms, during which energy stored in organic molecules, primarily glucose, is converted into a more readily usable form, known as adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Cellular respiration is essential for all living organisms because it provides the energy needed to sustain their cellular functions. The process of cellular respiration mainly involves three main stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation. 1. Glycolysis: It is the first stage of cellular respiration that takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell. During glycolysis, one molecule of glucose (a six-carbon sugar) is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate (a three-carbon compound). This process generates two molecules of ATP (used as energy for cellular processes) and two molecules of NADH (an electron carrier molecule). 2. Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle or Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle): It takes place in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells or the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells. The two molecules of pyruvate formed during glycolysis are converted into acetyl-CoA, which then enters the citric acid cycle. In this cycle, acetyl-CoA is completely oxidized, releasing carbon dioxide as a waste product. During the citric acid cycle, a small amount of ATP is produced, along with NADH and FADH2 (another electron carrier molecule). 3. Oxidative Phosphorylation: It is the final stage of cellular respiration and takes place in the inner membrane of mitochondria in eukaryotic cells or the plasma membrane of prokaryotic cells. This process involves the transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen molecules through a series of protein complexes called the electron transport chain. This electron transfer process creates a gradient of protons across the membrane, which drives the synthesis of a larger number of ATP molecules through a process known as chemiosmosis. In summary, cellular respiration results in the release of energy for cell processes in the form of ATP, which can be utilized by the cell to carry out various functions such as growth, maintenance, and reproduction. The byproducts of cellular respiration are carbon dioxide and water, which are excreted from the organism as waste products. Oxygen is not released during cellular respiration. Instead, it is consumed as the final electron acceptor during the process of oxidative phosphorylation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person that was evacuated from Leningrad? ?  The Leningrad première of Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7 took place on 9 August 1942 during the Second World War, while the city of Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) was under siege by Nazi German forces. Dmitri Shostakovich had intended the piece to be premièred by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra, but because of the siege, that group was evacuated from the city, as was the composer himself. The world première of the symphony was held on 5 March in Kuybyshev with the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra. The Leningrad première was performed by the surviving musicians of the Leningrad Radio Orchestra, supplemented with military performers. Most of the musicians were suffering from starvation, which made rehearsing difficult: musicians frequently collapsed during rehearsals, and three died. The orchestra was able to play the symphony all the way through only once before the concert. Despite the poor condition of the performers, the concert was highly successful, prompting an hour-long ovation. The concert was supported by a Soviet military offensive, code-named Squall, intended to silence German forces during the performance. The symphony was broadcast to the German lines by loudspeaker as a form of psychological warfare. The Leningrad première was considered by music critics to be one of the most important artistic performances of the war because of its psychological and political effects. The conductor concluded that \\"in that moment, we triumphed over the soulless Nazi war machine\\". Reunion concerts featuring surviving musicians were convened in 1964 and 1992 to commemorate the event.

Whether we are talking about our day, learning manners, having serious discussions, or laughing until we spit our drinks - it is where grow. There have been horrible nights at the table, where we shared bad news. There have been fabulous nights where we celebrated successes and talked about exciting things to come. There have been nights where the kids can see that Mom and Dad are “at odds” and nights where they see us push that aside and joke with each other for the sake of saving the evening. When they were little, we did “About Your Day” - one funny thing, one sad thing, one new thing you learned. Now, they are all teenagers, and the conversations just seem to flow, with never enough time to fit it all in before someone has to rush off to work, to study, or to get ready for bed because we are eating “after practice”. My twins will be Seniors next year, and I know that our table will look a little different from now on.

Pierre Benjamin Monteux (pronounced [pjɛʁ mɔ̃.tø]; 4 April 1875 – 1 July 1964) was a French (later American) conductor. After violin and viola studies, and a decade as an orchestral player and occasional conductor, he began to receive regular conducting engagements in 1907.  He came to prominence when, for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company between 1911 and 1914, he conducted the world premieres of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and other prominent works including Petrushka, Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, and Debussy's Jeux. Thereafter he directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century. From 1917 to 1919 Monteux was the principal conductor of the French repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He led the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1919–24), Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra (1924–34), Orchestre Symphonique de Paris (1929–38) and San Francisco Symphony (1936–52).  In 1961, aged eighty-six, he accepted the chief conductorship of the London Symphony Orchestra, a post which he held until his death three years later.  Although known for his performances of the French repertoire, his chief love was the music of German composers, above all Brahms. He disliked recording, finding it incompatible with spontaneity, but he nevertheless made a substantial number of records. Monteux was well known as a teacher. In 1932 he began a conducting class in Paris, which he developed into a summer school that was later moved to his summer home in Les Baux in the south of France. After moving permanently to the US in 1942, and taking American citizenship, he founded a school for conductors and orchestral musicians in Hancock, Maine. Among his students in France and America who went on to international fame were Lorin Maazel, Igor Markevitch, Neville Marriner, Seiji Ozawa, André Previn  and David Zinman. The school in Hancock has continued since Monteux's death. The answer to this question is:","output":"Monteux"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If you have an underlying medical issue or a blood disease that prevents your body from producing red blood cells, you won't be able to avoid anemia on your own. Seeking medical help to understand and treat the disease is the best way forward. Anemia that is not preventable can be congenital or caused by a number of conditions including: chronic disease, bone marrow disease, sickle cell and aplastic anemia, and   thalassemia. Some diseases prevent the body from making the correct number of red blood cells. The most common of these is kidney disease. If you have a disease that makes you prone to anemia, consulting your physician for appropriate treatment is absolutely necessary.  If you have anemia from an intestinal condition such as Crohn’s or Celiac, you will need to speak to your doctor and develop an effective treatment plan. If you have aplastic anemia or anemia caused by cancer, you may need a bone marrow transplant to help your body produce more red blood cells.  If you have hemolytic anemia, you may need to avoid certain medications and take immunosuppressant drugs to boost your red blood cell count.  Eating a lot of iron and avoiding situations that may cause injury could also help. In some cases, anemia is inherited in the form of a blood disease. Knowing that you or family members have the disease is the important first step to getting proper treatment and managing the condition. The following blood diseases cause anemia:  People suffering from sickle cell anemia have red blood cells shaped like sickles, which makes the cells prone to getting stuck in blood vessels and blocking blood flow. Sickle cell anemia can be very serious and very painful if not treated.  Thalassemia causes the body to make less hemoglobin than normal, leading to anemia.  Aplastic anemia causes the body to stop making enough new blood cells, including red blood cells. This can be caused by outside factors like certain cancer treatments, exposure to toxic chemicals, drugs, infections, and other causes. What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a short, simple version of a longer piece of information. In the case of this article, the summary is that some types of anemia cannot be prevented or treated just by eating healthy food. These types of anemia can be caused by different medical problems, like blood diseases or kidney disease. People with these problems need to talk to their doctors to find the best way to help their bodies make enough red blood cells.

Context: Before we got married my husband and I lived in 4 different apartments all within the span of one year. The worst one of all of them was actually a great apartment, but our upstairs neighbors drove us positively insane. A list of their common antics: Blasting movies/music with the bass turned all the way up into the small hours of the morning, in their bedroom, which was directly above our bedroom Stomping, all day, every day, no matter what, always stomping. Sometimes running full speed around their apartment. It was a 1 bedroom and they had at least 4 adults (two couples) and at least 2 kids living there. They also always had company over. It was a nonsmoking complex but they smoked on their porch and tossed their butts over their balcony, which would leave them landing in our little porch. Constantly came out to find butts and trash in our potted plants and all over the ground. We had to call the sheriff on them once because one of the couples living there got in a very loud, very obvious domestic violence situation. We heard them screaming and throwing each other around. At one point the man smashed her head through the wall. The kicker was when they brought home one of those mini motorcycles and put it out on their porch. Their porch was made of slatted wood so there were gaps between the boards. The damn bike started leaking fuel (racing fuel no less) through the slats and on our porch (and all over our stuff). Ruined a table, some laundry I had air-drying out there and killed a few of our plants. Not only that but while this was happening they were throwing their butts down onto our porch too. Could have started a fire. Then there was the spitting. They would spit over the edge of their balcony and we complained so they started spitting THROUGH the floor boards so it was definitely intentional. I have never experienced a more trashy group of people. So glad to be out of that apartment and away from them now. Question: How does the writer feel about the stability of the family living above?

The sentence clearly identifies who were taking slaves as concubines during the time period specified. It mentions three groups of people: white slaveholders, their sons, and other powerful white men. These people engaged in the practice of taking slave women as concubines in spite of anti-miscegenation laws, which were designed to prevent this. In the context of this sentence, \\"concubines\\" refers to enslaved women who were used for sexual purposes by their white masters. These relationships were often non-consensual and exploitative, as the enslaved women had no agency or control over their own bodies and could not refuse their masters' advances. Anti-miscegenation laws were legislated in many states during the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries to maintain racial separation and reinforce white supremacy. These laws prohibited intermarriage and sexual relations between people of different races. However, the existence of these laws did not deter white slaveholders, their sons, or other powerful white men from engaging in sexual relationships with enslaved women of African descent and fathering multiracial children.

Article:The contracts mean maximum flexibility for the employer and minimum security for the worker - the sense of David being, well, thoroughly crushed by Goliath  - undervalued, underpaid and thrown to the wolves when it suits. It's all pretty fertile territory for the man who's built his economic case around the \\"cost-of-living crisis\\". Labour leader Ed Miliband has bemoaned zero-hours contracts in the past - but Newsnight has learned that on Friday he'll attempt to turn words into policy. Speaking in Scotland - in what's being billed as his first attempt to make his mark on the pro-Union side of the independence debate - he'll offer legislation under a Labour government to stop what he's called an exploitative practice. He will promise some key measures: Mr Miliband will say the key to these policies is that they are UK-wide (a nod, then, to No to Scottish independence), to ensure that the economies both sides of the border don't try to undercut each other in a race to the bottom. So far so good. It'll chime with a lot of people pulling pints, stacking shelves, building houses and so on. But it doesn't take a genius to spot where such a plan might unravel. Who's to stop a boss, for example, offering five months' work instead of six to get around the legislation. Who's to stop a boss firing a worker just short of a year in, if they suddenly fear a little bit too much commitment coming round the corner? Critics also point out that the realities of life for those who work under zero-hours contracts mean few may be willing to stand their ground and fight for their rights. They often apply to the vulnerable - young workers, first-timers - those generally less likely to flex their muscle against all-powerful boss. Mr Miliband may be the first to put a legislative pledge in writing - but he's certainly not the first to raise the zero-hours contracts issue. Last week UKIP leader Nigel Farage told the Express he wanted to \\"tackle\\" the practice, saying: \\"I do not believe in banning zero-hours contracts. But I do believe there is a very strong case for expecting large employers to sign up to a tough code of conduct as to how they are applied. \\"For instance, if an employee proves reliable enough to be working for a big company for a year or more then there should be an expectation that the company will offer him or her a permanent position.\\" And this is where the politics gets interesting. Mr Miliband and Mr Farage may be seeking the same kind of voter - badly paid, disenfranchised, frustrated with the perceived big, bad corporate world. What the other two main parties do in response will be key. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable has already ruled out a complete ban on the contracts and the Conservatives are unlikely to want to take employers on with this one either. But payday loans and energy prices - both of which the coalition has acted upon - began as \\"Labour issues\\". Mr Miliband's ideas on zero-hours contracts may start by being rubbished and ridiculed. Yet could they also end up influencing his opponents? See my full report on Newsnight on BBC Two from 22:30 BST on Thursday and on the BBC iPlayer later. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The article highlights the issue of zero-hours contracts, which provide maximum flexibility for employers and minimum security for workers, leading to feelings of being undervalued and underpaid. Labour leader Ed Miliband plans to turn his opposition to zero-hours contracts into policy, offering legislation under a Labour government to stop what he calls an exploitative practice. He proposes several key measures, including restrictions on the use of zero-hours contracts and guaranteeing certain rights to employees who have been working under such contracts for an extended period of time. These policies are intended to be UK-wide, addressing both sides of the Scottish independence debate.  Critics argue that implementation of these policies may be difficult, as employers can find ways around the legislation, and workers on zero-hours contracts, who are often young and vulnerable, may not be willing to stand their ground and fight for their rights. The article also mentions UKIP leader Nigel Farage's proposal of a tough code of conduct for large employers using zero-hours contracts, which he believes should not be banned but regulated. The response of the two main parties, the Lib Dems and the Conservatives, will be crucial as they have ruled out a complete ban on zero-hours contracts but have acted on other issues brought up by Labour, such as payday loans and energy prices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Today, we are going to learn how to draw a simple graph using a plus (+) shape. Are you excited? Let's get started! First, let's talk about the function. The function is like a special rule that tells us how to use numbers to make a picture. We will use this rule to make our graph.  Now, let's see how we can draw our graph: 1. You know how to draw a big plus (+) sign, right? We will do that on a piece of paper. The place where the two crossed lines meet is called the \\"origin\\". It's like a secret meeting point of the lines. 2. It's time to number our graph! You know how to count, so this should be easy for you. Starting at the origin, count 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. to the right along the horizontal line (that's the line that goes from left to right). Do the same going to the left. Now, also count along the vertical line (that's the line that goes up and down) by counting 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. going up and doing the same going down. These numbers will help us find where to put our dots for the graph. 3. Next, we are going to use our special function rule to find the \\"y value\\" for 2 or 3 \\"x values\\". The x values are like the numbers we counted on the horizontal line and the y values are like the numbers we counted on the vertical line. Our function will tell us which y-number a dot will be at when we choose an x-number. 4. Now that we have our number pairs from our function, we are going to draw the graph points! Let's say our pair is (2, 3). This means we go to the number 2 on the horizontal line and then we go up to the number 3 on the vertical line and draw a little dot. Yay! We found our first graph point. Do that with each pair you’ve got from the function. 5. In the end, it's time to remove the imaginary lines. This means the lines on your graph paper that don't need to be part of your graph - we erase them or cover them up so that we just see our + shape and graph points. And that's it!

Question: suppose the sediment is picked up by the ocean tide happens, how will it affect the wind or water will carry the sediment.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"When sediment is picked up by the ocean tide, its transportation, deposition, and potential impact on the wind or water carrying it can be influenced by several factors. These factors can contribute to a more, less, or no significant effect on subsequent processes. 1. More effect: Suppose that the ocean tide carries the sediment towards a coastal area with stronger wind currents. In this case, the sediment's deposition onshore can enhance the wind's capacity to pick up and transport the sediment further. The sediment particles can potentially influence wind patterns or interact with the local atmosphere, changing the wind dynamics or causing localized turbulence. This results in an amplification of the transportation and potential deposition at newer or further locations, contributing to a more significant effect on the overall sediment movement process. 2. Less effect: If the ocean tide picks up sediment and transports it into deeper waters or a stagnant location without any additional wind or water factors coming into play, the sediment's movement may be limited. As a result, the sediment might settle or become trapped, and the impact on subsequent wind or water currents transporting the sediment will be less significant. 3. No effect: In some cases, the ocean tide might carry and deposit sediment in an area where the conditions for wind or water currents remain unchanged. In this scenario, the perturbation of the ocean tide may not have any substantial effect on subsequent wind or water currents carrying the sediment. The sediment might be deposited and later picked up again without any significant change in the movement, transportation, and deposition process. In summary, the effect of sediment being picked up by the ocean tide on subsequent wind or water currents carrying the sediment can vary depending on the location, environmental conditions, and other factors that may come into play. The influence might be more, less, or have no significant effect, ultimately shaping the overall sediment movement process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The viewer is rushed out of the door along with Milo Thatch (voiced well by Michael J. Fox) and is left thinking \\"Gee there must be an awful lot of stuff that's going to happen once we get to Atlantis\\". Unfortunately, not much happens. The secret of Atlantis remains a secret with the story-tellers not really knowing how to explain the legendary island/continent. They are afraid to commit to saying where Atlantis is, even in a fictional story. Is it in the Atlantic? Is it in the Mediterranean Sea? Who knows? Nothing is hypothesized, even from a purely fantasy-based point of view. The viewer will leave the theatre asking themselves \\"Now what was that all about? What was the point of the movie? Why couldn't the surviving Atlantean's remember how to read when many of them lived through the disaster to the \\"present\\" day? And WHY did Atlantis sink?\\" and then promptly begin to forget about what they saw. There is nothing left to think about or mill over... except the loss of money in their wallets. The characters and their motivations are equally unfathomable. From the eccentric zillionaire who founds the expedition with seemingly more money that existed on the entire planet in 1914, to the (spoiler) collective consciousness that enters Kida and VOLUNTARILY deserts its people!?! The crew are a collection of quirky, 2-dimensional people of anachronistically (for 1914) P.C. race and gender. The demolitions expert talks like he came right out of a Warner Brothers' Bugs Bunny short. Most of the jokes are gross one-liners that are largely missed by the audience for two reasons: They are delivered at lightning-speed pacing and usually mumbled. The way these supporting players do a moral turn-around near the end of the movie is hard to believe. While we applaud Disney for trying to create animated movies for adults - and this is the first Disney not to have cute, talking animals or objects - it fails to make the transition. Younger children will be frightened by some of the action scenes and be left in the dark by the large amount of subtitles (when the characters speak Atlantean). In the first five minutes of the expedition, approximately 200 people are killed without a second thought. Obviously Disney thinks that if you didn't know who those people were, then why should you care? Again, the movie has no feelings on any level. Mulan and Tarzan were the last animated movies produced by Disney that were done extremely well. Sadly, Atlantis harkens back to those failed attempts in the past such as the Black Cauldron and Hunchback of Notre Dame. Disney needs to get back to their roots. A sequel to Peter Pan is coming out shortly but one never knows what the results will be until you see it for yourself. And now that Disney has discovered Science Fiction one hopes that they will realize that that genre must have more than spectacle to it. We also hope that the upcoming \\"Treasure Planet\\", a sci-fi adaptation of Robert L. Stevenson's \\"Treasure Island\\", will have more heart to it than the unfathomable \\"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\\". Would you say this review is positive or negative?","output":"This review is predominantly negative. It criticizes the film's emphasis on special effects and lack of characterization, as well as the confusing plot and pacing. Additionally, the review points out a lack of depth and emotional connection in the characters and story. It expresses dissatisfaction with Disney's transition to animation for adults in this instance and hopes for better results in future projects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Process:  - As the sweat evaporates the sweat sheds molecules into the air - The sweat changes into a gas - Heat is drawn from the sweat - This process draws heat from the body - The evaporation also cools the remaining sweat on the body.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person does a heavy workout happens, how will it affect MORE body cooling occurring.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an effect, both direct and indirect, on the process of body cooling. When a person engages in heavy physical activity or workout, their body heat increases due to the metabolic processes taking place during muscle and energy consumption. In response to this elevated body temperature, the body produces sweat to cool itself down. The perturbation of increased sweating leads to more body cooling through the following mechanisms: 1. Direct effect: The increased sweating results in a greater amount of sweat on the skin, which means more sweat can evaporate. When the sweat evaporates, it changes into a gas and sheds molecules into the air, thus allowing more heat to be drawn from the body. Consequently, the body is cooled more as greater amounts of heat are dissipated into the environment. 2. Indirect effect: The increased production of sweat also promotes vasodilation of blood vessels in the skin. As blood vessels dilate, they increase blood flow to the skin, bringing more heat to the surface. This additional heat is further dissipated by the sweat, enhancing the overall cooling effect.  In conclusion, the perturbation of a heavy workout leading to increased sweating has a direct effect on body cooling through evaporation and an indirect effect by promoting vasodilation and heat dissipation through the skin. This combination of mechanisms helps regulate body temperature and prevent overheating during physical activity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Copenhagen Criteria, sometimes also referred to as the 'Copenhagen Criteria for EU Membership', were established during the European Council meeting that took place in Copenhagen, Denmark, back in 1993. These criteria set out the specific conditions that a candidate country must meet in order to be considered for accession to the European Union. The Copenhagen Criteria are divided into three primary categories: 1. Political Criteria: This entails having stable institutions that guarantee democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights, and protection of minorities. The candidate country should demonstrate that it has a well-functioning democratic system in place, including an independent judiciary, respect for fundamental rights, and effective mechanisms to combat corruption and criminal activity. 2. Economic Criteria: This involves having a functioning market economy, as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressures and market forces within the European Union. The candidate country must be able to show that it has a sound economic foundation, with liberalised markets that promote fair competition. The country should also display a commitment to tackling macroeconomic imbalances and have the ability to integrate successfully into the EU's single market. 3. Legal and Institutional Criteria (Acquis Communautaire): This requires adopting, implementing, and enforcing all the existing EU laws and regulations, known as the Acquis Communautaire. The candidate country must showcase its ability to align its national legal and institutional frameworks with those of the EU, which encompasses a wide range of sectors such as agriculture, environment, social policy, and justice and home affairs. Additionally, the country must also demonstrate an aptitude for participating in the EU's various institutions and policies effectively. Apart from these principal criteria, the European Union assesses a candidate country's ability to maintain stable and friendly relations with its neighbors, as well as its commitment to peaceful conflict resolution. The Copenhagen Criteria serve as a crucial mechanism in determining whether a country is ready for EU membership, ensuring that it can contribute positively to the Union's project of integration and uphold the shared values and principles. Since the establishment of these criteria, several countries have successfully joined the EU, with each candidate undergoing a rigorous assessment of their adherence to the Copenhagen Criteria."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The boy, with his eyes ablaze in determination, furiously swings the wooden stick at the person-shaped pinata, each strike more powerful than the last. He refuses to let the pinata's vibrant exterior from splaying open to reveal its hidden treasure. With each swing, the rope suspends the pinata in a wild, unpredictable dance, as if teasing the boy - daring him to try again. His friends and family, gathered around the scene, cheer him on with excited laughter and shouts of encouragement. The little boy's arms soon grow weary with each powerful strike, but his determination doesn't falter. He knows that eventually, one of his mighty swings will achieve the desired effect, spilling sweet treats for all those eagerly waiting. He can't help but wonder if he'll be the one to unwrap the first prize, his eyes scanning the colors of the pinata as if to read its secret thoughts. But that doesn't matter now; his only focus is on breaking that pinata wide open. As the crowd cheers grow louder and more encouraging, the sun glistening brightly against the green grass, the little boy takes a deep breath and repositions his feet. Bracing his arm for another powerful swing, he assails the pinata once more, finally loosening the strong fibers of the rope that had held it captive. As the pinata swings lower and lower, the boy feels hope and satisfaction starting to rise within him, like a warm wave reaching the shore. The heartfelt support of his friends and family, the thrill of competition, and the allure of sweet victory only serve to heighten his resolve. Despite the exhaustion tugging at his muscles and the sweat running down his forehead, the boy's face is framed by a fiery determination, his eyes never leaving the lively dance of the pinata before him. Each miss only serves to fuel his fervor, as he imagines the ultimate success already within reach. The sheer resilience of this little boy— refusing to yield until he accomplishes his quest—is the heartwarming foundation of this cherished memory. For the little boy, the experience is about more than just getting his hands on the sweet rewards hidden inside the pinata. It is about persevering, giving his all, and harnessing the energy of the crowd that has gathered to witness this enchanting symbol of celebration. No matter the outcome, he will walk away with his head held high, knowing that he engaged in this playful rite of passage with everything he had. Meanwhile, the pinata, that tantalizing challenge he so bravely faced, continues to bob precariously as the boy swings one final strike, winding down his triumphant battle against an adversary that, despite the bruises and dents, captured the very essence of joy and excitement."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Movie plot title: Jamaica Inn Movie plot: Jamaica Inn is the headquarters of a gang of wreckers led by the innkeeper Joss Merlyn (Leslie Banks). The wreckers are responsible for a series of engineered shipwrecks in which they extinguish coastal warning beacons to cause ships to run aground on the rocky Cornish coast. Then they kill the surviving sailors and steal the cargo from the wrecks. Beautiful, young Mary Yellan (Maureen O'Hara) is travelling to Jamaica Inn in a carriage, but the driver is afraid to stop there and drives a long way past the inn in spite of her repeated demands that he stop. Instead, he drops her off near the home of the local squire and justice of the peace, Sir Humphrey Pengallan (Charles Laughton). She meets him and requests the loan of a horse so she can go back to Jamaica Inn. Pengallan warns her not to go there. Nevertheless, Mary says she just came from Ireland, and as the orphaned niece of Joss's wife Patience (Marie Ney), she intends to live at Jamaica Inn. Unable to convince her to stay, Pengallan accompanies Mary to Jamaica Inn. When Joss meets Mary, he tries to kiss her and push himself on her. Patience is distraught to learn her sister, Mary's mother, has died. When Mary tells Joss that Pengallan has accompanied her to Jamaica Inn, Joss goes upstairs and reports to Pengallan. We learn that Pengallan is the secret criminal mastermind behind the wrecking gang, who finds out when well-laden ships are passing near the coast, determines when and where the wrecks are to be done, disposes of the stolen cargo, and uses the booty to support his lavish lifestyle, passing a small fraction of the takings back to Joss and the gang.

They suspect Jem Traherne (Robert Newton), a gang member who has been with them for only two months, of embezzling goods.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Step 1: Analyze both sentences to understand their meaning. Sentence 1 describes an action done \\"on the first morning,\\" where \\"you take a jeep-safari at dawn\\" for the purpose of \\"scout[ing] the terrain.\\" Sentence 2 states \\"the last day\\" and what will happen, which is \\"scouting the terrain by jeep-safari.\\" Step 2: Compare the sentences to check if the second sentence follows logically from the first. The first sentence talks about the first morning and mentions an activity - taking a jeep-safari at dawn to scout the terrain. The second sentence, on the other hand, describes an event that takes place on the last day, with a similar activity - scouting the terrain by jeep-safari. It is clear that both sentences discuss scouting the terrain via a jeep-safari. However, the timing and context differ, as one refers to the first morning, and the other to the last day. Step 3: Determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. Given the information in the two sentences, it is not possible to determine if the second sentence is necessarily a consequence of the first sentence. The events mentioned in both sentences occur at different times, and there is no suggestion that one event will lead to the other. It is also important to note that the second sentence does not contain context about whether this event is a repeat of the first day's activity or something that is planned independently.

Claim: Macs don't get viruses as often and thus run more smoothly What evidence supports this claim?","output":"The claim that Macs don't get viruses as often and thus run more smoothly has some evidence to support it. While no computer system is completely immune to malware, Macs have traditionally experienced fewer security issues when compared to Windows-based systems. Various factors contribute to this situation, including: 1. Market share: One of the main reasons for the lower incidence of virus attacks on Macs is their market share. Windows has a much larger market share compared to Mac, with approximately 76% of the market worldwide, whereas macOS (the operating system that powers Apple's Mac computers) accounts for around 17%. Since there are more Windows users, it is a more attractive target for hackers and individuals who create malware to exploit vulnerabilities in the system. Thus, malware developers often focus on creating viruses for Windows rather than macOS. 2. Unix-based architecture: MacOS is based on a Unix-based architecture, which is considered to be more secure when compared to Windows. Unix was designed with security in mind and includes built-in protective features that make it more challenging for malware and hackers to exploit vulnerabilities. For instance, macOS restricts access to its core system files and requires administrator privileges for significant system changes. These permissions act as additional barriers that a potential hacker or malware needs to overcome to be successful in its attack. 3. Apple's app ecosystem: One of the key factors that plays a role in macOS's robust security is Apple's App Store and its walled garden model. Apple rigorously reviews and screens all applications that are submitted to the App Store to ensure they meet specific quality and security criteria. This process significantly reduces the likelihood of malicious software entering the macOS ecosystem. In contrast, Windows users can easily download and install software from various sources, which increases the chances of downloading a malicious application unknowingly. 4. XProtect: Apple has incorporated a built-in malware protection feature called XProtect within macOS. XProtect operates in the background and scans all downloaded files for any known malicious code or threats. This feature provides an added layer of security and is updated frequently by Apple to ensure it can recognize and protect against the latest threats. 5. Security patches and updates: Apple regularly releases updates for macOS that include security patches to fix any known vulnerabilities. While Windows also releases security updates, the fragmented nature of the Windows ecosystem - with various manufacturers, hardware configurations, and older operating system versions still in use - can sometimes lead to delays in these updates becoming available or being installed by users. While the abovementioned factors contribute to the perception that Macs are less prone to viruses and run more smoothly, it is important to remember that no system is entirely immune. As Macs gain more users and become more popular, they may attract increased attention from hackers and malware developers, and thus, it is crucial for users to remain vigilant, maintain good security practices, and perform regular system updates."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a news article: January Genomic Health announces initiation of a clinical validation study of their prostate cancer test; & the acceleration of the company's Next Generation Sequencing program.      The prostate cancer test validation study, being performed in collaboration with leading prostate cancer researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), is designed to determine if a multi-gene test can help distinguish aggressive disease requiring surgery from less aggressive disease that may undergo active surveillance in patients with early-stage prostate cancer. Complete results are expected to be presented at the end of this year or early next year, and if positive, are expected to support the launch of the Oncotype DX ® prostate cancer test in 2013.      prostate cancer test in 2013. The company also announced that it is accelerating its Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) program by moving it into clinical development studies that will examine both RNA-Seq expression and mutation analysis. This decision comes after the company successfully conducted the first clinical outcomes study for biomarker discovery using NGS for whole transcriptome profiling of archival FFPE tumor specimens. Results of this study were presented at the 2011 CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December. In addition, informatics infrastructure investments to support a cloud-based system for storage and analysis of large genomic data sets are underway. The NGS technology allows Genomic Health scientists to assay the entire genome simultaneously to discover regions of the genome whose expression is associated with clinical outcomes and treatment response.      Press Release      Press Release Genomic Health presents new data at the 2012 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium, which demonstrates a 29% change in treatment recommendations in stage II colon cancer patients, reinforcing clinical benefit and supporting the wider adoption of the Oncotype DX Colon Cancer test.      Press Release February Genomic Health presents results from a large clinical study in prostate cancer evaluating the relationship of microRNAs, a novel class of biomarkers, to clinical outcomes for patients with early-stage prostate cancer. The data, presented at the 2012 Genitourinary (GU) Cancers Symposium, contribute to a greater understanding of prostate cancer biology by assessing the ability of specific microRNAs and genes to predict aggressive disease as part of the company's prostate cancer research and development program.      Press Release March Genomic Health announces presentation of three Oncotype DX studies at the 8th European Breast Cancer Conference. Results from these studies reconfirm the cost-effectiveness of the Oncotype DX breast cancer test and emphasize the important role it can play in guiding treatment decisions.      Press Release September Genomic Health announces positive results from a large clinical validation study of its biopsy-based prostate cancer test. The study, performed in collaboration with leading prostate cancer researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), met its primary endpoint by demonstrating that the multi-gene Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score (GPS), assessed in prostate needle biopsy tumor tissue, has been prospectively validated as a predictor of adverse pathology for patients with early-stage prostate cancer. UCSF and Genomic Health plan to submit complete data from this study for presentation at the 2013 ASCO Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in February. Based on these results, Genomic Health is completing the necessary work in its Clinical Reference Laboratory to make the Oncotype DX prostate cancer test available to physicians and patients in the first half of 2013.      Press Release ||||| Here we report the results of a prospectively conducted clinical trial, the Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatment (TAILORx). This trial was designed to further validate and refine the clinical usefulness of the 21-gene assay (Oncotype DX Recurrence Score, Genomic Health) in a specified low-risk cohort of women with hormone-receptor–positive, HER2-negative, axillary node–negative invasive breast cancer.      Previous studies have shown that a 21-gene expression assay provides additional prognostic information independent of clinicopathologic features 15 and also predicts benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in estrogen-receptor–positive disease. 16,17 Prospective validation was performed with the use of archival tumor specimens from completed studies that used a prospective–retrospective design. 18 However, validation in prospectively conducted studies provides the highest level of evidence supporting the clinical validity and ultimately the clinical usefulness of a new biomarker. 19,20      More than 100,000 women in the United States received a diagnosis of estrogen-receptor–positive breast cancer associated with negative axillary lymph nodes in 2014. 11 Although approximately 85% of these women may be recurrence-free at 10 years with adjuvant endocrine therapy alone, the addition of chemotherapy leads to a relative reduction in the risk of recurrence of approximately 30% on average, which translates into an absolute benefit in the rate of freedom from recurrence of up to 5 percentage points. 12,13 Many patients with estrogen-receptor–positive breast cancer would therefore be overtreated with chemotherapy on the basis of clinicopathologic features alone, since most would have been adequately treated with endocrine therapy alone. 14      For contemporary taxane-based or anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens, proportional reductions in risk have been shown to be affected only minimally by age, nodal status, tumor grade, estrogen-receptor expression, or use of adjuvant endocrine therapy. 8 These findings led a National Institutes of Health consensus panel in 2001 to conclude that “adjuvant polychemotherapy…should be recommended to the majority of women with localized breast cancer regardless of lymph node, menopausal, or hormone receptor status.” 9 The widespread use of adjuvant chemotherapy has contributed to the declining breast-cancer mortality that has been observed in the United States and other industrialized nations. 10      Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide and in the United States, and it is the leading cause of death from cancer in women worldwide. 1 Prognostic factors for the recurrence of breast cancer at a distant site regardless of treatment include clinicopathologic features such as tumor size and grade and the number of axillary lymph nodes with metastasis. 2 Predictive factors that identify a benefit from specific therapies include the expression of the estrogen receptor and the progesterone receptor, which identifies patients who benefit from adjuvant endocrine therapy, 3 and overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein (or HER2 gene amplification), 4 which identifies patients who benefit from adjuvant HER2-directed therapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy reduces the risk of recurrence, even among patients with axillary node–negative disease who are at lower risk for recurrence. 5-7      Event-free rates were estimated with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method, with confidence intervals computed with the use of the log–log transformation and Greenwood’s variance. The data-cutoff date for the results presented here was July 29, 2015.      Statistical comparisons of baseline characteristics were calculated with the use of the chi-square test for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon test and Student’s t-test for continuous variables. Tumor size in the greatest dimension, histologic grade of the tumor, and expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 were determined locally and reported by the participating site.      The overall sample size in all the risk strata defined according to recurrence score was driven by the need to include a sufficient number of patients with a score of 11 to 25 (midrange risk) in order to test the noninferiority of endocrine therapy alone versus chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy. At the fourth planned interim analysis held on March 20, 2015, the ECOG–ACRIN data and safety monitoring committee recommended that the results of the low-risk group be released and that follow-up in the randomized midrange-risk stratum and the nonrandomized high-risk stratum continue as planned. Although there was no specific enrollment goal for the low-risk group, the large sample provided the opportunity to estimate 5-year event rates accurately.      Secondary end points included time-to-event analyses of the freedom from the recurrence of breast cancer at a distant site, with an event of breast cancer at a distant site defined as the first event of distant recurrence of breast cancer or death with distant recurrence, if death was the first manifestation of distant recurrence (which corresponds to the STEEP definition of distant recurrence–free interval); freedom from any recurrence, with recurrence defined as the first recurrence of breast cancer at any site (including ipsilateral breast cancer, local or regional recurrence, or distant recurrence) or death with recurrence, if death was the first manifestation of recurrence (which corresponds to the STEEP definition of recurrence-free interval); and the overall survival rate, which was defined as the proportion of patients who did not die (from any cause). End-point assessments that were consistent with standard of care at regular intervals were specified in the protocol , and copies of source documents supporting each event were reviewed and corroborated by one of the coauthors who did not have knowledge of the study group or the recurrence-score information.      The standardized definitions for efficacy end points (STEEP) criteria were used for the end-point definitions. 23 The primary trial end point was a time-to-event analysis of the rate of survival free from invasive cancer, with an invasive-cancer event defined as the first event of recurrence of ipsilateral breast tumor, local recurrence, regional recurrence, distant recurrence, contralateral second primary invasive cancer, second primary nonbreast invasive cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer), or death without evidence of recurrence (which corresponds to the STEEP definition of invasive disease–free survival).      The manuscript was written by the first author; the final version of the manuscript incorporated some changes recommended by the coauthors and Genomic Health. Data were collected by the Cancer Trials Support Unit and the ECOG–ACRIN Cancer Research Group Coordinating Center. All the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analyses presented and for the adherence of the study to the protocol , which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. No commercial support was involved in the planning or execution of the study, although the genomic test used is commercially available.      To minimize the potential for undertreatment of the participants enrolled in our trial, the recurrence-score ranges used in our study differed from those that were originally defined as low (≤10 in our study vs. <18 in the original definition), intermediate (11 to 25 vs. 18 to 30), and high (≥26 vs. ≥31). 14 The recurrence-score strata derived for the trial were based on prior studies that indicated that the risk of recurrence of breast cancer at a distant site at 10 years after diagnosis and a 5-year course of tamoxifen could be as high as 10% among patients with a score of 11 (point estimate, 7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5 to 10) and up to 20% among those with a score of 25 (point estimate, 16%; 95% CI, 13 to 20), 15 indicating a risk that was substantial enough for a recommendation of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with a score of 11 or higher. 14      All the patients had an Oncotype DX Recurrence Score, a reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction 21-gene assay performed on RNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue, performed in a central laboratory (Genomic Health). 15 The recurrence scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of recurrence. Patients with a score of 0 to 10 were assigned to receive endocrine therapy alone, and those with a score of 26 or higher were assigned to receive chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy. Prior studies indicated that patients with a score of less than 11 had a favorable prognosis with endocrine therapy alone 15 and also that patients with a score of 26 to 30 or higher derived substantially greater benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. 16,17 Patients with a midrange score of 11 to 25 were randomly assigned to receive either chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy or endocrine therapy alone because the benefits of chemotherapy were uncertain in this group, yet the risk of recurrence was high enough to suggest that chemotherapy might be beneficial.      This prospective clinical trial was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), was coordinated by the ECOG and subsequently the ECOG–ACRIN Cancer Research Group, and included other participating NCI-sponsored groups. Patients were required to provide written informed consent, including willingness to have treatment assigned or randomly assigned on the basis of the genetic-assay results indicating the risk of recurrence.      Other eligibility criteria included an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status score of 0 or 1 (on a scale from 0 to 5, with higher numbers indicating greater disability; a score of 0 indicates no symptoms, and a score of 1 mild symptoms) and normal hematologic, bone marrow, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, and cardiac function. Patients with HER2-overexpressing disease were excluded because most have a high risk of recurrence 14 and because such patients benefit from adjuvant HER2-directed therapy plus chemotherapy. 22      The study included women 18 to 75 years of age with axillary node–negative invasive breast cancer that was estrogen-receptor–positive or progesterone-receptor–positive (or both) and that did not overexpress HER2. Patients had to meet National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for the recommendation of adjuvant chemotherapy, 21 including a primary tumor size of 1.1 to 5.0 cm in the greatest dimension for a tumor of any grade or a size of 0.6 to 1.0 cm in the greatest dimension for a tumor of intermediate or high histologic grade or nuclear grade (or both).      In a multivariate analysis that included age (≤50 years vs. 51 to 60 years vs. 61 to 75 years), tumor size (2.1 to 5.0 cm vs. ≤2 cm in the greatest dimension), histologic grade (high vs. intermediate vs. low), and surgery type (mastectomy vs. lumpectomy), only histologic grade showed a significant association with the rate of freedom from recurrence. However, histologic grade did not show a significant association with the rate of invasive disease–free survival or the rate of freedom from distant recurrence ( Table 2 Table 2 Multivariate Analysis.). Recurrence rates were very low regardless of histologic grade ( Table 3 Table 3 Event Rates at 5 Years, According to Histologic Grade.).      In this cohort, the rate of invasive disease–free survival at 5 years was 93.8% (95% CI, 92.4 to 94.9). The rate of freedom from recurrence of breast cancer at a distant site at 5 years was 99.3% (95% CI, 98.7 to 99.6), the rate of freedom from recurrence at 5 years was 98.7% (95% CI, 97.9 to 99.2), and the rate of overall survival at 5 years was 98.0% (95% CI, 97.1 to 98.6).      In the cohort of patients with a recurrence score of 0 to 10, there were 88 events of either invasive cancer or death and 30 deaths reported within 5 years after study entry. The first event in the analysis of survival free from invasive disease was local or regional recurrence (or both) in 8 patients, distant recurrence in 10, invasive cancer of the opposite breast in 15, other invasive new primary cancer in 43, and death without another event in 12. The Kaplan–Meier estimates for each end point examined are shown in Figure 1 Figure 1 Kaplan–Meier Estimates in the Analyses of Invasive Disease–free Survival, Freedom from Recurrence of Breast Cancer at a Distant Site, Freedom from Recurrence at Any Site, and Overall Survival..      In the low-risk cohort of 1626 patients, endocrine therapy included an aromatase inhibitor in 963 patients (59%), tamoxifen in 560 (34%), sequential tamoxifen followed by aromatase-inhibitor therapy in 13 (1%), ovarian-function suppression in 44 (3%), or other or unknown therapy in 46 (3%). Although the protocol specified that no chemotherapy be given if the recurrence score was 0 to 10, a total of 6 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy (1 of whom had a recurrence despite adjuvant chemotherapy).      Table 1 Table 1 Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline, According to Recurrence-Score Cohort. shows the characteristics of the study population that was included in this analysis — patients with tumors associated with a recurrence score of 0 to 10 (low-risk cohort) — as compared with the characteristics of the patients who had a score of 11 to 25 (midrange-risk cohort). There were no significant differences in tumor size between these two cohorts. There was a similar distribution of intermediate-grade tumors (59% in the low-risk cohort and 57% in the midrange-risk cohort), although there was a significant difference in the distribution of grade, including low-grade tumors (34% vs. 29%) and high-grade tumors (7% vs. 14%) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). There were also significant but numerically modest differences between the low-risk cohort and the midrange-risk cohort with regard to age (median, 58 years vs. 55 years), menopausal status (postmenopausal status, 70% vs. 64%), progesterone-receptor expression (progesterone-receptor–positive, 98% vs. 92%), and type of primary surgery (lumpectomy, 68% vs. 72%) (P<0.001 for all comparisons by the chi-square test).      Between April 7, 2006, and October 6, 2010, we enrolled 10,273 patients in the trial, of whom 10,253 were eligible to participate. A total of 1629 patients (1626 of whom were eligible [15.9% of the total eligible population]) had a recurrence score of 0 to 10 (indicating low risk), 6907 (6897 of whom were eligible [67.3% of the total eligible population]) had a score of 11 to 25 (indicating midrange risk), and 1736 (1730 of whom were eligible [16.9% of the total eligible population]) had a score of 26 or higher (indicating high risk). The median follow-up in the low-risk cohort was 69 months.      Discussion      We performed a prospective validation study of a 21-gene assay in patients with hormone-receptor–positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who had a low risk of recurrence according to clinicopathologic features but who nevertheless met established clinical guidelines for the recommendation or consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy. In patients who were found to have a low risk of recurrence on the basis of genetic-assay results and who were thus assigned to receive endocrine therapy alone, the risk of the recurrence of breast cancer at a distant site was less than 1% and the risk of any recurrence was less than 2% at 5 years.      Recurrence events were uncommon regardless of histologic grade and were not significantly affected by younger age at diagnosis. In fact, in this low-risk population, the rate of recurrence events at 5 years was far exceeded by the rates of second primary breast cancers, other second primary-cancer events, and deaths from other causes, which resulted in a rate of invasive disease–free survival that was nearly 5 percentage points lower than the rate of freedom from recurrence (93.8% vs. 98.7%).      Although adjuvant chemotherapy reduced the risk of distant recurrence and local–regional recurrence in the Early Breast Cancer Trialists meta-analysis, there was only a marginal effect in reducing the risk of contralateral breast cancer and no effect on the risk of second primary cancers or on nonbreast-cancer mortality after 15 years of follow-up in nearly 29,000 patients who had been randomly assigned to receive either chemotherapy or no chemotherapy.12 The low rate of distant recurrence observed in this prospective study is consistent with the rate observed at 5 years in the original prospective–retrospective validation study involving patients with a low recurrence score of less than 18 (2.1%; 95% CI, 0.6 to 3.7).14,15      The current prospectively conducted study supports the use of the 21-gene assay to spare the use of chemotherapy in patients who otherwise would be recommended to receive it on the basis of clinicopathologic features. These findings provide additional evidence supporting expert-derived clinical practice guidelines that recommend the use of this assay in patients with hormone-receptor–positive, axillary node–negative invasive breast cancer.21,24 Although this study clearly identifies patients who do not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, only 16% of the enrolled patients had a recurrence score of 10 or less. Approximately 67% of the patients enrolled in the trial had a midrange score of 11 to 25 and were randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy or endocrine therapy alone. Continued follow-up is required in order to determine the effect of chemotherapy in this larger group of patients.      Late recurrence that occurs after 5 years accounts for approximately one half of all distant recurrences in patients with estrogen-receptor–positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.25 There are several prognostic gene-expression assays for breast cancer,26 some of which are more accurately prognostic for late recurrence than others.27,28 However, the 21-gene assay predicts benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy,16,17 and chemotherapy prevents primarily early recurrences within 5 years after diagnosis.8 Therefore, although more recurrences are expected with longer follow-up, it is unclear whether these recurrences would have been prevented by the early administration of adjuvant chemotherapy. Extended adjuvant endocrine therapy beyond 5 years is effective in preventing late recurrence and may be considered when the treating clinician and the patient perceive a favorable benefit–risk ratio.29,30      The distribution of recurrence scores observed in this prospective trial differs from the distribution that was initially projected on the basis of observations in a prior prospective–retrospective validation study, which included 27% of patients with a score of 0 to 10, 43% with a score of 11 to 25, and 30% with a score of 26 or higher.14,16 This finding may be due to clinicians selecting patients for this study in whom there was therapeutic equipoise regarding the benefit of chemotherapy, which is reflected by the large proportion of patients who had tumors of 1.1 to 2.0 cm in the greatest dimension or tumors of intermediate histologic grade. However, the distribution of scores that was observed in this trial is similar to the distribution observed by the commercial laboratory during the same time period in which the study was conducted (score of 0 to 10 in 18% of patients, score of 11 to 25 in 62%, and score of ≥26 in 20%; Shak S, Genomic Health: personal communication). This finding indicates that the distribution of risk groups in the trial reflects clinical practice in the community and supports the generalizability of the study findings.      The RASTER (Microarray Prognostics in Breast Cancer) study was a prospective validation study that evaluated a different multigene assay, the 70-gene signature, in 427 patients with axillary node–negative breast cancer.31 The 5-year rate of freedom from distant recurrence was 97.0% among patients with a low-risk signature on the 70-gene assay (51% of all patients) and 91.7% among those with a high-risk signature (49% of all patients).32 Decisions regarding adjuvant systemic treatment were based on the Dutch Institute for Healthcare Improvement 2004 guidelines, the 70-gene signature, and doctors’ and patients’ preferences. Adjuvant chemotherapy was given to 169 patients (81%) with a high-risk signature and in 33 (15%) with a low-risk signature. The outcomes observed in the RASTER study may therefore have been attributable, at least in part, to chemotherapy administered in selected patients in the low-risk group.      The MINDACT (Microarray in Node Negative Disease May Avoid Chemotherapy) trial is a prospective trial in which patients were randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy or no chemotherapy on the basis of clinical criteria or the 70-gene signature; enrollment has been completed and follow-up is ongoing.33 Although the results of the MINDACT trial are likely to provide important information, gene-expression assays bring added value by providing complementary predictive information that is independent of and does not correlate with clinicopathologic features in selected patients for whom this information may be clinically useful.34,35 Other ongoing trials (RxPONDER36 and OPTIMA37) are evaluating whether adjuvant chemotherapy is beneficial in patients with hormone-receptor–positive, HER2-negative breast cancer with positive axillary lymph nodes and a recurrence score of 25 or less.      In conclusion, this prospective study involving uniformly treated patients with hormone-receptor–positive, HER2-negative, axillary node–negative breast cancer supports the clinical validity of the 21-gene assay in identifying patients who may be safely spared adjuvant chemotherapy. ||||| MAYWOOD, Ill. -- A major study published in the New England Journal of Medicine is providing the best evidence to date that a 21-gene test done on the tumor can identify breast cancer patients who can safely avoid chemotherapy.      Oncologist Kathy Albain, MD, FACP, FASCO of Loyola University Medical Center and Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine is among the main co-authors of the international multicenter trial. Dr. Albain also is a member of the trial's steering committee.      The test examines 21 genes from a tumor sample to determine how active the genes are. The tumor then is assigned a score between 0 and 100; the lower the score, the lower the chance the cancer will recur in distant organs if treated with only a pill such as tamoxifen. In previous studies involving fewer patients, a low score also suggested that chemotherapy does not work well and does not add to the survival benefit of tamoxifen.      The clinical trial enrolled 10,253 women, including 41 at Loyola, who had a certain type of breast cancer (hormone-receptor positive, HER2 negative) that had not spread to lymph nodes. Although the lymph nodes were not involved, the tumors had other features that indicated chemotherapy should be given, followed by tamoxifen or other endocrine therapy pills.      In the trial, women whose tumors scored 10 or lower on the 21-gene test received standard hormone therapy such as tamoxifen, but did not undergo chemotherapy. After five years of being followed closely, there was a less than a 2 percent risk the cancer had spread to nearby or distant sites. The five-year overall patient survival was 98 percent.      These findings, researchers concluded, provide the highest level of evidence that the multigene test can spare the use of chemotherapy in women with low-scoring tumors who otherwise would receive chemotherapy. \\"This should provide a lot of reassurance to women and their physicians,\\" Dr. Albain said. \\"In women whose breast cancer scored low on the multigene test, there was outstanding survival with endocrine therapy alone. The test provides us with greater certainty of who can safely avoid chemotherapy.\\"      In the trial, 15.9 percent of the women had a multigene test score of 10 or lower. An additional 68 percent had a mid-range score of 11 to 25. These women were randomly assigned to receive either hormone therapy plus chemotherapy or hormone therapy alone. Continued follow-up still will be needed to determine whether any women in this larger group, with tumors in the intermediate-score range, can safely forgo chemotherapy.      #      The multigene test, Oncotype DX Recurrence Score®, is made by Genomic Health, Inc.

FILE - In this Sept. 5, 2013 file photo, chemotherapy is administered to a cancer patient via intravenous drip in Durham, N.C. In a study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and results published... (Associated Press)      The test accurately identified a group of women whose cancers are so likely to respond to hormone-blocking drugs that adding chemo would do little if any good while exposing them to side effects and other health risks. In the study, women who skipped chemo based on the test had less than a 1 percent chance of cancer recurring far away, such as the liver or lungs, within the next five years.      \\"You can't do better than that,\\" said the study leader, Dr. Joseph Sparano of Montefiore Medical Center in New York.      An independent expert, Dr. Clifford Hudis of New York's Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, agreed.      \\"There is really no chance that chemotherapy could make that number better,\\" he said. Using the gene test \\"lets us focus our chemotherapy more on the higher risk patients who do benefit\\" and spare others the ordeal.      The study was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. Results were published online Monday by the New England Journal of Medicine and discussed at the European Cancer Congress in Vienna.      The study involved the most common type of breast cancer — early stage, without spread to lymph nodes; hormone-positive, meaning the tumor's growth is fueled by estrogen or progesterone; and not the type that the drug Herceptin targets. Each year, more than 100,000 women in the United States alone are diagnosed with this.      The usual treatment is surgery followed by years of a hormone-blocking drug. But many women also are urged to have chemo, to help kill any stray cancer cells that may have spread beyond the breast and could seed a new cancer later. Doctors know that most of these women don't need chemo but there are no great ways to tell who can safely skip it.      A California company, Genomic Health Inc., has sold a test called Oncotype DX since 2004 to help gauge this risk. The test measures the activity of genes that control cell growth, and others that indicate a likely response to hormone therapy treatment.      Past studies have looked at how women classified as low, intermediate or high risk by the test have fared. The new study is the first to assign women treatments based on their scores and track recurrence rates.      Of the 10,253 women in the study, 16 percent were classified as low risk, 67 percent as intermediate and 17 percent as high risk for recurrence by the test. The high-risk group was given chemotherapy and hormone-blocking drugs. Women in the middle group were randomly assigned to get hormone therapy alone or to add chemo. Results on these groups are not yet ready — the study is continuing.      But independent monitors recommended the results on the low-risk group be released, because it was clear that adding chemo would not improve their fate.      After five years, about 99 percent had not relapsed, and 98 percent were alive. About 94 percent were free of any invasive cancer, including new cancers at other sites or in the opposite breast.      \\"These patients who had low risk scores by Oncotype did extraordinarily well at five years,\\" said Dr. Hope Rugo, a breast cancer specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, with no role in the study. \\"There is no chance that for these patients, that chemotherapy would have any benefit.\\"      Dr. Karen Beckerman, a New York City obstetrician diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011, said she was advised to have chemo but feared complications. A doctor suggested the gene test and she scored very low for recurrence risk.      \\"I was convinced that there was no indication for chemotherapy. I was thrilled not to have to have it,\\" and has been fine since then, she said.      Mary Lou Smith, a breast cancer survivor and advocate who helped design the trial for ECOG, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, which ran it, said she thought women \\"would be thrilled\\" to skip chemo.      \\"Patients love the idea of a test\\" to help reduce uncertainty about treatment, she said. \\"I've had chemotherapy. It's not pretty.\\"      The test costs 4,175, which Medicare and many insurers cover. Others besides Oncotype DX also are on the market, and Hudis said he hopes the new study will encourage more, to compete on price and accuracy.      \\"The future is bright\\" for gene tests to more precisely guide treatment, he said.      ___      Marilynn Marchione can be followed at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A gene test called Oncotype DX has shown that it can accurately determine which women with certain types of breast cancer can avoid chemotherapy without reducing their chances of surviving the disease.

Question: \\"What does the F stand for in EF4?\\"  Context: \\"Oklahoma City has a very active severe weather season from March through June, especially during April and May. Being in the center of what is colloquially referred to as Tornado Alley, it is prone to especially frequent and severe tornadoes, as well as very severe hailstorms and occasional derechoes. Tornadoes have occurred in every month of the year and a secondary smaller peak also occurs during autumn, especially October. The Oklahoma City metropolitan area is one of the most tornado-prone major cities in the world, with about 150 tornadoes striking within the city limits since 1890. Since the time weather records have been kept, Oklahoma City has been struck by thirteen violent tornadoes, eleven F/EF4s and two F/EF5. On May 3, 1999 parts of southern Oklahoma City and nearby suburban communities suffered from one of the most powerful tornadoes on record, an F5 on the Fujita scale, with wind speeds estimated by radar at 318 mph (510 km/h). On May 20, 2013, far southwest Oklahoma City, along with Newcastle and Moore, was hit again by a EF5 tornado; it was 0.5 to 1.3 miles (0.80 to 2.09 km) wide and killed 23 people. Less than two weeks later, on May 31, another outbreak affected the Oklahoma City area, including an EF1 and an EF0 within the city and a tornado several miles west of the city that was 2.6 miles (4.2 km) in width, the widest tornado ever recorded.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"The \\"F\\" in EF4 stands for \\"Fujita,\\" referring to the Fujita scale.

Here's what it looks like: - 6 = -156*h + 150*h Now, when we add 150*h to -156*h, we will have: -6 = -6*h Now, we still want to find out what h is. To do that, we need to get rid of the -6 next to the h. Since it is multiplied by h, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -6: -6 / -6 = -6*h / -6 This gives us: 1 = h So, the answer is h = 1. Yay!

When a substance makes a transition from the liquid state to the gaseous state, the particles have many more possible arrangements, because they are no longer confined to a specified volume in which they are close to each other; gas particles can move freely throughout their container. Vaporization represents an increase in entropy. In the opposite direction, a liquid loses entropy when it freezes to a solid. Because solids have very ordered structures, there are fewer possible arrangements of particles that would result in the properties associated with a solid.  and the situation: George is going camping and forgot to bring water with him.

Title: The Patriot Movie plot: During the American Revolution in 1776, Benjamin Martin, a veteran of the French and Indian War and a widower with seven children, is called to Charleston to vote in the South Carolina General Assembly on a levy supporting the Continental Army. Fearing war against Great Britain, Benjamin abstains; the vote is nonetheless passed and, against his father's wishes, Benjamin's eldest son Gabriel joins the Continental Army. Four years later Charleston falls to the British and a wounded Gabriel returns home carrying dispatches. The Martins care for both British and American wounded from a nearby battle, before British Dragoons, led by the ruthless Colonel William Tavington, arrive, arrest Gabriel, and take captive the African American free men and women who work Benjamin's land. When Benjamin's second son Thomas tries to free Gabriel, he is shot and killed by Tavington, who then orders the Martins' house burned, and wounded Americans executed. After the British leave, Benjamin gives his next two eldest sons muskets, and they ambush the British unit escorting a tied Gabriel. Benjamin skillfully, yet brutally, kills many soldiers with his tomahawk. A British survivor tells Tavington of the attack, earning Benjamin the moniker of the \\"Ghost\\". Benjamin and Gabriel resolve to fight the British, leaving the younger children in the care of Benjamin's sister-in-law, Charlotte. On their way to the Continental Army's camp, they witness the southern Continental Army under General Horatio Gates engaging the British Army.

Next question: who has the most saves in a mlb season?","output":"The record for the most saves in a single Major League Baseball (MLB) season is held by Francisco Rodriguez. Francisco Rodriguez, also known as \\"K-Rod,\\" is a former professional baseball pitcher from Venezuela who played in MLB for several teams, including the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, New York Mets, Baltimore Orioles, Milwaukee Brewers, and Detroit Tigers. During the 2008 MLB season, Rodriguez, playing for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, set the record for the most saves with an impressive total of 62. This achievement broke the previous record of 57 saves, held by Bobby Thigpen, who set the mark in 1990 while pitching for the Chicago White Sox. Throughout his career, Rodriguez was known for his remarkable ability to close out games and seal victories for his team. A key component of his success was his devastating fastball and slider combination, which helped him generate a high number of strikeouts. K-Rod was a six-time All-Star and was also instrumental in helping the Angels win the World Series in 2002. In the world of baseball, saves are a crucial statistic for relief pitchers, particularly those known as closers, who are typically called upon to pitch in high-pressure situations at the end of the game. To be credited with a save, a pitcher must meet certain criteria, such as entering the game with a lead of three runs or fewer, pitching at least an entire inning, or entering the game with the potential tying run either on base, at the plate, or on deck. Though Francisco Rodriguez still holds the record for the most saves in a single MLB season, various other closers have enjoyed successful seasons and careers, such as Mariano Rivera, Trevor Hoffman, and Aroldis Chapman. While saves remain an essential gauge of a closer's effectiveness, other factors like ERA (earned run average), strikeouts, and WHIP (walks plus hits per inning pitched) also play a critical role in evaluating a relief pitcher's performance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Process:  - A butterfly starts as an egg - The egg hatches - A larva emerges - The larva eats and grows - The larva sheds its skin - The larva enters a chrysalis - The pupa grows inside the chrysalis - The adult butterfly exits the chrysalis - The adult butterfly is now fully grown - The adult butterfly lays more eggs.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the chrysalis is disturbed happens, how will it affect less butterflies exit the chrysalis.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if the chrysalis is disturbed during the butterfly's development, it may result in fewer adult butterflies successfully emerging from the chrysalis. The disturbance may have a direct or indirect effect on the entire process of the butterfly's life cycle. A detailed analysis of the potential impacts of this hypothesis is provided below. Direct effects: 1. Physical damage to the chrysalis: When the chrysalis is disturbed, it can lead to physical damage to its delicate structure. The chrysalis is a protective casing that houses the developing pupa, and any damage to the outer shell can be detrimental to the pupa's survival. This damage may cause deformities, hinder proper development, or even result in death, ultimately leading to a decrease in the number of butterflies that successfully emerge from the chrysalis. 2. Interference with the metamorphosis process: The process of metamorphosis is a complex one that involves a series of carefully orchestrated changes in the butterfly's body structure and physiology. When the chrysalis is disturbed, it can disrupt these processes, causing the pupa to be unable to develop into a fully functioning adult butterfly. This may result in immature or non-viable butterflies that are unable to survive or reproduce, reducing the overall butterfly population. Indirect effects: 1. Increased vulnerability to predators and parasites: A disturbed chrysalis could result in compromised defense mechanisms or even cause the developing butterfly to emit stress signals that attract predators or parasites. These natural adversaries may then prey on the pupa or adult butterfly, leading to a decrease in the number of adult butterflies that complete the life cycle. 2. Stress-induced developmental problems: The stress caused by the disturbance can have negative physiological and developmental effects on the butterfly. In some cases, stress can cause a delay in growth or trigger the release of stress hormones that affect the metamorphosis process. These changes might lead to developmental abnormalities or reduced survival rates in adult butterflies, thus decreasing the number of butterflies that emerge from the chrysalis. 3. Disruption of environmental cues and timings: Some butterflies rely on specific environmental cues to determine when to transition between life stages. If the disturbance of the chrysalis results in changes to the localized environment or disrupts the pupa's ability to perceive these cues, it may alter their developmental timeline. This can lead to mistimed emergence or unfavorable conditions for the adult butterfly, ultimately reducing its chances of survival. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis states that the disturbance of the chrysalis can directly or indirectly lead to a decrease in the number of butterflies that successfully emerge from the chrysalis. These effects can have a cascading impact on the butterfly's life cycle, potentially leading to reductions in the overall population. Further research and observations are necessary to determine the extent to which these disturbances influence butterfly populations in the natural environment and develop appropriate conservation measures if necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.

When glucose (sugar) levels in the blood are too high, the pancreas secretes insulin to stimulate the absorption of glucose and the conversion of glucose into glycogen, which is stored in the liver. As blood glucose levels decrease, less insulin is produced. When glucose levels are too low, another hormone called glucagon is produced, which causes the liver to convert glycogen back to glucose.

Movie title: Little Children Movie plot: Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet) is a hapless, stay-at-home mother in a small suburban Boston community. She had been working on a doctorate in English, but set aside her work to marry Richard (Gregg Edelman) and raise their 3-year-old daughter, Lucy (Sadie Goldstein). Her marriage falls apart when she discovers that Richard is addicted to online pornography. She meets Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson), a law student who brings his 4-year-old son, Aaron (Ty Simpkins), to the park. Although Brad's marriage to Katherine (Jennifer Connelly) is loving and amicable, it has been lacking intimacy. When he is supposed to be studying for the bar exam, Brad instead plays on a local football team or sits and watches teenagers skateboard outside his house, fantasizing about being young and carefree again. Brad and Sarah become friendly and, on a dare, kiss in the park, scandalizing the other park parents. They are instantly attracted to each other, but resolve to keep their relationship platonic. One day, several parents panic when they see Ronald \\"Ronnie\\" McGorvey (Jackie Earle Haley), a sex offender who was recently released from prison, swimming in the pool with the children. After Ronnie is escorted away by two police officers, it begins to rain. Sarah and Brad take Lucy and Aaron back to her house and put the kids to bed. Brad looks at one of Sarah's books and finds a photo of him in it. While Sarah is drying towels in her basement, Brad kisses her and they have sex. Brad's friend Larry (Noah Emmerich) is a former police officer who was forced to retire when he accidentally shot a teenager at a local shopping mall. Now he is estranged from his wife and spends much of his time harassing Ronnie. Ronnie lives with his mother, May (Phyllis Somerville), who believes that meeting a woman his own age would cure him of his pedophilia. Ronnie knows this is futile, but agrees to on a date May has arranged for him with a woman named Sheila (Jane Adams). During dinner, Ronnie tells Sheila about his criminal record, and Sheila in return...

Imagine you copied the binary number into a column and left it unchanged. Put the original number in the column and start writing down the powers of 2.;","output":"The next paragraph should end with: (B). Then, write down the powers of two from right to left. Start at 2, evaluating it as \\"1\\". To continue the explanation on how to convert from binary to decimal: After writing down the binary number 10011011, you will need to assign each digit with its corresponding power of 2, starting from right to left. The rightmost digit (also known as the least significant bit) starts with a power of 2 raised to the power of 0 (2^0), which equals to 1. Next, proceed to label each subsequent digit to the left with increasing powers of 2. For the given example of 10011011, the powers of 2 should look like this: 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1   1    0    0    1   1   0   1  1 Now, multiply each binary digit (1 or 0) by its corresponding power of 2, and add the results. In this case: (1 × 128) + (0 × 64) + (0 × 32) + (1 × 16) + (1 × 8) + (0 × 4) + (1 × 2) + (1 × 1) = 128 + 0 + 0 + 16 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 155 So, the decimal representation of the binary number 10011011 is 155."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(September 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1625 France, following in his late father's footsteps, d'Artagnan (Chris O'Donnell) sets off to Paris in hopes of becoming a member of the Musketeers, a band of men sworn to serve and protect the King of France. d'Artagnan is pursued by GÃ©rard and his brothers, who accuse him of blemishing their sister's honor. GÃ©rard saw his sister kissing d'Artagnan goodbye or as d'Artagnan put it \\"she wanted to give me something to remember her by!\\" At Musketeer Headquarters, Captain Rochefort (Michael Wincott) and the Cardinal's Guards have disbanded the Musketeers as per the orders of Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry), the King's Minister, ostensibly to help fight in an impending war with England. Rochefort confides to the Cardinal that there are three Musketeers that have refused to relinquish their duties: Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Porthos (Oliver Platt), and Aramis (Charlie Sheen). Upon reaching Paris, the headstrong d'Artagnan has a series of chance physical encounters with these same three Musketeers, resulting in d'Artagnan's accepting a duel with each one that very day. D'Artagnan arrives at the Ruins for his first duel; and, much to his surprise, Athos, Porthos and Aramis reveal themselves as Musketeers. But, before the duels can commence, the Captain of the Cardinal's Guard appears with orders to arrest the resistant Musketeers. Although d'Artagnan himself is not under arrest, he joins the three Musketeers in the ensuing skirmish, aligning himself with them. Displeased (but still impressed) by d'Artagnan's involvement, the Three Musketeers leave d'Artagnan behind. More of the Cardinal's Guards, led by Rochefort, arrive; and d'Artagnan is captured. During an escape attempt, d'Artagnan is able to eavesdrop on a conversation between Cardinal Richelieu and Milady de Winter (Rebecca De Mornay),...

Options: - murky - confusing - invisible - misunderstood - teacher  Explain why a human would choose \\"invisible\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human might choose \\"invisible\\" to answer the question above because the question implies a sense of contradiction or unexpectedness. In this context, the word \\"invisible\\" acts as a metaphor for something that is paradoxical, as it appears to be in direct contrast with the initial statement about the class being clear. When a class is clear, it means that the content is well-explained, easy to understand, and coherent. However, the question seems to push for an answer that seems to challenge or contradict this statement. By examining the given options, we can explore why \\"invisible\\" could be the chosen metaphorical answer: 1. Murky - This option is in contrast with the clarity of the class, but it does not convey the unexpectedness or contradictory nature implied in the question. 2. Confusing - Similar to murky, this option opposes the class being clear, but it does not capture the paradoxical element the question suggests. 3. Invisible - This option metaphorically represents a class that is so clear and easy to understand that it almost seems as though there is nothing to see or grasp. It draws upon the paradoxical concept of something being \\"too perfect\\" or \\"too good to be true,\\" prompting a human to select it as the best choice. 4. Misunderstood - Although this option seems to be contradicting the class's clarity, it does not have the same metaphorical or unexpected punch as \\"invisible.\\" 5. Teacher - This option doesn't fit the context or the structure of the question, as it seems unrelated to the comparison required by the sentence. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"invisible\\" to answer the question because it represents a metaphorical and unexpected response to the paradoxical nature of the question. By doing so, it challenges the perceived perfection and clarity of the class and invites the reader to entertain the possibility that there may be underlying layers or complexities not immediately evident."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ewood Park has been the club's home ground since its establishment in 1890, and it currently holds a seating capacity of around 31,367 spectators. Blackburn Rovers has a rich history in English football and is one of the founding members of both the Football League in 1888 and the Premier League in 1992. The club has won the English top division title three times: in the 1911-1912, 1913-1914, and 1994-1995 seasons. Additionally, Rovers have been winners of the FA Cup on six occasions and were runners-up in the Football League Cup once. Some notable players who have represented Blackburn Rovers throughout their history include Alan Shearer, who scored a record 34 goals in the 1994-95 season, leading the team to its Premier League title under then-manager Kenny Dalglish; Chris Sutton, who formed a prolific striking partnership with Shearer during the title-winning season; and Tim Flowers, the goalkeeper who played a vital role in securing the club's top-flight championship. The Blackburn Rovers fanbase is regarded as passionate and loyal, with Ewood Park often providing an intense atmosphere during home matches. The stadium is divided into four main sections: the Darwen End, the Jack Walker Stand (named after the club's former owner), the Riverside Stand, and the Blackburn End. Ewood Park has also served as a venue for national team matches, mainly for the England U-21 side, as well as music concerts and other sporting events. In recent years, Blackburn Rovers have experienced fluctuating fortunes, with the club currently (as of the 2021-2022 season) competing in the EFL Championship, the second tier of English football.

According to the radar reconstruction, American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at 9:05, east of its last known position. The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C. By 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center. They knew American 77 was lost. At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said \\"we have some planes.\\" Concerns over the safety of other aircraft began to mount. A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted to order a \\"nationwide ground stop.\\" While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters, the Command Center ordered one at 9:25. The Command Center kept looking for American 77. At 9:21, it advised the Dulles terminal control facility, and Dulles urged its controllers to look for primary targets. At 9:32, they found one. Several of the Dulles controllers \\"observed a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed\\" and notified Reagan National Airport. FAA personnel at both Reagan National and Dulles airports notified the Secret Service.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music. Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent (\\"The Silver Bell\\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel Carré's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy \\"To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition\\". Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted. In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation.

Movie title: Fright Night II Movie plot: Fright Night Part II begins after the hellish events in the original Fright Night. Charley (William Ragsdale) now believes that Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon), was nothing but a serial killer posing as a vampire. As a result, he comes to believe that vampires never existed.Charley, along with his new girlfriend, Alex Young (Traci Lind), go to visit Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), who is again a burnt-out vampire killer on Fright Night much to the chagrin of the boy-who-cried-wolf Charley. It is while visiting Peter's apartment that Charley sees four coffins being taken into a car. On the way out from Peter's apartment, Charley sees four strange people walk past him, into an elevator. Charley instantly becomes smitten with one of the four, the alluring Regine (Julie Carmen). Charley drives Alex back to her dorm room and begins to make out with her, only to pull away and see Regine staring back at him. A ticked-off Alex storms off, not realizing that something is following her. Another girl leaves the dorm as Alex enters, and she is followed and killed by one of Regine's henchmen, Belle. Alex, meanwhile, is unaware that Louie, another of Regine's posse, is scaling up the wall outside her window, but he is startled and falls when Alex inadvertently slams her window shut on his hands. Bozworth ( Brian Thompson), the third heavy, makes fun of Louie before consuming some bugs.Meanwhile, later that night Charley dreams that Regine comes to visit him, only for her to turn into a vampire and bite him. The next day Charley talks to his psychiatrist who assures him that what he dreamed was only natural. Alex finds Charley bowling, per doctor's orders, and Charley agrees to go to the symphony with her. On his way there however he sees his friend Richie (Merritt Butrick) with Regine and opts to follow him. Charley climbs up to a fire escape outside of Regine's apartment, only to be horrified when he sees Regine and Belle attack and drain Richie's blood. Charley runs off to find Peter, and the two of them arm themselves... Answer:","output":"In the movie Fright Night Part II, Charley begins to show signs of being a vampire by becoming sensitive to various elements commonly associated with vampire lore. One such sign is his increased sensitivity to sunlight, a classic vampire weakness. As a vampire, Charley would find direct sunlight extremely painful and potentially lethal, causing his skin to burn and possibly leading to his eventual death if exposed for too long. Another sign indicating Charley's transformation could be his heightened sensitivity to garlic. In many vampire stories and myths, vampires are repelled by the smell of garlic, and it is often used as a means of protection against them. This sensitivity can manifest itself in physical discomfort, coughing, sneezing, or even genuine pain when exposed to garlic. Additionally, Charley could also become sensitive to religious symbols, such as crosses or holy water. These items are believed to have the power to ward off evil spirits, including vampires. If Charley were to become increasingly bothered or repelled by religious items, it would indicate a gradual transformation into a vampire. Furthermore, Charley might experience a change in his appetite, developing a strong craving for blood. As a vampire, Charley would rely on the consumption of blood to sustain his newfound immortality, strength, and other vampire abilities. An insatiable thirst for blood would be another strong indicator that Charley is, in fact, becoming a vampire. Lastly, Charley could display a heightened sense of strength and agility, as well as accelerated healing abilities – qualities often attributed to vampires. The transformation into a vampire would grant him these supernatural powers, making him faster, stronger, and more resilient than an average human. In summary, Charley's transformation into a vampire in the movie Fright Night Part II may be indicated by the following signs: increased sensitivity to sunlight, garlic, and religious symbols, a strong craving for blood, and the development of enhanced physical abilities, such as strength and agility. By paying attention to these signs, it may become clear that Charley is indeed undergoing a slow and terrifying transformation into a creature of the night."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"Really?  \\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Genuinely?\\"?","output":"To analyze whether the premise \\"Really?\\" entails the hypothesis \\"Genuinely?\\", we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Understand the meaning of the premise and hypothesis. In this case, both \\"Really?\\" and \\"Genuinely?\\" are questions expressing doubt or seeking confirmation about the truth or sincerity of something. They show that the person asking the question is trying to clarify whether the information they received is trustworthy. Step 2: Determine the logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis. Since both questions are meant to seek clarity or express doubt, they are logically connected. However, they are not statements with truth values and cannot be directly compared in terms of entailment. Entailment typically deals with the relationship between statements or propositions, where if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be true as well. Step 3: Consider the implications of the premise being true. If the premise \\"Really?\\" is true, it tells us that the person asking the question is skeptical or seeking additional information to confirm the genuineness of a statement. However, since it is a question, the truth value of the premise cannot be accurately assessed. Step 4: Consider whether the implications of the premise being true also makes the hypothesis true. Assuming the situation in which one person is questioning another person's sincerity using the term \\"Really?\\", and the other party responds with \\"Genuinely?\\", it can be inferred that the hypothesis is being used to support or confirm the truth of the information. However, entailment does not apply between the premise and the hypothesis, as both are questions and not statements. In conclusion, while there is a logical connection between \\"Really?\\" and \\"Genuinely?\\" in terms of expressing skepticism and seeking clarity, they cannot be analyzed in terms of entailment. Entailment requires statements with truth values, and both the premise and hypothesis are questions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The two sentences provided contain different information, and a direct correlation between the truth of the first sentence and the truth of the second cannot be established based on the information given. Sentence 1: \\"i enjoyed talking to you in Lubbock\\" This sentence implies that the speaker enjoyed having a conversation with someone else while they were in Lubbock. This statement can be true without having any bearing on the second sentence, as it simply deals with the speaker's personal experience. Sentence 2: \\"The Lubbock public park is perfect for conversationalists.\\" In this sentence, the focus is on the Lubbock public park and its suitability for people who enjoy conversing with others. It is a separate statement that doesn't rely on the first sentence to be true or false.

The first sentence only talks about the speaker's experience while conversing with someone in Lubbock, not about Lubbock's public park or its suitability for conversationalists.

Answer a question about this article: While Nintendo never released an adapter for playing NES games on the SNES (though the instructions included a way to connect both consoles to the same TV by either daisy chaining the RF switches or using AV outputs for one or both systems), the Super Game Boy adapter cartridge allows games designed for Nintendo's portable Game Boy system to be played on the SNES.

Sadly, not everyone in these countries is so fortunate and many people in rich countries are homeless. The reasons for homelessness are various, but poverty is undoubtedly one of the main causes.

Often, the fact that unemployed people get help from the government prevents this from happening, but not always. Some homeless people are mentally ill and have no one to look after them. Some are young people who, for one reason or another, have left home and have nowhere to live. Many of them have had a serious disagreement with their parents and have left home, choosing to go to a city and live on the streets. Sometimes they have taken such action because they have been unable to get on with a step-parent. Many homeless people get into the habit of begging to get enough money to stay alive, but many of the general public refuse to give anything to beggars. Often they are moved on by the police, being accused  ,whether rightly or wrongly, of forceful begging . There are many who disrespect homeless people.

As one of the newest additions to the Strip, it's always fun to walk around the new casino floors and to visit the shops. I'll admit that I'm a fan of the classy yet modern theme they went with; however I do wish they had better integrated all the buildings in the new 'City Center'. It's a little annoying that I can't walk easily from Aria to Cosmopolitan when both buildings were essentially built at the same time.  The rooms were impressive. Anything that used electricity was linked together and could be controlled from a single remote. Setting your alarm to open the blinds and turn on ESPN was pretty neat.  The rooms did have a couple downsides. The fully-integrated electronics could be a little annoying (ex: navigating the remote to choose a channel to watch was arduous).

By investing time in regular care, he has ensured that his plants flourish, thus creating a more visually appealing space. Here are a few key reasons for the difference in their gardens: 1. Plant Variety: Dennis has a diverse selection of plants that bring a harmonious balance of varying sizes, colors, and textures to his garden. This assortment adds an element of charm and attracts various species of birds and butterflies, making it even more beautiful. 2. Placement and Design: Dennis has strategically placed his plants according to their growing habits and care requirements. By thoughtfully organizing the layout, he has effectively maximized the use of available space and ensured that each plant receives the necessary sunlight and water. 3. Regular Maintenance: Dennis pays attention to the needs of his garden by trimming and pruning overgrown plants, removing any dead leaves or flowers, and eradicating weeds. This meticulous upkeep enhances the garden's overall aesthetics and promotes healthy growth. 4. Fertilization and Soil Health: The health of plants is directly linked to the quality of the soil. Dennis consistently amends the soil with compost and organic matter, making it nutrient-rich and well-draining. The plants in his garden are visibly healthier and more vibrant as a result. 5. Irrigation: Dennis has set up an efficient irrigation system that provides adequate water to his plants without over or under-watering them. This not only conserves water but also ensures that plant roots get the right amount needed to thrive. 6. Accessories and Decor: Lastly, Dennis has tastefully incorporated ornamental features, such as garden art, benches, and charming pathways, which add character and appeal to the overall ambiance of his garden. In contrast, Ian's garden might lack some of these elements, which contributes to the disparity in the aesthetic value of the two gardens. By adopting similar gardening practices, Ian can also transform his garden into a more beautiful and inviting space."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q:Given the background: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).  and the situation: There are two dairy farms in the town of Milkton and both are about the same size. Farm A produces only organic milk. Farm B does not but they are considering switching production to organic milk.  Answer the following question: Which farm uses more pesticides, dairy farm A or B? A:","output":"Dairy Farm B uses more pesticides than Dairy Farm A. This is because Farm A produces only organic milk, which involves a reduction in the utilization of pesticides compared to conventional milk production methods employed by Farm B. Organic farming practices focus on sustainable and environmentally friendly methods of agriculture, and one of the key principles is to limit or avoid the use of synthetic chemicals, such as pesticides, in favor of alternative pest and disease management techniques. On the other hand, Farm B, which currently practices conventional milk production, is likely to have a greater dependence on pesticides to protect their crops and maintain high yields per hectare. Conventional farming practices often involve the use of synthetic pesticides to manage pests and diseases, which may result in higher levels of pesticide use compared to organic farming methods. Overall, the difference in pesticide use can be attributed to the distinct farming practices employed by organic and conventional farms. In this case, Dairy Farm A, which produces only organic milk, uses fewer pesticides compared to Dairy Farm B, which is currently engaged in conventional milk production."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bond agents typically have offices near local jails or criminal courts, and they often have a lot of information about people who've been arrested or charges that have been filed.  Much of a bond agent's business comes from being easily accessible and easy to find, so it should be easy to locate a number of bond agents nearby. Bond agent offices frequently are open late hours and weekends, so it may be easier to track down a bond agent than it is to call the jail. Particularly if the person has already been booked, a bond agent with an office near the jail may have information on whether the person has been arrested or is being held at the local jail.  Even if you end up not using the bond agent to bail the person out, they typically are willing to provide you any information they may have. A bond agent also may be able to help you if you aren't sure about the person's legal name. If they were present when the person was booked, they may be able to recognize the person from a physical description. How much information a bond agent will have often depends on how busy the jail was on that particular night. If the bond agent is located in a small town or relatively rural area, you probably can get more information than if you live in a densely populated urban area. If the person has been arrested and booked in the local jail, and you want to help get them out, the bond agent can help you find out whether the person's bond has been set and what you can do to pay it.  You also may be able to find this information by calling the jail. If the person hasn't been booked yet, the jail will let you know when that person's bail hearing will be held. Typically, the booking and bail hearing will be held within 24 to 48 hours of the time the person is arrested. If the person has special medical or other needs, talk to someone at the jail and find out what you can do to help or get needed medications to them.","output":"A bond agent is a helpful person near jails who can give you information about someone arrested and can also help you pay money to get them out of jail if needed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, there is a difference in their focus - Question 1 simply asks for the best laptop in the given price range, while Question 2 specifies that the laptop is meant for students. Therefore, the answer for Question 2 may place more emphasis on features and functionalities that would be particularly useful for students while determining the best laptop. In order to provide a comprehensive answer, we will consider factors like performance, battery life, storage, display, and reliability, while also discussing what features might be more important for students within that budget. Best Laptop Under 30,000: 1. HP 245 G8 (Budget Laptop for Students) The HP 245 G8 is a versatile laptop that offers good performance and value for its price. Some of its key features include: - AMD Ryzen 3 3300U processor, which offers efficient multitasking and improved performance compared to Intel alternatives at this price point - 14-inch HD (1366 x 768) anti-glare display, which helps reduce eye strain during long work or study sessions - 8GB DDR4 RAM for smooth multitasking - 1TB HDD storage, providing ample space for documents, music, videos, and applications - Integrated AMD Radeon Vega 6 graphics, suitable for basic graphics tasks and casual gaming - Windows 10 Home operating system - Good build quality and decent battery life, lasting around 6 hours on a single charge Considering the needs of a student, this laptop should work well for basic tasks such as web browsing, document editing, and media consumption. Its solid build quality and decent battery life make it suitable for use in classrooms, libraries, or anywhere else a student might need to work. Although its display resolution and graphic capabilities are not top-of-the-line, it's unlikely that a student would need higher-quality visuals for studying or other academic tasks within this budget range. In addition, the HP 245 G8 sacrifices a sleek design for greater affordability and functionality, which is more important for a budget-conscious user such as a student. Overall, the HP 245 G8 offers an excellent balance of performance and value for money and is arguably the best laptop under 30,000 for students seeking a reliable device for their academic needs."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

For comparison, this is 10.7 °C (20 °F) colder than subliming dry ice at one atmosphere of partial pressure, but since CO2 only makes up 0.039% of air, temperatures of less than −150 °C (−238 °F) would be needed to produce dry ice snow in Antarctica.

Temperatures reach a minimum of between −80 °C (−112 °F) and −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F) in the interior in winter and reach a maximum of between 5 °C (41 °F) and 15 °C (59 °F) near the coast in summer. Sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects almost all of the ultraviolet light falling on it. Given the latitude, long periods of constant darkness or constant sunlight create climates unfamiliar to human beings in much of the rest of the world. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What was the coldest temperature ever recorded?","output":"The coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth was -89.2°C (-128.6°F) at the Soviet (now Russian) Vostok Station in Antarctica on July 21, 1983. This extremely low temperature was recorded during the winter months in the interior of the continent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Process: - Fluid - Waste enters the kidneys - A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass - Prevents larger molecules to pass - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream - Bad waste is removed - The final product is turned into urine.  Question: suppose less acid rain lands happens, how will it affect MORE waste being removed from the body.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"Less effect.  Explanation: If less acid rain occurs, it means that there will be a decrease in the concentration of acidic substances in the environment, including in the water we consume. As acid rain typically contains pollutants like sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), reducing the occurrence of acid rain will also decrease the amount of these pollutants entering our body through drinking water. Since our kidneys are responsible for filtering waste and excess substances from the bloodstream and turning it into urine, a reduction in such pollutants will lead to a decreased amount of waste to be processed by the kidneys. Consequently, the kidneys will have less waste to remove and dispose of through urine. In this case, the perturbation of reduced acid rain has a \\"less effect\\" on the amount of waste being removed from the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Robert, a baker, has just baked a large batch of cupcakes for his store. He won't be able to sell all of his cupcakes within the next week, so he has decided to store a portion of them in the freezer to preserve them for later. He is trying to decide if he should store the cupcakes at 0° F or at 10° F in the freezer.  and a hint : Freezing is a common method of food preservation that slows both food decay and the growth of micro-organisms. Besides the effect of lower temperatures on reaction rates, freezing makes water less available for bacterial growth.  Please answer this question : Which temperature will result in faster decay of the cupcakes? Answer:","output":"The temperature at which the cupcakes will decay faster can be determined by understanding the effects of freezing and the different temperature options available. As mentioned in the hint, freezing is a common method of food preservation that slows both food decay and the growth of micro-organisms. This occurs because lower temperatures reduce reaction rates and decrease water availability for bacterial growth. Between the two temperature options provided, 0° F (-17.8° C) and 10° F (-12.2° C), the lower temperature would generally be more effective in preserving the cupcakes for a longer period. At 0° F (-17.8° C), the decay of the cupcakes will be slower than at 10° F (-12.2° C). This is because the lower temperature further reduces the rate of chemical reactions responsible for food spoilage, and the growth of micro-organisms is significantly slowed down. Moreover, water in the cupcakes will be more frozen at 0° F, making it less available for bacterial growth and hence decreasing the chance of spoilage. On the other hand, at 10° F (-12.2° C), the decay rate will be faster due to slightly higher temperatures that might allow for slightly faster reaction rates and possible growth of cold-tolerant microorganisms. Additionally, the water content in the cupcakes might be more available at this temperature as compared to 0° F, providing more suitable conditions for bacterial growth. To sum it up, the temperature that will result in faster decay of the cupcakes is 10° F (-12.2° C). Robert should store his cupcakes at 0° F (-17.8° C) in the freezer to maximize their preservation and minimize spoilage. It is essential to maintain a consistent temperature and ensure that the cupcakes are stored in an airtight container/bag to prevent freezer burn and maintain their quality for a longer period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bronx-born U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor led the 60-second countdown and pushed the button that unleashed the shimmering orb with 2,688 crystals, a role usually filled by the New York City mayor.      Mayor Michael Bloomberg, on his last day in office, sat out the celebration after 12 years on the job, while newly elected Mayor Bill de Blasio took the oath of office just after midnight at his Brooklyn home.      Kerrie McConaghy, 20, a university student visiting Times Square from Armagh, Ireland, was dancing and jumping up and down, donning a big blue top hat.      \\"It's unbelievable here,\\" she said. \\"The lights, seeing the ball, hearing the music, all the people. It's amazing.\\"      \\"TV doesn't do this justice,\\" she said. \\"You have to be here to believe it.\\"      Marcus Ix, 34, visiting from Germany, gave his wife, Sabrina, a big kiss when the ball dropped and confetti rained down.      \\"This is the best New Year's Eve of my life,\\" he said as the crowd erupted with cheers and cries of \\"Happy New Year!\\" ''It was worth the 13 hour wait in the cold.\\"      The annual New York celebration, which this year featured performances from artists such as Miley Cyrus, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis and Blondie, has become part endurance sport because post-9/11 security measures force spectators into pens at least 12 hours in advance, with no food, warmth or bathrooms.      \\"We've got adult diapers.

Her legs swelled up like balloons.      Merrir was fasting and not drinking anything to deal with the lack of restrooms. As for the cold, she recommended vigorous dancing for as long as you can stand on your feet.      \\"At a point,\\" she said, \\"your brain is not working anymore.\\"      Las Vegas held one its biggest ever New Year's Eve celebrations, with sold-out concerts and an eight-minute long fireworks show that was billed as the largest in the country. The Minus5 Ice Bar Mandalay Bay started handing out free champagne for hourly toasts at 11 a.m. Tourists were seen toting novelty drinks into casinos by noon.      Big-ticket musical acts Bruno Mars, John Legend and Maroon 5 helped lure 335,000 visitors to Las Vegas by nightfall on Tuesday — 5,000 more than last year, tourism officials said.      On the other side of the Atlantic, London welcomed 2014 with a mixture of futuristic fireworks and torch-lit tradition. The city's mayor said this year's explosive display came packed with peach-flavored snow, edible banana confetti and orange-scented bubbles. The evening also included scratch-and-sniff programs, LED wristbands and fruit-flavored sweets.      In Russia, where two suicide bombings in two days killed 34 people, eerily empty busses lumbered through the streets of Volgograd, where authorities canceled mass events for New Year's Eve and asked residents not to set off fireworks.      President Vladimir Putin, in his New Year's Eve address to the nation, vowed that the fight against terrorists will continue \\"until their destruction is complete,\\" Russian news agencies reported.      In Dubai, a Persian Gulf city known for glitz, glamour and over-the-top achievements like the world's tallest skyscraper, officials sought to break another record by creating the largest fireworks show.      The Dubai skyline was a canvas for a dazzling 30-minute show. The display capped off with six minutes of fireworks that engulfed the city's man-made, palm-shaped island, with its fronds and trunk shimmering in thousands of lights. Organizers had promised that the fireworks would form a flying falcon, a sunrise and the United Arab Emirates flag.      More than 260 people were injured by firecracker blasts and celebratory gunfire in the Philippines, a nation marking the end of a year of tragic disasters, including a Nov. 8 typhoon that left more than 6,100 dead and nearly 1,800 missing.      \\"Many here are welcoming the new year after losing their mothers, fathers, siblings and children so you can imagine how it feels,\\" said village chief Maria Rosario Bactol of the Anibong community in Tacloban, the city worst hit by Typhoon Haiyan. \\"I tell them to face the reality, to move on and stand up, but I know it will never be easy.\\"      ___      Associated Press writers Aya Batrawy in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia; Jim Gomez in Manila, Philippines; Kelvin Chan in Hong Kong; Ali Kotarumalos in Jakarta, Indonesia; Ken Moritsugu, Yuri Kageyama and Eric Talmadge in Tokyo; Louise Watt in Beijing; Hannah Dreier in Las Vegas and Colleen Long in New York City contributed to this report. ||||| Story highlights Revelers in London were treated to edible confetti choreographed to fireworks      Dubai's huge firework show certified as largest by Guinness World Records      40,000 new laws go into effect in the U.S., some involving pot, placentas and shark fins      A bar in Florida celebrates by lowering a drag queen from a giant shoe from the building      Yes, it's New Year's Eve again, time to bust out the champagne and make resolutions you probably won't keep.

Dubai goes big -- really big      In Dubai -- a city obsessed with superlatives -- organizers pulled off a world record for the biggest fireworks display near the world's tallest building      The spectacular show featured 400,000 pyrotechnics over 400 parts of the Dubai shoreline. That's 100 kilometers (62 miles) of waterfront lighting up.      The Guinness World Records staff later labeled it the largest ever. The show blew Kuwait's world record out of the water when last year it set off 77,000 fireworks over 64 minutes.      3. Have a ball -- an 'odd' ball      Sure, New York has a massive sparkly ball they've been dropping for the past century or so. But what other objects can you relinquish to gravity to mark the new year?      The North Carolina mountain town of Brasstown prefers a possum -- slowly lowered and then set free.      But Key West, Florida, takes the cake with its drag queen drop      For years, female impersonator Gary \\"Sushi\\" Marion has been lowered from the Bourbon St. Pub in Key West while riding in a massive high-heel shoe.      \\"It was inspired by 'Priscilla Queen of the Desert' when it first came out, with the whole high heel on top of the bus,\\" said Joey Schroeder, owner of Bourbon St. Pub. \\"I wanted to take that idea and do something fun on New Year's Eve.\\"      4. 25 hours of celebrations      Samoa and American Samoa are virtually neighbors, with just 101 miles between them. But they're also 25 hours apart      So one was among the first to ring in the new year; the other will be among the last.      How can this happen? Let's just say the international date line isn't even close to a straight line      And because the date line isn't fixed by any international law or agreement, it can zig and zag to accommodate government and business interests. It's as close to a time machine as we'll probably get.      5. Yes to placentas, no to shark fins      More than 40,000 new laws will take effect in the U.S. on New Year's Day. While Colorado's legalization of marijuana has racked up plenty of headlines, here are some of the more peculiar ones:      In Oregon, mothers will be allowed to take their placentas home from the hospital. Some say placenta capsules can help with postpartum depression, CNN affiliate KGW reported, though there's not a lot of medical research backing that up.      Delaware will join a growing number of states where you can't own, sell or distribute shark fins, which is considered a delicacy in some East Asian cuisine.      And thousands of companies will have to provide calorie counts for products sold in vending machines.      Because if you're going to a vending machine, clearly you care the most about calories, right?      Depends on what day of the resolution you're on. ||||| Summary:","output":"People all around the world celebrated the beginning of 2014 with big parties and amazing firework shows.

Question: Where should a ventilation system be closed? Options: - house - office building - in the attic - hospital - large building  Explain why a human would choose \\"hospital\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human might choose \\"hospital\\" as the answer to the question of where a ventilation system should be closed due to the following reasons: 1. Infection control: Hospitals are places where many people, including patients with various infections and diseases, healthcare professionals, and visitors, come together. Closing the ventilation system in a hospital can help to minimize the spread of airborne pathogens and germs, thus mitigating cross-contamination. 2. Maintaining a sterile environment: Certain areas of a hospital, such as operating rooms or intensive care units, require a high degree of sterility. Closing the ventilation system in these areas can help maintain a clean, sterile environment, preventing contamination that could jeopardize patient health and safety. 3. Controlled airflow: Hospitals often have specialized filtration systems designed to maintain optimal airflow and air quality. Closing the ventilation system in specific areas allows for better control over the airflow and distribution of filtered air, ensuring adequate conditions for patient care and treatment. 4. Energy efficiency: Since hospitals typically operate 24/7, they consume a significant amount of energy. Closing the ventilation system in certain areas or during periods of low occupancy can help save energy, reducing costs and environmental impact. However, it is important to note that closing the ventilation system may not always be the most appropriate action, depending on the context and specific needs of each location. The choice to close it should be determined by expert advice tailored to the unique requirements and circumstances of the given building."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 2007, Gabe Newell of Valve said \\"The PS3 is a total disaster on so many levels, I think it's really clear that Sony lost track of what customers and what developers wanted\\". He continued \\"I'd say, even at this late date, they should just cancel it and do a do over. Just say, 'This was a horrible disaster and we're sorry and we're going to stop selling this and stop trying to convince people to develop for it'\\". Doug Lombardi VP of Marketing for Valve has since stated that they are interested in developing for the console and are looking to hire talented PS3 programmers for future projects. He later restated Valve's position, \\"Until we have the ability to get a PS3 team together, until we find the people who want to come to Valve or who are at Valve who want to work on that, I don't really see us moving to that platform\\". At Sony's E3 2010 press conference, Newell made a live appearance to recant his previous statements, citing Sony's move to make the system more developer friendly, and to announce that Valve would be developing Portal 2 for the system. He also claimed that the inclusion of Steamworks (Valve's system to automatically update their software independently) would help to make the PS3 version of Portal 2 the best console version on the market. Who is Valve's VP of Marketing who says they want to hire programmers for a PS3 team? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"Valve's Vice President of Marketing who expressed the company's interest in hiring programmers for a PS3 team is Doug Lombardi. In response to criticism about the difficulty of programming for the PS3, Lombardi stated that Valve was actively looking to recruit talented PS3 programmers for their future projects. This suggests an interest in overcoming the challenges and unlocking the potential of the PS3 console for game development, despite initial negative comments about the system. This comment came as a restatement of Valve's position regarding the PS3, with Lombardi explaining, \\"Until we have the ability to get a PS3 team together, until we find the people who want to come to Valve or who are at Valve who want to work on that, I don't really see us moving to that platform\\". Understandably, building a dedicated team is critical for specializing in console-specific development, and overcoming the technical hurdles that come with it. It's also interesting to note that Gabe Newell, from Valve, later publicly recanted his previous critical statements about the PS3 at Sony's E3 2010 press conference. He cited Sony's efforts to make their system more developer-friendly as a significant reason for this change of heart, and went on to announce that Valve would be developing the game Portal 2 for the PS3. He further claimed that the inclusion of Steamworks, Valve's system for automatic software updates, would help make the PS3 version of Portal 2 the best console version on the market. So, while there have been perceived difficulties and initial negative comments in regards to developing for the PS3, both Lombardi and Newell have shown, in their statements and actions, Valve's willingness to work with and adapt to the PS3 system for the development of their projects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: A YORKSHIRE curry restaurant owner with a “cavalier attitude” to safety was today beginning a six-year jail term for the manslaughter of a customer with a nut allergy, after he supplied him with a curry containing peanuts.      Paul Wilson, 38, was meticulous about his condition and asked for “no nuts” when staff at the Indian Garden, Easingwold, North Yorkshire, cooked his chicken tikka masala takeaway.      Bar manager Mr Wilson was found slumped in the toilet at his home in Helperby in January 2014 and had died from a severe anaphylactic shock.      Restaurant owner Mohammed Zaman was convicted of gross negligence manslaughter following a trial at Teesside Crown Court at which the jury was told he swapped almond powder in recipes for cheaper groundnut mix, containing peanuts, despite warnings.      The case is thought to be a legal first which sets a precedent for food suppliers.      Previously: Peanut allergy diner died after Yorkshire Indian restaurant owner ‘ignored repeated warnings’      Keith and Margaret Wilson, whose son Paul Wilson died after eating a takeaway curry from the Indian Garden, Easingwold      The curry that killed him: Video shows allergy sufferer Paul Wilson ordering meal from Yorkshire restaurant      Judge Simon Bourne-Arton, the Recorder of Middlesbrough, said Zaman had made a success of himself since coming to this country more than 40 years ago, building up his businesses and gathering a property portfoilio worth more than £2 million.      “You threw all that away,” the judge said. “You have done so in pursuit of profit.      “You have done so in such a manner as to bring about the death of another individual.      Restaurant owner Mohammed Zaman (right) leaving Teesside Crown Court      “Paul Wilson was in the prime of his life.      “He, like you, worked in the catering trade. He, unlike you, was a careful man.”      The judge said Zaman ignored warnings from officials after 17-year-old Ruby Scott suffered a reaction to a curry, three weeks before Mr Wilson’s death.      He could have destroyed the groundnut mix then, but decided to continue to use it at his restaurants.      The judge said Zaman had told “many lies” to the jury, adding: “You remain in complete and utter denial for what you have done.”      This was not a “transitory” case of gross negligence, but one lasting seven months - from his fateful decision to switch almond for groundnut in June 2013.      The court heard that Zaman, who owned six restaurants in York and North Yorkshire, was almost £300,000 in debt and cut costs by using the cheaper ingredient and by employing untrained, illegal workers.      Mr Wilson bought a takeaway from the Indian Garden in Easingwold, North Yorkshire, in January 2014.      After eating very little of it, he was found slumped in the toilet at his home in Helperby by his housemate. He died from a severe anaphylactic shock.      Zaman was convicted of gross negligence manslaughter after the jury was told he swapped almond powder in recipes for the cheaper groundnut mix, despite warnings that it could endanger customers with allergies.      After the verdict, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it showed that food suppliers had a duty of care towards their customers.      Zaman, who owned six restaurants in York and North Yorkshire, cut costs by using the cheaper ingredient and by employing untrained, illegal workers.      The prosecution said the owner had “put profit before safety” at the restaurants he owned.      Zaman denied manslaughter by gross negligence, perverting the course of justice and six food safety offences. He was found guilty of all charges except perverting the course of justice.      He claimed he left managers to run his restaurants and that included ordering stock and hiring staff. He was not on the premises when the curry was sold.      Richard Wright QC, prosecuting, said: “Mohammed Zaman received numerous warnings that he was putting his customers’ health, and potentially their lives, at risk.      “Tragically for Paul Wilson, Mohammed Zaman took none of those opportunities and ignored all of the warnings he was given.      “His was a reckless and cavalier attitude to risk and one that we, the prosecution, would describe as grossly negligent.”      Mr Wilson’s parents, Keith and Margaret, from Sheffield, said their son had carefully managed his condition since he was seven when he had a reaction to a Marathon chocolate bar.      He loved curry but was always clear when ordering that his food must not contain nuts.      They said: “Justice has been served, Paul can rest in peace.      “We can’t go back and change the past, all we can do is focus on the present and the future and making things right. Don’t let this happen again.”      Outside court, Detective Inspector Shaun Page said Mr Wilson’s death was “totally avoidable”.      He added: “We have shown Zaman had a duty of care to serve safe food.      “He has breached that duty to a criminal standard.”      Martin Goldman, chief crown prosecutor with CPS Yorkshire and Humberside, said: “In this conviction, the CPS has sent a very clear message to the catering industry: there is a duty of care to your customers.      “If you ignore your responsibilities and regulations and put lives at real risk then we will not hesitate to prosecute.”      Alistair Webster QC, defending, said Zaman was a hard-working family man with no previous convictions. ||||| LONDON — The owner of an Indian restaurant in Britain with a “cavalier attitude” to food safety was found guilty on Monday of causing the death of a customer who had a severe allergy, after he was served a dish containing peanuts. The owner received a six-year sentence.      It marked the first time in Britain that someone has been convicted of manslaughter over the sale of food.      The customer, Paul Wilson, 38, ordered chicken tikka masala, to go, from the Indian Garden restaurant in North Yorkshire in January 2014, having specified “no nuts” in his order.      Mr. Wilson had diligently avoided peanuts and dishes made with them ever since he had a severe reaction to eating a chocolate bar with peanuts when he was 7 years old. He was “very, very careful,” his mother, Margaret, said, especially when ordering his favorite meal.      Mr. Wilson had eaten food from Indian Garden before, and the restaurant had gone so far as to write “no nuts” on the lid of his curry container.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      But after just one bite of what would be his last meal, Mr. Wilson had an allergic reaction. His roommate found him slumped on his toilet at home, where he had gone into anaphylactic shock and died.      Prosecutors said that the restaurateur, Mohammed Zaman, 52, who owns six restaurants, was about 300,000 pounds, or about 434,000, in debt. He had cut corners, they said, replacing almond powder in his recipes six months earlier with a cheaper mix of groundnuts, and hiring untrained, undocumented workers to turn out the popular curry dishes at his restaurants.      Another customer with a nut allergy had to be treated at a hospital after eating at Mr. Zaman’s restaurant three weeks before Mr. Wilson’s death. Like him, she had been assured her meal would not contain nuts, prosecutors said.      Mr. Zaman was convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence in the death of Mr. Wilson, and six food safety offenses. He was sentenced to six years in prison.      He had a “reckless and cavalier attitude to risk,” the prosecutor, Richard Wright, told a jury at Teesside Crown Court.      “Time and again he ignored the danger and did not protect his customers,” Mr. Wright said at trial, adding that Mr. Zaman had “put profit before safety, and he cut corners at every turn.”      Mr. Zaman had said that he left his employees to run his restaurants, including ordering the ingredients and preparing the dishes, and that he was not even on the premises when the deadly curry was prepared.      Shaun Page, a detective inspector on the case, said that Mr. Zaman had a duty to serve safe food to his customers and that Mr. Wilson’s death was “totally avoidable.”      According to Allergy UK, a nonprofit group, about 1 percent of Britons are allergic to peanuts. Up to 1.3 percent of Americans are allergic — as many as four million people, according to Food Allergy Research and Education. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that the number of children with food allergies is rising. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A Yorkshire curry restaurant owner has been sentenced to six years in jail for the manslaughter of a customer with a nut allergy.

Context: Progression of pulmonary vascular disease limits heart transplantation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) to early infancy. Our objective was to assess the impact of bilateral pulmonary artery banding (PAB) on the operative courses of HLHS infants transplanted at ages older than 4 months.', 'Courses of all HLHS patients in our center who remained listed to age >or=120 days before heart transplantation were assessed. Patients undergoing transplantation after standard management (control group) were compared to patients having a prior pulmonary blood flow limiting procedure (PAB group).', 'Of 16 identified patients, one crossed over to stage I Norwood on day 185 and died post-operatively. Fifteen patients were transplanted at age >or=120 days (control group n=9, PAB group n=6). Four PAB patients had open PA band placement. Two PAB patients underwent experimental percutaneous bilateral internal pulmonary artery flow limiting device insertion. The PAB group mean age at banding was 141+/-54 days, and mean interval from PAB to transplant was 35+/-31 days (range 1.5-68 days). No differences in age at transplant, weight at transplant, warm graft ischemia time or total graft ischemia time were detected between groups. Mean times of mechanical ventilation (control 143+/-69h vs. PAB 44+/-13h), inhaled nitric oxide (control 126+/-70h vs. PAB 37+/-9h), inotropic support (control 171+/-64h vs. PAB 87+/-17h), intensive care unit (ICU) stay (control 8.3+/-2.7 days vs. PAB 4.5+/-1.4 days), and hospital stay (control 10.4+/-3.9 days vs. PAB 7.0+/-1.1 days) were all lower in the PAB group (P<0.05 all comparisons). Two control patients died, three required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and six did not tolerate primary chest closure. No PAB patient died or required ECMO. All PAB patients tolerated primary chest closure. All PAB patients had widely patent branch pulmonary arteries with no re-interventions to date. All hospital survivors remain alive (mean follow-up, control 50.2 months, PAB 11.5 months).Question: Does mechanical limitation of pulmonary blood flow facilitate heart transplantation in older infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome? A:","output":"Task explanation: The task requires generating an answer to the question \\"Does mechanical limitation of pulmonary blood flow facilitate heart transplantation in older infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome?\\" based on the given context. Guidelines provided: The context provides information about a study involving patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) who underwent heart transplantation. It focuses on comparing the outcomes between the control group, who had no pulmonary blood flow limitation procedures, and the PAB group, who had a mechanical limitation of pulmonary blood flow through bilateral pulmonary artery banding (PAB). Steps to solve the task using guidelines: 1. Identify relevant information from the context: As we are looking for the effect of mechanical limitation of pulmonary blood flow on heart transplantation, we should focus on the outcomes between the control and PAB groups. 2. Extract relevant data from the context: - Mechanical ventilation time: control 143 +/- 69h vs. PAB 44 +/- 13h - Inhaled nitric oxide duration: control 126 +/- 70h vs. PAB 37 +/- 9h - Inotropic support duration: control 171 +/- 64h vs. PAB 87 +/- 17h - ICU stay duration: control 8.3 +/- 2.7 days vs. PAB 4.5 +/- 1.4 days - Hospital stay duration: control 10.4 +/- 3.9 days vs. PAB 7.0 +/- 1.1 days - Total deaths: control group 2 vs. PAB group 0 - ECMO requirement: control group 3 vs. PAB group 0 - Primary chest closure tolerance: control group 6 did not tolerate vs. PAB group all tolerated 3.

Many people like picking mushrooms, but that is not as simple as you might think. Old people who live in the villages know places where you can pick lots of mushrooms. Some mushrooms grow in colonies. If you find one, you only need to look around because nearby you'll find more of them. However, when picking mushrooms, it is important not to choose the wrong kind. You have to be careful because some mushrooms are poisonous even though they look good. The smell can help you choose them, because good mushrooms smell very good. Siberian people are very friendly and hospitable. If someone invites you home for dinner, you'll soon be full. You should try everything the host is having. The climate there depends on the territory. Some places have very comfortable climates with hot summers and cold winters.

Question:   When you are driving down a mountain you will notice the temperature decreases or increases?    Text:  Air in the troposphere is warmer closer to Earths surface. A:","output":"When driving down a mountain, you will generally notice that the temperature increases as you descend. This observation can be understood based on the given text, which states that \\"air in the troposphere is warmer closer to Earth's surface.\\" The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere, and it extends from the Earth's surface up to approximately 8-15 kilometers (5-9 miles) in altitude, depending on the location and time of year. This is the layer where weather and climate occur, as well as the layer through which we tend to travel while driving. The temperature change as you go higher or lower in the troposphere is mainly due to the way solar energy is absorbed and re-emitted within this layer. The Earth's surface absorbs solar radiation and warms up as a result. This heat is then transferred to the air near the ground, making it warmer. As you move upwards in the troposphere, the air becomes cooler since it is further away from the Earth's surface and receives less of the heat energy transferred from the ground. This pattern of decreasing temperature with increasing altitude is called the \\"lapse rate\\" and typically accounts for a decrease of approximately 6.5 degrees Celsius (11.7 degrees Fahrenheit) for every kilometer (0.6 miles) in altitude gained. Thus, as you drive down a mountain and decrease your altitude within the troposphere, you will be moving towards the warmer air closer to Earth's surface. Consequently, the temperature will generally increase as you make your descent."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you're given passages that contain mentions of names of people, places, or things.

Input: Passage: Nicholas Rodney Drake (19 June 1948 – 25 November 1974) was an English singer-songwriter and musician known for his acoustic guitar-based songs. He failed to find a wide audience during his lifetime, but his work has since achieved wider recognition.Drake signed to Island Records when he was 20, while a student at the University of Cambridge, and released his debut album, Five Leaves Left, in 1969. By 1972, he had recorded two more albums, Bryter Layter and Pink Moon. Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release. His reluctance to perform live or give interviews contributed to his lack of commercial success. No footage of the adult Drake has been released, only still photographs.Drake is believed to have suffered from depression, reflected in his lyrics. After making Pink Moon, he withdrew from performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. At the age of 26, Drake died from an overdose of approximately 30 amitriptyline pills, a prescribed antidepressant. His cause of death was determined as suicide.The 1979 release of the retrospective album Fruit Tree triggered a reassessment of Drake's music. By the mid-1980s, he was credited as an influence by such artists as Robert Smith, David Sylvian, and Peter Buck. In 1985, the Dream Academy reached the UK and US charts with \\"Life in a Northern Town\\", a song written for and dedicated to Drake. By the early 1990s, he had come to represent a \\"doomed romantic\\" musician in the UK music press. The first Drake biography was published in 1997, followed in 1998 by the documentary film A Stranger Among Us. In 1999, his song \\"Pink Moon\\" was used in a Volkswagen commercial, resulting in an increase in his U.S. album sales. By 2014, more than 2.4 million Nick Drake albums had been sold in the UK and the US. Output:","output":"1. What kind of songs was Nicholas Rodney Drake known for? 2.

On her second or third day behind the counter, she received a phone call from her nine-year-old son, Jessie. He needed a baseball glove for Little League. She explained that as a single mother, money was very tight, and her first check would have to go for paying bills. Perhaps she could buy his baseball glove with her second or third check. When Cynthia arrived for work the next morning, Patricia, the store manager, asked her to come to the small room in the back of the store that served as an office. Cynthia wondered if she had done something wrong or left some part of her job incomplete from the day before. She was concerned and confused.

The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate.  - The Official World Golf Ranking is a system for rating the performance level of male professional golfers (although there is no rule prohibiting women from being ranked). It was introduced in 1986 and is endorsed by the four major championships and six major professional tours, five of which are charter members of the International Federation of PGA Tours:  - Sir Nicholas Alexander Faldo, (born 18 July 1957) is an English professional golfer on the European Tour, now mainly an on-air golf analyst. A top player of his era, renowned for his single-minded dedication to the game, he was ranked No. 1 on the Official World Golf Ranking for a total of 97 weeks. His 40 professional wins include 30 victories on the European Tour and six major championships: three Open Championships (1987, 1990, 1992) and three Masters (1989, 1990, 1996).  - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union.  - In golf the distinction between amateurs and professionals is rigorously maintained. An amateur who breaches the rules of amateur status may lose his or her amateur status. A golfer who has lost his or her amateur status may not play in amateur competitions until amateur status has been reinstated; a professional may not play in amateur tournaments unless the Committee is notified, acknowledges and confirms the participation. It is very difficult for a professional to regain his or her amateur status; simply agreeing not to take payment for a particular tournament is not enough. A player must apply to the governing body of the sport to have amateur status reinstated.  - In golf, a caddy (or caddie) is the person who carries a player's bag and clubs, and gives insightful advice and moral support. A good caddy is aware of the challenges and obstacles of the golf course being played, along with the best strategy in playing it. This includes knowing overall yardage, pin placements and club selection. A caddy is not usually an employee of a private club or resort. They are classified as an \\"independent contractor,\\" meaning that he or she is basically self-employed and does not receive any benefits or perks from his association with the club. Some clubs and resorts do have caddy programs, although benefits are rarely offered. Particularly in Europe, the vast majority of clubs do not offer caddies, and amateur players will commonly carry or pull their own bags.  - Fanny Sunesson born in Karlshamn , Sweden is a retired professional golf caddy , who is most noted as being the caddy for Nick Faldo from 1990 to 1999 .  - A golf course is the grounds where the game of golf is played. It comprises a series of holes, each consisting of a teeing ground, a fairway, the rough and other hazards, and a green with a flagstick (\\"pin\\") and hole (\\"cup\\"). A standard round of golf consists of 18 holes. Most courses contain 18 holes; some share fairways or greens, and a subset has nine holes, played twice per round. Par-3 courses consist of nine or 18 holes all of which have a par of three strokes.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.  - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states.

He had developed a passion for baking when he was a teenager and spent countless hours watching baking shows and experimenting with various recipes. Over the years, he had honed his skills and become quite adept at making exquisite, delightful, and delicious baked goods, and he took immense pride in sharing his knowledge with others. One day, as Aaron was discussing an upcoming birthday party for one of their mutual friends, Justin expressed interest in making a cake for the event. Justin acknowledged that while he had spent some time creating simple dishes in the kitchen, he had never really delved into the intricate art of baking, particularly when it came to creating a decadent, multi-layered cake. Sensing an opportunity to bond over a shared passion and to mentor a friend in the fascinating world of baking, Aaron gladly offered to assist Justin in his endeavor. Together, Aaron and Justin spent the better part of a weekend planning and carefully selecting the best ingredients for their multi-layered cake. They browsed through numerous recipes and ultimately decided on a scrumptious chocolate sponge cake with alternating layers of rich chocolate ganache and velvety, cloud-like vanilla buttercream frosting. Aaron wanted to make sure Justin would develop a strong foundation in baking techniques, so they decided to add a few extra touches, such as the delicate art of piping and the creation of intricate sugar decorations to adorn the cake. In Aaron's well-equipped kitchen, Justin listened attentively as the experienced baker explained the importance of accurately measuring ingredients, the science behind the chemical reactions that occur while baking, and the significance of temperature control in the oven. As they carefully mixed, poured, and baked each individual layer, Aaron emphasized the significance of patience and the value of precision in each step of the process. Aaron demonstrated the proper way to level the cakes and how to stack them, ensuring that each layer was stable and uniform before continuing with the next. Finally, after several hours of hard work, laughter, and perhaps a bit of healthy competition, the two friends stood back and admired the towering, beautifully decorated multi-layered cake they had created together. Justin marveled at the level of craftsmanship and skill involved in making such an astounding dessert and expressed his gratitude to Aaron for the guidance and support. He couldn't wait to present the cake at the birthday party and share the story of how Aaron had shown him the joy, camaraderie, and love that can be found in the simple act of creating and sharing a delectable homemade cake. So, Aaron showed Justin how to make a multiple layered cake for the birthday because Aaron was an amateur baker. This fascinating journey into the world of baking not only led to the creation of a memorable birthday cake but also forged a lasting bond between two friends united by their shared passion for culinary creation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Therefore, the completion \\"Erin was always keeping herself out of the spotlight.\\" makes logical sense as it correlates with Erin's lesser desire for attention compared to Jennifer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I can use this background: In practice, the diameter of the aperture is chosen based on the focal length of the lens, the diameter and quality of the input beam, and its wavelength (longer wavelengths require larger apertures). If the hole is too small, the beam quality is greatly improved but the power is greatly reduced. If the hole is too large, the beam quality may not be improved as much as desired.  The size of aperture that can be used also depends on the size and quality of the optics. To use a very small pinhole, one must use a focusing lens with a low f-number, and ideally the lens should not add significant aberrations to the beam. The design of such a lens becomes increasingly more difficult as the f-number decreases.  Now, I have a new situation: David needs to purchase a camera for his photography class. He went to the local consumer electronics store to find himself a good camera. Two cameras caught his eye, camera A and camera B. Camera A had a very small pinhole, but camera B had larger aperture. David needs to decide which camera should he buy.  Answer this question please: Which camera would have higher beam quality? A:","output":"Camera A with the very small pinhole would have a higher beam quality. A smaller pinhole usually results in a greater beam quality due to the reduced amount of diffraction and the ability to more precisely control the light passing through the aperture. However, it is important to note that the smaller pinhole in Camera A would also result in less light entering the camera and may require longer exposure times or higher sensitivity (ISO) settings. Camera B with a larger aperture allows more light to enter and is better suited for low-light situations, but the beam quality may not be as good as Camera A. David should consider his specific photography needs (e.g. shooting in low light, the importance of beam quality, and desired level of control over depth of field) when deciding which camera to purchase."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you are a woman and marry an Emirati citizen, you will not automatically become an Emirati citizen.  As a woman, you can get Emirati citizenship as a dependent of your husband, if your husband is an Emirati citizen. Women in the UAE are considered dependents either of their husbands or their fathers, regardless of whether they work or live independently. Women cannot pass on their Emirati citizenship. If you are a man and marry an Emirati woman, you will never be able to get Emirati citizenship as a result of being married to her, no matter how long the marriage lasts. Once you marry an Emirati citizen, you will generally have the right to reside in the UAE with your spouse. However, you will not have the benefits of being a citizen.  When you get married, go to the General Directorate of Residence and Foreign Affairs (GDRFA). Bring your marriage certificate and identification. Tell them that you want to become a national, and they will give you forms to complete. If you are a man and marry an Emirati woman, any children your wife gives birth to will not be Emirati citizens. They will have to wait until they are 18 to apply for citizenship, and in the meantime you will have to pay for education and healthcare for the child that Emirati citizens get for free. If you marry an Emirati citizen, you will not become eligible for Emirati citizenship until you have been married for 3 years from the date you expressed your intent to become a national. Keep in mind this rule only applies to women who marry men who are Emirati citizens. A man who marries an Emirati woman will not be eligible for citizenship by virtue of the marriage. The UAE does not recognize dual citizenship. If you want to become an Emirati citizen through marriage, you must be willing to revoke any citizenship you currently have. Contact the embassy or consulate of your country of origin to find out what you need to do to officially revoke your citizenship. To apply for citizenship, your husband must complete a form and supply documents to the GDRFA that prove your identity and indicate your desire to become a citizen of the UAE. You will have to pay a fee for the request to be processed. You must be present with your husband when he submits the form and documents.","output":"In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), women do not enjoy equal citizenship rights as men. Female Emirati citizens who marry non-Emirati men do not automatically pass on their citizenship to their husbands or children, making them ineligible for the benefits that Emirati citizens enjoy. Women's citizenship is considered dependent on their husbands or fathers, regardless of their employment status or independent living situation. As a consequence, male spouses of Emirati women are unable to apply for UAE citizenship through marriage, irrespective of the duration of their union. On the other hand, non-Emirati women who marry Emirati men can apply for UAE citizenship after being married for at least three years. Spouses of Emirati citizens, regardless of gender, are allowed to reside in UAE, but do not have the rights and benefits of citizenship. In order to apply for UAE citizenship through marriage, individuals must be willing to revoke their current citizenship as the country does not recognize dual citizenship. When seeking to apply for UAE citizenship via marriage, couples must visit the General Directorate of Residence and Foreign Affairs (GDRFA) with their marriage certificate and identification documents. They must complete the required forms and pay a processing fee. Husbands of non-Emirati women must submit additional documents to prove their spouse's identity and intent to become a UAE citizen. Furthermore, children born to male non-Emirati spouses and Emirati women are regarded as non-Emirati, and parents must bear the costs of education and healthcare services until the child turns 18 and becomes eligible to apply for Emirati citizenship. Overall, the citizenship rights of women in the UAE are limited and unequal compared to those of their male counterparts, presenting challenges and hindrances to both Emirati women and their non-Emirati spouses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Simpsons supremo Matt Groening with his creations at the film's premiere in Springfield, Vermont Matt Groening told the Screening Room that fans had driven the demand for the movie. \\"We've had fans clamoring for a movie for the past 18 years,\\" he said. The film has taken four years to come to fruition, as writer Al Jean explained. \\"What really held us up for a long time was to have enough people to do the show and the movie,\\" he said. \\"We talked for a while about doing the movie after the show is done, but the show is never done! So it really started in earnest in 2003, when we started working on this story that became the movie.\\" Technology has also played its part. Jean continued, \\"The technology to do this film really wasn't even around five years ago. For example, there was this joke I once pitched and David Silverman, the director, started drawing and as I was pitching it, it went into the film and it was cut a day later.

Groening told the Screening Room, \\"This movie is designed to both honor the people who have loved the show all this time, so there's lots of little details for them in the movie, little characters and stuff who they know and love, but we also want people who don't know the family to not be completely confused.

Q:I have a new situation: There are two dairy farms in the town of Milkton and both are about the same size. Farm A produces only organic milk. Farm B does not but they are considering switching production to organic milk.  But I can use this background: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).  What is an answer for this question: Which farm uses more pesticides, dairy farm A or B? A:","output":"Dairy farm B uses more pesticides because it follows conventional milk production methods. Dairy farm A produces only organic milk, which involves reducing or eliminating the use of pesticides."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It may not always be easy to know that you are interacting with someone that has bad intentions. One way to keep yourself safe is to keep a look out for common signs that the person you are interacting with is an online predator. Available choices:  -- If your suspicions or behavior are displayed via various social media posts, suspicious questions and behavior, it may indicate a predator that is trying to scam you. See what your customers look for during business hours or clearly have questions about places they aren't in regular telephone conversations.;  -- Pay attention to situations that do not make sense. For example, if one of your friends tries to scam you with phone numbers, this could happen over time.;  -- Signs like bothering you or avoiding your friends or being secretive might include awkward calls or texts and/or missing your friend frequently. Suspicious behavior can be a sign that you may be in serious trouble.;  -- If someone you interact with online demonstrates behavior that is in keeping with that of a predator, consider cutting off communication with them. If someone repeatedly asks you to skype with them or communicate via webcam, they may be an online predator.;","output":"All right, imagine you're playing with your toys and talking to a new friend online, but sometimes they say or do things that make you feel a little uncomfortable, like asking too many questions or trying to know things that you shouldn't share with someone you barely know. That's kind of like what an online predator does. They might want to trick you or do something not nice. So, what's the next thing you should do? If you notice any signs that the person you're talking to online might not be a good person, it's best to stop talking to them. Just like how you don't talk to a stranger offering you candy on the streets, you shouldn't talk to strangers online who make you feel uncomfortable. Always remember to tell a grown-up, like your parents or a teacher, about anything that worries you online. They will help you stay safe and happy while playing and talking to your real friends."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In the year 1978, Gracie Bowen, a 15-year-old tomboy who lives in South Orange, New Jersey, is crazy about soccer, as are her three brothers and their former soccer star father. Although Gracie wants to join her brothers and neighbor Kyle in the nightly practices her father runs, she is discouraged by everyone except her older brother, Johnny. Johnny, Gracie and Kyle attend Columbia High School, where Johnny is the captain and star player for the varsity soccer team. After missing a shot at the end of a game, the despondent Johnny drives off with a friend's car and dies in a traffic accident. Struggling with grief, Gracie decides that she wants to replace her brother on the team. Her father does not believe that girls should play soccer, telling her she is neither tough nor talented enough. Her mother is a nurse who lacks the competitive drive of the rest of her family and fears for Gracie's safety. Her mother later tells Gracie that she would have liked to become a surgeon, but that option had not been available to her as a woman. Rejected and depressed, Gracie begins to rebel; she stops doing her schoolwork, is caught cheating on an exam, and experiments with wild and self-destructive behavior. She is finally caught by her father almost having sex with a guy she met near the docks after telling her friend, \\"I want to do something that I've never done before.\\" This serves as a wake-up call for her parents, particularly her father.

Please answer a question about the following article about Aspirated consonant: In the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), aspirated consonants are written using the symbols for voiceless consonants followed by the aspiration modifier letter ⟨◌ʰ⟩, a superscript form of the symbol for the voiceless glottal fricative ⟨h⟩. For instance, ⟨p⟩ represents the voiceless bilabial stop, and ⟨pʰ⟩ represents the aspirated bilabial stop. Written IPA consonants use symbols for what?","output":"In the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), written IPA consonants use symbols to represent specific speech sounds and phonetic characteristics of spoken languages. The symbols are designed to provide a standardized, unambiguous, and universal notation for the precise representation of various sounds produced in human speech.  As stated in the article, aspirated consonants are written using the symbols for voiceless consonants followed by the aspiration modifier letter ⟨◌ʰ⟩. This modifier is a superscript form of the symbol for the voiceless glottal fricative ⟨h⟩.  To better understand the role of symbols in the IPA, let's consider the example from the article: the voiceless bilabial stop ⟨p⟩ and aspirated bilabial stop ⟨pʰ⟩. In this case, the symbol ⟨p⟩ is used to denote a specific speech sound made by completely blocking the airflow at the lips (bilabial) and then releasing this blockage without vocal fold vibrations (voiceless stop). When the aspiration modifier ⟨ʰ⟩ is added to the symbol ⟨p⟩ to form ⟨pʰ⟩, it indicates an aspirated bilabial stop, which involves the same blocking and release of airflow, but with an additional burst of air (aspiration) upon the release of the stop.  In summary, written IPA consonants use symbols to notate several aspects of speech sounds, such as the manner of articulation (e.g., stops, fricatives, and nasals), places of articulation (e.g., bilabial, alveolar, and velar), and phonetic features like voicing and aspiration. The symbols aim to facilitate accurate transcription and communication of speech sounds across languages, allowing linguists, speech therapists, and foreign language learners to better understand and analyze the phonetic structure and pronunciation of different languages."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - riots - vote - change yourself - social activism - change clothes  I believe the correct choice is \\"change yourself\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"I agree with your choice of \\"change yourself\\" as the correct answer for how to initiate change in society from within. Here's a step-by-step justification for this choice: 1. Self-awareness: Before attempting to change society, it's crucial to assess oneself and identify personal values, beliefs, strengths, and weaknesses. By being aware of one's own attitudes and behaviors, it becomes possible to recognize areas that may need improvement or change. 2. Personal development: Change starts with personal growth and self-improvement. Developing oneself will enable the individual to be a role model for others, ultimately encouraging a ripple effect of positive change in society. 3. Education: To contribute to societal change, one must be well-informed about the issues that need addressing. This includes being aware of existing social problems, understanding their complexities, and researching potential solutions. 4. Engaging in dialogue: Effective communication is essential for change to occur. Engaging in open and constructive dialogues with others helps to share ideas, challenge assumptions, and build empathy. This fosters the development of a collective understanding and desire to change. 5. Advocacy and allyship: By being an advocate for change and supporting marginalized communities, one can spark broader societal transformation. Allyship consists in using personal privileges to empower others, amplify their voices, and support social justice causes. When considered collectively, these steps demonstrate that changing oneself is a crucial component of initiating change from within. By focusing on personal growth and development, an individual can inspire change and serve as a catalyst for societal transformation, in contrast to more disruptive or superficial options like riots or changing clothes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In an overstuffed landscape of cinematic prowess, this film never manages to rise above its sea of mediocrity. The plot follows a group of seemingly unrelated individuals whose lives intersect in the most banal, predictable ways, culminating into a poorly executed twist ending. The formulaic nature of the storyline becomes increasingly frustrating as the audience is force-fed a barrage of clichéd situations devoid of any substance or innovation. It seems that the screenplay was lifted from an outdated playbook, rather than penned with any genuine thought or attention to detail. The characters in Dreamless Nights are as static and lifeless as the title suggests. Their motivations, dialogue, and emotions seem borrowed from other, better films, leaving the viewer yearning for something authentic and engaging. The acting, unfortunately, is lackluster and uninspiring, with most of the cast delivering their lines as if sleepwalking through their respective roles. This insipid mediocrity ripples throughout the film, robbing it of any chance of capturing the audience's empathy or interest. The film's cinematography operates on a similarly inadequate plane. Sporting an array of drab and uninspired visuals, Dreamless Nights is consistently monotonous, save for the sporadic and jarring jump-cuts. The color palette of the movie adds to its overall dreariness, often evoking a sense of gloom and despair instead of heightening the dramatic tension. Perhaps the cardinal sin of Dreamless Nights is its score – or rather, the lack thereof. The music is sporadic and inconsequential, with only the feeblest of contributions to setting the mood. More often than not, it seems as if the score has fallen into slumber, shattering the already fragile atmosphere. The potential for a captivating, immersive soundscape lies dormant, further cementing the film's failure to engage its audience. In conclusion, Dreamless Nights is a resounding disappointment – a tiresome, unimaginative slog through a minefield of clichés and contrivances. It stands as an example of wasted potential, both in terms of storytelling and visual innovation. It leaves the viewer with the unmistakable impression that the filmmaker entrusted the creative process to autopilot, resulting in a hollow and forgettable debacle. After sitting through its numbing 90 minutes, one thing becomes clear: \\"Dreamless\\" is not only reflected in the title, but it painfully resonates within the very essence of this unfortunate film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When we're hungry, we eat at home instead of going out. We take buses instead of taxis. And we wear our old designer jeans just a few months longer. With college expenses at all-time highs, high school students are eager to do anything to cut the cost of a university education. One cost-cutting proposal is to allow college students to get a bachelor's degree in three years instead of four. Educational institutions have been actively exploring ways to make the learning process more efficient. But there's a question: Would the quality of undergraduate education suffer? Few US universities have formally approved a \\"three-year degree\\" model. I doubt that mainstream North American colleges will carry out a three-year curriculum   any time soon. For one thing, most universities already allow highly qualified students to graduate early by testing out of certain classes and obtaining a number of college credits. In addition, at famous universities, the committee who determine which courses are required and which courses are electives are unlikely to suddenly \\"throw out\\" one quarter of the required credits. Professors will resist \\"diluting  \\" the quality of the education they offer. In my opinion, a quality four-year education is always superior to a quality three-year education. A college education requires sufficient time for a student to become skilled in their major and do coursework in fields outside their major. It is not a good idea to water down education, any more than it's not a good idea to water down medicine.

State police cited the driver, Adolpho Guerra, 55, of Miami, Florida, with having an unsafe load. Guerra suffered 50-100 bee stings and was treated at Christiana Hospital for what Sgt. Paul Shavack called minor injuries. Two passengers also were taken to the hospital for treatment of bee stings.      The flatbed tractor-trailer was hauling 460 hives of honeybees from Florida to Maine when the load shifted about 6:10 p.m. on the Del. 896 on-ramp to northbound I-95, overturning onto the guard rail, Shavack said.      DelDOT reported the right lane of northbound I-95 also was closed in the area overnight, but it was reported reopened at 5:45 a.m. Wednesday.      By 7:30 a.m., only a few bees were observed in the area as passing motorists slowed to check out the site.      ALERT: DelDOT warns of bee swarms along I-95      TRAFFIC: Truck gets stuck under I-95 ramp at mall      Tuesday night, troopers had warned motorists of the closed ramp, as well as \\"transient bee swarms in the area.\\"      CLOSE A tractor-trailer was hauling 460 hives of honeybees — an estimated 16 million to 20 million bees — from Florida to Maine when it overturned on the Del. 896 on-ramp to northbound I-95. (5/20/14)      The two passengers, men ages 24 from Miami and 25 from Hialeah, Florida, were taken by ambulance to Christiana Hospital, Shavack said. He said both passengers suffered 50-100 stings but he had no update on their treatment Wednesday morning.      Nearly an hour after the truck failed to negotiate the on-ramp curve, Shavack said bee swarms were so massive, \\"we can't even get close to the truck right now.\\"      The odd cargo spill prompted state police to call in experts.      \\"We contacted beekeepers to assist,\\" Shavack said, adding that three were advising on the scene.      Instead of trying to round up the bees, he said, they suggested dispersing swarms with water.      So firefighters from the Aetna Hose Hook & Ladder Company of Newark, coordinating with state troopers, began \\"hosing down the bees,\\" Shavack said.      Within about an hour, hosing made \\"some progress,\\" but thick swarms continued to buzz around the wreck, he said.      Police had to get rid of the bees before they could remove the tractor-trailer safely, he said.      As the hose-down went on, Shavack noted that the response to the bee release was not impromptu.      \\"The [emergency] communication center in New Castle County contacted headquarters communication center, and headquarters communication followed the plan that was in place before this occurred,\\" he said.      The \\"bee swarm removal procedure\\" included a list of experts to contact, he added.      \\"We got ahold of one of those bee providers, and he came right out,\\" he said. \\"He called for additional resources, so that's why there are three on-scene.\\"      As far as the communication center staff members know, Shavack said, \\"this is the first time we've actually activated the plan.\\"      But they didn't know how long the plan has been in place.      The bee-hosing continued through dusk. The bee experts advised police that \\"when it's dark, the bees won't fly, the bees will crawl,\\" Shavack said.      With nightfall, he said, the bee handlers could begin examining the crated hives to see if any could be salvaged before the truck was righted and hauled away.      And the fate of the bees?      Their long haul is over.      The salvaging keepers – not identified by police – get to keep them.      \\"They were authorized to do that by the trucking company,\\" Shavack said.      No estimate was available of the full bee cargo's value or the count and value of those being salvaged.      Reporter Damian Giletto contributed to this story.

CLOSE A truck hauling 460 hives of honeybees from Florida to Maine overturned onto its side about 6:10 p.m. Tuesday on the Del. 896 on-ramp to northbound I-95 at the outskirts of Newark, Delaware. (5/20/14)      Read or Share this story: http://delonline.us/1nlNox6 ||||| How do you deal with up to 20,000,000 angry bees swarming a highway? That suddenly became top priority for the Delaware State Police, when a tractor-trailer hauling 460 crated hives overturned near Newark, Del., yesterday evening.      Luckily, 14 years ago, someone had the unusual—if convenient—foresight to develop an “official honeybee swarm removal plan.” This is the first time they’ve had to use it, says police spokesman Sgt. Paul Shavack.      Basically, the procedure involves calling a list of experts. Shavack told cbc.ca:      Three on-call bee handlers were sent to the scene and [were] working with firefighters to spray water on the insects, the crates and the truck. \\"There's no rounding them up,\\" Shavack said of the bees. \\"The water will disperse and calm the bee activity.\\"      But once darkness fell, the bee-hosing wound down. The bee experts advised police that \\"when it's dark, the bees won't fly, the bees will crawl.\\"      Since bees are cold-blooded and their body temperature varies with external conditions, bees need to be warm for their flight muscles to work. (They are generally loath to fly in the rain, too, but whether they are avoiding the impact of rain drops or the potential chill has yet to be confirmed.)      Twelve hours after the accident, the highway ramp was reopened. The driver and two passengers each suffered about 50 to 100 stings and were taken to hospital. The driver was later cited for unsafe shifting of a load in relation to a crash. They're lucky their cargo didn't include the vicious africanized bees, who recently showed up in Colorado, much to scientists' surprise.      If you ever have the misfortune of getting caught in a swarm of disoriented and thirsty bees, here's a how-to for escaping. |||||","output":"A tractor-trailer transporting approximately 16 million to 20 million honey bees from Florida to Maine overturned on I-95 near Newark on Tuesday, releasing the bees and causing major swarms in the area. The driver, Adolpho Guerra, was cited with having an unsafe load and suffered 50-100 bee stings. Two passengers were also taken to the hospital for treatment of bee stings. Carrying 460 hives of honeybees, the load shifted and overturned on the Del. 896 on-ramp to northbound I-95. The ramp was closed for over 12 hours as police and emergency personnel worked to disperse the swarms of bees and make the area safe for drivers. The unusual situation prompted state police to call in help from beekeepers. Three experts were called to the scene to advise on how to handle the massive swarms of bees. Their recommendation was to disperse the swarms with water, leading firefighters to hose down the bees alongside state troopers. As night approached, the bee handlers informed police that bees are less likely to fly at night, preferring to crawl. This allowed the experts to begin examining the crated hives to see if any could be salvaged before the truck was righted and removed from the scene. The trucking company authorized the keepers who helped with the salvage to keep any bees that were collected. Delaware State Police had an official honeybee swarm removal plan in place for 14 years, which involved calling a list of experts to assist in situations like this. This accident was the first time the plan had to be activated. The driver and passengers were lucky that the bees involved were not Africanized bees, which are known to be more aggressive and dangerous."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","output":"The record for the most assists in a single NBA game is held by the legendary point guard, Scott Skiles. On December 30, 1990, Scott Skiles, playing for the Orlando Magic, dished out an incredible 30 assists in a game against the Denver Nuggets. This outstanding performance set a new NBA record, surpassing the previous record of 29 assists held by Kevin Porter since 1978. Scott Skiles was known for his extraordinary passing and playmaking abilities throughout his career, which spanned over a decade from 1986 to 1996. Despite his relatively modest stature at 6'1\\", Skiles was a strong and tenacious competitor, with a knack for finding his teammates in optimal scoring positions. His relentless work ethic and basketball IQ enabled him to excel as a floor general and leave an indelible mark in the NBA record books. The game in which Skiles set the record was a high-scoring affair, with the Orlando Magic emerging victorious with a 155-116 win over the Denver Nuggets. In addition to Skiles' mesmerizing assist performance, the game also featured impressive scoring displays from several of his teammates, including Terry Catledge, who scored a career-high 49 points. However, even for a player as skilled as Skiles, achieving 30 assists in a single game was no small feat and required a combination of exceptional factors to come together. The fast-paced and explosive nature of the contest, as well as the exceptional shooting performances from his teammates, played a crucial role in Skiles being able to create and capitalize on numerous scoring opportunities throughout the game. Despite several outstanding playmakers and passers entering the NBA since Skiles' time, his record of 30 assists in a game has stood the test of time and remains unbroken more than three decades later. Some notable players who came close to breaking the record are John Stockton and Rajon Rondo, both of whom logged 28-assist performances during their careers. Nevertheless, Scott Skiles' singular accomplishment in that memorable game against the Denver Nuggets in 1990 continues to stand as an enduring testament to his exceptional talent and playmaking prowess."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: SANAA The Air Force flew some U.S. diplomatic personnel out of Yemen on Tuesday and Washington told nationals to leave the country immediately after warnings of potential attacks that pushed the United States to shut missions across the Middle East.      Yemen, one of the poorest Arab countries, is the base for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), one of the most active branches of the network founded by Osama bin Laden, and militants have launched attacks from there against the West.      U.S. sources have told Reuters that intercepted communication between bin Laden's successor as al Qaeda leader, Ayman al-Zawahri, and the Yemen-based wing was one part of the intelligence behind their alert last week.      Britain, which has already advised for more than two years that its citizens in Yemen should \\"leave now\\", announced it was temporarily evacuating all its embassy staff.      Yemen is one of a handful of countries where Washington acknowledges targeting militants with strikes by drone aircraft.      In the latest strike on Tuesday, a U.S. drone fired five missiles at a car travelling in the central Maarib province killing all four of its occupants, local tribal leaders said. Yemen's state news agency Saba said four al Qaeda militants were killed in the attack.      The U.S. State Department's announcement urging Americans to leave the country follows a worldwide travel alert on Friday which prompted Washington to shut diplomatic missions across the Middle East and Africa. Some of its European allies have also closed their embassies in Yemen.      \\"The Department urges U.S. citizens to defer travel to Yemen and those U.S. citizens currently living in Yemen to depart immediately,\\" the statement posted on its website said.      \\"On August 6, 2013, the Department of State ordered the departure of non-emergency U.S. government personnel from Yemen due to the continued potential for terrorist attacks,\\" it added.      Previous U.S. travel warnings to Yemen had also advised citizens not travel to the country, but the language of the latest announcement appeared to reflect a more imminent threat.      State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said U.S. relations with Yemen remained strong despite the measures taken.      \\"So this was, again, just to reiterate, a response to an immediate specific threat, but we continue to work with them on a number of issues,\\" Psaki told journalists at a news briefing in Washington.      Britain also said on Tuesday it had withdrawn all staff from its embassy in the capital Sanaa, adding there was \\"a very high threat of kidnap from armed tribes, criminals and terrorists\\".      The Netherlands advised its citizens to leave Yemen as a matter of urgency, local news agency ANP reported.      France said it had not changed its previous advisory asking citizens to \\"be very cautious and to move around as little as possible,\\" Helene Conway-Mouret, junior Minister for French nationals abroad, told BFM TV.      EVACUATION      Restoring stability to Yemen - a country close to major shipping lanes and torn by regional and sectarian separatism and tribal violence as well as the al Qaeda insurgency - has been a priority for the United States.      In a statement issued in Washington, Pentagon spokesman George Little said the U.S. Air Force \\"transported personnel out of Sanaa, Yemen, as part of a reduction in emergency personnel\\" in response to a request by the State Department.      He did not specify which types of personnel were involved or where they were taken.      \\"The U.S. Department of Defense continues to have personnel on the ground in Yemen to support the U.S. State Department and monitor the security situation,\\" the statement said.      Yemeni Foreign Minister Abu-Bakr al-Qirbi criticized the measures but said they would not affect relations with the United States.      \\"Unfortunately, these measures, although they are taken to protect their citizens, in reality they serve the goals that the terrorist elements are seeking to achieve,\\" Qirbi told Reuters.      \\"Yemen had taken these threats seriously and had taken all the necessary measures to protect all the foreign missions in the country,\\" he added.      The country's Supreme Security Committee issued a statement saying it had information al Qaeda was plotting attacks during Eid al-Fitr, this week's Muslim holiday that marks the end of the Ramadan fasting month.      The committee also published a list of 25 senior al Qaeda militants it said were being sought by security forces and offered a bounty of 5 million Yemeni riyals (23,000) for information leading to their capture.      \\"Information has become available that terrorist elements of the al Qaeda network were planning to carry out terrorist acts targeting public installations and facilities, especially in a number of Yemeni provinces, in the latter days of the holy month of Ramadan and during the Eid al-Fitr holiday,\\" it said.      STABILITY      Long-serving leader Ali Abdullah Saleh stepped down following months of protests against his rule in 2011, part of Arab uprisings that toppled three other heads of state. His replacement, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, met U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington last week.      Yemen is home to 56 of the 86 detainees still being held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and security in Yemen is a key element of any deal to send them back so that Obama can fulfill a pledge to close the U.S. prison camp.      Washington's warnings last week concerned possible attacks in the region, based on intelligence including intercepted communication between al Qaeda leaders. Some officials pinpointed Yemen as the main concern.      No figures on the number of Americans in Yemen were immediately available. Washington had consistently cautioned citizens against travelling to Yemen since the protests in early 2011 that eventually forced Saleh to step down.      Al Qaeda's Yemen-based branch AQAP has been behind plots against Western targets and neighboring Saudi Arabia. It claimed responsibility for a failed attempt by a Nigerian man to blow up a Detroit-bound trans-Atlantic airliner with explosives hidden in his underwear on Christmas Day, 2009.      The United States has acknowledged killing Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen and al Qaeda preacher, in a drone strike in Yemen in September 2011. The Obama administration's policy allowing the killing of a U.S. citizen has been controversial.      (Additional reporting by Phil Stewart, Tabassum Zakaria, Susan Cornwell, Paul Eckert and Lesley Wroughton in Washington, Ingrid Melander in Paris, Thomas Escritt in Amsterdam; Writing by Sami Aboudi; Editing by Peter Graff and Mike Collett-White) ||||| The White House has warned the terror alert which forced US embassy closures across the Middle East and Africa could continue for another four weeks as it revealed its intelligence indicated an ongoing threat \\"from now until the end of August\\".      It was widely reported on Monday that the closures follow an intercepted communication between al-Qaida leader Ayman Zawahiri and the chief of the terrorist organization's Yemeni affiliate.      Supporters of the NSA's surveillance tactics have used the latest threat to justify their opposition to reining in the agency's domestic spying activities. But the information related to the latest threat was collected overseas under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act – not the bulk surveillance programs disclosed by the Guardian and the Washington Post thanks to whistleblower Edward Snowden.      White House spokesman Jay Carney distanced himself from those linking the scare to recent debates about the agency's surveillance power in the US.      The White House and State Department also both sought to downplay the impact of the shutdown on the effectiveness of US diplomacy in the region, stressing the embassy closures should not be seen as indefinite.      \\"This is a temporary measure and it is out of an abundance of caution,\\" said Carney. \\"We are engaged around the world and that engagement creates some risk. This decision is designed to reduce that risk but our engagement will continue.\\"      In contrast to NSA supporters who have been quick to link the surveillance debate with the current scare, the White House sought to downplay any political implications.      \\"I am not going to blend those two stories together,\\" added Carney. \\"We have a threat that we have advised the public about and we have a set of issues regarding the unauthorised disclosure of classified information that has led to a debate about the balance between protecting our security and maintaining privacy – I wouldn't blend the two issues.\\"      The White House did however re-iterate its threat to boycott a planned bilateral summit with President Putin in Moscow in retaliation for its decision to grant temporary asylum to NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.      Asked if there was any relationship between the embassy alerts and the recent NSA controversies, Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said \\"I can assure that in no way, at all, period, affects\\" the State Department's threat assessment.      While the administration did not make the link, others did. On Sunday, Rebublican senator Saxby Chambliss said the NSA had identified threats that were the most serious for years and akin to levels of \\"terrorist chatter\\" picked up before 9/11. \\"These [NSA] programs are controversial, we understand that,\\" he told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday. \\"But they are also very important … If we did not have these programs, then we simply would not be able to listen in on the bad guys.\\"      Critics of the NSA surveillance programs were measured in their responses. Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democract who has been a longstanding voice against the bulk collection of phone records, said the latest threat was \\"serious\\".      As a member of the Senate intelligence committee, Wyden receives classified briefings, but he added: \\"While I can't go into specific details, the vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee noted yesterday that this information was collected using section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, rather than the Patriot Act. I still haven't seen any evidence that the NSA's dragnet surveillance of Americans' phone records is providing any unique value to American counterterrorism efforts.\\"      Privacy campaigners criticised the linking of the latest terror alerts with the debate over the domestic powers of the NSA. Amie Stepanovich, a lawyer with the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said: \\"The NSA's choice to publish these threats at this time perpetuates a culture of fear and unquestioning deference to surveillance in the United States.\\"      News of the fresh terror alert came as Congress looked increasingly likely to pursue fresh attempts to limit the NSA's domestic powers when it returns in September.      \\"The NSA takes in threat information every day. You have to ask, why now? What makes this information different?\\" added Stepanovich.      \\"Too much of what we hear from the government about surveillance is either speculation or sweeping assertions that lack corroboration. The question isn't if these programs used by this NSA can find legitimate threats, it's if the same threats couldn't be discovered in a less invasive manner. This situation fails to justify the NSA's unchecked access to our personal information.\\"      US embassies have been closed temporarily in response to similar perceived terrorist threats, but rarely for this long. Four embassies were closed for the first anniversary of 9/11 in 2002; six African embassies were closed for 3 days in June of 1999; and 38 embassies shut for 2 days in December 1998.      \\"I don't want anyone to think we're leaning toward indefinite closure,\\" Harf said, emphasizing that many of the embassies would largely have been closed or on relaxed hours due to the Eid holiday.      Harf said the threat \\"looks credible\\" in response to a question about whether it might have been a decoy once revelations of NSA surveillance became public.      \\"We continue to refine our assessment of the threat,\\" Harf said. ||||| A suspected U.S. drone killed four alleged al-Qaida members in Yemen on Tuesday, as the U.S. and British embassies evacuated staff amid reports of a threatened attack by al-Qaida that has triggered temporary shutdowns of 19 American diplomatic posts across the Muslim world.      Yemeni officials have suggested al-Qaida threats to multiple potential targets in the Arabian Peninsula country in recent days, including foreign installations and government offices in the capital Sanaa as well as to the strategic Bab al-Mandeb straits at the entrance to the Red Sea to the south.      It is not clear if these reports are the same as the intelligence that led to the embassy shutdowns, reportedly instigated by an intercepted message between al-Qaida chief Ayman al-Zawahri and his deputy in Yemen about plans for a major terror attack.      The State Department on Tuesday ordered non-essential personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Yemen to leave the country. The department said in a travel warning that it had ordered the departure of non-emergency U.S. government personnel from Yemen \\"due to the continued potential for terrorist attacks\\" and said U.S. citizens in Yemen should leave immediately because of an \\"extremely high\\" security threat level.      Britain's Foreign Office also said it has evacuated all staff from its embassy in Yemen due to increased security concerns. The Foreign Office said the British Embassy staff were \\"temporarily withdrawn to the U.K.\\" on Tuesday. It declined to comment further.      Meanwhile, there has been a spike in apparent U.S. drone strikes against al-Qaida leaders. The attack Tuesday was the fourth in two weeks.      Yemen officials say the drone fired a missile at a car carrying four men in the al-Arqeen district of Marib province, setting it on fire and killing all of them. They believed that one of the dead is Saleh Jouti, a senior al-Qaida member.      To the west, in the capital Sanaa, residents awoke to the sound of an aircraft buzzing overhead. Officials said it was an American, and photos posted on Instagram appeared to show a P-3 Orion, a manned aircraft used for surveillance. All officials spoke anonymously as they were not authorized to brief the media.      The rare overflight of the capital came shortly before the announcements of the evacuations.      Yemeni authorities released the names of 25 wanted al-Qaida suspects on Monday, saying they were planning terrorist attacks in the capital, Sanaa, and other cities across the country.      A statement from Yemen's Interior Ministry said the suspects were going to target foreign offices and organizations, as well as Yemeni government installations in the impoverished Arab country. It said security was beefed up around embassies, ports, airports, oil installations and power stations.      Officials say potential U.S. targets in Sanaa could include the embassy and other buildings used by the United States to house personnel, as well as a military camp a few kilometers (miles) outside used by U.S. aircraft.      The Yemeni statement said security forces will pay 23,000 to anyone who comes forward with information that leads to the arrests of any of the wanted men. They included allegedly senior figures in al-Qaida's Yemen branch, including Saudi nationals Ibrahim Mohammed el-Rubaish and Ibrahim Hassan el-Assiri.      El-Rubaish was released from Guantanamo in 2006 and is believed to have played significant roles in al-Qaida's expanding offshoot in Yemen. He is a theological adviser to the group and his writings and sermons are prominent in the group's literature.      Military officials meanwhile said the threat may be related to the Bab al-Mandeb, pointing to a visit by Defense Minister Gen. Mohammed Nasser Ahmed on Sunday to Yemeni military forces positioned at the Red Sea entrance some 276 kilometers (171.5 miles) south of Sanaa.      Officials said that the visit came after intelligence that al-Qaida could be targeting foreign or Yemeni interests at the vital Red Sea corridor, which is a main thoroughfare for international shipping but also a crossing point of for smuggled weapons and illegal immigrants between east Africa and Yemen.      Ahmed urged the forces to stay \\"on alert against any sabotage operations aiming at destabilizing the country,\\" according to officials. They also spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.      Washington considers the al-Qaida branch in Yemen to be among the terror network's most dangerous branches. The United States has also assisted Yemen's military in fighting the militants who, at one point during the country's recent political turmoil, had overrun large sections of land in the south. The group has also carried out bold assassination attacks on Yemeni security forces, killing hundreds over the past two years. ||||| Summary:","output":"The United States flew diplomatic personnel out of Yemen and advised its nationals to leave the country immediately after warnings of potential attacks. Yemen is the base for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), one of the most active branches of the network founded by Osama bin Laden, and militants have launched attacks from there against the West. The latest strike involved a US drone firing five missiles at a car in Maarib province, killing all four occupants who were reported to be Al Qaeda militants. The US State Department's announcement urging Americans to leave the country follows a worldwide travel alert which prompted Washington to shut diplomatic missions across the Middle East and Africa.

Hasan al-Askari was born during a period when his father Ali al-Hadi, the tenth Imam, was suspected of being involved in a conspiracy against the Caliph Al-Mutawakkil. There is doubt as to whether al-Askari was born in Medina or Samarra. According to authentic shia hadith he was born in Medina on the 8th of Rabiul Akhar 232 Hijri (4 December 846 AD) and died in Samarrah Iraq on the 8th of Rabiul Awwal 260 Hijri (4 January 874) aged 28. The period of his imamate was 6 years. He was taken along with his family to Samarra in the year 230, 231 or 232 A.H., and was kept there under house arrest. In Samarra, al-Askari spent most of his time reading the Quran and the Sharia. According to Donaldson, al-Askari must also have studied languages, for in later years it was known that he could speak Hindi with the pilgrims from India, Turkish with the Turks, and Persian with the Persians. According to Shia accounts, however, it is part of the divine knowledge given to all Imams to be able to speak all human languages.  It is said that even as a child, al-Askari was endowed with divine knowledge. One day a man passed by him, and saw that he was crying. The man told him he would buy a toy that he might play with. \\"No!\\" said al-Askari, \\"We have not been created for play.\\" The man was amazed at this answer and said, \\"Then, what for have we been created?\\" \\"For knowledge and worship.\\" answered the child. The man said \\"Where have you got this from?\\" Al-Askari said, \\"From the saying of God, Did you then think that We had created you in vain.\\" The man was confused, so he said, \\"What has happened to you while you are guiltless, little child?\\" al-Askari said, \\"Be away from me! I have seen my mother set fire to big pieces of firewood, but fire is not lit except with small pieces, and I fear that I shall be from the small pieces of the firewood of the Hell.\\"  Al-Askari's mother, as in the case of the majority of The Twelve Imams, was a slave girl who was honoured after bearing children with the title Umm walad (mother of offspring). Her given name was Hadith, though some say she was called Susan, Ghazala, Salil, or Haribta. Al-Askari had other brothers, and among them was Ja'far who was also known as Ja'far al-Zaki or Jaffar-us-Sani. His other brother was Husayn, and together he and al-Askari were known as \\"as-Sibtayn\\", after their two grandfathers Hasan and Husayn, who were also called as-Sibtayn. Answer this question \\"How devoted was he to his beliefs?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Hasan al-Askari was highly devoted to his beliefs. Evidence of this devotion can be found in the text mentioning that he spent most of his time reading the Quran and the Sharia, and even as a child, he displayed divine knowledge and understanding of the purpose of life. He recognized the importance of knowledge and worship, as opposed to engaging in play. This demonstrates his deep commitment to his religious beliefs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This sudden loss of the cherished pet, who belonged to her late cardiologist husband, has left Vasquez inconsolable, surrounded by memories of happier times. Elaine Vasquez had left her home for a short while, not suspecting that this brief absence would lead to such devastation. Upon her return, she found her house in shambles, as if a tornado had swept through, turning her life upside down. The frantic search for her four-legged family member led her to the closet, where the gruesome sight of the small dog's body left her shattered and tearful. The trail of blood was a morbid breadcrumb trail that the police followed, leading them from the chaotic living room, through the hallways, and ultimately to the heartbreaking scene. The local authorities in the quiet Florida neighborhood have launched a thorough investigation into the break-in and the brutal death of the dachshund. However, no suspects have been identified yet, and the community is left on edge. The impact of this tragedy runs deeper than the incomprehensible violence against an innocent animal. For Elaine Vasquez, this dachshund represented much more than a companion; it was a living reminder of her cardiologist husband, who had passed away not long ago. Their small and endearing pet had brought comfort and joy to the couple during their time together, and its presence had undoubtedly helped Vasquez cope with the crushing loss of her life partner. Friends and family offered their condolences and tried to console the devastated woman, but the magnitude of this loss seems almost insurmountable. Neighbors have come forward, expressing their sympathy and utter disbelief at the events that have unfolded in their previously peaceful community. While it's crucial that the local authorities conduct a thorough investigation and apprehend the perpetrators responsible for this heartless crime, it is also essential that the community comes together to support people like Elaine Vasquez. Pet owners and advocates for animal rights have a role to play in spreading awareness about the importance of our furry friends and the cruelty that is far too often inflicted upon them. Elaine Vasquez's tragic story serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerability of our pets and the irreplaceable bond we share with them. As her neighbors and the rest of the nation mourn the loss of this innocent dachshund, we must take a moment to cherish our own animal companions – and vow to better protect them in the future. In the meantime, the investigation continues, and the hope remains that the family will eventually find closure and justice for the senseless killing of their beloved pet.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Encouragement and praise can come in many forms, and some ways are better for child development than others. Researchers at the University of Chicago who studied mother-child interactions   found that the type of praise children receive affects their attitudes towards challenges later in life. Specifically, praise that focused on their behavior and the choices that kids made helped them deal with difficult experiences better five years later, compared with praise that focused more on the child himself, like \\"You're a good boy.\\" The study, which appears in the journal Child Development, is the first major study of praise and child development done outside of a lab setting. \\"It's exciting to see _ play out in the real world,\\" said Elizabeth Gunderson who led the study. \\"Praising the efforts, actions and work of kids is going to be more beneficial in their long-term persistence and desire to be challenged and work hard in the future.\\" Such \\"process praise\\" includes comments such as \\"You worked really hard\\", which emphasize a child's actions. \\"Person praise\\" includes comments like \\"You're so smart\\", which focus on a child's personal qualities. These distinctions   aren't new in the field of psychology, but exactly how they affect children's development over the years hasn't always been clear. As part of the study, the researchers visited the homes of more than 50 kids between the ages of 1 and 3, and filmed their daily interactions with their parents during 90-minute sessions. Five years later, the researchers followed up with the families, measuring the children's attitudes towards challenges and problem solving. The children who grew up with more process praise were more open to challenges. Though person praise didn't seem to have any negative effect on the children, the study suggests that process praise teaches children that their talents and abilities can be developed and improved, while person praise sends the message that their abilities are fixed and therefore not easily changed. Answer:","output":"Question: According to the study in the journal Child Development, which type of praise has a more beneficial impact on a child's long-term persistence, desire to be challenged, and ability to deal with difficult experiences? A) Person praise, which focuses on a child's personal qualities, such as \\"You're so smart.\\" B) Process praise, which emphasizes a child's actions, such as \\"You worked really hard.\\" C) Praise that directly refers to the child, such as \\"You're a good boy.\\" D) No distinction was found between the types of praise in the study.

In one account, Tweedy recalled: Around this time, I would say something into a microphone onstage, and afterward [Farrar would] pull me aside and say, \\"Don't you ever fucking talk into that microphone again.\\" He would misconstrue me talking into the microphone as more evidence of my out-of-control, rampant ego, more evidence of me feeling like I didn't have to be so fucking afraid anymore. Tweedy felt the new members gave him a new opportunity to contribute to the band, but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedy's new carefree attitude. Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and didn't want to work with Tweedy anymore. Soon after the breakup, Farrar explained his departure: \\"It just seemed like it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren't compatible. It had ceased to be a symbiotic songwriting relationship, probably after the first record.\\"Tweedy was enraged that he heard the news secondhand from Margherita, since Farrar decided not to tell him in person. The following day, the two singers engaged in a verbal confrontation. As a favor to Margherita—who had spent a substantial amount of money to keep the band running—Farrar agreed to a final tour with Uncle Tupelo in North America. Tweedy and Farrar again engaged in a shouting match two weeks into the tour, due to Farrar's refusal to sing harmony on any of Tweedy's songs.

As a teenager, and a top member of his high school's wrestling team, he proves himself physically fit and athletic, as well as an academically exceptional student. When local Marine recruiting NCOs visit his school and give Ron and his fellow seniors an impassioned lecture about the Corps, Ron decides to enlist. He misses his prom, because he is unable to get a date with his love interest, Donna. He confronts her at the prom and has a dance with her on his last night before leaving.The story then jumps to Kovic's second Vietnam tour in 1968. Now a Marine sergeant and on patrol, his unit massacres a village of Vietnamese citizens, believing them to be enemy combatants. During the retreat, Kovic becomes disoriented and accidentally shoots one of the new arrivals to his platoon, a younger Marine private first class, Wilson, who ends up in the line of fire between sides. Despite the frantic efforts of the Navy Corpsman present who try to save him, Wilson dies from his wounds. Overwhelmed by guilt, Kovic appeals to his executive officer (XO), who merely tells him to forget the incident. The meeting has a negative effect on Ron, who is crushed at being brushed off by his XO.The platoon goes out on another hazardous patrol on January 20. During a firefight, Kovic is critically wounded, shot in the ankle and through the chest, smashing his spine. He lays trapped in a field facing sure death, until a fellow Marine rescues him. Paralyzed from the mid-chest down, he spends several months recovering at the Bronx Veterans Administration hospital.

The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C.  Story: Mark decides he want a cold drink and puts a bottle of warm water in his freezer. By doing this he makes the water colder and as water cools its density increases eventually freezing and becoming a solid, Ice. After a while mark forgets that he put the bottle of water in the freezer. He eventually remembers and comes back to check and the bottle of water is frozen solid.

Information:  - The is a period in Japanese history marked by social upheaval, political intrigue and near-constant military conflict. Japanese historians named it after the otherwise unrelated Warring States period in China. It came to an end when all political power was unified under the Tokugawa shogunate.  - The Warring States period was an era in ancient Chinese history following the Spring and Autumn period and concluding with the Qin wars of conquest that saw the annexation of all other contender states, which ultimately led to the Qin state's victory in 221 BC as the first unified Chinese empire known as the Qin dynasty. Although different scholars point toward different dates ranging from 481 BC to 403 BC as the true beginning of the Warring States, Sima Qian's choice of 475 BC is generally the most often cited and popularly accepted one. The Warring States era also overlaps with the second half of the Eastern Zhou dynasty, though the Chinese sovereign, known as the king of Zhou, ruled merely as a figurehead and served as a backdrop against the machinations of the warring states.  - Shinmen Sokan ( active 16th century ) was a Japanese lord , daimyo of the Shinmen clan (  Shinmen - shi ) during the middle of the Sengoku period . Sokan was known as a rather petty daimyo in the mountainous regions of Sakushu , which was west of Kyoto . Even though this was so , the Shinmen clan had very good ties with that of the Hirata family , leading to the Shinmen receiving a good amount of support . One such swordsman of note that served under Sokan was the famous Shinmen Munisai , the father of the legendary swordsman Miyamoto Musashi . In 1589 , Sokan ordered Munisai to kill Honiden Gekinosuke ( a minor student under Munisai ) for unknown reasons . Due to this fact however , Munisai was forced to leave his village of Miyamoto .  - , also known as Shinmen Takez, Miyamoto Bennosuke or, by his Buddhist name, Niten Draku, was an expert Japanese swordsman and rnin. Musashi, as he was often simply known, became renowned through stories of his excellent and unique double-bladed swordsmanship and undefeated record in his 60 duels (next to 33 of It Ittsai). He was the founder of the Hyh Niten Ichi-ry or Niten-ry style of swordsmanship and in his final years authored , a book on strategy, tactics, and philosophy that is still studied today.  - , which can be loosely translated as \\"the school of the strategy of two heavens as one\\", is a kory (ancient school), transmitting a style of classical Japanese swordsmanship conceived by the warrior Miyamoto Musashi. Hyh Niten Ichi-ry is mainly known for the two-swordkatana and wakizashikenjutsu techniques Musashi called \\"Niten Ichi\\" (, \\"two heavens as one\\") or \\"Nit Ichi\\" (, \\"two swords as one\\").  - Originally named It Yagor, he at the age of fourteen found himself in a little seaside village called Izu. Legend tells that he floated across the Sagami Bay on a piece of driftwood from shima Island, part of the Izu Islands. The trust of the local villagers was earned when Yagor chased away a group of bandits that went around raiding and pillaging. As he desired to be a great swordsman, the villagers paid for Yagor's travels in seeking out a master. On his journey, Yagor reached Tsurugaoka Hachimang Shinto shrine in Kamakura where he paid homage to the gods and practiced his swordsmanship. One particular day, an unknown assailant tried to attack Yagor but he somehow unconsciously and without thinking drew his sword and cut him down in one swift stroke. Not understanding this technique, Yagor would later describe it as \\"Musken\\" (), a fundamental aspect of his swordsmanship's philosophy. Musken is either an offensive or defensive technique that is delivered spontaneously and without thinking, fully anticipating an opponent's movement; a type of extra-sensory perception similar to mushin.  - A was a samurai with no lord or master during the feudal period (11851868) of Japan. A samurai became masterless from the death or fall of his master, or after the loss of his master's favor or privilege.  - Tokyo, officially Tokyo Metropolis, is the capital of Japan and one of its 47 prefectures. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. It is the seat of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government. Tokyo is in the Kant region on the southeastern side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Formerly known as Edo, it has been the de facto seat of government since 1603 when Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters. It officially became the capital after Emperor Meiji moved his seat to the city from the old capital of Kyoto in 1868; at that time Edo was renamed Tokyo. Tokyo Metropolis was formed in 1943 from the merger of the former and the .  - The Tokugawa shogunate, also known as the and the , was the last feudal Japanese military government, which existed between 1603 and 1867.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - A calendar is a system of organizing days for social, religious, commercial or administrative purposes. This is done by giving names to periods of time, typically days, weeks, months, and years. A date is the designation of a single, specific day within such a system. A calendar is also a physical record (often paper) of such a system. A calendar can also mean a list of planned events, such as a court calendar or a partly or fully chronological list of documents, such as a calendar of wills.  - Undecimber or Undecember is a name for a thirteenth month in a calendar that normally has twelve months . Duodecember is similarly a fourteenth month .  - A day is a unit of time. In common usage, it is either an interval equal to 24 hours or daytime, the consecutive period of time during which the Sun is above the horizon. The period of time during which the Earth completes one rotation with respect to the Sun is called a \\"solar day\\". Several definitions of this universal human concept are used according to context, need and convenience. In 1960, the second was redefined in terms of the orbital motion of the Earth, and was designated the SI base unit of time. The unit of measurement \\"day\\", redefined in 1960 as 86 400 SI seconds and symbolized \\"d\\", is not an SI unit, but is accepted for use with SI. A civil day is usually 86 400 seconds, plus or minus a possible leap second in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and occasionally plus or minus an hour in those locations that change from or to daylight saving time. The word \\"day\\" may also refer to a day of the week or to a calendar date, as in answer to the question, \\"On which day?\\" The life patterns of humans and many other species are related to Earth's solar day and the day-night cycle (see circadian rhythms).  - A month is a unit of time, used with calendars, which is approximately as long as a natural period related to the motion of the Moon; \\"month\\" and \\"Moon\\" are cognates. The traditional concept arose with the cycle of moon phases; such months (lunations) are synodic months and last approximately 29.53 days. From excavated tally sticks, researchers have deduced that people counted days in relation to the Moon's phases as early as the Paleolithic age. Synodic months, based on the Moon's orbital period with respect to the Earth-Sun line, are still the basis of many calendars today, and are used to divide the year.  - Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in apparently irreversible succession from the past through the present to the future. Time is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, along with the three spatial dimensions.  - A year is the orbital period of the Earth moving in its orbit around the Sun. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons, marked by changes in weather, the hours of daylight, and, consequently, vegetation and soil fertility. In temperate and subpolar regions around the globe, four seasons are generally recognized: \\"spring\\", \\"summer\\", \\"autumn\\" and \\"winter\\". In tropical and subtropical regions several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the seasonal tropics, the annual \\"wet\\" and \\"dry\\" seasons are recognized and tracked.  - A week is a time unit equal to seven days. It is the standard time period used for cycles of work days and rest days in most parts of the world, mostly alongside (but not strictly part of) the Gregorian calendar.    After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'undecimber' with the relationship of 'instance of'.

The animated comedy topped the box office once again this weekend, while \\"Rock of Ages\\" and \\"That's My Boy\\" delivered majorly disappointing debuts. Dreamworks' 145 million effort \\"Madagascar 3\\" roared a second time following its 60.3 million start. The CG-animated film dipped 41 percent to 35.5 million this frame. That's better than the second weekend decline of its predecessor, \\"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa,\\" which fell by 45 percent and had earned a slightly softer 116.9 million at the same point in its run. \\"Madagascar 3\\" has grossed 120.5 million over ten days, and is headed to a 180 million finish domestically. Worldwide, the 3-D film has grossed a robust 278 million, and will likely finish near 600 million. Ridley Scott's \\"Alien\\" prequel \\"Prometheus\\" finished in second place for its second weekend, despite dropping by a hefty 60 percent to 20.2 million. Fox's 130 million sci-fi thriller has earned 88.9 million since invading theaters 10 days ago, and it may struggle to match it production budget domestically. Thankfully, the conversation-spurring flick has found 92.7 million overseas, giving it a worldwide total of 181.6 million. Although many prognosticators expected \\"Rock of Ages\\" to vie for the number one spot this weekend, the hair-metal Broadway adaptation couldn't convince audiences to join the mosh pit. Ages dropped like a rock, earning an abysmal 15.1 million in its debut — far less than comparative Broadway adaptations like \\"Mamma Mia!\\", which began with 27.8 million in 2008 and \\"Hairspray\\" (also directed by \\"Rock of Ages'\\" helmer Adam Shankman), which started with 27.5 million in 2007. Warner Bros. says the film cost 65 million to produce, and there's little chance it can match its production budget domestically after audiences, which skewed heavily female and decisively older, issued the film a mediocre \\"B\\" CinemaScore grade, suggesting that it won't benefit from word-of-mouth. Some are claiming that Rock of Ages' awful debut is a sign that Tom Cruise, who plays rocker Stacee Jaxx, may have lost his Midas touch at the box office. While the A-list star appeared heavily in ads for the film, in all actuality, he only serves as a minor character, and the musical is so far outside his action/drama wheelhouse that it's not a totally apt criticism. If there's a star to blame here (and, to be clear, I'm not sure there is — I'd bet the amateur look and sound of the movie is what kept audiences away), it's lead actress Julianne Hough, whose first three music-and-dance features since leaving \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" have all been relative box office disappointments. \\"Burlesque\\" found just 39.4 million in 2010, and \\"Footloose\\" achieved only 51.8 million last year — not a terrible result given its 24 million budget, but far below expectations. Hough may be Hollywood's go-to starlet for dance-heavy roles, but she's not yet a legitimate box office draw, and her \\"Rock of Ages\\" co-lead, Diego Boneta, certainly is not either. In fourth, Universal's 170 million tentpole \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" dipped just 40 percent (following a 59 percent decline last weekend) to 13.8 million in its third weekend. The Kristen Stewart/Charlize Theron showdown has earned 122.6 million so far (and another 124.6 million internationally) and seems headed for a finish of about 145 million domestically and 325 million worldwide. Whether those grosses are fair enough to justify the \\"Snow White\\" sequel reportedly in the works seems doubtful. Rounding out the top five is Adam Sandler's latest, \\"That's My Boy,\\" which, despite the presence of Saturday Night Live favorite Andy Samberg, earned only 13 million over Father's Day weekend. That's about half of what Sandler's last comedy, the Razzie-festooned \\"Jack and Jill,\\" earned in its debut (25 million), and his smallest opening for a traditional live-action comedy since \\"Happy Gilmore's\\" 8.6 million bow in 1996. \\"That's My Boy\\" received a discouraging \\"B-\\" CinemaScore grade from audiences (which were 54 percent male), with patrons under 18 giving the raunchy title an \\"A-\\" and those 50 and up issuing it a \\"D-.\\" If \\"That's My Boy\\" didn't carry an R-rating, perhaps more enthusiastic youngsters would have turned out over the weekend. The failure of \\"That's My Boy,\\" which cost Sony about 70 million, marks a pivotal moment in Sandler's career. For years, he reigned as the most consistent box office draw in Hollywood. Though his comedies — like \\"Mr. Deeds\\" (which earned 126.3 million), \\"Click\\" (137.4 million), and \\"Grown Ups\\" (162 million) — were usually critical misfires, they almost always opened in the 30-40 million range (or higher), and reaped major profits. It's not just that Sandler was starring in these films, either — he executive produced each of his 12 comedies that has earned over 100 million domestically. As a business-oriented filmmaker, no one could knock Sandler. But something changed with the release of Jack and Jill in late 2011. Critics utterly savaged the cross-dressing comedy, and audiences who had been willing to laugh at the silly antics of Sandler's amateur man-baby characters decided they had had enough. Jack and Jill became the star's first live-action comedy (I'm not including dramedies \\"Funny People,\\" \\"Punch Drunk Love,\\" or \\"Spanglish\\" — none of which Sandler produced) to miss the 100 million mark since 2000′s Little Nicky, and Jack and Jill finished with a weak 74.2 million. \\"That's My Boy\\" will be lucky to earn even half that amount. It seems that Sandler (and his longtime studio partner Sony) may need to rethink their strategy moving forward. His formula worked wonders at the box office for 15 years, but Sandler's shine is wearing off, and many of his formerly faithful paying customers are no longer amused. Elsewhere on the chart, \\"Men in Black 3\\" took in another 10 million and passed the 150 million mark. After four weekends, the 230 million production (though unceasing rumors suggest the budget was much higher) has earned 152.6 million domestically and 544.3 million worldwide. In limited release, Wes Anderson's \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" continued its remarkable run. Following an expansion from 96 to 178 theaters, the indie ticked up 40 percent to 2.2 million, giving it a per theater average of 12,253 — the strongest at the box office. After four weekends, Moonrise has found an impressive 6.8 million, and it's got lots of life left in it. 1. Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted -- 35.5 million. 2. Prometheus -- 20.2 million. 3. Rock of Ages -- 15.1 million. 4. Snow White and the Huntsman -- 13.8 million. 4. That's My Boy -- 13.0 million. See the full story at EW.com.

Despite expectations, \\"Rock of Ages,\\" a hair-metal Broadway adaptation starring Tom Cruise wasn't successful. The film only pulled in 15.1 million in its debut, indicating audiences were not convinced to join the mosh pit despite hefty advertisement effort. The film's mediocre reception raised questions about the box office pull of star Tom Cruise, and lead actress Julianne Hough's track record was critiqued. However, it was also noted that the movie's look and sound likely contributed to the poor debut. \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" held fourth place, dipping to 13.8 million on its third weekend, while Adam Sandler's \\"That's My Boy\\" managed to pull in 13 million over Father's Day weekend. \\"That's My Boy\\" was noted to be a fall from grace for Sandler, as it performed substantially worse than previous Sandler led comedies.  \\"Men in Black 3\\" passed the 150 million mark after four weekends while \\"Moonrise Kingdom,\\" in limited release, continued its remarkable run with a 40% uptake and a per theater average of 12,253.

First he offers her an ice cream made of snow and icicle, which she accepts. Next, he tries catching her a fish, but only succeeds in catching a pufferfish. Polly accepts it graciously, but when she swallows it, she begins inflating and deflating repeatedly until Peter makes her spit out the fish, which then returns to water. Peter shrugs in embarrassment, but, feeling humiliated, Polly slaps him and leaves to swim on a small iceberg. On the shore, Peter kicks himself for letting her get away, but then notices a sharkfin moving towards Polly's iceberg. He squawks a danger warning to her, but Polly ignores him, thinking that he's just begging for forgiveness that he won't get. Soon enough, the shark attacks Polly, who swims away in panic. Needing to act, Peter picks up a stick and charges out to help.  The shark chases Polly around the bay for several minutes. When it looks like he has her cornered, Peter arrives and clobbers him on the nose. Enraged, the shark starts chasing after Peter. After several minutes of fighting and swimming away from the shark, Peter tries to escape by climbing up onto a cliff with a boulder on top. Peter unintentionally dislodges the boulder, which falls into the shark's mouth, who then swallows it. Due to the boulder's weight, the shark sinks to the bottom of the bay. The shark struggles until he's too tired to move. Passing fish begin to poke fun at him. Meanwhile, Polly and Peter reconcile and fall in love, thus Peter's wooing succeeded.

A: The answer is:","output":"Dogs lose body heat through a variety of methods, and these are essential for regulating their body temperature and maintaining it within a safe and comfortable range. Here are the main ways dogs lose body heat and the justifications for each step: 1. Panting (Evaporative Cooling): Panting is one of the most efficient ways dogs lose body heat. When a dog pants, it exhales warm, moist air and takes in cooler, drier air. The evaporation of moisture from its tongue, mouth, and respiratory tract helps to dissipate heat, thus lowering the dog's body temperature. This is important because dogs don't have sweat glands all over their body like humans do, so panting is their primary means of cooling down. 2. Radiative Cooling: Radiative cooling occurs when a dog's body heat is transferred to the surrounding environment through the process of radiation. This happens naturally as the dog's body temperature is higher than that of the surrounding air. The greater the temperature difference, the more heat is lost by radiation. Providing access to cooler environments, such as shaded areas or air-conditioned rooms, can help enhance radiative cooling for dogs. 3. Conductive Cooling: Conductive cooling involves the transfer of heat between two objects in direct contact with each other, such as a dog lying on a cold surface, like a tile floor. By laying on a cooler surface, the dog's body heat transfers to the surface, thereby lowering its body temperature. This method of heat loss is particularly useful for dogs with thick coats, as they may struggle to dissipate heat effectively through panting alone. 4. Convection: Convection helps dogs lose body heat through the process of air (or liquid) moving over their body surface, carrying away heat. This can be natural, such as a breeze blowing over the dog's body, or artificial, like a fan blowing air over the dog. This method helps enhance the already-existing heat loss processes and supports the dog in maintaining a comfortable body temperature. 5. Vasodilation - Some dogs have the ability to dilate the blood vessels near the surface of their skin to help regulate body temperature. Vasodilation allows more blood to flow to the surface of the skin, promoting heat transfer with the cooler air around the dog, thus helping lower the body temperature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Should I validate this answer? Select from the following.  a). No.  b). Yes. Answer:","output":"a). No. The provided answer needs to be updated, as it does not provide accurate and current information on the manufacturer of BlackBerry devices and the company's market standing. A more detailed and updated answer would be: BlackBerry was originally developed and manufactured by the Canadian company Research In Motion (RIM), which was founded in 1984. However, in 2013, RIM rebranded itself as BlackBerry Limited, adopting the name of its most popular product. The BlackBerry smartphones were known for their signature QWERTY keyboard, business-focused approach, and encrypted messaging system. In September 2016, BlackBerry Limited announced that it would no longer manufacture its own smartphones and would instead focus on software development and outsource the production of new devices. This change was a result of BlackBerry's diminished market share due to the increasing competition from other smartphone manufacturers like Apple and Samsung. In December 2016, BlackBerry Limited signed a licensing agreement with TCL Communication, a Chinese multinational electronics company, granting them the rights to design, manufacture, and sell BlackBerry-branded smartphones. This means that the current BlackBerry devices you see on the market are designed and manufactured by TCL Communication. In August 2020, BlackBerry and OnwardMobility, a US-based company, announced together with FIH Mobile Limited, a subsidiary of Foxconn, a new partnership to produce secure 5G BlackBerry devices. As part of the agreement, OnwardMobility will sell and market the BlackBerry devices, while FIH Mobile will handle the design and manufacturing.

In the wake of recent local election triumphs, Venezuela's opposition has gained significant symbolic victories that signal a potentially encouraging shift in the political landscape. These victories engage a new narrative of justice and freedom, deeply rooted in the sentiments of Venezuelan citizens. Among those celebrating these symbolic triumphs is Patricia Gutierrez de Ceballos, who believes the votes represent powerful \\"sentences of justice and freedom.\\" The significance of her statement extends beyond just political assertion. Her husband found himself on the other end of governmental authority when he was arrested for allegedly failing to curtail anti-government protests. Hence, the victory is not just for her, but also depicts a triumph for Venezuelan citizens who champion the cause of democracy and freedom.  Furthermore, the countrywide political mobilization is characterized by peaceful persistence, as confirmed by Rosa Brandonisio de Scarano. \\"The people will remain peacefully in the streets,\\" she states. Brandonisio de Scarano's insight echoes the silent yet profound intensity of Venezuelans determined to voice their hopes, concerns, and demands for an open, democratic society. The positive response and participation from large sections of Venezuelan society reflect the longing for a shift from prolonged political stagnancy. While these local election victories may be symbolic rather than transformative in the immediate sense, they indicate the direction in which Venezuelan citizens aspire to move politically. In summary, the recent local elections have given Venezuela's opposition a sense of emblematic triumph over past challenges. These victories, deemed as \\"sentences of justice and freedom\\" by Patricia Gutierrez de Ceballos, indicate a surge in favor of transparent governance.

There, you and your colleagues wait for a man to arrive from the capital, perhaps a thousand miles away, with a suitcase of cash. Few countries are as corrupt as Congo . Mobutu Sese Seko, a former strongman, used state funds to _ a Concorde to take him on shopping trips to Paris. By the time of his overthrow in 1997, graft was endemic. Government employees were not paid but rather expected to use their positions to make a living. Among the most prized government jobs was that of accountant: the people responsible for transporting bags of cash to the provinces to hand out to employees. In 2012, however, the Congolese government started helping civil servants to open bank accounts. Around three-quarters of them--some 670,000 people--now have one. In the process, the government has weeded out tens of thousands of ghost employees, since the embezzlers who invented them could not open accounts in their names without a matching ID. Yet in a vast country with fewer roads than Luxembourg, hardly anyone lives anywhere near a bank branch. So Congolese banks must now do the work the government accountants used to: shipping money to the remote area. Cash has to be transported to branches in regional capitals, and thence to account-holders on the backs of motorbikes, in canoes or by foot. Bank staff with suitcases of cash make easy targets, just as they did in the west of America in the 19th century. Though they usually travel with armed policemen, there have been at least ten armed robberies of bank employees since January. At the moment banks are little more than money-transfer companies, and not very sophisticated ones at that. The transfers tend to go only one way--out of Kinshasa--so cannot be netted against each other; instead cash almost always has to be moved physically. Therefore, most Congolese bankers hope that the new system will promote the... Question: How did government employees use to earn a living?

Hypothesis: Tom also wondered: could we be one of God's dreams? Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Possible answers: (I) yes (II) it is not possible to tell (III) no","output":"Answer: (I) yes. The premise and the hypothesis both put forth the idea that our existence might be a part of God's dreaming. To delve deeper into this idea, let's analyze both statements and their underlying philosophical implications. Premise: And (as Tom wonders in the book's opening line) are we all characters in one of God's dreams? This premise suggests that the protagonist Tom is questioning the nature of existence, specifically whether human beings and the entire world might simply be creations within a dream of a higher power, which is assumed to be God in this context. The idea that we could be a part of God's dream raises questions about the nature of reality and our place within it. Hypothesis: Tom also wondered: could we be one of God's dreams? The hypothesis is essentially a rephrased expression of the premise. It also presents the idea of human existence as potentially being part of a dream, dreamed by God. This hypothesis shares the same underlying philosophical questions and implications as the premise, as it brings to light the possible illusory nature of our reality and the possibility of our lives being shaped by a powerful external force. Now, let's discuss the entailment between the premise and the hypothesis. Entailment, in this context, refers to a logical relationship between the two statements such that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true. In this case, both the premise and the hypothesis deal with the same core concept - that we might be part of a dream of God. The hypothesis can be seen as a paraphrased version or a reiteration of the premise. Given that they both express the same idea, if the premise were assumed to be true (i.e., Tom wonders about the possibility of our existence as part of God's dream), this would also lead to the truth of the hypothesis (i.e., Tom wonders if we could be one of God's dreams). Thus, we can conclude that the premise indeed entails the hypothesis, and the answer is (I) yes. Our existence being a product of God's dream is a recurring philosophical question that speaks to the innate curiosity humans have about the nature of reality and our role within it."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Therefore, if humans were to eat bears, they would likely be taking in less or more levels of toxic metals?","output":"Mike is studying what humans eat. Since bears are higher up the food chain than mosquitoes, if humans were to eat bears, they would likely be taking in higher levels of toxic metals. The passage states that the higher up a food chain that humans eat, the greater the levels of toxic metals they take in. This implies that eating bears, which are positioned higher up the food chain, would result in more accumulated toxic metals ingested by humans compared to eating mosquitoes, which are lower in the food chain. The reason behind this phenomenon is a process known as biomagnification. Biomagnification occurs when toxic substances, such as heavy metals, pesticides, and other pollutants, become more concentrated in organisms as one moves up the food chain. These substances tend to accumulate in the fatty tissues of organisms and are not easily broken down or excreted. Consequently, these toxins become more concentrated with each trophic level in the food chain. For example, in an aquatic ecosystem, small organisms like algae may absorb heavy metals or other pollutants from the water. They, in turn, are consumed by small insects or zooplankton, which in turn are consumed by small fish, which are ultimately eaten by larger fish and so on. At each trophic level, the concentration of toxic substances increases. As a result, top predators such as bears, which consume a range of prey species, will have a higher concentration of toxic substances in their tissues than the organisms lower down on the food chain. When humans consume these top predators, they are exposed to these accumulated toxins, which can pose health risks. Therefore, it can be concluded that if humans were to eat bears, they would likely be taking in more levels of toxic metals as opposed to eating mosquitoes, which are lower down the food chain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In A Double Life,Ronald Coleman surpassed himself as Anthony John, the tortured double personality. He put into that character all his talent and sincerity. The facial expressions, mannerisms,gait and stance spoke eloquently of what Anthony John was going through while playing Othello on stage. Coleman also did extremely well as a Shakespearean actor in those short scenes as Othello that were part of this gem of a movie. Closups of Coleman's face as Othello tortured by doubts about the fidelity of Desdemona were in themselves scenes worth watching.Add to that, his character's off stage desperation and only someone with Coleman's depth of acting perception can achieve. It was like watching Spenser Tracy as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, except this double role was much more profound and poignant. Shelly Winters looked so sweet, vulnerable and gorgeous at the same time and added her talent to the movie.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person John accuses of using him?  En route to California to prospect for gold, ex-sheriff Hooker, professional gambler Fiske, and bounty hunter Luke Daly are forced to stop over in a tiny Mexican village by engine trouble on the ship they are taking. A desperate Leah Fuller hires the three men and local Vicente Madariaga, to rescue her husband, John, who is pinned under debris from a gold mine cave-in in hostile Apache territory. During the harrowing journey, Luke tries to force himself on Leah late one night, forcing Hooker to intervene. Leah tells Hooker that where her husband is trapped, once was a boom town, but a volcano eruption wiped it out, leaving only a church steeple and the mine uncovered by lava. The resident priest called it the \\"garden of evil\\". The Indians now consider the volcano sacred. The group then arrives at the mine. They find John unconscious, and they free him. Before John wakes up, Hooker sets the man's broken leg.  When John regains consciousness, he accuses Leah of using him to get gold. Hooker talks to Leah later, about what her husband said; after he tells her that he has spotted signs of Apaches nearby, she offers him and the others all the gold they have dug up to take her husband away that night, while she remains behind to make it look like they are all still there.

Context: Swift Rivers is a children's historical novel by Cornelia Meigs. Set initially in 1835 in Minnesota, it is a story of the early days of the logging industry, when logs were floated down the Mississippi to St. Louis. The novel, illustrated by Forrest W. Orr, was first published in 1931 and was a Newbery Honor recipient in 1933. Hypothesis: It won an honor in 1933","output":"Based on the context provided, we can confidently draw the hypothesis that Swift Rivers, a children's historical novel by Cornelia Meigs, indeed received an honor in 1933. To understand the plausibility of this hypothesis, let us break down the context and analyze the relevant information in more detail. Firstly, Swift Rivers is described as a children's historical novel, highlighting that its target audience is young readers, and the story is set within a historical timeframe. The plot is set in the early days of the logging industry in Minnesota, around 1835, and revolves around the transportation of logs on the Mississippi River. The context also provides information about the author, Cornelia Meigs, and the illustrator, Forrest W. Orr. Cornelia Meigs is a notable name in the world of children's literature, and in combination with the historical setting and compelling narrative, it is reasonable to assume that the book has the potential to gain recognition in the industry. The most crucial piece of information supporting the hypothesis, however, is the statement that Swift Rivers was a \\"Newbery Honor recipient in 1933.\\" The Newbery Medal, along with its Honor recipients, is a prestigious literary award given to authors of distinguished children's books in the United States. The fact that the book received a Newbery Honor in 1933 directly supports the hypothesis. In conclusion, the context provided supports the hypothesis that Swift Rivers won an honor in 1933. Given that it is specifically mentioned that the book was a Newbery Honor recipient in that year, it is reasonable to assume this award recognition plays a significant part in the novel's reputation and highlights the importance of the story in shaping the children's literature landscape during that time. Therefore, the hypothesis holds true and aligns with the context given."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

However, there is something I must say about how the director captured something about the atmosphere of the early 70's in the choice of settings and clothing. The \\"back to the earth\\" philosophy and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs that was not dramatically decadent, as portrayed in many later versions of the 70's was right on, as was the \\"don't ask don't tell\\" pseudo-liberalism of the fraternity made up of east-coast intellectuals, except that I would have thought this was more likely of a New England school rather than one in Virginia, where I imagine the \\"good ole boy\\" mentality still dominated even elitist schools like this one.

The Residents are an American art collective best known for avant-garde music and multimedia works. Since their first official release, Meet the Residents (1974), the group has released over sixty albums, numerous music videos and short films, three CD-ROM projects, and ten DVDs. They have undertaken seven major world tours and scored multiple films. Pioneers in exploring the potential of CD-ROM and similar technologies, the Residents have won several awards for their multimedia projects. In October 2016, The Residents released Rushing Like a Banshee, the first single off their next album, alongside a video directed by John Sanborn. It was announced later found that it was part of a longer piece on The Ghost of Hope.  In early 2017, they announced a new show, titled In Between Dreams, was to premier at the Blue Note in Tokyo, the first show in Japan since the 13th Anniversary Show. Rather than \\"Randy\\", \\"Bob\\" and \\"Rico\\", the show was to feature \\"The Real Residents\\", the \\"original\\" group featuring four members, much like their earlier years. Three of the members wore blue and white checkered suits, plague doctor masks with dark lenses and white bowler hats while the singer wore a cow-pattern bodysuit with a fake cow nose and plastic horns. Two shows were to be played over the course of two days, and later the same show was to be played at the Safe as Milk festival in the Wales. The show in the Wales, however, never happened as the festival was cancelled in early April. Later, in March 2017, they announced the tour to officially begin in Copenhagen, Denmark, in November 2017.  Less than a week after the premiere of In Between Dreams, on March 24, 2017, the group released their first album in over 4 years, The Ghost of Hope. The album, based around historical train wrecks from the late 19th century and early 20th century, featured guest players such as Eric Drew Feldman (\\"who has worked with everybody cool\\") and Nolan Cook. The album gained large media attention, with notable magazines like Billboard and Wired covering the album shortly before its release.  Several months later, in late October 2017, the full In Between Dreams tour kicked off in Copenhagen, featuring the same cast and decorations as the Tokyo show, though with a substantially changed setlist that included preview tracks from an upcoming blues-styled album: \\"Die!

Roy Hodgson, England's head coach, is set to name Fabian Delph, Calum Chambers, Danny Rose, and John Stones in the national team's first squad since their disappointing World Cup campaign in Brazil. Nathaniel Clyne might also be included depending on Glen Johnson's injury status. The upcoming matches include a friendly against Norway at Wembley and a Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland in Basle. Step 2: Analyze the potential impact of the decision. By selecting young players, Hodgson is showing trust in fresh talent, hoping they can bring a new energy to the team. The decision to include Delph, Chambers, Rose, and Stones demonstrates Hodgson's commitment to rebuilding the England national team after the World Cup disappointment. Additionally, the possible inclusion of Clyne highlights Hodgson's attention to potential injuries and the need for reliable backup options. Step 3: Extrapolate potential benefits and drawbacks of the decision. Benefits:  - The young players can bring fresh energy and enthusiasm to the national team. - The decision may motivate these players to perform at their best, knowing they have the trust of the head coach. - The inclusion of new players could lead to healthy competition among team members, pushing them to improve their performances in upcoming matches. Drawbacks: - The selected players may lack international experience, which could potentially impact their performance in high-stake matches. - Opting for younger players without considering experienced options might result in the team's overall performance suffering due to a lack of guidance and leadership on the field. - There could also be concerns regarding the squad's chemistry, as the younger players may take time to adjust to playing with their more experienced teammates. Step 4: Monitor and adjust the strategy. Hodgson should keep an eye on the progress of the selected young players during training sessions and in upcoming matches, making adjustments to the squad as needed. If these players perform well and adapt to the team dynamic, they could become reliable fixtures in the future. If, on the other hand, it becomes evident that relying solely on young talent isn't working, Hodgson should reconsider his strategy and perhaps integrate more experienced players while still nurturing the potential of younger members."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information:  - Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (6 May 1880  15 June 1938) was a German expressionist painter and printmaker and one of the founders of the artists group Die Brücke or \\"The Bridge\\", a key group leading to the foundation of Expressionism in 20th-century art. He volunteered for army service in the First World War, but soon suffered a breakdown and was discharged. In 1933, his work was branded as \\"degenerate\\" by the Nazis and in 1937, over 600 of his works were sold or destroyed. In 1938, he committed suicide by gunshot.  - Modern art includes artistic work produced during the period extending roughly from the 1860s to the 1970s, and denotes the style and philosophy of the art produced during that era. The term is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in a spirit of experimentation. Modern artists experimented with new ways of seeing and with fresh ideas about the nature of materials and functions of art. A tendency away from the narrative, which was characteristic for the traditional arts, toward abstraction is characteristic of much modern art. More recent artistic production is often called contemporary art or postmodern art.  - Expressionism was a modernist movement, initially in poetry and painting, originating in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century. Its typical trait is to present the world solely from a subjective perspective, distorting it radically for emotional effect in order to evoke moods or ideas. Expressionist artists sought to express the meaning of emotional experience rather than physical reality.  - Die Brücke (The Bridge) was a group of German expressionist artists formed in Dresden in 1905, after which the Brücke Museum in Berlin was named. Founding members were Fritz Bleyl, Erich Heckel, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff. Later members were Emil Nolde, Max Pechstein and Otto Mueller. The seminal group had a major impact on the evolution of modern art in the 20th century and the creation of expressionism.  - Erich Heckel ( 31 July 1883 in Döbeln -- 27 January 1970 in Radolfzell ) was a German painter and printmaker , and a founding member of the group Die Brücke ( \`\` The Bridge '' ) which existed 1905 - 1913 .

Choices:  - seed  - cell  - dna  - grain of pollen  A: The answer is:","output":"A: grain of pollen A grain of pollen can be described as a tiny male gametophyte enclosed in a tough capsule. Pollen grains play a crucial role in the reproductive process of flowering plants, as they contain the male genetic material needed for fertilization. Let's delve deeper into understanding pollen, its structure, and its significance in plant reproduction. Pollen is produced by the anthers, which are part of a flower's stamen – the male reproductive organ. The process of pollen formation starts with the development of microsporocytes within the anthers. These microsporocytes undergo meiosis to form four haploid microspores. Each microspore then develops into a pollen grain, containing a male gametophyte. Each pollen grain (male gametophyte) consists of two main parts: the vegetative cell and the generative cell. The vegetative cell is responsible for producing the pollen tube, which delivers the sperm cells (contained within the generative cell) to the female gametophyte during the process of fertilization.  The tough capsule surrounding the pollen grain is called the exine, which is made up of a highly resistant biopolymer called sporopollenin. Sporopollenin protects the male gametophyte from various environmental factors, such as UV radiation, desiccation, and enzymatic degradation. Additionally, the surface of the exine is decorated with intricate patterns of ridges, spines, and grooves, which are species-specific and can be vital in helping the pollen grain adhere to certain pollinators for effective transfer to the female reproductive organs of another flower. In the process of plant reproduction, pollen grains are dispersed from the anthers of one flower and transported to the stigma of another flower within the same species. This transfer is facilitated by various pollinators, such as insects, birds, bats, and wind. Once the pollen grain lands on a compatible stigma, it germinates, forming a pollen tube. This tube grows through the style toward the ovary, enabling the delivery of sperm cells to the female gametophyte (embryo sac) for fertilization. Successful fertilization results in the formation of a seed, which eventually matures and is released for the development of a new plant. In summary, a grain of pollen is the correct choice because it represents the male gametophyte of a flowering plant, enclosed within a protective capsule.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the mother of the girl that the professor of French Literature is attracted to? is inside the article: In 1947, Humbert Humbert, a middle-aged European professor of French literature, travels to the United States to take a teaching position in New Hampshire. He rents a room in the home of widow Charlotte Haze, largely because he is romantically attracted to her adolescent daughter Dolores, also called \\"Lo\\", who he sees while touring the house. Obsessed from boyhood with girls of approximately her age (whom he calls \\"nymphets\\"), Humbert is immediately smitten with Lo and gets married to Charlotte only just to be near her daughter. Charlotte finds Humbert's secret diary and discovers his preference for her daughter. Furious, Charlotte runs out of the house, when she is struck by a car and killed.  Her death frees Humbert to pursue a romantic and sexual relationship with Lo, whom he nicknames \\"Lolita\\". Humbert and Lo then travel the country, staying in various motels before eventually settling in the college town of Beardsley, where Humbert takes a teaching job and Lo begins attending an all-girls Catholic school. However, Lo's increasing boredom with Humbert, combined with her growing desire for independence, fuels a constant tension that lead to a fight between them. Humbert's affection for Lo is also rivaled by another man, playwright Clare Quilty, who has been pursuing Lo since the beginning of the pair's travels. Lo eventually escapes with Quilty, and Humbert's search for them is unsuccessful, especially as he doesn't know Quilty's name. Three years later, Humbert receives a letter from Lo asking for money. Humbert visits Lo, who is now married and pregnant. Humbert asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. He relents and gives her a substantial amount of money. Lo also reveals to Humbert how Quilty actually tracked young girls and took them to Pavor Manor, his home in Parkington, to exploit them for child pornography. Quilty abandoned her after she refused to be in one of his films., can you guess it ? The answer is:","output":"Charlotte Haze. Justification: Given the information provided in the article, we can deduce that Humbert Humbert is the professor of French Literature. He rents a room in the home of widow Charlotte Haze and becomes attracted to her adolescent daughter, Dolores, also known as \\"Lo\\" or \\"Lolita.\\" Therefore, the full name of the mother of the girl that the professor of French Literature is attracted to is Charlotte Haze."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Although Neptune lies over 50% further from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% its amount of sunlight, the two planets' surface temperatures are roughly equal. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8 K (−221.3 °C). At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa), the temperature is 72.00 K (−201.15 °C). Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun; whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal properties of its interior, the heat left over from Neptune's formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets.\\"?

Question: Which sea, separated from the Black Sea by the Strait of Kerch, suffered an ecological disaster in November 2007, when a fierce storm wrecked numerous oil tankers? Answer:","output":"The sea in question is the Azov Sea, which experienced a significant ecological disaster in November 2007 as a result of a severe storm that led to the wreckage of numerous oil tankers. The Azov Sea, situated in the northeastern part of the Black Sea basin, is a relatively small and shallow body of water that lies between the southeastern European region of Russia and Ukraine. This sea is connected to the Black Sea through the Strait of Kerch, a narrow passage that serves as a vital route for maritime transport in the region. In mid-November 2007, a powerful storm hit the Strait of Kerch, causing massive waves to batter the vessels traversing the channel. Among the ships affected were several oil tankers, including the Russian-registered Volganeft-139, which was carrying over 4,000 tonnes of fuel oil at the time. Due to the storm's ferocity, the tanker broke apart, spilling a significant part of its payload into the sea. Other smaller spills occurred during the incident, involving multiple vessels transporting toxic substances such as sulfur and bitumen. The consequences of the 2007 Kerch Strait ecological disaster were severe and far-reaching. The spilled oil spread quickly across the Azov Sea, covering an area of approximately 80 square kilometers. The contamination adversely affected marine life, killing thousands of fish and birds, as well as posing a significant threat to the delicate ecosystems of the sea. Moreover, the oil spill wreaked havoc on the local fishing and tourism industries, with both experiencing substantial financial losses.  In the aftermath of the disaster, emergency response efforts were launched by both Russian and Ukrainian authorities to mitigate the environmental damage. These efforts included deploying containment booms, skimmers, and dispersants to restrict the further spread of oil and limit its presence on the water's surface. Additionally, thousands of volunteers and military personnel participated in beach clean-up operations to remove oil deposits from the shoreline and rescue afflicted wildlife.  The Kerch Strait ecological disaster of 2007 served as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities faced by seas like the Azov Sea in regard to human activities and maritime transport. The disaster brought to light the need for increased cooperation between bordering nations, more rigorous environmental regulations, and the implementation of enhanced safety measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. As a result, authorities on both sides have taken steps to strengthen maritime safety policies, improve emergency response capabilities, and promote environmental sustainability in the management of the Azov Sea and its surrounding areas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A drunk driver caused a gruesome car crash that took the life of his passenger who was celebrating his birthday on Friday night. Hugue Lapomarade, 31, was killed when driver Vladimir JeanPierre smashed his white minivan into a parked flatbed truck in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, in the early hours of Saturday morning. JeanPierre, 34, has been arrested and charged with manslaughter, reckless endangerment, vehicular manslaughter and drunk driving. Emergency crews had to cut the roof and doors off the vehicle to remove the people inside. The car, pictured in Brooklyn on Saturday morning, was driven by drunk driver Vladimir JeanPierre. Tragedy: The victim was removed from the car and taken to hospital, but was pronounced dead on arrival. The victim had been out celebrating his birthday before the horrific crash, which occurred at around 4.25 am on Saturday at 1304 Utica Avenue, East Flatbush. Barry Radow, who works at a local garage told the New York Daily News that police had told him the driver 'hit the tow truck so hard he pushed the truck forward five or six feet.' Wreckage: According to a witness, the car was driving so fast it moved the truck several feet. Horror: The car's roof had to be taken off to remove the driver and passenger after it hit a flatbed truck. Radow said: 'The car was a mess, they had to cut the roof off. It was really bad.' Emergency workers arrived at the scene and rushed Lapomarade to hospital, but he was pronounced dead on arrival. Police said it was not clear if the truck operator was at fault. The flatbed appeared to be double-parked when the white minivan, a white Nissan Quest, hit it. The truck had been double parked, but police said it was not clear if there was any blame to lay on its owner. Horrific: An onlooker surveys the wreckage as traffic piles up at the scene on Saturday morning. Highlights:","output":"1.

Given the question: Given the following passage  \\"Orientalist scholars of the 18th century like Sir William Jones marked a wave of enthusiasm for Indian culture and for Sanskrit. According to Thomas Trautmann, after this period of \\"Indomania\\", a certain hostility to Sanskrit and to Indian culture in general began to assert itself in early 19th century Britain, manifested by a neglect of Sanskrit in British academia. This was the beginning of a general push in favor of the idea that India should be culturally, religiously and linguistically assimilated to Britain as far as possible. Trautmann considers two separate and logically opposite sources for the growing hostility: one was \\"British Indophobia\\", which he calls essentially a developmentalist, progressivist, liberal, and non-racial-essentialist critique of Hindu civilisation as an aid for the improvement of India along European lines; the other was scientific racism, a theory of the English \\"common-sense view\\" that Indians constituted a \\"separate, inferior and unimprovable race\\".\\",  answer the following question.

Write a title for this article: HONG KONG — Protesters demanding democracy in Hong Kong delivered a stinging rebuff to the government late on Friday by reclaiming a street that police had forcibly cleared earlier in the day. Hundreds of demonstrators cheered ecstatically when, after hours of mounting tensions, the outnumbered police were ordered to retreat rather than risk an escalating confrontation. The action was centered on Nathan Road in the volatile Mong Kok neighborhood, an area teeming with shops and neon signs where demonstrators had blocked streets with barriers and tents and had snarled traffic for nearly three weeks, demanding a democratic ballot for choosing Hong Kong’s next leader. The police moved in early Friday morning and swiftly reopened all but a small area to traffic. But by evening the move had backfired, drawing the biggest crowds in weeks to the area and forcing the police to deploy hundreds of officers, many of them in full riot gear with helmets, batons and shields. Three officers were injured in the clashes, one with an unspecified head injury, the police said in a statement. It was not known how many protesters were hurt. As they have several times recently, the police used pepper spray to help quell the crowds. Alex Wong, a bank worker in his 20s wearing a medical mask, goggles and towel on his head, said he had come to Mong Kok to show his anger at the police operation. “I’m very scared,” Mr. Wong said. “But I’m here to fight for the future of Hong Kong. The price of democracy and freedom is not cheap.” Like many other protesters, he said he did not trust established political parties and student groups to negotiate effectively with the government. “Mong Kok is more the true voice of Hong Kong citizens,” he said. Guidelines issued by China’s national legislature in late September effectively guarantee that only pro-Beijing candidates can appear on the ballot for chief executive, the top position in Hong Kong, in the elections scheduled for 2017. The protesters say those rules violate commitments Beijing made when Britain returned the territory to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 after more than 150 years of British rule. Before the last three weeks, clashes between police and angry crowds were uncommon in Hong Kong, one of the world’s richest cities. It has a reputation for stability and good governance, and is home to the Asia headquarters for scores of multinational corporations, law firms and banks. The 1997 agreement called for the city’s British-based legal system and civil liberties to be preserved for 50 years after the handover to China. The scene at Nathan Road on Friday turned into a churning confrontation between hundreds of masked protesters and the police, who stripped away the protesters’ umbrellas and struggled to contain flare-ups with the surging crowd. Nearby, on Argyle Street, the police struggled on Friday to contain crowds as they chanted “Open the road,” and “Cross the street.” Several young men were hauled away by the police, prompting roars of disapproval from the crowd. Several of the masked protesters said they had no intention of charging at the police but wanted to show their support for the Mong Kok protest, which was more diverse and raucous than the main sit-in outside the government’s headquarters in Admiralty, where students dominate. “I came here to be a witness if there is police violence,” said Mani, an office assistant who declined to give her surname. “We don’t want violence. Most of the police are not bad men, but we’ve seen the illegal things they have done.” Though many protesters in the crowd wore goggles and surgical masks, now customary protections against pepper spray, most appeared reluctant to challenge the police cordons. “I want to reoccupy Mong Kok,” said one goggled university student who gave only his first name, Simon. “This was supposed to be our road for occupy.” Title:","output":"\\"Protesters Win Back Street in Hong Kong's Fight for Democracy\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A. wilderness  B. rainforest  C. mountains  D. swamp  E. burrow  The best answer is Answer:","output":"B. Rainforest Marmosets, which belong to the family Callitrichidae, feel safest in their natural habitat, the rainforest. These small, tree-dwelling primates are native to the Central and South American rainforests, particularly in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Amazon Basin. The rainforest offers an ideal environment for marmosets, as it provides abundant food resources, protective cover, and ample opportunities for social interactions. Marmosets primarily feed on tree sap, fruits, insects, and small vertebrates, all of which are readily available in a rainforest ecosystem. The dense foliage of the rainforest provides multiple layers of vegetation, which allows marmosets to forage safely and efficiently while remaining hidden from potential predators such as birds of prey and larger primates. Furthermore, rainforests are home to a diverse array of plant and animal species, which encourages the biological and ecological stability necessary for marmosets to thrive. In addition to providing an abundance of food resources, the rainforest also offers ample opportunities for marmosets to establish and maintain complex social structures. Marmosets are known for their highly social behavior and live in groups consisting of multiple families, with each family usually composed of a breeding pair and their offspring. Living in a group provides protection from predators, as well as providing opportunities for cooperative foraging and coordinated defense. The dense canopy and diverse vegetation of the rainforest create the perfect living space for these groups to establish their territories and interact with other marmoset groups. The other options (A. wilderness, C. mountains, D. swamp, and E. burrow) do not provide the same level of safety and resources for marmosets as their preferred rainforest habitat. The wilderness or mountains may lack the specific vegetation necessary for marmosets to feed and survive, while swamps may be too wet and have a different array of flora and fauna. Burrows, on the other hand, may provide some protection but do not offer the arboreal lifestyle that marmosets are adapted for. Therefore, the best answer is B. Rainforest, as it offers the ideal combination of food resources, protective cover, and opportunities for social interaction that marmosets need to feel safe and thrive in their natural environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The lack of a clear heir led to a period known as the \\"Great Cause\\", with several families laying claim to the throne. With Scotland threatening to descend into civil war, King Edward I of England was invited in by the Scottish nobility to arbitrate. Before the process could begin, he insisted that all of the contenders recognise him as Lord Paramount of Scotland. In early November 1292, at a great feudal court held in the castle at Berwick-upon-Tweed, judgement was given in favour of John Balliol having the strongest claim in law. Edward proceeded to reverse the rulings of the Scottish Lords and even summoned King John Balliol to stand before the English court as a common plaintiff. John was a weak king, known as \\"Toom Tabard\\" or \\"Empty Coat\\". John renounced his homage in March 1296 and by the end of the month Edward stormed Berwick-upon-Tweed, sacking the then-Scottish border town. In April, the Scots were defeated at the Battle of Dunbar in East Lothian and by July, Edward had forced John to abdicate. Edward then instructed his officers to receive formal homage from some 1,800 Scottish nobles .

Along the way, Yuna discovers her own unique style and becomes an unexpected force for change in this male-dominated world. Act 1: Yuna, a socially awkward photographer living in a bustling city, is struggling to find her true photographic niche. One day, she accompanies her close friend, Elise, to a photography meet-up, where she hopes to showcase her latest work. When at the meet-up, she inadvertently captures a \\"panty shot\\" of a cosplayer when adjusting her camera. As she starts to delete the picture, a mysterious figure named Vincent approaches her, impressed by her \\"skill\\" and inviting her to a secretive photography group. Curious and feeling out of place in the regular photography scene, Yuna reluctantly agrees. She is intrigued by the idea and secretly follows Vincent to the next meeting. Act 2: Yuna discovers an underground network of salacious photographers, including many well-known professionals, who specialize in capturing panty shots of unsuspecting women. Initially repulsed, Yuna decides to use this opportunity to take them down from the inside. She creates a disguise and a new persona – Yuri, a brazen and unapologetic panty shot photographer –  and joins the group. She quickly befriends several members of the group and learns about a prestigious competition, \\"The Crystal Lens,\\" awarded to the best panty shot photographer. Yuna, driven by the unjust nature of the group, sets her sights on exposing the group by winning the competition and revealing its members to the public. Act 3: As Yuna immerses herself deeper into this hidden world, she discovers that many of the photographers are not only motivated by their perverse desires but also by a twisted sense of camaraderie and belonging. Through her interactions with them, Yuna learns more about what it means to be passionate about one's art and begins questioning her own motivations. Meanwhile, Elise notices a change in Yuna's behavior and grows increasingly concerned about her friend's sudden fascination with \\"panty shots.\\" Elise attempts to confront Yuna about her newfound obsession, but Yuna deflects her concern and keeps her undercover operation a secret. Act 4: The competition finally arrives, and Yuna's unique and artistic panty shots quickly put her among the top contenders. At the final round, as she is about to make her grand reveal and expose the group, Yuna hesitates, realizing that some of the members are genuinely talented individuals who have simply lost their way. Instead of revealing her identity, she dedicates her winning entry to challenging the underground group to reimagine their skills for good rather than objectification. Her powerful words, combined with her undeniable talent, inspire many of the photographers to change their ways and use their skills for more positive and inclusive purposes. Vincent, after gracefully admitting defeat, privately confesses to Yuna that he too has long desired change and offers to join her in this new path. Act 5: The underground group disbands, and several of its members continue on to create a more positive and socially responsible photography collective. Yuna, having finally found her photographic niche, steps into the limelight with her artistic portrayal of empowering and body-positive photography. Elise, although worried about Yuna's initial secret, is proud to see her friend become a positive influence within the photography community. Astonished to see her friend's sudden transformation, Elise remains a loyal confidant, always ready to support Yuna in her future endeavors. Together, Yuna, Vincent, Elise, and other like-minded photographers build a new photography community based on respect, empowerment, and artistic evolution, helping to change the perception of photography in society. \\"Undercover Lenses\\" highlights the importance of staying true to one's values, breaking away from societal constraints, and using one's talents to promote positive change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Phonology is a branch of linguistics concerned with the systematic organization of sounds in languages. It has traditionally focused largely on the study of the systems of phonemes in particular languages (and therefore used to be also called phonemics, or phonematics), but it may also cover any linguistic analysis either at a level beneath the word (including syllable, onset and rime, articulatory gestures, articulatory features, mora, etc.) or at all levels of language where sound is considered to be structured for conveying linguistic meaning. Phonology also includes the study of equivalent organizational systems in sign languages.  The word phonology (as in the phonology of English) can also refer to the phonological system (sound system) of a given language. This is one of the fundamental systems which a language is considered to comprise, like its syntax and its vocabulary.  Phonology is often distinguished from phonetics. While phonetics concerns the physical production, acoustic transmission and perception of the sounds of speech, phonology describes the way sounds function within a given language or across languages to encode meaning. For many linguists, phonetics belongs to descriptive linguistics, and phonology to theoretical linguistics, although establishing the phonological system of a language is necessarily an application of theoretical principles to analysis of phonetic evidence. Note that this distinction was not always made, particularly before the development of the modern concept of the phoneme in the mid 20th century. Some subfields of modern phonology have a crossover with phonetics in descriptive disciplines such as psycholinguistics and speech perception, resulting in specific areas like articulatory phonology or laboratory phonology.

Knowledge is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or something, such as facts, information, descriptions, or skills, which is acquired through experience or education by perceiving, discovering, or learning.  Knowledge can refer to a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. It can be implicit (as with practical skill or expertise) or explicit (as with the theoretical understanding of a subject); it can be more or less formal or systematic. In philosophy, the study of knowledge is called epistemology; the philosopher Plato famously defined knowledge as \\"justified true belief\\", though this definition is now thought by some analytic philosophers to be problematic because of the Gettier problems while others defend the platonic definition. However, several definitions of knowledge and theories to explain it exist.  Knowledge acquisition involves complex cognitive processes: perception, communication, and reasoning; while knowledge is also said to be related to the capacity of \\"acknowledgment\\" in human beings.  The definition of knowledge is a matter of ongoing debate among philosophers in the field of epistemology. The classical definition, described but not ultimately endorsed by Plato, specifies that a statement must meet three in order to be considered knowledge: it must be justified, true, and believed. Some claim that these conditions are not sufficient, as Gettier case examples allegedly demonstrate. There are a number of alternatives proposed, including Robert Nozick's arguments for a requirement that knowledge 'tracks the truth' and Simon Blackburn's additional requirement that we do not want to say that those who meet any of these conditions 'through a defect, flaw, or failure' have knowledge. Richard Kirkham suggests that our definition of knowledge requires that the evidence for the belief necessitates its truth. 1. Who said knowledge is justified true belief? 2. Do recent philosophers agree? 3. Why do some disagree? 4. How is knowledge obtained? 5. Is it implicit or explicit? 6. What does it mean to be implicit? 7. And explicit? 8. What term is used for the study of knowledge? 9. How many processes are involved with acquiring knowledge? 10. Are these simple processes? 11. Would communicating be one of them? 12.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Bernoulli’s law explains how the wings of both airplanes and birds create lift that allows flight (see Figure below ). The shape of the wings causes air to flow more quickly — and air pressure to be lower — above the wings than below them. This allows the wings to lift the plane or bird above the ground against the pull of gravity. A spoiler on a race car, like the one in Figure below , works in the opposite way. Its shape causes air to flow more slowly — and air pressure to be greater — above the spoiler than below it. As a result, air pressure pushes the car downward, giving its wheels better traction on the track.  Now, I have a new situation: Rob is experimenting with how air pressure works. To that end, he has designed two tests. In the first test the air flow works as it would in an airplane wing. He labels it as case A. In the second test the air flow works as it would in a race car spoiler. He labels it as case B. He is surprised to see that air flow behaves differently in different situations.  Answer this question please: Would case A have faster or slower air flow above it than case B? Answer:","output":"Case A would have faster air flow above it than case B.

Some cookware or packaging is marked with symbols to indicate compatibility with induction, gas, or electric heat. Induction cooking surfaces work well with any pans with a high ferrous metal content at the base. Cast iron pans and any black metal or iron pans will work on an induction cooking surface. Stainless steel pans will work on an induction cooking surface if the base of the pan is a magnetic grade of stainless steel. If a magnet sticks well to the sole of the pan, it will work on an induction cooking surface. An \`\`all-metal'' cooker will work with non-ferrous cookware, but available models are limited. Is this statement correct \\"does cast iron work on an induction cooktop\\"?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"does cast iron work on an induction cooktop?\\" is correct. Cast iron pans and cookware are highly compatible with induction cooktops due to their high ferrous metal content, which is essential for the cookware to work effectively on an induction cooking surface. Induction cooking uses electromagnetic fields to generate heat directly within the cookware, rather than relying on the heat transfer from the cooktop to the pan, as in conventional gas or electric cooking methods. The process requires the cookware to have magnetic properties, as the magnetic field created by the induction cooktop causes the ferromagnetic materials in the cookware to heat up. Cast iron, being a ferromagnetic material, is a perfect fit for induction cooktops. Not only does cast iron work on induction cooktops, but it also offers some benefits when compared to other cookware materials. These benefits include: 1. Cast iron cookware has excellent heat retention properties, which allows the cookware to hold onto heat longer than other materials, leading to more even cooking temperatures. 2. The high heat capacity of cast iron cookware allows it to reach and maintain high temperatures, which is useful for searing, frying, and other high-temperature cooking techniques. 3. Cast iron cookware is highly resilient and can last for generations if properly cared for, making it a sustainable and environmentally friendly choice. However, when using cast iron cookware on an induction cooktop, some precautions should be taken. For instance: 1. Make sure your cast iron cookware has a flat base so that it sits well on the induction cooktop and ensures optimal heat transfer. 2. Be careful when placing or moving your cast iron cookware on the surface of your induction cooktop, as they might scratch or damage the surface due to their weight and rough texture. Using trivets or placing silicone mats under your cookware can help prevent this problem. 3. It's essential to keep your cast iron cookware properly seasoned, as this can help prevent food from sticking to the pan, and also imparts a unique flavor to your dishes. In conclusion, cast iron cookware is highly compatible with induction cooktops due to its ferromagnetic properties and unlocks numerous benefits when used for cooking. So, the statement \\"does cast iron work on an induction cooktop?\\" is accurate and reflects the compatibility between cast iron cookware and induction cooking technology."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he urged North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to directly engage with Washington to salvage the June 12 nuclear summit with the U.S., when the two leaders held a surprise second inter-Korean summit Saturday. “I emphasized that the two sides must directly communicate in order to eradicate any misunderstandings, and preliminary talks through working-level negotiations on key agendas are necessary,” said President Moon at a press briefing in Seoul Sunday. North Korea requested the meeting between Kim and Moon after U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled the Singapore summit. Trump said his decision was based on the “tremendous anger and open hostility displayed” by North Korea officials recently over U.S. demands that Pyongyang follow the Libya denuclearization model. North Korea sees that model for rapid and complete denuclearization as a threat to the Kim government’s security, since Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi was later overthrown and killed by his own people, with support from a multinational military coalition that included the U.S. Pyongyang has called for a more incremental process that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and postpones complete denuclearization until the North’s security demands are met. Moon met with Kim on the North side of the inter-Korean border, in the same village of Panmunjom where the two leaders held a summit in April. At that meeting, on the south side of the border, the two leaders jointly declared their support for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

Women teachers have been 'strongly suggested' to remove their veils when teaching in the classroom in the majority Catholic country of the Philippines. It is the latest twist in the ongoing controversy over the wearing of the religious garment, that sparked a riot in the French capital Paris on Friday. An order was sent out by the Filipino Government yesterday instructing females who teach Arabic language and Islamic values to take off the religious niqab, which covers all of the face except the eyes. The Government believes this will lead to better relationships between teachers and pupils. Education secretary Armin Luistro said it was part of reforms designed to make schools more sensitive to religion. The ruling does not apply to the hijab - garments that cover the head only. Muslim schoolgirls will still be allowed to wear the veil in schools as well as 'appropriate clothing' in gym class. But while female Muslim schoolteachers can wear the veil outside class, they have been told to remove the veil during lessons so they can interact better with students. The order stated: 'Once the teacher is in the classroom, she is requested to remove the veil.' It added the move would help aid 'proper identification of the teachers by their pupils, thus promoting better teacher-pupil relationship'. It would also help the teaching of languages, where 'lip formation' plays a role in pronouncing certain letters. The Government’s Office of Muslim Affairs said it agreed with the education department’s measures, although it had not yet received a copy of the order. Roque Morales, an adviser to the office, claimed that while he did not know how many Muslim Filipinas were working as teachers, the practice of wearing veils, such as hijabs and niqabs, was widespread in the southern Philippines. Breaking down barriers: Education Secretary Armin Luistro believes the ban on the veil will lead to better relationships between teachers and pupils. Exempt: Schoolgirls, like this one, will continue to be allowed to wear veils around schools, but their teachers will have to remove full face niqabs similar to this one on the left. He said: 'You would almost see it everywhere.' So far there have not been any complaints from Muslim teachers, he added. The office said that Muslims make up about 15 per cent of the Philippine population, mostly based in the southern regions, which they consider their ancestral home. The hijab and niqab - a religious garment worn by some Muslim women to cover their whole face - continue to divide cultures around the world. Two years ago, France banned the niqab and the burqa from being worn anywhere in public in a move that sparked protests among Muslims. Protests: Muslims took to the streets when France banned the niqab and burqa from being worn in public places. On Friday rioting broke out in the Paris suburb of Trappes after police carried out identity checks on a Muslim woman who was wearing a full face veil, according to the Guardian. Her husband was arrested and taken into custody amid allegations he had assaulted one of the officers involved. Hundreds of people took to the streets, hurling stones and paving slabs and setting fire to cars, bins and bus shelters, demanding his release. Riot police tackled them with tear gas. The police station was said to have been under siege for about an hour. A second night of rioting followed on Saturday, when violence threatened to spread to nearby towns. The Collective Against Islamophobia in France released a statement. complaining of heavy handed policing. In 2004 France introduced a law banning state employees from wearing prominent religious symbols, such as Christian crosses and Jewish skullcaps, as well as Muslim veils. Current France President Francois Hollande now wants a new law that could extend this into the private sector.

Write highlights for this article: Lighting storms are impressive displays of nature's power - but up until now scientists hadn’t realised that they could also sculpt mountains. A team of researchers from Johannesburg recently discovered that a single lightning bolt could, for example, blow. three to 10 cubic metres (100 to 350 cubic feet) out of bedrock. This. goes against the current assumptions that the peaks above 3,050 metres. (10,000ft) tend to break down over hundreds of thousands of years. Lighting storms are impressive displays of nature's power - but up until now scientists hadn't realised that they could also sculpt mountains. The discovery was made by Professor Stefan Grab while studying the Drakensberg mountains in Lesotho, southern Africa. Previous theories claim that water melting and freezing inside cracks causes the rocks on mountains to break into pieces as they expand and break off. The Wind River Range, the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains were thought to have been shaped in this way, for example. But unlike these formations, Professor. Grab believes that lightning was the main cause behind the creation of. the mountain landscapes in southern Africa. In Lesotho's Drakensberg mountains, for instance, the team found that a single lightning bolt could blow three to 10 cubic metres (100 to 350 cubic feet) out of bedrock. New research done on the Drakensberg mountains in South Africa debunks previous suggestions that cold temperatures played a dominate role in mountain formation. The hit: Lighning strickes the rock surface. The heat - which is around 27760 ºC - vapourises water that is stored in the cracks. The explosion: The force of the vapourised water explosed the rocke, moving 10 tonnes of debris as far as 10 metres (30 feet) away. New cracks help to continue the process of weathering. In Lesotho's Drakensberg mountains, for instance, the team found that a single lightning bolt could blow three to 10 cubic metres (100 to 350 cubic feet) out of bedrock. This goes against the current assumptions that the peaks above 3,050 metres (10,000 feet) tend to break down over hundreds of thousands of years. His team used a compass to prove their theory. ‘A compass needle always points to magnetic north,’ said Professor Grab's colleague Professor Jasper Knight. ‘But. when you pass a compass over a land’s surface, if the minerals in the. rock have a strong enough magnetic field, the compass will read the. magnetic field of the rock, which corresponds to when it was formed. ‘In the Drakensburg, there are a lot of basalt rocks which contain a lot of magnetic minerals, so they’ve got a very strong magnetic signal.’ If a compass is passed over an area where a lightning strike occurred, its needle will suddenly swing through 360 degrees. ‘The energy of the lightning hitting the land’s surface can, for a short time, partially melt the rock and when the rock cools down again,’ added. ‘It takes on the magnetic imprint of today’s magnetic field, not the magnetic field of millions of years ago when the rock was originally formed.’ Because of the movement of continents, magnetic north for the newly formed rock will be different from that of the older rock around it. Professor Knight and Professor Grab mapped out the distribution of lightning strikes in the Drakensburg and discovered that lightning significantly controls the evolution of the mountain landscapes because it helps to shape the summit areas with this blasting effect. Previously, angular debris was assumed to have been created by changes typical of cold, glacial environments, such as fracturing due to frost. Water enters cracks in rocks and when it freezes, it expands, causing the rocks to split apart. ‘Many. people have considered mountains to be pretty passive agents, just. sitting there to be affected by cold climates over these long periods of. time,’ said Professor Knight. ‘This. evidence suggests that that is completely wrong. African mountain. landscapes sometimes evolve very quickly and very dramatically over. short periods of time. These are actually very sensitive environments. and we need to know more about them.’ Previously, angular debris was assumed to have been created by changes typical of cold, glacial environments, such as fracturing due to frost. The research team also attempted to quantify how much debris was moved by such blasts, which can cause boulders weighing several tonnes to move tens of metres. The stability of the land’s surface has important implications for the people living near the mountains. ‘If we have lots of debris being generated it’s going to flow down slope and this is associated with hazards such as landslides,’ said Professor Knight. Mountains are also inextricably linked to food security and water supply. In Lesotho, a country crucial to South Africa’s water supply, food shortages are leading to overgrazing, exposing the rock surface and making mountain landscapes even more vulnerable to weathering by lightning. Professor Knight hopes the research will help to put in place monitoring and mitigation to try and counteract some of the effects. ‘The more we increase our understanding, the more we are able to do something about it,’ he said. Highlights:","output":"1. Scientists discovered that lightning storms can change the shape of mountains. 2. A single lightning bolt can blow a big chunk out of a mountain. 3. Before, people thought mountains broke down slowly over a very long time. 4. Researchers studied the Drakensberg mountains in Africa and found evidence of lightning shaping them. 5. Understanding how lightning affects mountains can help people who live near them stay safe."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the band who played Woodstock 1999 and Rock in Rio? ?  Following a life-threatening drug addiction that developed after leaving the Chili Peppers in 1992, Frusciante completed a month of drug rehabilitation at Las Encinas in Pasadena in 1998. Shortly thereafter he was asked to rejoin the band. After several months of writing and recording, the Chili Peppers' next album, Californication was released. The album went on to sell more than 15 million copies worldwide, becoming the Chili Peppers' most successful recording to date. Frusciante's return generated much response from critics, who recognized the album as a commercial revitalization from their previous record, One Hot Minute. A two-year-long, international tour followed, which included several festival appearances, including Woodstock 1999 and Rock in Rio. The writing and formation of By the Way began immediately following the culmination of Californication's world tour, in the spring of 2001. As with Californication, much of the creation took place in the band members' homes and other practice locations, such as a recording studio stage. Kiedis recalled of the situation: \\"We started finding some magic and some music and some riffs and some rhythms and some jams and some grooves, and we added to it and subtracted from it and pushed it around and put melodies to it.\\" Frusciante and Kiedis would collaborate for days straight, discussing guitar progressions and sharing lyrics. For Kiedis, \\"writing By the Way...was a whole different experience from Californication. John was back to himself and brimming with confidence.\\" Prior to recording By the Way, the Chili Peppers decided that they would again have Rick Rubin produce the album. Rubin had, in the past, granted the Chili Peppers creative freedom on their recording material; this was something they thought essential for the album to be unique, and could only occur with his return.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: It's important to use a cover that will keep bugs out but allow air to flow in and escape the crock. You can use a crock lid designed for this purpose or stretch a cloth or t-shirt over the opening and secure it in place with a large rubber band. Place the covered crock in a warm area with a temperature around 70 degrees overnight. Putting the crock in a cool place won't facilitate the growth of the yeast. Storing it in a place that's too warm will kill the yeast. Find a good in-between place in your kitchen. The day after you make the mixture, uncover it and stir it thoroughly, and recover. Do this every 4 hours or so the first day, then keep stirring a few times per day for the next 3 days. The mixture should start bubbling as the yeast moves into action. This is the fermentation process that will lead to delicious wine. When the bubbling slows down, about 3 days after it begins, it's time to strain out the solids and siphon the liquid into your carboy for longer-term storage. Once you've siphoned it into the carboy, affix the airlock to the opening to allow for the release of gas while preventing oxygen from coming in and spoiling your wine.  If you don't have an airlock, you can use a small balloon placed over the opening with about 5 pin sized holes in it. Secure it with tape. This will let the gas escape but not let in oxygen. It's better if you can let it age for up to nine, during which time the wine will age and mellow, resulting in a much improved taste. If you used extra honey in your wine, it's better to age it on the longer side, or else it will taste too sweet when you drink it. To prevent the wine from catching a bacteria that could cause it to turn to vinegar, add a Campden tablet to the mixture as soon as you remove the airlock. Siphon the wine into your clean bottles, filling them almost to the top, and cork them immediately. Allow the wine to further age in the bottles or enjoy it immediately. Use dark bottles to preserve the color of red wines.

Given the question: Information:  - Delain is a Dutch symphonic metal band formed in 2002 by former Within Temptation keyboardist Martijn Westerholt, and Charlotte Wessels. The name of the band comes from the Kingdom of Delain in Stephen King's novel, \\"The Eyes of the Dragon\\".  - Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in April 1995 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have always been classified by critics as gothic metal, although the \\"gothic\\" influence varies with each album. Their most prominent and well-known sound is described as symphonic metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album \\"Enter\\", was mostly gothic metal. \\"Enter\\" even had a hint of doom metal. In an interview, Den Adel said they fell into a symphonic rock genre with various influences. In a later interview with Dutch music platform 3VOOR12, den Adel stated that \\"we consider ourselves more a symphonic rock band ... in my opinion, we are no gothic band\\".  - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:  European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.  - Nightwish is a symphonic power metal band from Kitee, Finland. The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and lead singer Tarja Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami Vänskä after the release of their debut album, \\"Angels Fall First\\" (1997). In 2002, Vänskä was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers.  - Symphonic metal is a subgenre of metal music which combines the characteristics of this genre, such as heavy drums and guitars, with different elements of classical music including symphonic instruments, choirs and on occasion, a full symphony orchestra. Keyboards reminiscent of power metal also often find a dominant place in this subgenre. Symphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname opera metal or operatic metal, and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing growls, a more common characteristic of gothic metal. Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Finnish band Nightwish, Dutch bands Within Temptation, Delain and Epica, and Swedish band Therion, all four of which place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores on top of the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre.  - Vanishing Point are a progressive / symphonic metal band based in Melbourne , Australia .
