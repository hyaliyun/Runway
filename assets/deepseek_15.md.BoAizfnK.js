In the original statement, a man dressed in black is standing behind three other people dressed in red and black. This suggests a gathering or situation where multiple individuals are present, and the people might be dressed in similar or coordinated attire. Fashion choices can often be indicators of an event, celebration, or social function. For example, formal wear or coordinated colors might suggest a wedding, gala event, or some other themed gathering.  However, the sentence does not explicitly provide information on the setting, purpose, or nature of the gathering. The mention of people in an unspecified location does not necessarily confirm that they are at a party or social event. They could potentially be at a photoshoot, in a waiting area, or even participating in some other form of shared activity. Moving on to the sentence, \\"Some people are socializing at a party,\\" it can be considered a plausible assumption, given the presence of a group of individuals in apparently coordinated attire.

They were preserved in amber found in western Canada, researchers led by Ryan C. McKellar of the University of Alberta report in Friday's edition of the journal Science.      Amber, hardened tree resin, preserved a mixture of feathers from 70 million years ago. Other feathers contained in amber dating to 90 million years ago are less diverse.      Specimens include simple filament structures similar to the earliest feathers of non-flying dinosaurs _ a form unknown in modern birds _ and more complicated bird feathers \\"displaying pigmentation and adaptations for flight and diving,\\" the researchers reported.      Indications of feathers have been found on much older fossils, and the new discoveries indicate feathers continued to develop into modern form before the extinction of dinosaurs, explained Norell, who was not part of the research team.      A separate report by Roy A. Wogelius of the University of Manchester, England, published online June 30 by Science, reports the finding of trace metals in feather fossils, suggesting their colors included black, brown and a reddish-brown.      \\"Despite many reports over the past decade of feathered dinosaurs and new birds from China, only now are we beginning to understand just how diverse feather types were\\" millions of years ago, Norell said.      ___      http://www.sciencemag.org ||||| A trove of ancient feathers both primitive and complex is providing scientists with an unprecedented snapshot of what some dinosaurs and birds looked like during the Cretaceous period.            An account published online Thursday in the journal Science describes a host of feathers and feather-like filaments found in western Canada. The structures were ensconced in 70-million-year-old amber.      Taken together, the feathers and filaments point to the diversity of this prehistoric plumed menagerie, said study coauthor Alexander Wolfe, a paleoecologist at the University of Alberta in Canada.            \\"The simplest feathers are of greatest interest because these protofeathers have been inferred to be the evolutionary precedent to evolved feathers,\\" Wolfe said in an interview with The Times.            Scientists have posited that feathers developed first as single, hair-like protrusions meant for insulation, then began to grow in clumps, and then as increasingly complex structures. At some point, they were probably used for other purposes (such as attracting mates), and later for flight.            Many of the samples described in the study accurately match one of those stages. Some feathers even had coiled barbules, similar to those that have evolved on modern birds such as sandgrouses, which allow the animals to transport water to the nest to cool their incubating eggs.            \\"We never thought we'd have fossils to show all these feathers, from primitive stage-one [protofeathers] to feathers of modern aspect,\\" Mark Norell, chairman of the division of paleontology at the American Museum of the Natural History, said in an interview with The Times.

Credit: Science ||||| By Hans Villarica      Protofeather fossils discovered entombed in amber from the Late Cretaceous era support theories of dinosaur and avian evolution -- and make for one beautiful gallery      Dinosaur and bird feathers preserved in amber from a Late Cretaceous site in Canada reveal new insights into the structure, function, and color of animals that date back to about 78 million years ago.      Researchers led by University of Alberta paleontologist Ryan McKellar say these specimens represent distinct stages of feather evolution, from early-stage, single filament protofeathers to much more complex structures associated with modern diving birds. After analyzing the preserved pigment cells, the authors add that these feathered creatures may have also had a range of transparent, mottled, and diffused colors, similar to birds today. They can't determine which feathers belonged to birds or dinosaurs yet, but they did observe filament structures that are similar to those seen in other non-avian dinosaur fossils. Their findings appear in the current issue of the journal Science.      In the gallery below, with captions from McKellar, marvel at the beauty of these amber-preserved feathers. Then, in the Q&A that follows, learn more about how amber preservation works, the science of feather evolution, and the possibility of Jurassic Park-type experiments down the line.      How significant is this discovery?      This discovery is a pretty significant find. It supports a model for the evolution of feathers that has previously relied on compression fossils that are difficult to interpret and have been hotly debated.      Also, the amber-entombed feathers show that some of the most primitive feather types, also known as protofeathers, were still around just before the dinosaurs went extinct. They existed alongside feathers that are nearly identical to those of modern birds. Given what we know about the animals that were alive in the area at the time, it is reasonable to suggest that the protofeather-like specimens are attributable to dinosaurs and are the first specimens of this type of feather to be recovered from amber.      How does amber preservation work exactly?      Preservation in amber can vary quite a bit among deposits. Amber tends to preserve specimens in great detail because tree resin has antibacterial and drying properties that partially mummify inclusions and slow the initial onslaught of decay. Over many years, the resin polymerizes, turning into a plastic-like substance that is quite resilient, but burial usually results in heating that can have a profound effect on the inclusions over the span of millions of years.      The Canadian amber insect inclusions are largely preserved as hollow voids in the amber, with a thin film of carbonized, coal-like material, where the outside of the insect once was. The feathers appear to have fared much better, because they are fine and are not composed of material that decay easily. That said, many of the specimens show signs of partial decay, and there is no indication of how much, if any, original material remains intact.      What's the backstory of these specimens?      What originally got me interested in this project was a single feather fragment trapped in a spider web that had been given to Dr. Brian Chatterton. For my Ph.D. project, I worked on tiny, less than three millimeter, parasitic wasps trapped within amber from the same deposit. As part of this project I was able to go through the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology collection of 3,000 or so inclusions in great detail. After finding a lot of feather fragments in this collection, I had the good fortune of meeting the Leuck family, amateur collectors in southern Alberta, who donated a pair of additional specimens to the University of Alberta. Later, we learned that Dr. Philip Currie was also examining a trio of specimens from the deposit. We pooled the material, creating a surprisingly rich snapshot of feathers in the Late Cretaceous.      This project underlines the importance of maintaining museum collections as well as the role that interested amateurs can play in palaeontology. Without these, there is no way that we would have been able to observe these important specimens.      According to your paper, these feathers represent several distinct stages of feather evolution. Could you explain each stage briefly?      The evolutionary-developmental model is an attempt to explain how the transition from small hair-like feathers to modern feathers with multiple tiers of branching occurred. A quick account of modern feather anatomy would go like this: Feathers have a central shaft called the rachis. Off of this shaft branch the tufts, which in turn branch off into small structures called barbules that are segmented like bamboo shoots.      Stage 1 consists of individual filaments that are comparable to hair in terms of overall appearance. Stage 2 consists of multiple filaments that arise from a single base, forming barbs. Stage 3 is where feathers become branched structures, either by forming segmented barbules on their barbs or by forming barbs on their central shaft, the rachis, and then combining these features to make two tiers of branching. Stage 4 is where the barbules on each side of the barb were altered to connect barbs together and form a sheet or vaned feather. Stage 5 encompasses a wide range of finer alterations that actually permit powered flight and a wide range of additional uses for feathers.      The notion of dinosaur specimens preserved in amber reminds me of Jurassic Park. Would what happened in that movie be plausible? What can we look forward to learning?      Put simply, no. The specimens that we examined are extremely small and would not be expected to contain any DNA material. To put this into context, the only genetic material that has been recovered from amber is from lumps of mummified insect muscle tissue in much younger Dominican amber that are approximately 17 million years old and well after the age of dinosaurs.      If we are able to obtain more material, we would really like to examine the chemical makeup of the protofeather-like specimens, as well as the pigments found within these specimens and other feathers. It would then be possible to investigate how much of the original feather material remains intact and gain a better understanding of the feathers' colors.      Unfortunately, these investigations rely on being able to create small breaks within some of the specimens and examine them under very high magnifications, such as scanning electron microscopy, so they are not possible with the limited number of specimens that are currently available. A larger collection may also allow us to verify some of the other stages in feather evolution. ||||| Photo      Color is coming to the formerly black-and-white Mesozoic world of dinosaurs and early birds.      Not exactly high-definition color, and some formidable characters may show up in the same old drab and scaly wardrobes; they are dinosaurs, after all, with a reputation for resistance to change. But in time, you can look for splashes of color in museum dioramas of feathered figures from the age of dinosaurs.      For more than a decade, hardly a season has passed without more discoveries of dinosaur and bird fossils in China bearing impressions of feathers and traces of chemical coloring agents. Now, in Canada, paleontologists have found 70-million-year-old amber preserving 11 specimens showing a wide diversity of feather types at that time.      One specimen of so-called proto-feathers had a single bristlelike filament and some simple clusters. Others were complex structures with hooklike barbules that act like Velcro; in modern birds, this keeps feathers in place during dives. Still other specimens revealed feather patterns for flight and underwater diving.      Preserved pigment cells encased in the amber, along with other evidence, suggested that the feathered animals had an array of mottled patterns and diffuse colors like modern birds, scientists at the University of Alberta, led by Ryan C. McKellar, said in a report published Thursday in the journal Science.

A:","output":"To determine whether this review would increase or decrease the chances of buying the product, I will analyze the review step by step. Step 1: Read the review title - \\"I'm with David Swanson here...\\" This suggests that the reviewer agrees with someone named David Swanson, whose opinion is not provided in this context. As a result, it is ambiguous and does not immediately sway my opinion either way. Step 2: Examine the reviewer's writing - \\"...I found it tediously written, with the constant whiny self-references...\\" Based on this statement, the reviewer found the product (a book) to be poorly written and annoying. This would generally decrease the chances of me buying the product. Step 3: Consider the reviewer's experience - \\"In my experience, no book every helped any of my kids toilet train.\\" The reviewer states that no books, including this one, have helped with toilet training. This suggests that the reviewer had a negative experience with this book, decreasing the chances of me buying it. Step 4: Analyze the reviewer's expectations - \\"That's not Frankel's fault, but when I hear accolades, I at least expect a clever book, even if it didn't help in my particular case.\\" Here, the reviewer recognizes that the book's lack of help might not be the author's fault. They still expected a \\"clever book\\" due to the positive reviews, even if it didn't help with toilet training. Their expectations were not met, which further decreases my interest in the product. Conclusion: Based on this review, the chances of me buying the product would decrease. The reviewer found the writing tedious, the book unhelpful, and their expectations unmet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Options: - vending machine - pop - store - liquid - picnic cooler  Explain why a human would choose \\"liquid\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"liquid\\" as the answer to the question above because, among the given options, it is the state that accurately reflects the physical condition of the matter inside a can of soda. The question aims to identify the phase or state of matter that the content of a soda can exists in, and it is most fittingly described as a liquid. The other options provided are not relevant or accurate to the question.  - Vending machine: A vending machine is an apparatus used for the automatic dispensing of various consumer items, including canned sodas. While a can of soda can be found inside a vending machine, it doesn't describe the state of matter of the soda itself. The vending machine serves as a storage and distribution method, but it doesn't define the phase or state of matter of the contents inside the can. - Pop: Although \\"pop\\" can be a colloquial term for soda in some regions, it is not a suitable answer to the question because it does not describe the state of matter inside a soda can. Rather, it is an informal reference to the beverage itself. - Store: Similar to a vending machine, a store is a physical location where soda cans can be purchased. It doesn't provide any information regarding the state or condition of the matter inside the can but refers to the place where the cans can be found. - Picnic cooler: A picnic cooler represents another storage and transportation method for canned sodas. It serves as a way to keep the beverages cold and preserve their quality during outdoor activities or events. The picnic cooler describes an item that contains soda cans but doesn't answer the question about the state of matter of the soda. On the other hand, \\"liquid\\" accurately represents the state of matter inside a can of soda. Soda typically consists of water, various sweeteners, flavorings, carbon dioxide (which creates the fizzy nature or bubbles when dissolved in the liquid), and other additives. Collectively, these substances form a liquid mixture or solution, which corresponds to the liquid state of matter. In this state, the molecules of the soda have enough energy to move around, but not enough to break away from each other, thus making it a fluid rather than a solid or a gas. Therefore, a human would choose \\"liquid\\" to appropriately answer the question about the state of matter inside a can of soda."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: It is a novel that is probably more talked about than read. People think: \\"It's such a big book! It has such a serious theme!\\" The feeling that they are going to be taught a long, hard lesson often puts readers off. But really, War and Peace (1869), which tells the stories of five upper-class families in Russia at the time of the 1812 French invasion, is not to be missed. Reading this novel is one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences, like climbing the Great Wall: You will regret it if you do not try. Earlier this month, USA Today reported that a six-episode   War and Peace miniseries   produced by the BBC would air next year. With a complex plot and so many characters, readers unfamiliar with the work might be most interested in the characters from the financially-troubled Rostov family of Moscow. Count Rostov has four teenage children. Natasha is in love with Boris Drubetskoy, who is about to become an army officer. Nikolai Ilyich loves the poor Sonya, a ward   of the family, but his family is not happy with their relationship. The proud Vera is about to start a happy marriage with a German-Russian officer. The youngest Rostov is the 9-year-old Petya, who, like his brother Nikolai, has his heart set on fighting for his country. The lives of all are about to be changed by the upcoming great war that involves many other major characters of War and Peace, such as Prince Andrei, who goes into a military career partly in order to get away from his unhappy marriage to the socialite   Lise. The novel has a great reputation among many kinds of writers and millions of readers. US writer Ernest Hemingway wrote: \\"I don't know anybody who could write about war better than Tolstoy did.\\" A comment by the great 20th-century Russian short-story writer Isaak Babel shows the rich sense of history that Tolstoy's work conveys. \\"If the world itself could write, it would write like Tolstoy,\\" Babel commented.

A:","output":"The information provided in the paragraph focuses on the Moon's effect on tides and does not discuss the Sun's gravitational effect on different planets.

The farther away a planet is from the Sun, the weaker the gravitational effect. In the solar system, Mars and Mercury are located at different distances from the Sun, with Mercury being the closest planet to the Sun and Mars being the 4th planet. Mercury's average distance from the Sun is approximately 57.9 million kilometers (or 35.98 million miles). On the other hand, Mars is located at an average distance of 227.9 million kilometers (or 141.6 million miles) from the Sun.

The Oklahoma Land Rush, also known as the Oklahoma Land Run, began on April 22, 1889, when the federal government made available nearly two million acres of what was once Native American land to settlers. This event marked the first of several land rushes in Oklahoma, with others occurring in 1891, 1892, 1893, and 1895. The Oklahoma Land Rush of 1889 was the result of the passage of the Indian Appropriations Act on March 2, 1889, which allowed surplus, unassigned lands in Indian Territory to be opened up to white settlers. Prior to that, Oklahoma was predominantly inhabited by Native Americans who had been forcibly relocated to the territory through the Indian Removal Act of 1830 and subsequent land cessions. At the time, the federal government deemed these lands unsuitable for white settlement. However, growing pressure from would-be settlers and land speculators led to the opening of the Oklahoma Territory to non-Indian settlers. At noon on April 22, 1889, a cannon was fired, signaling the start of the land run, and an estimated 50,000 people raced to stake their claims on the available tracts of land, each of which was about 160 acres in size. Settlers traveled by every means available, from horseback and wagons to bicycles and trains, in the hope of securing a piece of the newly available land. This high-stakes event led to the creation of many towns and settlements virtually overnight, as people built homes, businesses, and infrastructure upon their newly claimed land. Oklahoma City, one of the most significant settlements established during the 1889 land run, grew from a small railroad station to a city of 4,000 residents in a single day. The Oklahoma Land Run of 1889 and the subsequent land runs were not without controversy and conflict. Native Americans were forced to relinquish more of their lands, and settlers often clashed with one another, resorting to violence and extralegal means to secure their claims. Furthermore, \\"Sooners\\" – those who entered the territory before the official start of the land run – caused additional tension, as they tried to lay claim to desirable land before others had a chance to do so legally. Though the Oklahoma Land Rush and related land runs are a significant part of American history and the development of the West, they also represent a chapter marked by the continued marginalization of Native American communities and the often harsh realities faced by those seeking a new life in the untamed territory. Today, Oklahoma still bears the marks of this tumultuous period, with many of its towns and cities owing their origins to the ambitious settlers who participated in the land runs."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The physical outcome of the surgery will depend upon how much tissue your surgeon removes. In some cases, muscle is also removed to prevent or remove cancerous tissue. Choices: 1). Pre-op surgery involves inserting a sterile scalpel into the bone beneath the breast and cutting away the additional tissue in the incision. Do not interrupt nursing during surgery and immediately clean any unused tissue.; 2). Begin eating solid foods shortly after surgery. As the surgeon removes the intervening cells, you'll begin experiencing stomach pain and discomfort.; 3). The surgery itself is routine and does not need to be done using regular equipment. The surgeon will inject a salicylic acid solution in the palm of your hand which you lie on a flat surface while doing the surgery.; 4).

The answer is","output":"\\"grill\\".  In the given passage, the narrator describes a familiar scene at their home when the father is around. The recurring theme of grilling emphasizes the distinctive presence and activity of the father when he is home. The passage states \\"she did n't even see her grill on the back porch\\" – which means not only is the father missing, but also a central aspect of his presence – grilling – is notably absent. It is natural to assume that the word intended to complete the phrase \\"she did n't see him or his _\\" is \\"grill\\". The passage describes that the protagonist expects to see her father engaged in one of his usual activities, which characteristically include grilling food. Thus, the absence of both her father and the grill on the back porch signifies that her father is not at home. This realization prompts her to recall the importance of the grill and the memories associated with it, which have become integral to her understanding of her father's presence at home.

What would be the first thing you would set foot on? The beach, naturally. There are hundreds of miles of beaches on the twenty islands of Hawaii. These islands cover 1,600 miles and are about 2,300 miles west of California. Most of them are covered with fine white sand. They are thought to be among the finest beaches in the world. Another wonderful thing about the beaches of Hawaii is the water temperature. The year-round average  temperature of the water at the famous Waikiki Beach is 230C! The same is true of air temperature. In fact, there are no real seasons in Hawaii. There is a difference of only two or three degrees between the hottest day of summer and the coldest day of winter. That's why the Hawaiians don't have a word for weather in their language. Perhaps the nicest thing about Hawaiian beaches are the waves. The earliest settlers   in Hawaii, the Polynesians, quickly learned how much fun it was to ride the waves. They developed a sport which is now very popular on the islands called body surfing. You go out into the ocean, wait for a big wave to come towards you, jump on it, and ride it all the way to the beach. Now imagine once again that you are the first person ever to set foot in Hawaii. What do you think would be the second beautiful thing you would notice? Would it be those strange triangles   rising out of the water hundreds and hundreds of meters high? What are those beautiful things? They are volcanoes  , of course. These volcanoes are not just a part of the islands. They made the islands at first. Because of them the islands are still growing. The most famous volcano on Hawaii is Mauna Loa. It is the world's most active volcano. It has been erupting   for thousands of years. Even when it isn't erupting, smoke comes out of the earth from a thousand little holes. In 1950 Mauna Loa erupted for twenty-three days. That erupting produced the greatest amount of lava   in modern history. In 1960 it erupted again. That time it added a... Question: It can be inferred that   _   according to the passage. - volcanoes are more active because the area of the island is enlarging - the visitors to Hawaii can probably see more than one active volcano - Mauna Loa is the tallest mountain in the world because it has erupted so often - people in Hilo are sure that more visitors will come because of volcanoes A:","output":"The visitors to Hawaii can probably see more than one active volcano according to the passage.

Leckey says it was made with \\"found footage, a lot of which is pirated\\", which he has used to create \\"a false memoir\\". Speaking to BBC Front Row the 52-year-old says it is an attempt to \\"approximate my past, my autobiography through everything that I could find\\" and deal with something that his generation knows well, the feeling of being caught between \\"the analogue and the digital world\\" and having their pasts resurrected as \\"collective memory\\" online. \\"I'm not the only one who talks about [the internet] being haunted - it feels spooky,\\" he says. \\"There's something uncanny about it, to find all these memories that you've carried around your whole life. \\"You can get stuff from YouTube and Vimeo, on DVD - all that stuff is available now [along with] the software to be able to rip that stuff and put it on your hard drive. \\"Basically, in the work, I'm saying these things affected me in this way, did they have the same effect on you? \\"It's a piece of rhetoric.\\" That hope, to find \\"some kind of connection\\" between the artist and his audience is underlined by the setting for the work, in a room down a \\"disorientating\\" corridor at a club.

He says he is drawn back to the subject again and again because of a desire to produce the \\"same state\\" in a gallery as one might experience on a dance floor. \\"There is a quote I always use from [Victorian essayist] Walter Pater, that 'all art aspires towards the condition of music'. \\"What I want from art is that same state, that same ecstatic state. \\"I want to be lost.

Q:Information:  - Worsted (or ) is a high-quality type of wool yarn, the fabric made from this yarn, and a yarn weight category. The name derives from Worstead, a village in the English county of Norfolk. That village, together with North Walsham and Aylsham, formed a manufacturing centre for yarn and cloth in the 12th century, when pasture enclosure and liming rendered the East Anglian soil too rich for the older agrarian sheep breeds. In the same period, many weavers from Flanders moved to Norfolk. \\"Worsted\\" yarns/fabrics are distinct from woollens (though both are made from sheep's wool): the former is considered stronger, finer, smoother, and harder than the latter.  - Aylsham is a historic market town and civil parish on the River Bure in north Norfolk, England, about north of Norwich. The river rises near Melton Constable, upstream from Aylsham and continues to Great Yarmouth and the North Sea, although it was only made navigable after 1779, allowing grain, coal and timber to be brought up river.  - Gautam Hari Singhania (born 9 September 1965) is an Indian Industrialist.

James has  a personal problem with is Algebra teacher, but loves his history teacher because the","output":"history teacher has a unique way of making the subject come alive. James often finds himself lost in his teacher's stories about significant historical events and people. His history teacher, Mr. Adams, is a passionate storyteller, and his love for history is contagious. Despite James's deep appreciation for Mr. Adams, he struggles with his Algebra teacher, Mrs. Johnson. Mrs. Johnson's teaching style is more rigid and disciplined, and James finds it difficult to keep up with the pace of her classes. He feels overwhelmed by the material and, as a result, his confidence diminishes. The problem isn't that James doesn't have an aptitude for math; rather, it's the vastly different teaching styles between his favorite teacher and the one he struggles with. James's interest in history has grown to a level where he feels a burning desire to learn more about the past. As a result, he spends most of his free time in the library, devouring historical books and documentaries recommended by Mr. Adams. The more he learns, the more he starts to view history as a vast tapestry of interconnected events and protagonists. At this point, history is no longer a series of static dates and events for James, but a living, breathing story that continues to unfold in the present day. Meanwhile, his relationship with his algebra teacher remains strained. He senses her frustration with his lack of progress and struggles to meet her expectations. Nevertheless, James has a determination to improve his algebra skills, but he can't shake the feeling that he'll never be able to truly master this subject. As the end of the school semester approaches, the pressure mounts. James is acutely aware that his grades in algebra will impact his overall academic standing and potentially his future opportunities. He decides to seek help, determined to put forth the effort to improve not only his algebra skills but also his relationship with Mrs. Johnson. To address his difficulties, James starts attending after-school tutoring sessions with Mrs. Johnson. He puts in extra hours outside the classroom, working diligently on his homework and algebra exercises. As he begins to see progress, James starts to perceive the beauty and logic within mathematical equations, much like how he sees the intricate connections in history. Over time, the one-on-one tutoring strategy helps break down the communication barriers between James and Mrs. Johnson. She begins to recognize James's sincere efforts, and her patience and understanding grow. As they work together, Mrs. Johnson adapts her teaching style to James's unique learning needs, and he begins to view her less as a strict instructor and more as a helpful guide. As James's algebra skills continue to improve, he discovers a surprising connection between his love for history and his newfound appreciation for math. He begins to understand that mathematics is a kind of language that can express and explain the workings of the world around him. This realization bridges the gap between the two subjects he once thought were disconnected. By the end of the school year, James has managed to transform his relationship with both algebra and Mrs. Johnson. He earns a respectable grade in her class, and she commends him for his hard work and dedication. James, in turn, thanks her for helping him see the value and beauty of mathematics. From this experience, James not only learns the importance of perseverance but also the true meaning of adaptability. He realizes that, much like the history he loves, life is full of unexpected challenges and surprises. Sometimes, adding a new perspective to what seems like an insurmountable problem can reveal a solution that was there all along. In the end, it's not just about learning facts and figures or equations and formulas; it's about understanding the interconnectedness of all things, both in history and daily life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is a significant departure from the European university system, where degrees are awarded by the institution. The concept of receiving a degree from a madrasa is recognized as the \\"ijazah\\" system in the Islamic scholarly tradition. The ijazah system comprised of a student studying under a specific teacher, who would evaluate and determine the student's mastery of the subject matter. The ijazah, which is a certificate or written testimony, would then be granted by this teacher to the student upon successful completion and mastery of the subject. This ijazah specified the subjects and texts that the student had studied and recognized the student as an authority on the given subject, allowing them to teach and share their knowledge with others.  Ijazahs were given for various fields of study, such as Islamic law, theology, grammar, literature, and more. The relationship between the student and teacher was essential, as the student's reputation, credibility, and authority relied on the teacher's recognition and endorsement. Furthermore, the teacher's credentials were also critical, as their scholarly lineage and connections could substantially influence the value of the ijazah being granted. While the ijazah system in Islamic madrasahs may bear some resemblance to the European university system, it differs in that the authority and recognition come from individual teachers rather than a centralized institution. The granting of ijazahs was a more flexible and personalized system, which allowed scholars to study across numerous madrasahs, build strong networks, and maintain diverse scholarly lineages."},{"instruction":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks.  Question: \\"The Algarve has approximately how many miles of coast line?\\" Answer: \\"No coast line\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"No, this answer is not correct. The correct answer is that the Algarve has approximately 100 miles (160 kilometers) of coastline."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The sentence you provided is in Finnish, and it translates to a statement expressing the firm conviction of both the Council and the Commission in their ability to make knowledgeable decisions. The Council and the Commission are likely referring to political or administrative entities in Finland or Europe, such as the European Council and the European Commission, responsible for key decision-making processes within their respective jurisdictions. The European Council, for example, is an institution comprised of the heads of state or government of EU member countries, the President of the European Council, and the President of the European Commission. Its primary role is to define the general political direction and priorities of the European Union (EU). The Council meets at least twice every six months, and the leaders gather to discuss and address current challenges and opportunities facing the EU. Their conclusions serve as guidelines for developing EU legislation and policies. The European Commission, on the other hand, is the EU's executive body responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, enforcing EU law, and representing the EU internationally. Its main goals are to ensure that the interests of the EU as a whole are carried out, and that EU legislation and policies are properly enforced. The Commission comprises of 27 members, one from each EU country, each of whom has a specific portfolio (e.g., economics, environment, or technology). Collectively, they are responsible for making informed judgments and recommendations based on their expertise. The statement indicates that both institutions strongly believe they possess the necessary knowledge and experience to make the best decisions for their respective areas of responsibility. While they might contribute a wealth of expertise and have access to valuable information, it is also important to recognize that collaboration, consultation, and incorporating diverse perspectives from other stakeholders are crucial in making well-rounded, effective decisions.

Premise: \\"Moreover, the researchers found that a significant portion of higher-income households save little.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The higher income households save all their money.\\"?","output":"If the premise \\"Moreover, the researchers found that a significant portion of higher-income households save little\\" is true, then it has important implications on the hypothesis \\"The higher income households save all their money.\\"  First, let's analyze the premise. The statement is claiming that researchers have identified that a significant portion of higher-income households do not save a substantial part of their income. This could mean that these households may have other priorities or expenses that prevent them from saving a considerable amount of their income. This could be due to multiple factors, such as lifestyle choices, high living costs, financial commitments, or personal preferences. Now, let's evaluate the hypothesis. The hypothesis \\"The higher income households save all their money\\" implies that households with higher incomes save the entirety of their income. However, this seems to contradict the premise which states that a significant portion of higher-income households save little of their income. Consequently, if the premise is true, the hypothesis would not hold in all cases as it generalizes that all higher-income households save all of their money. Based on the conflict between the premise and the hypothesis, we can deduce the following conclusions: 1. The hypothesis \\"The higher income households save all their money\\" is too general and does not account for the diverse financial habits and behaviors observed among higher-income households.  2. The premise provides insight into the savings behavior of a significant portion of higher-income households, suggesting that their savings habits might not solely be linked to their higher income levels, but could also be influenced by other factors mentioned above. 3. It is important to consider the exceptions, different scenarios, and financial choices that individual households make when discussing subjects such as savings behavior. Generalizing based on income level might lead to inaccurate assumptions. In conclusion, assuming the premise is true, it directly contradicts the hypothesis \\"The higher income households save all their money.\\" While it may be tempting to assume that people with higher incomes save all their money, the premise suggests that savings behaviors are more complex and influenced by a variety of factors. Therefore, the hypothesis would not be factual or accurate in representing the savings habits of all higher-income households. Instead, it is essential to recognize the diversity in financial behaviors and acknowledge that savings habits can significantly vary among households, regardless of their income levels."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

From Darwin's study of the Galapagos and Wallace's study of Indonesia, islands have played an important role in evolutionary investigations, and radiations within archipelagos are readily interpreted as supporting the conventional view of allopatric speciation. Even during the ongoing paradigm shift towards other modes of speciation, island radiations, such as the Lesser Antillean anoles, are thought to exemplify this process. Geological and molecular phylogenetic evidence show that, in this archipelago, Martinique anoles provide several examples of secondary contact of island species. Four precursor island species, with up to 8 mybp divergence, met when their islands coalesced to form the current island of Martinique. Moreover, adjacent anole populations also show marked adaptation to distinct habitat zonation, allowing both allopatric and ecological speciation to be tested in this system. We take advantage of this opportunity of replicated island coalescence and independent ecological adaptation to carry out an extensive population genetic study of hypervariable neutral nuclear markers to show that even after these very substantial periods of spatial isolation these putative allospecies show less reproductive isolation than conspecific populations in adjacent habitats in all three cases of subsequent island coalescence. The degree of genetic interchange shows that while there is always a significant genetic signature of past allopatry, and this may be quite strong if the selection regime allows, there is no case of complete allopatric speciation, in spite of the strong primae facie case for it. Importantly there is greater genetic isolation across the xeric/rainforest ecotone than is associated with any secondary contact. This rejects the development of reproductive isolation in allopatric divergence, but supports the potential for ecological speciation, even though full speciation has not been achieved in this case. It also explains the paucity of anole species in the Lesser Antilles compared to the Greater Antilles.","output":"Task: Generate a title for an article discussing the study of evolutionary investigations on islands, specifically focusing on the Lesser Antillean anoles and the speciation processes in the island of Martinique.

Title: Never Say Never Again Movie plot: After MI6 agent James Bond, 007, fails a routine training exercise, his superior, M, orders Bond to a health clinic outside London to get back into shape. While there, Bond witnesses a mysterious nurse named Fatima Blush giving a sadomasochistic beating to a patient in a nearby room. The man's face is bandaged and after Blush finishes her beating, Bond sees the patient using a machine which scans his eye. Bond is seen by Blush and an attempt is subsequently made to kill him in the clinic gym, but Bond manages to defeat the assassin. Blush and her charge, a United States Air Force pilot named Jack Petachi, are operatives of SPECTRE, a criminal organisation run by Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Petachi has undergone an operation on his right eye to make it match the retinal pattern of the US President, which he uses to circumvent iris recognition security at an American military base in England. While doing so, he replaces the dummy warheads of two cruise missiles with live nuclear warheads; SPECTRE then steals the warheads, intending to extort billions of dollars from NATO governments. Blush murders Petachi to cover SPECTRE's tracks. Under orders from the Prime Minister, M reluctantly reactivates the double-0 section and Bond is assigned the task of tracking down the missing weapons.

In the 1970s I was a student nurse in psychiatry. I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been. It is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life. Her name is not common, but every so often I meet people with the same name and ask them if they know of a relative to whom this happened, but, so far, no-one has known of her. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: The narrating nurse probably believes that: Options: - Connie was worth defending before she took action - not enough information - Connie will report the then impatient nurse for pouring cold water on her - Connie will come back one day to thank her The answer to this question is:","output":"Connie was worth defending before she took action"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Generate a 3-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.gpl.rpg.AndorsTrail. The answer is:","output":"Title: Room for Improvement, but Not Wrong on All Fronts - A 3-star Review  App: Andor's Trail by com.gpl.rpg.AndorsTrail Rating: ★★★☆☆ When downloading a new app, it's always with the hope of discovering a hidden gem. Unfortunately, I would not consider com.gpl.rpg.AndorsTrail, Andor's Trail, to be one of those sparkling finds, although it does sparkle in some respects. This open-source single-player RPG (Role-Playing Game) aims to provide immersive gameplay. While it does achieve that to an extent, there are many areas where it falls short. However, it's definitely not all doom and gloom either. Therefore, my decision to award a 3-star rating comes with various nuanced opinions, some of which I will now elaborate on. Firstly, the graphics. The retro pixel-art aesthetic of Andor's Trail appealed to me. For individuals like myself who have a nostalgic love for 1990s RPGs, the visual design of this app was charming. Employing the 'old school' pixel-art style gave the game a vintage, soothing touch. Furthermore, the characters are well-designed, and the game environments like forests, towns, and dungeons bring back memories of classic games.  Subsequently, the storyline and quest design captivated my interest. The main storyline is linear, yet well planned and intriguing. It contains enough twists and turns to propel the plot forward and keep players engaged. I appreciated the mini-quests peppered throughout the game; it made the world feel alive and dynamic. However, where we start to see a misstep is the overall user interaction and controls. In my opinion, the controls are rigid and antiquated, making for an app experience that feels clumsy at times. There's a disproportionate amount of time spent on navigation, as moving your character across the screen can be a slow and sometimes frustrating affair. This becomes particularly noticeable when the enemies are in pursuit.  Another drawback to Andor's Trail is the lack of multiplayer functionality. While it's common for RPGs to be single-player, the addition of a multiplayer option could significantly enhance the app's appeal. It would be an intriguing prospect to have direct interaction with other players, jointly solve quests, or enter friendly competitions. The speed of level progression in Andor's Trail could also pose some challenges. While the slow progression might appeal to those who prefer meticulously planned strategizing, it can be deemed cumbersome by those desiring fast-paced action and rapid leveling-up. Additionally, I encountered a few technical bugs and a tendency for the app to crash periodically. These issues, while not catastrophic, are certainly frustrating and disrupt the overall gaming experience.  Not to overshadow all of its positive aspects, the inquisitive minds would be pleased by the open-source nature of the project. It enables developers to readily engage with the code base, initiate modifications, and even suggest improvements.  In conclusion, Andor's Trail has a definite charm with its vintage pixel-art style and interesting storyline, but it gets weighed down by control issues, lack of multiplayer option, slow progression, and minor bugs. Steps to fix these issues could elevate it from a middling choice to an essential pick for any RPG gaming aficionado. For now, it stands firmly in the realm of the average with a three-star rating.  Still, with its open-source status, Andor's Trail holds the potential to grow and evolve, and I would be more than willing to revisit this review should future updates rectify some of my grievances."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 2: Researching the nuclear weapon policy To find the name of this policy, I will gather information on nuclear weapon policies and check whether they match the description given. Step 3: Finding the matching policy After researching, I find out that the policy that matches the given description is the \\"No First Use\\" (NFU) policy. Step 4: Explaining the NFU policy The \\"No First Use\\" policy is a pledge by a country possessing nuclear weapons that they will not be the first to use them in a conflict, but will rather use them only in response to a nuclear attack. Step 5: Providing context about China, India, and North Korea accepting the policy, Russia dropping it, and NATO rejecting it. China declared its NFU policy in 1964 during the Cold War to reduce tensions and the possibility of a nuclear escalation. India followed this policy when it became a nuclear weapon state, and North Korea also adopted the NFU policy. Russia had an NFU policy during the Soviet Union era, but dropped it after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1993, instead opting for a more assertive nuclear strategy. NATO, on multiple occasions, has rejected the NFU policy as it has preferred to maintain strategic ambiguity regarding the use of its nuclear arsenal to deter potential adversaries. In conclusion, the nuclear weapon policy first declared by China in 1964, later adopted by India and North Korea, dropped by Russia in 1993, and has been rejected repeatedly by NATO is the \\"No First Use\\" policy."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"The two questions you've asked are significantly different from each other, focusing on two distinct aspects of Jewish history and practice. Let's break them down: 1. 'How did the Jews respond to Roman rule?' The Jewish response to Roman rule, which began in Jerusalem around 63 BCE, varied greatly depending on the specific time and circumstances. During the initial period of Roman control, the kingdom was a client state, and the Jews had a measure of autonomy. There were, of course, periods of unrest, along with continual tension between the mostly pagan Romans and the monotheistic Jews. This tension eventually led to the Great Revolt in 66 CE after a series of political and religious conflicts. The revolt was brutally crushed, culminating in the Siege of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. This event is a significant and traumatic part of Jewish history, marking the beginning of the Jewish diaspora. A second major revolt, the Bar Kokhba Revolt, from 132-136 CE, led to more devastation and death, making clear that the Romans would not easily tolerate rebellion. After the failure of the Bar Kokhba Revolt, many Jews were sold into slavery, killed, or exiled. On the other hand, despite escalating tensions and open revolts, there were also periods of relative peace and stability during Roman rule. There was a degree of cultural exchange between Romans and Jews. Some Jews in the Diaspora even became Roman citizens and reached a high social status. 2. 'Has anybody been converted to Judaism?' Yes, throughout history, there have indeed been many converts to Judaism. People of different backgrounds, cultures, and nationalities have embraced Jewish faith and culture. The process of conversion is guided by Jewish law (Halakhah) and involves rigorous study, lifestyle changes, and rites of initiation. In the Bible, the most notable convert is Ruth, the Moabite woman who married into the Jewish faith and became the great-grandmother of King David. Over the centuries, there have been numerous instances of both individuals and groups choosing to convert. In modern times, each branch of Judaism (Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, etc.) has its own criteria and processes for conversion. Generally, conversion to Judaism involves religious study and practice, including learning Hebrew, studying Jewish law and customs, participation in Jewish life, and adherence to Jewish dietary restrictions. Therefore, while both questions pertain to Jewish history and culture, they investigate vastly distinct aspects. The first question addresses the sociopolitical history and conflicts of a specific era, and the second question focuses on a religious practice and personal decision continuing from antiquity to the current day."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So, he decided to take that idea to the extreme in 2007, writing a program that automatically tweets one word every half-hour, the Washington Post reported last month. Of course, the feed’s 96,000 followers took each word and ran with it. “To have people see a word in their Twitter feed and then riff off of it or to use it as the basis to make jokes with friends, that’s a big vindication for people who care both about language and technology,” Parrish says. (The second most-retweeted word? \\"Weed.\\") As the words come from an unsourced list Parrish found online, he acknowledges that the feed has probably missed some words, \\"but that’s the point,\\" he says. \\"There’s an implied commentary there—it’s satirical in that it’s trying to do something impossible.\\" No word on what, if anything, Parrish will do with the handle next, but he says he plans to stay awake into the wee hours to see the last word go out.

Empty the container of its contents. Wash and dry the inside. Using a flexible measuring tape or ribbon, measure the container so you can wrap it with the right amount of paper or fabric.  Measure the circumference of the container; write down the measurement, adding one or two centimeters for overlap allowance.  Measure the height of the container and write it down. This is what will turn your can from a boring food container to an attractive, personalized money box.  Choose or cut out a piece of paper or fabric large enough to wrap all the way around the container. Lay the paper or fabric face-down on your cutting surface. After tracing out the rectangle, cut it from the paper or fabric using the outline as a guide. Once the rectangle is cut, wrap it around the container to make sure it fits properly. If it’s too large, trim it down to size. If it’s too small, begin again with a new piece of paper or fabric. Before securing the paper or fabric to the container, lay it down right side up and write or draw any of the decorations you plan to use. It will be significantly easier to perform this step while the paper or fabric is lying flat than when it’s wrapped around the container. After the paper or fabric is secure, add any additional decorations you may want. At this stage, you can add decorations like buttons, ribbons, jewels, etc. Use hot glue if the decoration is heavy or won’t stay in place with regular glue.","output":"This article talks about making a pretty money box using an empty can with a plastic lid, like a nut container.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Why don't Jehovah's Witnesses believe in multiple religious teachings?\\"  Context: \\"Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the Bible condemns the mixing of religions, on the basis that there can only be one truth from God, and therefore reject interfaith and ecumenical movements. They believe that only their religion represents true Christianity, and that other religions fail to meet all the requirements set by God and will soon be destroyed. Jehovah's Witnesses are taught that it is vital to remain \\"separate from the world.\\" The Witnesses' literature defines the \\"world\\" as \\"the mass of mankind apart from Jehovah's approved servants\\" and teach that it is morally contaminated and ruled by Satan. Witnesses are taught that association with \\"worldly\\" people presents a \\"danger\\" to their faith, and are instructed to minimize social contact with non-members to better maintain their own standards of morality.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Jehovah's Witnesses, as a distinct religious group, have a unique set of beliefs that separate them from other Christian denominations and religious faiths. One of the central tenets in their doctrine is the belief in the absolute authority of the Bible as God's inspired word. According to their interpretation, the Bible condemns the mixing of religious teachings and practices, emphasizing that there can be only one truth from God. As a result, they reject the ideas of interfaith cooperation, ecumenical movements, and the blending of religious doctrines. The primary reason Jehovah's Witnesses do not believe in multiple religious teachings is their strict adherence to the concept of monotheism. They firmly believe in the existence of a single, all-powerful God, Jehovah, and that he has clearly communicated his expectations and instructions to humanity through the Bible. As they consider the Bible to be the ultimate source of divine authority and moral guidance, Jehovah's Witnesses claim that it provides a clear and unerring path to salvation for those who choose to follow its teachings. This strict interpretation of the Bible leads Jehovah's Witnesses to adopt an exclusivist stance in matters of religious belief and practice. They contend that their organization alone represents true Christianity and that other religions, including other Christian denominations, fail to meet the exacting standards set forth by God. Consequently, they believe that these other faiths are under the influence of Satan and are, therefore, false and harmful to one's spiritual welfare. Another reason Jehovah's Witnesses do not believe in multiple religious teachings is their conviction that the end times are imminent and that only their adherents will be saved from the impending destruction. They teach that all other religious groups and their followers, unfaithful to the true teachings of the Bible, will ultimately be destroyed by God. This apocalyptic worldview reinforces their commitment to remain \\"separate from the world\\" and avoid adopting beliefs or practices that deviate from their understanding of biblical truth. Additionally, Jehovah's Witnesses emphasize the importance of maintaining moral purity and avoiding the corrupting influences of \\"worldly\\" people and ideas. They define the \\"world\\" as the mass of mankind apart from their approved community and consider it to be morally contaminated and under the control of Satan. To preserve their faith and moral integrity, Jehovah's Witnesses are encouraged to minimize social contact with those outside of their religion. This separation further reinforces their unwillingness to accept or engage with multiple religious teachings. In summary, Jehovah's Witnesses do not believe in multiple religious teachings due to their strict interpretation of the Bible, belief in monotheism, exclusivist stance, apocalyptic worldview, and commitment to maintaining moral purity by remaining separate from the \\"world.\\" Driven by these core beliefs, they reject interfaith cooperation, ecumenical movements, and the blending of religious doctrines, as they see them as contrary to God's commandments and harmful to their path towards salvation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

My boyfriend and I came here with a reservation on a Friday night around 6:30.  We were seated right away in the dark downstairs dining room, where the walls are lined with wood, and the wood is lined with wine bottles.  Our seating was comfortable, and not too close to the table next to us (relief).  The restaurant didn't seem incredibly busy - comfortably populated, but a few empty tables scattered around.  You might not even need a reservation.  Our server was very casual, in his dress and demeanor (jeans and black button downs seem to be the uniform).  His interactions with us were a little lax, a little moreso than I expected, given that it's a somewhat pricey joint, but he was knowledgeable and happy to give recommendations, which is always appreciated.  The menu changes daily, so there are no specials.  Everything is a special, in that sense.  The wine list, printed on the back, was absolutely delightful since almost every bottle can be ordered in a taster portion, a half glass, a full glass, or a bottle.  Lovely!  I ordered three tasters throughout the evening, and it was such a fun experience.  We drank white with our appetizers, red for dinner, and sparkling for dessert.  I was never too drunk or too full of wine, the price was great, the taster portions were more generous than I expected, and I got to try five kinds of wine.  Hard to beat.  We had a Montravel from Spain, which my boyfriend loved, and their Riesling, which I loved.  Both wines were flavorful and unique, and it was a truly great experience to have excellent wine again, compared to our usual bottles purchased cheaply from the store.  Our appetizers were the Mac and Cheese (goat cheese, local sausage, and a fried egg in the dish), and the Stuffed Poblano Peppers.  The Mac 'n' Cheese was good, creamy but not too heavy, and the pasta was orzo which was fun.  But the Peppers  - just to die for.  To.  Die.  They had been roasted, it seems, or grilled, and were filled with the most flavorful housemade pork sausage.  We were both bowled over.  If this is on the menu, don't miss it.  Their sausage is the real deal.  Next we got two tasters of red, the Cotes-du-Rhone and something else....also very uniquely flavored and rich wines.  Our entrees were the Suckling Pig and the Hanger Steak.  The steak was my favorite - cooked to a delightful medium rare and served with roasted potatoes and rutabegas, it was simple and unpretentious.  Great beef flavor, nothing too intrusive or unusual.  Just high quality food.  The pig was good as well - the texture was divine, soft and reminiscent of pulled pork only better.  The sweet potato mash alongside was great.  My only complaint was the sauce was, in my opinion, too salty.  Anything it touched became too salty, and the sweet potato mash was needed to cut through that sodium taste.  I think it bothered me more than it bothered my boyfriend.  We absolutely finished both plates, practically licking them clean, but I'd watch out for that sauce if you're sensitive to salt.  For dessert I had a glass of moscato, sweet and lovely, and we split the \\"peanut butter ice cream sandwich\\" which seemed more like a peanut butter pie, but who's complaining?  It was very good and a great end to the meal.  All this for about 75.  The way they price their wines makes all the difference, and a great meal instantly becomes much more affordable than you'd expect.  I'd recommend Toast! to anyone, especially wine lovers.  It was such a treat, and didn't break the bank. Is this review positive or negative?","output":"This review is positive. The reviewer enjoyed the comfortable seating, the wine selection, the food quality, and the overall dining experience. They had a few minor complaints, such as the server's casual demeanor and the saltiness of the sauce on the Suckling Pig, but overall, they had a great time and would recommend Toast! to others, especially wine lovers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Shortly thereafter, Annie tells the family that she's pregnant, and George begins to mildly panic, insisting he is too young to be a grandfather. He has his assistant make a list of people who are older than him, dyes his hair brown, and decides he and Nina should sell the home their children have grown up in if one more thing goes wrong with it. Termites strike the house two weeks later. George puts the house on the market without telling Nina, and sells it to the Habibs. At dinner, after a discussion on whether the baby's last name will be hyphenated or not, George reveals the house has been sold. Nina is livid, as she and George have to be out in 10 days and have no place to go. Having no place to go, the Banks stay at the mansion owned by Bryan's parents. As the MacKenzies are on a cruise in the Caribbean, the Banks have to deal with their vicious Dobermans, much to the chagrin of George, who is still obviously paranoid from a previous mishap with them.

Incredibly, the resident killer whales of the San Juan Islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. Stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: This article: Big Star was an American rock band formed in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1971 by Alex Chilton, Chris Bell, Jody Stephens, and Andy Hummel. The group broke up in early 1975, and reorganized with a new lineup 18 years later following a reunion concert at the University of Missouri.  In its first era, the band's musical style drew on the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Byrds. Big Star produced a style that foreshadowed the alternative rock of the 1980s and 1990s. Before it broke up, Big Star created a \\"seminal body of work that never stopped inspiring succeeding generations,\\" in the words of Rolling Stone, as the \\"quintessential American power pop band,\\" and \\"one of the most mythic and influential cult acts in all of rock & roll\\".Big Star's first album—1972's #1 Record—was met by enthusiastic reviews, but ineffective marketing by Stax Records, and limited distribution stunted its commercial success. Frustration took its toll on band relations: Bell left not long after the first record's commercial progress stalled, and Hummel left to finish his college education after a second album, Radio City, was completed in December 1973. Like #1 Record, Radio City received excellent reviews, but label issues again thwarted sales—Columbia Records, which had assumed control of the Stax catalog, likewise effectively vetoed its distribution.  After a third album, recorded in the fall of 1974, was deemed commercially unviable and shelved before receiving a title, the band broke up late in 1974. Four years later, the first two Big Star LPs were released together in the UK as a double album. The band's third album was finally issued soon afterward; titled Third/Sister Lovers, it found limited commercial success, but has since become a cult classic. Shortly thereafter, Chris Bell was killed in a car accident at the age of 27. During the group's hiatus in the 1980s, the Big Star discography drew renewed attention when R.E.M. and the Replacements, as well as other popular bands, cited the group as an influence.

However, based on the band members mentioned in the article, we can infer that the concert likely included Alex Chilton and Jody Stephens from the original lineup.

The next day he gathers his staff and actors and tells them about the brilliant script called \\"Chubby Rain\\" that was written by his very own accountant Afrim. They then figure that this is their only shot at making a movie.

He hands the script to Renfro and he reads through it, eventually agreeing with Bobby about the script's final moment which has the hero screaming \\"Gotcha suckers!!\\" that that is a great catch phrase. Bobby tells Jerry about the plans to get Kit Ramsey in the film's lead role.

The deeper ancestral demography of Bermuda's population has been obscured by the ethnic homogenisation of the last four centuries. There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away as Mexico. By the 19th century, the white ethnically-English Bermudians had lost their numerical advantage. Despite the banning of the importation of Irish, and the repeated attempts to force free blacks to emigrate and the owners of black slaves to export them, the merging of the various minority groups, along with some of the white English, had resulted in a new demographic group, \\"coloured\\" (which term, in Bermuda, referred to anyone not wholly of European ancestry) Bermudians, gaining a slight majority. Any child born before or since then to one coloured and one white parent has been added to the coloured statistic. Most of those historically described as \\"coloured\\" are today described as \\"black\\", or \\"of African heritage\\", which obscures their non-African heritage (those previously described as \\"coloured\\" who were not of African ancestry had been very few, though the numbers of South Asians, particularly, is now growing. The number of persons born in Asian countries doubled between the 2000 and the 2010 censuses), blacks have remained in the majority, with new white immigration from Portugal, Britain and elsewhere countered by black immigration from the West Indies. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Who was the minority for the first 17 years of the settlement?","output":"For the first 17 years of the settlement in Bermuda, the minorities included white Irish and Scots, as well as non-white groups such as Spanish-speaking free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans primarily from Algonquian tribes and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard.

Adam quickly looked around to see where the rake had landed. He needed to retrieve it to keep working on the task at hand. He spotted it a few yards away, tangled in a small cluster of leaves. Step 2: Retrieving the Rake. Adam hurried over to the rake, his steps crunching through the fallen leaves covering the ground. He bent down and firmly gripped the handle, pulling it free from the leafy trap. Step 3: Preventing Future Accidents. To avoid a repeat of the wind snatching his rake, Adam made sure to keep a more secure grip. He considered using gloves for better traction if he had any, but then decided that his firm grasp should suffice. Step 4: Continuing the Cleanup. With the rake back in his possession, Adam resumed raking the leaves. He gathered them into neater and larger piles, so they wouldn't be as easily swept away by the powerful gusts.

Sentence 1: Get in, he ordered. Sentence 2: He asked them to get out Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. An entailment in linguistics and logic refers to a relationship between two sentences where the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of another. In other words, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence must also be true. In this case, the two sentences have different content and implications which do not guarantee the truth of one another: Sentence 1: \\"Get in, he ordered.\\" This sentence suggests that someone is instructing others to enter a place, a vehicle, or a situation. The focus is on the action of getting in, and it tells us that the order is given by someone with authority or control. The context does not provide further information about what happened before or what will happen after the order is executed. Therefore, the truth of this sentence does not guarantee the truth of the second sentence. Sentence 2: \\"He asked them to get out.\\" In contrast, this sentence implies that someone is requesting others to exit a place, a vehicle, or a situation. The focus is on the action of getting out, and the request seems more polite than an order. Unlike the first sentence, this sentence provides no information about the power dynamics between the involved parties. Furthermore, the context is again not clear about what happened before or what will happen after the request. Overall, the actions in the two sentences are opposite (getting in vs. getting out), and their structures also differ in terms of orders versus requests. Consequently, the truth of one sentence does not guarantee the truth of the other, meaning they are not entailed. Instead, these sentences could be seen as potentially connected in a broader context or narrative, such as someone ordering people to get in and subsequently asking them to get out after a certain event or change in circumstances. However, the relationship between the sentences would then be a contextual or chronological connection, not an entailment."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Possible A: become inebriated, socialize, eating, sleep at night, dance  Why is \\"dance\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Dance\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense when hearing music while drinking alcohol because it combines two activities that are often enjoyed together at social events and gatherings.  Dancing is a physical expression of a person's emotional response to music, and it's common for people to move their bodies along with the rhythm when they hear melodies and beats. Music has the ability to evoke emotions and create a connection with others, making it a popular choice for entertainment at parties, clubs, and other events. On the other hand, alcohol is a psychoactive substance that can lower inhibitions, reduce anxiety, and increase feelings of euphoria. When people consume alcohol, they may feel more relaxed and open to experiences, which can lead to increased sociability and a desire to participate in activities they might otherwise refrain from, such as dancing. When people are exposed to both music and alcohol, they are more likely to dance due to the combined effects of these two stimuli. The lowered inhibitions from alcohol can make individuals feel less self-conscious and more open to dancing, while the emotional connection to music can encourage movement and self-expression. This is why \\"dance\\" represents a common sense answer to the question, as it combines the effects of alcohol and music in a way that is commonly observed in social settings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Surveillance footage emerged in May of Solange attacking Jay-Z in the elevator at the Met Gala - as Beyonce did nothing. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Solange Addresses Elevator Incident with Jay-Z: No Bad Blood Between In-Laws Introduction: In a recent interview, Solange Knowles, sister of the iconic pop star, Beyoncé, finally broke her silence on the infamous elevator incident that took place in 2014. The leaked surveillance footage showed Solange physically attacking Jay-Z at the Met Gala as Beyoncé simply looked on. Contrary to public speculation, Solange insists that there are no ill feelings between her and her brother-in-law. Step 1: Give background on the incident The elevator scuffle between Solange and Jay-Z took place after the 2014 Met Gala in New York City. After leaving a Met Gala afterparty, the trio entered an elevator where Solange was seen attacking Jay-Z with kicks and punches. The leaked footage quickly went viral, prompting a media frenzy and sparking rumors about the incident's underlying cause. However, no official statements were immediately released by the involved parties. Step 2: Discuss Solange's recent statement In a candid interview, Solange addressed the altercation, referring to it as \\"that thing.\\" She emphasized that the civil relationship between herself and Jay-Z hasn't been tainted by the past event. The singer-songwriter's dismissal of any lasting hard feelings, matched with her commitment to moving forward, helps to dispel growing assumptions that the family remains divided. Step 3: Mention that the family has shown public support for one another since the incident Since the incident in 2014, Beyoncé, Jay-Z, and Solange have all shown public displays of unity to support one another. The Knowles sisters have attended each other's concerts and spoken highly of each other in various interviews, while Jay-Z has also shown his support for both artists. Their solidarity appears genuine, despite the seemingly scandalous circumstances of the elevator encounter. Step 4: Express the importance of not perpetuating rumors It's crucial to remember that celebrities are still human beings, and their lives are subject to the same ups and downs as anyone else's. It's important not to perpetuate manufactured drama and to respect the statements and actions of those involved. Creating unnecessary speculation can cause emotional distress and harm the individuals involved. Conclusion: Solange's clarification on the 2014 elevator incident with Jay-Z sheds light on the absence of any lasting ill feelings between the two. The family's ongoing public support for one another underscores their closeness and unconditional love. While the world may never know the full story behind the elevator altercation, it's important to respect the involved parties' wishes and focus on their accomplishments rather than rumors."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

If you don't have a textbook, or if you'd like a secondary textbook to complement what you're learning in the first, you may want to buy Wheelock's Latin. Named after the author, Frederic M. Wheelock, Wheelock's Latin is generally considered the standard text for learning Latin, even if you're teaching yourself the language at home. It builds sequentially by first introducing you to grammar and vocabulary, then building into increasingly complex sentences and short readings. Having a dictionary of Latin words and their various cognates will be immensely helpful in learning the vocabulary. Any good Latin dictionary should suffice. If you're unsure which dictionaries are best for learning the language, consult user reviews online or ask others who have learned the language which dictionary they used.  Some scholars recommend Langenscheidt's Pocket Latin Dictionary, but which dictionary you choose is largely a matter of personal preference. Latin uses the same letters as the English alphabet and many of the same basic language habits, which may make it easier to grasp a given word or phrase. Still, a dictionary will be necessary to distinguish between the various forms a word may take, and can help you when you need to check a word on the fly. Flash cards are an excellent way to learn vocabulary words in any language. To make flash cards, start with a blank pack of index cards. Write the word or phrase in Latin on one side of the card and its English translation on the back. Then quiz yourself, keeping a pile of words/terms you struggled with so that you can revisit those cards with further practice. You may be able to find pre-printed Latin index cards online or in a book store, but many experts recommend making your own. That's because the practice of writing out the words/terms of a foreign language will help you grow proficient and learn to think in that language. A mnemonic device is a learning technique that helps you remember something complex by associating that information with another word, a sentence, or an image. Acronyms (forming a word from the first letter of each word in a phrase) and rhymes are two of the most common types of mnemonic devices. There are numerous mnemonic devices for learning Latin that can be found online and in books, or you can invent your own to help you study.  A popular rhyme used to remember future-tense vowels is \\"Conjugations one and two, in the future Bo Bi Bu; Conjugations four and three, in the future A then E.\\" Another rhyme for remembering feminine nouns in the fourth declension goes \\"Domus = house and manus = hand, feminine will always stand.\\"  One popular mnemonic device for remembering the i-stem adjectives that form their genitive using \\"-ius\\" and dative with \\"-i\\" goes \\"Some Uncles' Umbrellas Are All Too Nice\\" to memorize Solus, Unus, Ullus, Alter, Alius, Totus, Nullus.\\" An easy way to remember the word endings for first declension Latin nons in the five primary cases is \\"MariA, queen of reggAE, gave Fannie mAE some jAM for her bananā.\\" (nominitve: -a, genitive: -ae, dative: -ae, accusative: -am, abblative: -ā) Balancing your work life and your private life can be difficult, and setting aside an extra slice of your day for studying may seem impossible. However, if you budget your time right by keeping a regular schedule and designating time to study each day, it will definitely be manageable.  Study every single day. Having an inconsistent or sporadic study schedule will make it more difficult for you find the time to study and to absorb what you learn.  Set an alarm to remind you to study each day. Then make a to-do list of the lessons you'll be studying for each day. It may be helpful to make a list for the following day at the end of your study session. That way you'll know whether you've covered everything you wanted to study that day, and the information will be fresh enough that you'll know where to pick up again the following day. Some people are able to focus better at night. Others prefer to study first thing in the morning. While some people prefer to study in the comfort of their room, others find studying in a library to be less distracting. If you're studying Latin, you may need conditions that are just right for quiet, contemplative study, and that means you'll need to figure out how you study best.  Try to study in a quiet place, and remove any potential distractions. If at all possible, aim to study in the same place every day. This can help create a mindset that will allow you to sit down and get to work right when you need to. If you're naturally a morning person, you may prefer to study early in the day. If you're a night owl, you may find it easier to study in the evening. Any time of day is fine, as long as it works well with your body. However, studying later than your usual bedtime can make you too tired to retain the information you learn.  Take periodic breaks. If you start to feel fatigued or frustrated with studying, it's a good time to take a break. Stand up and stretch, walk around a bit, and have a nutritious snack if you're hungry. Breaking up your study sessions like this can help prevent your brain from feeling overloaded. Summary:","output":"The article provides guidance on learning Latin, emphasizing the importance of using resources such as Wheelock's Latin textbook, a Latin dictionary, and mnemonic devices. Additionally, it highlights the benefits of using flashcards, creating a consistent study schedule, and establishing a conducive environment for learning. The article also offers advice on determining your most productive study time and taking breaks when needed to ensure effective learning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: WASHINGTON — When Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton announced her vice presidential choice, she referred to Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as a progressive who is \\"everything Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not.” Timothy Michael \\"Tim\\" Kaine was born on February 26, 1958, in St. Paul, Minnesota, but grew up in the metro area of Kansas City, Missouri. He is the eldest son of an ironworker and a home economics teacher. Kaine attended an all-boys Jesuit high school, joining spring mission drives to fund Jesuit activities in Honduras. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Missouri before entering Harvard Law School. Kaine took time off from his law studies to work with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Honduras for nine months in 1980-81, helping Jesuit missionaries who ran a Catholic school in El Progreso. His time there reportedly helped form his support for citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States – a stance likely to attract Latino voters. He also learned to speak fluent Spanish, seen as a possible advantage with Hispanic voters. At Harvard, Kaine met his wife, Anne Holton, the daughter of former Republican Virginia Governor Linwood Holton (1970-74), who desegregated the commonwealth's public schools. She now serves as Virginia's secretary of education. They have three children. After law school, the Kaines settled in Richmond, Virginia, where he spent nearly two decades as an attorney focusing on civil rights and fair housing. He helped found the Virginia Coalition to End Homelessness and was a board member of the Virginia chapter of Housing Opportunities Made Equal. Kaine entered politics in 1994 when he was elected to the Richmond City Council, then became the city's mayor. Virginia's voters chose him as their lieutenant governor in 2001. Four years later, he ran for governor against Republican candidate Jerry Kilgore, a former state attorney general. Considered an underdog, Kaine trailed in polls for most of the election but won the race. He... Question: Where at Harvard did Tim Kaine meet his wife Anne Holton in?

Article: As a public school superintendent , I believe the best way to prepare students for colleges and careers is to focus on providing instructional programs and opportunities that help them become good thinkers. To do this, teachers and actually everyone else in a community, should play a role as a \\"cognitive coach\\" to students, helping develop good thinkers among our youth. The best way for you to become a cognitive coach is to seek out and engage school children and adolescents in meaningful conversations. The objective here is to get kids talking about what they think, how they feel, and what they believe whenever and wherever you may find them. It may be in a classroom. It may be at the grocery store. It may be at a basketball game. It doesn't matter where as long as you engage students in a topical conversation and, hopefully, even a debate. Mainly, you want to encourage students to voice their opinion about things. Get them to take a position on \\"this thing, or that thing,\\" and ask them to support their position with evidence. Curiously enough, the simple process of engaging students in real life conversations and debates will serve to strengthen what they have learned in the classroom, and help them create their own knowledge about a subject or a topic. Learning indicates that a student has been exposed to material, understands the material, and can recall the information. Knowledge, on the other hand, goes beyond recall and includes information processing, application to other situations, consideration of meaning, and contrasting with other concepts. Naturally, the topic of conversation you engage in with one of your learners will differ from student to student, and in the level of complexity based on child's age and developmental level. Even a kindergartener has an opinion about things that are going on in his or her life. Engaging in conversation with any members of your learning community in ways that get at what they have learned and what they know will help them develop higher order reasoning...

Article: The playwright George Bernard Shaw once said humorously, \\"England and America are two nations divided by a common language. If he were writing today, he might add 'divided by a common technology--- e-mail'\\". Two completely different styles of e-mail have formed on either side of the Atlantic-Euromail and Amerimail. Americail is informal and chatty. It's likely to begin with a \\"Hi\\" and end with a \\"Bye\\". The chances of Amerimail containing a smiley face or an \\"xoxo\\" are disturbingly high. We Americans are unwilling to dive into the meat of an e-mail. We feel we have to first inform recipients   about our vacation on the island which was really excellent except the jellyfish were biting and the kids caught a cold, so we had to skip the whale watching trip, then about that investors ' meeting in New York. Amerimail is a bundle of contradictions, casual and yet direct, respectful yet over proud. In other words, Amerimail is America. Euromail is stiff and cold often beginning with a formal \\"Dear Mr. X\\" and ending with a simple \\"Sincerely\\". You won't find any mention of kids or the weather or jellyfish in Euromail. It's all business. It's also slow. Your correspondent might take days even weeks to answer a message. Euromail is exactly like the Europeans themselves. Recently about 100 managers were asked on both sides of the Atlantic whether they noticed differences in e-mail styles. Most said yes. Here are a few of their observations: \\"Americans tend to write (e-mail) exactly as they speak.\\" \\"Why don't you just call me instead of writing five e-mails back and forth?\\" \\"Europeans are less interested in checking e-mail\\". \\"In general, Americans are much more responsive to e-mail--they respond faster and provide more information.\\" So which is better, Euromail or Amerimail? I realized it's not popular these days to suggest we have anything to learn from Europeans, but I'm fed up with an inbox filled with casual, barely meaningful e-mails from friends and colleagues.

Kim is now the first North Korean leader to cross into South Korea. He was greeted by Moon, who waited on the South Korean side of the borderline in the village of Panmunjom, the historic site, where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. The two leaders smiled as they shook hands across the border. Kim then stepped over the cement boundary marker. Kim said he was, \\"excited to meet at this historic place\\" and later wondered \\"why it took so long\\" to get there. \\"It really has a strong emotional impact on me,\\" said Kim about the warm welcome he received from the people of South Korea.

Alex says he needs help finding his dog, then he and Frank take her to school. While driving, Alex tells Leslie her dad is their boss, thus earning her trust. After school, Alex and Frank find her again. They lure her into their car with a story about her dad being in trouble, drug her and take her to their house. Alex tells Leslie her parents do not want her anymore. As proof, he provides the number to her \\"dad's cell phone,\\" which, in reality, is a pay phone. After several unanswered calls, she eventually accepts his story. She and another victim, a young boy named Donnie, are forced into prostitution and pornography. Their clients include men in positions of authority, such as a judge. As a coping mechanism, Donnie and Leslie pretend they are in an imaginary world based on the stories of Mowgli and The Jungle Book. One day, Leslie goes to a convenience store, where it becomes apparent her parents are looking for her because her picture is on milk cartons. However, Leslie doesn't see the cartons, thus preserving her notion that her parents don't want her.

Context: On the night of December 25, 1991, at 7:32 p.m. Moscow time, after Gorbachev left the Kremlin, the Soviet flag was lowered for the last time, and the Russian tricolor was raised in its place, symbolically marking the end of the Soviet Union. The next day, December 26, 1991, the Council of Republics, the upper chamber of the Union's Supreme Soviet, issued a formal Declaration recognizing that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist as a state and subject of international law, and voted both itself and the Soviet Union out of existence (the other chamber of the Supreme Soviet, the Council of the Union, had been unable to work since December 12, 1991, when the recall of the Russian deputies left it without a quorum). The following day Yeltsin moved into Gorbachev's former office, though the Russian authorities had taken over the suite two days earlier. By December 31, 1991, the few remaining Soviet institutions that had not been taken over by Russia ceased operation, and individual republics assumed the central government's role.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the full name of the person that was abroad for much of the intervening period of Nuffield?, using the article: Administration of Nuffield's donation was the responsibility of the University, as the college did not become an independent body until after the Second World War. A sub-committee, consisting of three heads of Oxford colleges (Sir William Beveridge from University College; Alfred Emden from St Edmund Hall; and Linda Grier from Lady Margaret Hall), was appointed to choose the architect; Emden appears to have played the major part in the group's work. Eight architects were initially asked to compete, including Louis de Soissons, Vincent Harris, Austen Harrison, Charles Holden, Edward Maufe, and Hubert Worthington. All but Holden and Maufe submitted photographs of their work, and the sub-committee then recommended Harrison, a decision confirmed after he was interviewed on 17 June 1938. At that time, Harrison had never worked in Britain: although he had qualified there, he had practised in Greece and Palestine.  Indeed, the college seems to have been his only project in the country, and remains his best known work, along with his later University of Ghana.  Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style; Nuffield agreed to Harrison's appointment, but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work. When Nuffield's donation was announced, it was reported that the \\"general idea\\" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens, similar to the memorial gardens at Christ Church, Oxford, so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a \\"beautiful vista of well-planned gardens seen through railings\\"; this idea did not form part of Harrison's designs. After Harrison's preliminary studies, it became clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end..., what would be the answer ?

In 1931 Paris, Nicole Picot, a model for a fashionable dress shop, is hired by nearly-penniless Stefan Orloff to help persuade a financier to fund his ambitious plans. By 1934, Stefan has established an investment bank; in gratitude, he provides the capital that Nicole needs to set up her own business and become a successful dress designer (though she insists on paying him back). British diplomat Anthony Wayne romances Nicole and wins her heart. However, when Stefan's crooked schemes start to unravel, he asks Nicole to marry him without divulging his main motive: the attendance of her influential friends at the well-publicized ceremony would bolster public confidence in him and buy him time. She agrees, out of friendship alone, much to the distress of her friend and assistant, Suzanne. It is too late. At their wedding, Stefan's closest confederate, Francis Chalon, is taken away by the police for questioning, and the other guests hastily depart.

The Battle of Stamford Bridge marked a pivotal event in English history, as it took place just a few weeks before the fateful Battle of Hastings in the same year. The Stamford Bridge battle was fought between the English King Harold Godwinson and an invading force of Vikings led by King Harald Hardrada of Norway and Harold's treacherous brother Tostig Godwinson. The battle unfolded on September 25th, 1066, after Harold Godwinson had marched his troops from London to York in just four days. He was able to orchestrate a surprise attack against the Viking forces positioned at Stamford Bridge. After an intense day-long battle, the English emerged victorious, with King Harald Hardrada being killed in the process. Unfortunately for King Harold Godwinson, his triumph was short-lived, as he was forced to march his weary army back south to face William the Conqueror's Norman invasion at the Battle of Hastings just 19 days later, where he ultimately met his end.

Photograph: Camille Lepage A French photojournalist has been killed in the Central African Republic, the presidential palace announced on Tuesday evening. The body of Camille Lepage, 26, from Angers, was discovered by French troops patrolling in the Bouar region in the west of the country in a vehicle driven by militia from the anti-balaka (anti-machete) group. A week ago, in her last tweet on 6 May, Lepage had written that she was: \\"Travelling with the anti-balaka to Amada Gaza, about 120km from Berberati. \\"We left at 3.30am to avoid the Misca [International Support Mission to the Central African Republic] checkpoints and it took us eight hours by motorbike as there is no proper roads to reach the village. In the region of Amada Gaza, 150 people were killed by the Seleka [an alliance of rebel militia factions] between March and now. \\"Another attack took place on Sunday killing 6 people, the anti-balaka Colonel Rock decides to send his elements there to patrol around and take people who fled the bush back to their homes safely.\\" On Tuesday, the Elysée said the French president, François Hollande, had ordered \\"the immediate despatch of a French team and police from the African force deployed in the CAR to the scene. \\"All necessary means will be deployed to shine light on the circumstances of this assassination and find the killers of our compatriot,\\" it said in a statement. The use of the word assassinat in French appears to suggest that Paris has information that the young woman was targeted deliberately and in cold blood. Lepage had moved to Juba in South Sudan in July 2012, after completing a journalism degree at Solent University in Southampton, but had spent the last few months working in the CAR. Her work has been published in the Guardian, Le Monde, the Sunday Times, the Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and used by the BBC. In an interview with the photographic blog PetaPixel last October, Lepage spoke about her ongoing projects, You Will Forget Me and Vanishing Youth, that capture the violence of South Sudan. \\"Since I was very little, I've always wanted to go and live in a place where no one else wants to go, and cover in-depth conflict related stories … I can't accept that people's tragedies are silenced simply because no one can make money out of them.\\" Of her life in South Sudan, she said: \\"The fact that I live in South Sudan for a while really helps. I live in a local house in a local neighbourhood, with no electricity and little comfort, so I don't see myself as being very different from them [local people].\\" She ends the interview: \\"I'm currently in the Central African Republic, working on a new photography project there for a few months before heading back to South Sudan and Sudan.\\" The anti-balaka are an umbrella group of various militia – mostly uneducated Christian youths – engaged in armed struggle against Seleka rebels, made up of mostly Muslim fighters, many of them mercenaries from neighbouring countries. Summary:","output":"French photojournalist Camille Lepage, aged 26, was killed in the Central African Republic. Lepage's body was discovered by French troops in a vehicle driven by militia from the anti-balaka group in the Bouar region.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Rise of the Planet of the Apes Context: The film opens at Gen Sys, a genetic therapy pharmaceutical company. A female ape (Terry Notary), designated No. 9 and known as \\"Bright Eyes\\" by the staff, has been given the drug ALZ 112, and has shown considerable progress. She is more sociable and calmer than normal apes, and has succeeded in completing the Towers of Hanoi puzzle in 20 moves, which is close to a perfect score of 15. Will Rodman (James Franco) talks to his boss, Steve Jacobs (David Oyelowo), and convinces him that he has data to enable them to proceed with human trials for the drug.The next day, Rodman and Jacobs appear before the board of directors in the Gen Sys conference room. Will explains that the new drug causes neurogenesis, the growth of new brain cells (something that doesn't typically happen after birth) and may heal any number of degenerative brain disorders, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. The only side effect is that the subjects exposed to the drug have a green sparkle to their eyes.Back in the lab, the senior ape caretaker, Robert Franklin (Tyler Labine), is having trouble coaxing Bright Eyes out of her cage. She acts aggressively towards Robert and the other helpers. They attempt to lure her out of the cage with orange soda, but when they try to wrangle her with a lasso pole, she goes \\"ape\\" and runs rampant through the building. The chase ends when she crashes through the glass window of the conference room and the building's security guards kill her.Fearing that what they witnessed with Bright Eyes is a violent side effect of the drug, Jacobs pronounces the drug project 'dead.' Will attempts to change his mind, but Jacobs refuses, claiming he wants the remainder of the test apes 'put down.'After returning to the lab, Robert shows Will a baby ape hidden in Bright Eyes's cell. This explains that their assumption was in error: Bright Eyes was not acting violently because of the drug, but to protect her child. Robert does not have the heart to put down the baby, and gives the task to Will.

Passage:In Bukovina, the Romanian nationalist Ion Nistor and his Democratic Union Party seized the opportunity and ran pro-Romanian Ukrainians and Poles as candidates for the 1919 elections. Active on the left side of the spectrum, Constantin Krakalia joined the Socialist Party. In early 1920, he spent time in prison for protesting against the People's Party (PP) government's clampdown on Ukrainian socialism. He ran in the elections of May against Bogatyrets, taking a seat in the Assembly of Deputies, where he demanded a plebiscite over the territorial status of Bukovina and Maramureș. The election of November 1922 were held under the watch of National Liberal Party (PNL), which supported centralizing policies. During the race, the incumbent Rusyn Senator Jevhen Kozak was arrested and intimidated. Fearing persecution, Krakalia made his way into the opposition Peasants' Party; the other Ukrainian socialists soon came into contact with the Union for the Liberation of Ukraine, and were either arrested or pushed to leave Romania.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Born at Podolskaya Street in Saint Petersburg, Russia, Shostakovich was the second of three children of Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich and Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina. Shostakovich's paternal grandfather, originally surnamed Szostakowicz, was of Polish Roman Catholic descent (his family roots trace to the region of the town of Vileyka in today's Belarus), but his immediate forebears came from Siberia. A Polish revolutionary in the January Uprising of 1863–4, Bolesław Szostakowicz would be exiled to Narym (near Tomsk) in 1866 in the crackdown that followed Dmitri Karakozov's assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II. When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia. He eventually became a successful banker in Irkutsk and raised a large family. His son Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer's father, was born in exile in Narim in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics in Saint Petersburg University, graduating in 1899. He then went to work as an engineer under Dmitri Mendeleev at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg. In 1903 he married another Siberian transplant to the capital, Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina, one of six children born to a Russian Siberian native.Their son, Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich, displayed significant musical talent after he began piano lessons with his mother at the age of nine. On several occasions he displayed a remarkable ability to remember what his mother had played at the previous lesson, and would get \\"caught in the act\\" of playing the previous lesson's music while pretending to read different music placed in front of him. In 1918 he wrote a funeral march in memory of two leaders of the Kadet party, murdered by Bolshevik sailors.In 1919, at the age of 13, he was admitted to the Petrograd Conservatory, then headed by Alexander Glazunov, who monitored Shostakovich's progress closely and promoted him.

Write an article based on this \\"The brother of a murdered private detective has urged the prime minister to continue with the second part of the Leveson Inquiry into press ethics.\\"","output":"Title: The Continuing Quest for Press Ethics: A Murder Victim's Brother Pleads for the Resumption of the Leveson Inquiry Introduction The Leveson Inquiry, a significant investigation into the UK's media practices and ethics, remains a subject of intense discussion almost a decade after its initial launch. Prompted by the infamous phone-hacking scandal in 2011, the inquiry's extensive recommendations have nonetheless not been pursued in their entirety. Amidst growing pressure to resume its second part, the brother of a murdered private investigator has recently called upon the UK Prime Minister to follow through with the investigation, thereby addressing lingering concerns about press attitudes towards ethics and their potential role in the unsolved case. The Leveson Inquiry: A Refresher Lord Justice Leveson's public inquiry followed allegations of widespread phone hacking by Rupert Murdoch-owned newspaper News of the World. The scandal, involving hacked voicemails and messages of celebrities, politicians, and even crime victims, rightfully provoked outrage, leading to the examination of not only News of the World, but other publications as well. Part one of the inquiry investigated the relationship between the press and the public, along with the extent to which current media practices adhered to ethical standards. It sought to balance press freedom with individual privacy concerns while addressing any potential criminal activity within news organisations. Meanwhile, the planned second part of the inquiry was set to address any additional illegal conduct and ties between news organisations, police, and politicians, but it has yet to be pursued. The Case of a Murdered Private Detective The case involving the unsolved murder of private detective Daniel Morgan – who, prior to his tragic death, had allegedly uncovered evidence of police corruption – has remained unresolved for more than 30 years. Morgan's brother has come forward, urging the British Government to continue with the second part of the Leveson Inquiry, especially since it could shed light on connections that might have contributed to Daniel's killing and the subsequent failure to bring his murderers to justice. This plea to the Prime Minister highlights various potential criminal implications and unsavoury relationships between the press and crime enforcement, emphasising the need to re-examine the media landscape more comprehensively. Resuming the Leveson Inquiry could serve to scrutinise unethical practices that perhaps still lurk within news reporting, and aid in solving the mystifying case that resulted in Daniel Morgan's untimely demise. Pursuing the Second Part of the Leveson Inquiry: Potential for Positive Change The continuation of the Leveson Inquiry could generate multiple benefits for the UK’s media landscape: 1. Accountability: Implementing the second part enables the prosecution of illegal and unethical conduct that was hitherto overlooked or suppressed. By fully examining connections between news organisations and law enforcement, it holds responsible parties accountable for their actions. 2. Restoration of Public Trust: With allegations of illegal cooperation between the media and government officials still looming heavily, the Leveson Inquiry’s continuation would send a clear message that unscrupulous tactics will not be tolerated. This would reinforce public trust in both the press and government institutions. 3. Improved Ethical Standards: Part two of the inquiry could strengthen media regulations and practices, filling in existing gaps and highlighting unethical practices. In turn, media outlets would be able to defy pressure to engage in sensationalist or harmful reporting, thanks to a regulatory environment that prioritises journalistic integrity. Conclusion The impassioned plea by a murder victim's brother highlights the urgency surrounding the necessity to revisit the second part of the Leveson Inquiry. Beyond addressing the broad implications of decades-old misconduct, the resumption of the investigation could also open the door to the prosecution of those linked to Daniel Morgan's tragic murder. Most importantly, the continuation of the inquiry would serve as a catalyst for a more transparent, accountable, and ethical media sphere – fostering trust in a powerful industry that wields considerable influence over public opinion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Given the background: The Gaia hypothesis states that the biosphere is its own living organism. The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis . For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention.  and the situation: Two friends had a sleepover. They spent most of the time online looking up stuff and talking about it. Bill looked up the Gaia hypothesis, while Frank read about the Flat Earth theory.  Answer the following question: Which friend read less about the composition of our atmosphere? A:","output":"Based on the background information and the situation provided, it can be inferred that Frank, who read about the Flat Earth theory, likely read less about the composition of our atmosphere in comparison to Bill, who looked up the Gaia hypothesis. The Gaia hypothesis is directly related to the interactions and processes within the Earth's biosphere, which involve self-regulation of atmospheric conditions to maintain homeostasis. This hypothesis discusses the interconnections between different components of the Earth's system, such as the atmosphere, geosphere, and biosphere, and how these components work together to maintain a stable environment suitable for life. Therefore, Bill's research on the Gaia hypothesis would have provided him with more information on the Earth's atmospheric composition and how it relates to the overall functioning of the biosphere. On the other hand, the Flat Earth theory is a belief that the Earth is flat, rather than an oblate spheroid as science demonstrates. While this theory might touch upon general information about the Earth's structure, it is not inherently focused on the composition of the atmosphere or processes maintaining Earth's homeostasis. Followers of this theory may challenge scientific explanations related to Earth's shape and its interaction with various celestial bodies but do not specifically center on the in-depth understanding of the Earth's atmosphere. Thus, it can be concluded that in this situation, Frank, who read about the Flat Earth theory, likely read less about the composition of our atmosphere than Bill, who looked up the Gaia hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you’ve been treating your wart but it isn’t improving, talk to your doctor to find out if you need additional treatments. Your doctor may be able to give you a stronger treatment than what you can find in the store.  They may treat your wart in their office and might even be able to remove it. Alternatively, your doctor might offer you a prescription-strength topical cream. Sometimes warts can develop on your hands and feet, which might make it hard for you to carry out your daily activities. If this happens, talk to your doctor about treatment options that can help your wart heal faster. Then, follow your doctor’s advice so you can get back to your normal activities. Medical treatments can help your wart heal a lot faster than they would with home treatment. Try not to worry, but this could be a sign that what you have is more serious than a wart. For instance, it’s possible that your bump is skin cancer. Visit your doctor to get your skin examined so you can get a proper diagnosis. Then, discuss your treatment options with your doctor. It might just be a wart, so you probably don’t need to worry. However, it’s better to be safe than sorry.

You turned around and, sure enough, someone was looking right at you! Parapsychologists   say that humans have a natural ability to sense when someone is looking at them. To research whether such a \\"sixth sense\\" really exists, Robert Baker, a psychologist at the University of Kentucky, performed two experiments. In the first one, Baker sat behind unknowing people in public places and stared at the backs of their heads for 5 to 15 minutes. The subjects were eating, drinking, reading, studying, watching TV, or working at a computer. Baker made sure that the people could not tell that he was sitting behind them during those periods. Later, when he questioned the subjects, almost all of them said they had no sense that someone was staring at them. For the second experiment, Baker told the subjects that they would be stared at from time to time from behind a two way mirror in a laboratory setting. The people had to write down when they felt they were being stared at and when they weren't. Baker found that the subjects were no better at telling when they were stared at and when they weren't. and they were no better at telling when they were stared at than if they had just guessed. Baker concludes that people do not have the ability to sense when they're being stared at. If people doubt the outcome of his two experiments, said baker, \\"I suggest they repeat the experiments and see for themselves.\\" Question: In the first experiment, the subjects  _  . - were not told that they would be stared at - lost their sense when they were stared at - were not sure when the would be stared at - were uncomfortable when they were stared at The answer is:","output":"In the first experiment, the subjects were not told that they would be stared at."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here, make sure that the changes are semantically related and syntactically similar to the input. And the generated sentence should have high commonsense plausibility, that is to have reasonable probability of it being true. Se siete sposati, non fate a turno la preparazione del cibo. Output:","output":"Se siete in coppia, non delegate a turno la pulizia della casa. Reasoning step-by-step: 1. I understand the input sentence is about a situation in a married life where spouses are advised not to take turns in preparing food. 2. The first change I make is replacing the word \\"sposati\\" with \\"in coppia\\". Both mean being in a relationship, but the latter is more general, not necessarily implying marriage. 3. Next, I change the context from cooking to another common household chore, cleaning the house. This change keeps the overall message similar and is semantically related. 4. Then, I make an additional small change in the verb used for describing the action. The word \\"fate\\" is replaced by the verb \\"delegate\\", which adds a little bit of difference, while still keeping the sentence structurally and semantically similar to the original. 5. These changes result in a sentence that has a high commonsense plausibility; it’s reasonable in many relationships for couples not to take turns in cleaning the house. It fits into the real-world expectations of tasks within a relationship."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Once there lived an old man in a mountain village. He was a famous hunter. He often went hunting alone in the mountains. He was not afraid of any wild animals, not even a tiger. One night, someone saw a tiger come into the village, and stole two sheep away. The next night the tiger came again. The villagers were frightened. They asked the old hunter to catch it so that they could have a safe life. When the old man heard about the tiger, he thought hard. He wondered why the tiger came at night twice but only stole the sheep. The next night he walked outside the village. Suddenly he saw the tiger coming. He quickly threw himself on the ground. To his surprise, the tiger did not come at him, but went away. He followed it quietly and found it was running on two of its feet just like a man. Then everything was clear. On the fourth day, when it got dark, the hunter took some animal skins with him and hid himself behind a big tree near the village. He was waiting for the \\"tiger\\". As soon as the \\"tiger\\" came near the tree, the old hunter jumped out, caught the \\"tiger\\" by the \\"leg\\" and said, \\"Don't be afraid. I do not mean to hurt you. You know who I am, don't you?\\" The \\"tiger\\" said \\"Yes\\" and took off the tiger's skin. \\"You are poor. But you mustn't steal anything from others. Here are some animal skins for you. You may sell them at the market. With the money, you can buy food and clothes for your family. Work harder and try to make a living. \\" With tears in his eyes, the poor man thanked the kind-hearted old hunter and walked home. Question: What did the old hunter do when he first saw the tiger? Options: A: He was frightened. B: He threw himself on the ground. C: He ran away. D: He hid himself behind a tree. A:","output":"The correct answer is B: He threw himself on the ground. When the old hunter first saw the tiger coming, he quickly threw himself on the ground in an attempt to avoid the tiger's attention. To his surprise, the tiger did not come at him, but went away instead. This allowed the hunter to follow the tiger and eventually discover that it was a poor man disguised as a tiger to steal the sheep."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He is approached by a shady father and son tycoon team (Big and Little Enos Burdett) who are planning a big party. Only problem is, in 1978 America, due to arcane liquor laws, it was illegal to ship Coors beer east of Texas...and the Burdetts wanted some for their Atlanta, Georgia shindig. 400 cases of it.The Burdetts offer The Bandit 80,000 dollars to get the brews in Texarkana, Texas and bring them back to Atlanta in 28 hours.

Options: - haversack - desk - cabinet - backpack - house  The answer is \\"backpack\\" because A:","output":"The answer is \\"backpack\\" because a backpack is an ideal option for carrying scissors securely and conveniently from one building to another where you'll need to use them soon. Let's elaborate on why that's the best choice among the given options: 1. Haversack: While a haversack is a type of bag, it is typically smaller and used for carrying lightweight items. For items like scissors, which have sharp edges, a haversack may not be the most protective or secure choice to prevent accidental damage to the scissors or other items in the bag. Additionally, haversacks often have drawstring closures, which are less secure than zippers and may allow the scissors to fall out. 2. Desk: Placing the scissors on a desk would not be practical if you will need them in a different building shortly. The desk is stationary and located within a room, so leaving the scissors there would mean you would have to physically go back to the room to retrieve them, which defeats the purpose of having the scissors readily available for use in the other location. 3. Cabinet: Similar to the desk, a cabinet is also a stationary furniture piece that doesn't allow for easy transportation of items. Leaving the scissors in a cabinet would make it inconvenient and time-consuming to retrieve them when needed in the other building. 4. Backpack: A backpack is a versatile and secure choice for carrying items such as scissors. Backpacks typically have multiple compartments and zippered closures, making them a safe and efficient means of transporting items. The scissors can be placed in a specific compartment, protecting them from damage and ensuring they don't inadvertently damage other items in the backpack. With the scissors securely packed, it's easy to carry them and have them readily accessible when needed in the other building. 5. House: Placing the scissors inside the house would be impractical for the same reasons as the desk and cabinet options. The house is stationary, and leaving the scissors inside would require going back to retrieve them, which is neither efficient nor effective in ensuring their availability for use in the other building. In summary, a backpack is the best choice from the given options to securely hold and transport scissors that you will need to use in another building soon. It offers convenience, accessibility, and security, allowing you to quickly access and utilize the scissors when needed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Vincenzo's successor Francesco had no high regard for Monteverdi, and dismissed him from his post. Upon Francesco's sudden death in December 1612, the dukedom passed to his brother Ferdinando, but Monteverdi was not recalled to the court and was appointed maestro di capella in August 1613 at St Mark's, Venice. However, he remained in contact with Striggio and other highly placed Gonzaga courtiers, through whom he was able to secure occasional commissions to compose theatrical works for the Gonzaga court. Thus, late in 1616, Striggio asked him to set to music Scipione Agnelli's libretto Le nozze di Tetide, as part of the celebrations for Duke Ferdinando's forthcoming marriage to Catherine de' Medici. This story, based on the wedding of the mythical Greek hero Peleus to the sea-goddess Thetis, had previously been offered to the Mantuan court by Peri, whose setting of a libretto by Francesco Cini had been rejected in 1608 in favour of L'Arianna.Initially, Monteverdi had little enthusiasm for Le nozze di Tetide, and sought ways of avoiding or delaying work on it. He would accept the commission, he informed Striggio on 9 December 1616, because it was the wish of the duke, his feudal lord. However, the verses he was given were not, he felt, conducive to beautiful music. He found the tale difficult to understand, and did not think he could be inspired by it. In any event he was occupied for most of December in writing a Christmas Eve mass for St Mark's. On 29 December, perhaps hoping that the commission would be withdrawn, Monteverdi told Striggio that he was ready to begin work on Le Nozze di Tetide \\"if you tell me to do so\\". In January 1617, however, he became more enthusiastic on learning that the project had been scaled down and was now being projected as a series of intermedi.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write an article based on this summary: – How many trees are there on earth? A lot … or, more precisely, 3.04 trillion (about 422 per person on the planet, CNN notes). That's what some scientists discovered this year after conducting a global tree census, NPR reports. To put that number in context, it would take some 96,000 years to plant 3 trillion trees, if you were planting a tree per second, says ecologist Thomas Crowther, who led the study while working at Yale University. A previous estimate, based on satellite images, had the world's tree population at about 400 billion—some 7.5 times less than the new estimate, which was published September in the journal Nature. \\"It's a huge, astronomical number that I don't think I could comprehend before this study,\\" Crowther tells NPR. Still, Crowther cautions, \\"It's not like we discovered new trees,\\" so it's not time to say, \\"There's plenty left. No worries.\\" In fact, per Nature, the researchers think the total number of trees has been slashed nearly 50% in the last 12,000 years. And about 15 billion trees are cut down each year. The tree census involved getting tree counts in certain areas from people on the ground, using existing forest inventories, and entering the data into computer models. The whole thing started when Crowther's friend, part of the Billion Tree Campaign, was trying to figure out what kind of impact planting a billion trees would have. He asked Crowther how many trees are on the earth. At the time, Crowther tells NPR, \\"It doesn't seem like anyone had any idea.\\" Now they do … and the information could be used to weigh whether trees should be preserved, rather than cut down to make way for farms, a Stanford University ecologist tells Nature. (Droughts might be even worse for trees than we thought.)","output":"How many trees are there on Earth? There are a lot of trees! About 3.04 trillion of them to be exact. That's like having 422 trees for every person on the planet! But what does trillion mean? Well, a trillion is a really, really big number that's almost too big for us to imagine. To give you an idea, if you wanted to plant 3 trillion trees and could plant one tree every second, it would take you 96,000 years to finish. That's a lot of trees! The scientists found out there were this many trees by doing a special count called a \\"Global Tree Census\\". Before, they thought there were only around 400 billion trees, but after these studies by the smart ecologist called Thomas Crowther and his friends, they discovered there are a lot more trees than that! However, just because there are a lot of trees doesn't mean we don't have to worry about them. Even though there are a lot of trees on Earth now, around 12,000 years ago there used to be almost double the number of trees we have today. And sadly, every year, people chop down about 15 billion trees! Thankfully, the scientists are using their new information about how many trees there are to help decide if they should try to save more trees instead of cutting them down to make way for farms and other things. So, even though there are a lot of trees, it's really important to take care of them and make sure we don't lose even more."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You'll want to grip the racket using the \\"Eastern\\" or \\"Continental\\" grip, as these are the most common grips for serving. For the Eastern grip, ensure that the base knuckle of your forefinger is against the third bevel of the racket handle, while the Continental grip places that same knuckle on the second bevel. Both grips keep the racket face at an optimal angle for serving. Bounce the ball. As a matter of preference and timing, bounce the ball a few times on the ground, being mindful of your nerves and the rhythm you want to establish. This can help you feel comfortable and focused on the task at hand. Initiate your toss. With the ball in your non-dominant hand (left hand, if you are right-handed), hold your arm and hand straight without any bend in your wrist. As you bend your knees slightly, you will toss the ball in front of you, emphasizing a smooth and controlled motion, with the goal of achieving a consistent and reliable toss trajectory. As a general rule, you should aim to toss the ball around 1 to 2 feet above your maximum reach. Simultaneously, as you start to toss the ball, begin the backswing of your racket by bending your dominant elbow and bringing it back, so that it forms an approximate 90-degree angle (similar to a trophy pose). This will help you generate power during the next phase of your serve, the upward motion. Hit the ball. Just before reaching the peak of the toss, use your legs to propel your body upwards (a motion called \\"loading\\"), and extend your racket-arm towards the ball. Keep your eye on the ball as you make contact with it with the middle of your racket strings, aiming at a slight downward angle to ensure it clears the net while still landing in the correct service box. Follow through. As you make contact with the ball, allow your natural momentum to guide the follow through. Ideally, your racket should complete a fluid arc over your shoulder, with your body weight shifting forward into the court. Recover and prepare for the return. Once you have completed your serve, quickly return to a ready position, with your racket hand close to your body and both feet shoulder width apart. This ensures that you are prepared to handle any return shots from your opponent. Remember to practice your serve frequently, as consistency and accuracy are key factors in reducing errors and improving your overall game. Being able to rely on your serve during crucial moments in a match can make the difference between winning and losing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Background: Current Situation : Currently the heating effect of extra greenhouse gases (since the start of the industrial revolution) is equal to about . Thus the recent period has recorded parallel increases in concentration of carbon dioxide and average global temperature. As more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere the temperature will increase further. There are certain effects of a warmer Earth (discussed more in optional section), which could accelerate the process, even if no more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere (an unlikely prospect for the foreseeable future).  Paragraph: Last week, an exact clone of Earth appeared next to our current Earth. Scientists have come to call this new planet, Terra. Terra has the exact same cities, civilizations and history as Earth. Scientists are completely baffled as to how this planet exists, but it undeniably does. The only difference between Earth and Terra is that the citizens of Terra output half as many greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as citizens of Earth do.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Does Terra have more or less concentration of carbon dioxide than Earth? The answer to this question is:","output":"Terra has less concentration of carbon dioxide than Earth. Since the citizens of Terra output half as many greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as citizens of Earth do, this would lead to a lower concentration of carbon dioxide on Terra compared to Earth. The reduced emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, would result in a slower rate of climate change and a lower overall concentration of these gases in Terra's atmosphere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn’t have enough time to do something dumb. Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship. What he did after I connected with him was talk to me and then test me as the conversation progressed. How did he test me? He told a corny joke which I laughed to.

Standing on the steps of the Supreme Court, Scott Lively, president of Abiding Truth Ministries, told reporters he’s filing a motion with the Supreme Court calling for the recusal of Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan.      ADVERTISEMENT      “Justices Ginsburg and Kagan, knowing full well that unique legal issues regarding the definition of marriage would soon come before them, deliberately officiated at so-called homosexual wedding ceremonies creating not merely the appearance of bias, but an actual and blatant conflict of interest,” he said.      “In my personal view they have committed an unparalleled breach of judicial ethics by elevating the importance of their own favored political cause of gay rights above the integrity of the court and of our nation.”      The case before the court, known as Obergefell v. Hodges, stems from a 6th Circuit Court of Appeals decision to uphold same-sex marriage bans in Ohio, Tennessee, Michigan and Kentucky. The court has grouped the appeals from the couples in the four states together and will hear two and a half hours of arguments Tuesday morning, 90 minutes more than the court typically allows.      In their rulings, the justices will seek to answer whether states are required to license a marriage between two people of the same sex and whether states have to recognize same-sex marriage licenses from other states under the 14th Amendment.      Lively said Kagan and Ginsburg's “vividly demonstrated disposition” in favor of the same-sex couples shows they are unable to render a fair judgment.      He and more than a dozen leaders of anti-gay-marriage groups stood behind a wall of empty cardboard filing boxes stacked on the steps of the court on Monday morning.      The boxes — 60 in all — were there to \\"symbolically\\" represent 300,000 restraining orders that Faith2Action President Janet Porter said will be delivered to the Supreme Court and to Congress to keep the justices from ruling on gay marriage.      “We have appealed to Congress to restrain the judges, and the good news is Congress has heard our cry,” Porter said.      Last week, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) introduced the Restrain the Judges on Marriage Act of 2015, which would remove jurisdiction to rule on gay marriage from federal courts. In the Senate, Sen. Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward CruzGroup aiming to draft Beto O’Rourke unveils first 2020 video Howard Dean looking for a 'younger, newer' Democratic nominee in 2020 Congress can stop the war on science MORE (R-Texas) has introduced The Protect Marriage from the Courts Act, which would also limit the federal courts’ jurisdiction to consider same-sex marriage cases.      “Congress has the ability to remove appellate jurisdiction,” Porter said. “What that means is, we can actually take from them their right to rule on marriage before they even rule on marriage.”      During the press conference, Larry Sternbane, 51, stood quietly back behind the crowd holding a sign that read, “Don’t like gay marriage? Don’t get gay married.”      “This right here is the last gasp of a group that is losing this issue in the public square,” he said. “They are talking to themselves. There are a bunch of tourists listening, and the only ones clapping when somebody ends is them.” ||||| Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the West conference room at the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post via Getty)      Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the 82-year-old leader of the Supreme Court’s minority liberal wing, has cast aside her usual restraint in the past months and left little doubt where she stands on the upcoming gay marriage case.      The Supreme Court hears arguments in the case, Obergefell v. Hodges, on Tuesday, and will most likely announce in June whether states will still be allowed to ban same-sex marriage and refuse to recognize the rights of couples married in other states.      Ginsburg, a former civil rights lawyer, has been uncharacteristically outspoken in advance of one of the most significant civil rights decisions in decades. In August, she became the first Supreme Court justice to officiate at a same-sex wedding. Since then, she’s highlighted the big shift in public opinion on gay marriage in interviews and public speeches, breaking from her usual reticence when it comes to talking about upcoming cases. In February, Ginsburg told Bloomberg that it “would not take a large adjustment” for Americans to accept nationwide marriage equality, given the “enormous” change in people’s attitudes about same-sex marriage. New York Times columnist Gail Collins wrote in January that Ginsburg has a “strong hunch” about the way the case will turn out. “I would be very surprised if the Supreme Court retreats from what it has said about same-sex unions,” Ginsburg told Collins, referencing the 2012 decision that found the federal government must recognize same-sex marriages.      Two anti-gay-marriage groups, the National Organization for Marriage and the American Family Association, have since called on Ginsburg to recuse herself, arguing that she can no longer be impartial. They’ve also targeted Justice Elena Kagan for officiating at a same-sex marriage, asking her to step down from the case, too.      Legal experts say the calls for recusal are unwarranted, given the 2012 ruling that the federal government must recognize same-sex marriages in states that allow them. The constitutional issue at stake in the current case is whether states can ban same-sex marriage at all. Officiating at a same-sex marriage in a jurisdiction that already allows it does not call into question the justices’ impartiality on that question, according to Columbia Law School professor Jamal Greene.      SLIDESHOW: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: A look back >>>      The earlier gay rights decision gives Ginsburg more leeway to comment on the issue generally. Though the court did not find a fundamental right to marriage, the majority opinion held that same-sex marriages have an essential “dignity” like any other marriage and that the federal government does not have a good reason to discriminate against them by refusing to recognize them.      “She’s not saying anything that she hasn’t said in an opinion,” said Margo Schlanger, a former Ginsburg clerk who is now a law professor at the University of Michigan. “So it’s not like, ‘Wow, that’s a new one and the court hasn’t ruled on it since Baker v. Nelson,’” she said, referencing the 1972 case that upheld a state same-sex marriage ban after the court refused to hear the appeal.

(Associated Press)      The justices are meeting Tuesday to offer the first public indication of where they stand in the dispute over whether states can continue defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman, or whether the Constitution gives gay and lesbian couples the right to marry.      The court is hearing extended arguments, scheduled to last 2 ½ hours, which also will explore whether states that do not permit same-sex marriage must nonetheless recognize such unions from elsewhere.      Same-sex couples can marry in 36 states and the District of Columbia.      The cases before the court come from Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee, four of the 14 remaining states that allow only heterosexual marriage. Those four states had their marriage bans upheld by the federal appeals court in Cincinnati in November. That is the only federal appeals court that has ruled in favor of the states since the Supreme Court in 2013 struck down part of the federal anti-gay marriage law.      Justice Anthony Kennedy has written the court's three prior gay rights decisions, including the case from two years ago. All eyes will be on Kennedy for any signals that he is prepared to take the final step in granting marriage rights to same-sex couples.      Such an outcome was inconceivable just a few years ago.      The first state to allow gay and lesbian couples to marry was Massachusetts, in 2004. Even as recently as October, barely a third of the states permitted it. Now, same-sex couples can marry in 36 states and the District of Columbia, a dramatic change in the law that has been accompanied by an equally fast shift in public opinion.      The main thrust of the states' case is to reframe the debate.      \\"This case is not about the best marriage definition. It is about the fundamental question regarding how our democracy resolves such debates about social policy: Who decides, the people of each state or the federal judiciary?\\" John Bursch, representing Michigan, wrote in his main brief to the court.      Other arguments by the states and more than five-dozen briefs by their defenders warn the justices of harms that could result \\"if you remove the man-woman definition and replace it with the genderless any-two-persons definition,\\" said Gene Schaerr, a Washington lawyer.      The push for same-sex marriage comes down to fairness, said Mary Bonauto, who will argue on behalf of the plaintiffs. The people who have brought their cases to the Supreme Court are \\"real people who are deeply committed to each other. Yet they are foreclosed from making that commitment simply because of who they are,\\" she told reporters last week.      Arguments made by Bonauto, other lawyers for same-sex couples and more than six-dozen supporting briefs have strong echoes of the 1967 Loving v. Virginia case, in which the Supreme Court struck down state bans on interracial marriage. In that case, the justices were unanimous that those bans violated the constitutional rights of interracial couples.      No one expects unanimity this time. But many believe the justices will take the final step toward what gay rights supporters call marriage equality, in part because they allowed orders in favor of same-sex couples to take effect even as the issue made its way through the federal court system.      That was action through inaction, as other judges played a major role over the years. Only 11 states have granted marriage rights to same-sex couples through the ballot or the legislature. Court rulings are responsible for all the others.      A decision is expected in late June.      ___      Follow Mark Sherman on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/shermancourt . ||||| The scene outside the Supreme Court today felt a lot like a football game tailgate party -- and for supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage who have spent days camped out to score a seat, Tuesday's oral arguments are the Super Bowl.      The justices will hear arguments into two related questions: one, whether states must allow same-sex couples to marry; and two, whether states must recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere.      There were at least sixty groups -- mainly supporters, but also some opponents -- who had been waiting on the corner of First and East Capitol Streets for days, hoping for a coveted chair inside the courtroom.      Frank Colasonti Jr. and his husband James Ryder of Birmingham, Michigan, were among the first in line. They said they had been there since Friday evening, snoozing in sleeping bags and hiding under tarps when it rained. But the partners for 27 years, husbands for the last one, said this argument was too important not to try to attend.      \\"We really never thought ...\\" Colasonti said before getting choked up.      \\"We really never thought we'd see it in our lifetime,\\" Ryder said, finishing his husband’s sentence.      \\"It really never seemed like an option that it would ever happen,\\" he continued, noting that they had filed their income taxes jointly for the first time this year.      The couple was among some 300 spouses who married on a single day in 2014 when Michigan's gay marriage ban was temporarily lifted. Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder later said he would not contest the validity of those marriages although the ban was reinstated.      Michigan is one of four states arguing in favor of their same-sex marriage bans. The others are Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee.      Besides the many same-sex couples and their families who flocked from those states, there were many law students who wanted to see a case that future classes will likely study.      \\"However this is decided it's going to be one of the most iconic and well-read cases in casebooks so this is going to be really exciting to be here,\\" Wyatt Fore, a third-year law student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor said. He said he had been in place, lawn chair and law books in tow, since Friday night.      Emotions and opinions on both sides of Tuesday's arguments run high, but at this unique gathering of legal minds, students, same-sex couples and pastors, the tendency is to live and let live -- or in this case, wait and let wait.      Pastor Rick Grogan of Fort Worth, Texas, acknowledged that he was one of the few opponents of same-sex marriage camped out, a buoy in a sea of Human Rights Campaign banners and rainbow flags.      \\"You've got, what, 20-something states who have banned it in their constitution. Now, nine people are going to tell the whole nation what to do,\\" he said, sprawled on a blanket with an opened Bible in his hand.      But he said the discourse among his neighbors had been respectful. After all, if people toss footballs around during a pre-game tailgate, why wouldn't they engage in elevated debate before a Supreme Court argument?      \\"Even though people disagree, it's been pleasant so far,\\" Grogan said.      As he spoke, a group of same-sex marriage supporters from Kentucky posed for a group picture, just steps away. ||||| Hard to imagine any of that happening to John Roberts .      The retirement talk started around 2011, when the Harvard Law School professor Randall Kennedy wrote an essay in The New Republic arguing that both Ginsburg and Justice Stephen Breyer should quit while there was still a Democratic president to nominate replacements. “What’s more, both are, well, old,” he added uncharitably.      As time moved on, the focus shifted almost exclusively to Ginsburg (“Justice Ginsburg: Resign Already!”). Perhaps that’s simply because she is older than Breyer, who is now 76. Or perhaps there’s still an expectation that women are supposed to be good sports, and volunteer to take one for the team.      From the beginning, Ginsburg waved off the whole idea. (“And who do you think Obama could have nominated and got confirmed that you’d rather see on a court?”) Anyway, since Republicans took control of the Senate in January, it’s become pretty clear that ship has sailed.      “People aren’t saying it as much now,” she said with what sounded like some satisfaction.      Obviously, a time will come. But as far as clarity on the bench, productivity and overall energy go, that time doesn’t at all seem to be at hand. Her medical history is studded with near disasters — colon cancer in 1999, and pancreatic cancer 10 years later. Both times she returned to the bench quickly. (In the latter case, Senator Jim Bunning of Kentucky apologized for predicting she’d probably be dead within nine months.) Last year she had a stent placed in one of her coronary arteries. That happened on a Wednesday, and the court’s public information officer quickly told reporters that Ginsburg “expects to be on the bench on Monday.”      HER physical fierceness is legend. Scalia, her improbable good friend, once recounted a summer when he and Ginsburg had both snagged a gig teaching on the French Riviera. “She went off parasailing!” he told The Washington Post. “This little skinny thing, you’d think she’d never come down.” She has since given up that sort of recreation, but she still works out twice a week in the Supreme Court gym with her personal trainer. Plus there are the daily stretching exercises at home. At night. After work.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      It’s the combination of Ginsburg’s woman-hear-me-roar history, her frail-little-old-lady appearance and her role as the leader of the Supreme Court’s dissident liberals that have rallied her new fan base, particularly young women.      The second woman to be appointed to the Supreme Court, she’s part of the generation who came of age after World War II and led a revolution that transformed women’s legal rights, as well as their role in the public world. There’s a famous story about the dean at Harvard Law inviting Ginsburg and her tiny group of fellow female law students to dinner, then asking them how they’d justify having taken a place that could have gone to a man. Ginsburg was so flustered she answered that her husband, Marty, was a law student and that it was very important for a wife to understand her husband’s work.      “That’s what I said,” she nodded.      The dean, Ginsburg said, told her later that he had asked only because “there were still doubting Thomases on the faculty and he wanted the women to arm him with stories.” You have to wonder if the dean was trying to rewrite history. Or maybe joking. But Ginsburg believed the explanation: “He was a wonderful man, but he had no sense of humor.”      During law school Marty Ginsburg developed testicular cancer . Ruth helped him keep up with his work by bringing him notes from his classes and typing up his papers, while also taking care of their toddler, Jane. Plus, she made the Harvard Law Review. This is the kind of story that defines a certain type of New Woman of Ginsburg’s generation — people whose gift for overachievement and overcoming adversity is so immense, you can see how even a nation of men bent on maintaining the old patriarchal order were simply run over by the force of their determination. (Ginsburg herself isn’t given to romanticizing. Asked why the women’s rights revolution happened so quickly, she simply said: “Well, the tide was in our favor. We were riding with winners.”)      Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

She has a son, a daughter and four grandchildren, one of whom called and said “Bubbe, you were sleeping at the State of the Union!” after the cameras caught her famous nap. She travels constantly. The day we talked, she was preparing to go off to a meeting of the New York City Bar, where she would introduce Gloria Steinem , who would deliver the Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Distinguished Lecture on Women and the Law. A few weeks earlier, at a gathering of the Association of American Law Schools, Ginsburg had introduced her old friend Professor Herma Hill Kay, recipient of the Ruth Bader Ginsburg Lifetime Achievement Award. When you reach this kind of stature, there are lots of echoes.      She’s spent much of her life being the first woman doing one thing or another, and when it comes to the retirement question, she has only one predecessor to contemplate — her friend Sandra Day O’Connor, the first female Supreme Court justice, who left the bench at 75 to spend more time with her husband, John, who was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease .      “She and John were going to do all the outdoorsy things they liked to do,” Ginsburg recalled. But John O’Connor’s condition deteriorated so swiftly that her plans never worked out. Soon, Ginsburg said, “John was in such bad shape that she couldn’t keep him at home.”      O’Connor has kept busy — speaking, writing, hearing cases on a court of appeals and pursuing a project to expand civics education. But it’s not the same as being the swing vote on the United States Supreme Court. “I think she knows that when she left that term, every 5-4 decision when I was in the minority, I would have been in the majority if she’d stayed,” Ginsburg said.      Besides not retiring, another thing Ginsburg is planning not to do is write her memoirs. “There are too many people writing about me already,” she said. There’s an authorized biography in the works, along with several other projects to which she has definitely not given a blessing.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      “But now — this is something I like,” she said, picking up a collection of essays, “The Legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.” The justice also seems to be looking forward to an upcoming “Notorious R.B.G.” book, written by Shana Knizhnik, who created the blog, and Irin Carmon of MSNBC. The name started as a play on the name of the Brooklyn gangsta rapper Notorious B.I.G. , but it’s taken on a life of its own as a younger-generation tribute to Ginsburg.      “The kind of raw excitement that surrounds her is palpable,” Carmon said. “There’s a counterintuitiveness. We have a particular vision of someone who’s a badass — a 350-pound rapper. And she’s this tiny Jewish grandmother. She doesn’t look like our vision of power, but she’s so formidable, so unapologetic, and a survivor in every sense of the word.”      So Ginsburg is planning to be on the bench when the Supreme Court decides mammoth issues like the future of the Affordable Care Act and a national right for gay couples to marry. She says she doesn’t know how the health care case will turn out. But like practically every court observer in the country, she has a strong hunch about which way gay marriage will go: “I would be very surprised if the Supreme Court retreats from what it has said about same-sex unions.”      The speed with which the country has already accepted gay rights was, she theorized, just a matter of gay people coming out, and the rest of the country realizing that “we all knew and liked and loved people who were gay.” She recalled Justice Lewis Powell, who told his colleagues he had never met a gay person, unaware that he’d had several gay law clerks. “But they never broadcast it.”      The National Organization for Marriage, a conservative group, recently demanded that Ginsburg recuse herself from the case since she had said that it would not be difficult for the American public to accept a ruling in favor of a national right to gay marriage.      Don’t hold your breath. ||||| It’s come to this: Even those who most strongly oppose gay marriage think the Supreme Court is likely to support a constitutional right to same-sex unions — and are looking beyond Tuesday’s legal arguments to demand that Congress intervene.      Wielding placards supporting “traditional marriage” and reciting prayers for divine intervention, pastors and other social conservatives who gathered on the court’s steps Monday sounded resigned to a ruling they believe would be deeply damaging to the nation.      Story Continued Below      “We recognize that we are at a crossroads like never before in this nation’s history,” the American Decency Association’s Bill Johnson said, urging gay-marriage opponents to hope for the best but brace for the worst. “I would just say to each one of us that there is still that possibility that, despite the darkness of the day, that God answers prayers.”      “We now perhaps are days away from this very court telling us that holy matrimony between one man and one woman, ordained by God in the Garden of Eden … is merely a relic of a bygone era,” added Kay Daly of the Coalition for a Fair Judiciary. “I’m hopeful but, at the same time, I have a great deal of trepidation.”      On Tuesday, the court will hear arguments on same-sex marriage cases that could lead to a ruling forcing every state to certify gay unions. The justices’ endorsement of such a sweeping constitutional right was almost unthinkable even a decade ago, but jurisprudence has changed so quickly — alongside public opinion — that even two of the court’s most die-hard conservatives, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, seemed to concede earlier this year that the court was moving toward granting a right to marry.      Thus, those who inveighed against the evils of same-sex marriage outside the court building on Monday were already looking past the justices to Congress, urging lawmakers to support legislation that would strip federal courts of jurisdiction over marriage-related litigation and forbid officials from spending federal funds to enforce whatever the Supreme Court holds in a ruling expected by late June.      Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) introduced a bill last week that would make both such moves. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has proposed a similar measure, along with a constitutional amendment that would prohibit the federal government from interfering with state gay-marriage bans.      The anti-gay-rights activists’ concern that they may need such measures is not without foundation. While the comments of legal pundits are easy to dismiss as mere speculation, the court’s most conservative justices also seem to be among those who see the writing on the wall.      In February, when the Supreme Court refused to block an appeals court ruling requiring Alabama to recognize same-sex marriage, Thomas and Scalia joined to warn that the justices’ refusal to step in “may well be seen as a signal of the Court’s intended resolution” of the marriage cases it will hear Tuesday.      The pair of conservative justices never made exactly clear if they agreed or disagreed with the likely public assessment of where the court would come out, but their overall tone suggested that a ruling in favor of same-sex marriage might be inevitable.      Many legal observers predicted it would be at least several years before the issue of same-sex marriage returned to the high court after a pair of decisions the justices issued in 2013. One landmark, 5-4 ruling in the case of Windsor v. U.S. struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act. But the justices passed up on technical grounds a case out of California where they could have resolved the issue definitively.      The move punted the issue back to the lower federal courts, which acted with surprising speed and near-unanimity to strike down gay-marriage bans across the country.      “I don’t know if it’s a rocket docket,” said Daly. “This is dangerous in a lot of ways … It’s gratifying in one sense. It’s terrifying in another.”      However, some conservatives believe the court actually acted too slowly, particularly when it decided last October not to take up appeals from five states that asked the justices to confront the issue head-on. That gave other courts more time to issue more rulings in favor of same-sex marriage, eventually spreading the practice to 37 states. The flurry of rulings, and the justices’ refusal to stay them, created a kind of on-the-ground momentum that could be hard for the justices to reverse.      “The combination of this broadly worded but deeply confusing opinion in Windsor, coupled with their refusal to take responsibility for what lower courts have done with it, is significant,” said University of Richmond Law professor Kevin Walsh. “Once it became clear what lower courts were doing with the decision in Windsor, [the justices] should have addressed whether the Constitution requires recognizing same-sex marriage.”      A crowd gathering in advance of Tuesday's Supreme Court hearing on gay marriage. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO      In January, the high court finally agreed to wade into the issue again, granting review to cases from Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee after the federal appeals court with jurisdiction over those states — the Sixth Circuit — bucked the trend and ruled against same-sex marriage rights.      There’s a broad expectation that the Supreme Court is likely to rule at least 5-4 in favor of a federal constitutional right to same-sex marriage, with Republican-appointed Justice Anthony Kennedy joining the court’s Democratic appointees expected to back such a right.      A total of five lawyers are expected to square off during the scheduled 2½ hours of argument Tuesday.      Two private attorneys — Mary Bonauto of Gay and Lesbian Advocates & Defenders and Douglas Hallward-Driemeier, a former lawyer in the Justice Department’s Office of Solicitor General — will argue in favor of same-sex marriage rights, as will Solicitor General Donald Verrilli.      Arguing for the four state bans on gay marriage will be former Michigan Solicitor General John Bursch and Joseph Whalen, who works in the office of Tennessee’s solicitor general.      Advocates for same-sex marriage rights are expected to argue that there’s no rational basis for prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying and that, even if there were, measures that discriminate against gays and lesbians should be subjected to heightened scrutiny that such bans can’t possibly meet.      The lawyers for the states counter that there are a variety of reasons to allow states to enforce such bans, including a respect for voters who put the measures in place. Other reasons revolve around a kind of autonomy for states, as well as longtime justifications for same-sex marriage bans, including promoting male-female marriages, and encouraging procreation and child rearing.      While it hasn’t received much discussion, there is a potential twist in how the court could rule on same-sex marriage.      When the justices agreed to hear the four cases in January, the court not only asked lawyers to address the issue of whether the Constitution requires states to allow gay couples to marry but also added a question about whether states should be required to recognize marriages approved in other states.      That raises the possibility that a majority of judges could stop short of requiring states to allow same-sex couples to marry, but insist that states accept as married any couple legally married in another state. That would allow states to maintain their same-sex marriage bans, but cure some of the problems gay and lesbian married couples face relating to hospital visitation, inheritance, divorce and child-raising.      Gay rights advocates sounded confident Tuesday that the massive shift in public opinion in favor of same-sex marriage would propel the justices toward the more sweeping ruling.      “Simply put, this isn’t a question any longer of a country evolving. This country has evolved,” Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said, echoing President Barack Obama’s language as his position on the issue morphed from opposing gay marriage to embracing it.      “Now, it’s just a question of when our laws will finally catch up,” Griffin added.      The plaintiff whose name leads off the cases the Supreme Court will hear Tuesday, Jim Obergefell of Ohio, said he’s surprised at how quickly the country has come to accept same-sex marriage in the wake of the last pair of rulings from the justices in 2013.      “The last two years it’s been amazing how much has changed and how quickly it’s changed,” said Obergefell, who married his terminally ill, long-term partner John Arthur in an unusual ceremony aboard a medical aircraft at the Baltimore airport in 2013. Arthur died a few months later. Obergefell is fighting for the right to be listed as Arthur’s husband on his death certificate.      “What I hope will happen in June is long overdue, but I have to be happy that it is on the verge of happening,” Obergefell said. ||||| Lawyers and friends of Kennedy are reluctant to speak for the record, but most of them do not believe his views on gay rights stem from personal experience, such as having a child, relative or close friend who is gay. Instead, Kennedy's friends and former law clerks point to a repeated theme running through his court opinions — that the Constitution protects \\"dignity\\" and \\"decency,\\" two concepts that sometimes align him with liberals. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Religious leaders are calling on members of the Supreme Court’s liberal wing to recuse themselves from the blockbuster gay marriage case that the court will begin considering on Tuesday."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed. Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

Usage: 'I_LOOK' corresponds to the command 'look'. It meets the criteria because it is one of the specified actions and its command is in lowercase. Part #2: Directional words 'left' and 'right'. Usage: In the command 'turn left', 'left' denotes the direction of turning. It meets the criteria because it is used to specify the direction of an action. Part #3: The word 'opposite' for turning the agent backward. Usage: For the action pair 'I_TURN_LEFT' followed by 'I_TURN_RIGHT', the command would be 'turn left and turn right'. It meets the criteria because it follows the instruction that the word 'and' can be used to execute multiple actions sequentially. Part #4: The word 'around' to execute an action while turning around. Usage: For 'I_TURN_LEFT' followed by 'I_JUMP', the command would be 'jump around left'. It meets the criteria because it demonstrates that an action like 'jump' can be executed while the agent turns around in a specified direction. Part #5: The word 'and' for executing multiple actions sequentially. Usage: In the command 'turn left and walk', the agent will 'turn left' and then 'walk'. It meets the criteria because it follows the instruction that the word 'and' means executing the next action after the previous one. Part #6: The word 'after' for indicating the order of actions. Usage: In the command 'walk after turn left', the agent will 'turn left' and then 'walk'.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I went about it: 1. I started by going through the given list: [-62, 6, -29, -32, -63, -82, 59, -38, 95, -1] 2. Next, I checked each number in the list to determine if it's even or odd. 3. An even number is any number that is divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder. In other words, if a number can be divided by 2 and results in a whole number, it's considered even. Now I will check each number: - -62 is even, since it can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder (-62/2 = -31). - 6 is even (6/2 = 3). - -29 is odd since it can't be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder (-29/2 = -14.5). - -32 is even (-32/2 = -16). - -63 is odd (-63/2 = -31.5). - -82 is even (-82/2 = -41). - 59 is odd (59/2 = 29.5). - -38 is even (-38/2 = -19). - 95 is odd (95/2 = 47.5). - -1 is odd (-1/2 = -0.5). 4. Based on the above checks, I removed the odd numbers from the list and kept only the even numbers: [-62, 6, -32, -82, -38]. 5.

In June 1426 Hussite forces, led by Prokop and Sigismund Korybut, significantly defeated the invaders in the Battle of Aussig. Despite this result, the death of Jan Žižka caused many, including Pope Martin V, to believe that the Hussites were much weakened. Martin proclaimed yet another crusade in 1427. He appointed Cardinal Henry Beaufort of England as Papal Legate of Germany, Hungary, and Bohemia, to lead the crusader forces. The crusaders were defeated at the Battle of Tachov. The Hussites subsequently invaded parts of Germany several times, though they made no attempt to occupy permanently any part of the country. Korybut was imprisoned in 1427 for allegedly conspiring to surrender the Hussite forces to Sigismund of Hungary. He was released in 1428, and participated in the Hussite invasion of Silesia. But after a few years, Korybut returned to Poland with his men. Korybut and his Poles, however, did not really want to leave; but the Pope threatened to call a crusade against Poland if they did not.

Saying Investigation Is Over, Police Release Final Sandy Hook Shooting Report Authorities in Connecticut released a final report on Friday outlining the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., on Dec. 14, 2012, providing the most complete account to date for one of the nationâs most wrenching massacres. It contained hundreds of photographs, hours of video and voluminous crime scene reports. The stateâs Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection said that the release of the full report, which included many redactions, âis indicative that this State Police criminal investigation is concluded.â Questions of how and when to release sensitive investigative details from the shooting have been prevalent since shortly after the massacre, which left 20 first graders and six adults from the school dead. The shooter, Adam Lanza, 20, also killed his mother and himself. In a letter accompanying the report, Reuben F. Bradford, the commissioner of the stateâs Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, said that the names and âcontextually identifying information of involved childrenâ were withheld, including descriptions of the children, their clothing and their belongings. He added that âall visual images depicting the deceased have been withheld, as well as written descriptions whose disclosure would be highly offensive to a reasonable person and would violate the constitutional rights of the families.â Mr. Bradford said that balancing the âoften competing interests of government transparency and individual privacy has been difficult.â Stephen J. Sedensky III, the stateâs attorney in Danbury, had fought to keep private the recordings of 911 calls made from the school. But Judge Eliot D. Prescott of the Superior Court in New Britain ruled last month that there was no legal basis to keep the recordings secret; they were released on Dec. 4. He said their release âmay serve to vindicate and support the professionalism and bravery of first responders.â The recordsâ release on Friday followed the issuance of a far shorter report last month by Mr. Sedenskyâs office. At the time, the account provided the most detail yet about Mr. Lanzaâs final months â his bedroom windows covered with black trash bags, as he passed time playing violent video games and spoke to his mother only over email, even though they shared a floor in a house on Yogananda Street. But the stateâs attorneyâs report did not offer a motive for the massacre. It also did not name the children who died, nor did it include graphic descriptions of the crime scene. âThere is no clear indication why Sandy Hook Elementary School was selected,â Mr. Sedensky wrote then, âother than perhaps its close proximity to the shooterâs home.â Mr. Lanza had created a spreadsheet of some of the worst massacres in American history, according to the authorities, and seemed to carefully plan his attack. According to information from a GPS device, he had driven to the area of the school one day earlier, while his mother was away. Around 9:34 a.m. on Dec. 14, Mr. Lanza blasted through the glass windows at the schoolâs locked entrance, the police said. At 9:40, he shot himself in a first-grade classroom. Mr. Bradford, from the Emergency Services and Public Protection Department, said that while the investigation was closed âfor administrative purposes,â additional supplemental reports might be released in the coming months. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The Connecticut authorities released a final report on the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that took place on December 14, 2012, in Newtown.

Information about the deceased was also withheld, as it would violate the constitutional rights of the families. Balancing government transparency and individual privacy has been challenging during the investigation and release of the Sandy Hook report. Last month, recordings of 911 calls from the school were released, following a judge’s decision. The motive for the shooting is still unclear, but it is suggested that Lanza selected Sandy Hook Elementary School due to its close proximity to his home.

The instrumental case is used here to indicate the tools or means (in this case, the processes of developing and implementing) needed to complete the action. 6. \\"The special State Program\\" can be translated as \\"специальной Государственной программы\\". \\"Special\\" is translated as \\"специальной\\", acting as an adjective to describe the program. \\"State Program\\" is translated as \\"Государственная программа\\", capitalizing \\"Государственная\\" (state) and \\"программа\\" (program) to emphasize the importance and official nature of the program. Hence, the final translation is: \\"Сегодня правительственные и общественные организации в Узбекистане работают над разработкой и внедрением специальной Государственной программы.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Regretting that tattoo you got? Cheer up: There's a good chance a dermatologist can remove it for you -- but success is going to depend on a number of factors, including how big the tattoo is, what colors it contains and whether you smoke.      Italian researchers who treated 352 people between 1995 and 2010 say they are the first to fully explore the factors that make some tattoos harder to remove than others. Their findings were published online Monday in the Archives of Dermatology.      The doctors used the current standard procedure for tattoo removal, which involves repeated laser treatments spaced several weeks apart. The devices they used, called Q-switched lasers, removed tattoos for 47% of patients in 10 sessions, nearly 75% in 15 sessions.      But success varied. Tattoos were harder to remove if they were:      -- More than 12 inches.      -- Colors other than black or red.      -- More than three years old.      -- On feet or legs.      -- On a smoker. Smoking may impair natural healing processes that help clear ink after treatment, researchers say.      A separate study in the journal looked at a newer laser, not yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and found it removed more than 75% of tattoo ink in an average of four sessions. But the study of the picosecond laser included only 12 patients and did not directly compare it with the standard lasers. It was partially funded by Cynosure, Inc., the manufacturer.      Typical side effects for any laser treatment can include pain, redness and swelling, says Nazanin Saedi, director of laser surgery and cosmetic dermatology at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. She worked on the study of the picosecond laser when she was a fellow at SkinCare Physicians in Chestnut Hills, Mass.      But it's the cost, in time and money that discourages many peoplewho want their tattoos removed, says George Hruza, clinical professor of dermatology at St. Louis University in Missouri. He says he charges 200 to 600 per laser session, depending on how big and difficult-to-remove a tattoo is. He says doctors are experimenting with several techniques that might speed up a process that can take a year or two and, in extreme cases, \\"cost as much as car.\\"      Still, it's a growing business, Hruza says, thanks to the rising popularity of tattoos and the inevitable regrets among some people who get them. \\"Some people come in a week after they get the tattoo,\\" he adds.                  Maybe it's a good thing that most people seem to like their tattoos: 21% of adults have at least one tattoo and just 14% of those who have them regret them, according to a recent ||||| As growing numbers of people rue the tattoos they got in their youth, a new study has found that tattoo removal is less likely to succeed if the person is a smoker, the design contains colors such as blue or yellow and is larger than 12 inches.      The study is believed to be the first research that looked at several factors—which included tattoo size and location on the body—involved with successful tattoo removal, according to the researchers.      As more people rue the tattoos they got in their youth, a new study has found that tattoo removal is less likely to succeed if the skin design contains certain colors. Jennifer Corbett Dorren has details on Lunch Break. Photo: Getty Images.      The standard procedure for removing tattoos currently is treatment with a laser called a Q-switched laser, or QSL, applied over a number of sessions. But the technique can lose its effectiveness depending on certain variables, according to the study, published online on Monday in the American Medical Association's Archives of Dermatology.      Smoking, for instance, can reduce by 70% the chance of successfully removing a tattoo after 10 treatment sessions.      Dermatologists have long known certain colors are easier to remove than others, but the findings on the impact of smoking on tattoo removal are new.      The research was conducted at a laser-surgery center in Milan, Italy, from 1995 through 2010. There were 352 people in the study, of which 201 were men, with a median age of 30 years old.      As many as 22% of U.S. college students have at least one tattoo, according to background information in the study, and about half of people who get tattoos later try to have them removed.      In order to remove tattoos, patients must undergo about 10 laser treatments several weeks apart. The light from the laser targets pigments in the ink of the tattoo and helps the ink break down. Over time the ink is removed through the body's lymphatic system. Each treatment costs about 200 and isn't covered by insurance.      Overall, the study found about 47% of people had their tattoos successfully removed after 10 laser treatments and it took 15 treatments to remove tattoos from 75% of patients.      Black and red pigments in tattoos were most easily removed. All-black tattoos had a 58% successful-removal rate, while tattoos with black and red pigments had a 51% success rate after 10 treatments. The presence of other colors such as greens, yellows or blues reduced the chances of effective removal of a tattoo by as much as 80%, the study found. Other factors that reduced the procedure's success included a design larger than 12 inches or one located on the feet or legs.      Karthik Krishnamurthy, director of the cosmetic dermatology clinic at Montefiore Medical Center in Bronx, N.Y., who wasn't involved in the study, explained that black and red inks absorb the wavelength of light emitted by the QSL laser better than other colors.      Older tattoos are harder to remove in part because the ink particles move deeper into the skin over time, the researchers said. And smoking is believed to hinder tattoo removal because smoking is known to hinder wound healing.      The researchers also found that the amount of time between QSL treatment sessions was important to the technique's success. Treatment intervals of eight weeks or less were found to be less effective for tattoo removal.      A separate study, also published in the Archives of Dermatology, however, suggests a different type of laser currently in development called a picosecond alexandrite laser, can remove tattoos with fewer treatments than the QSL laser.      The study involved 15 patients and was partly funded by Cynosure Inc., a Westford, Mass., firm that is waiting for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to clear its picosecond laser for marketing.      Most patients could have their tattoos removed with four or fewer treatments, said one of the study's authors, Nazanin Saedi, who was a fellow at SkinCare Physicians in Chestnut Hill, Mass., where the study was conducted. Dr. Saedi is now an assistant professor and director of laser surgery and cosmetic dermatology at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.

The 30 miles of steep roads that snake through the mountains of Logan Canyon in Utah are enough to make most drivers'hands sweat. But Andersen, a 46-year-old father of four, wasn't expecting any trouble on the road last New Year's Eve, when he set off for a ski trip to the Bear River Mountains with nine-year-old daughter Mia, four-old son Baylor, and nine-year-old neighbor Kenya. Andersen had driven through the Canyon hundreds of times over the years. The weather was fine-but the higher they drove, the more slippery the roads became. Rounding a sharp U-turn at mile marker473, Andersen saw a truck that had skated off the road and immediately tapped his brakes. In an instant, the car was sliding at 25 miles per hour toward the shoulder of the highway, then rolling down a steep ten-foot dam toward the extremely cold Logan River. As it hit the water, the car tipped toward the passenger side, hesitated, and then rolled onto its roof and sank into the river. There was no time to tell the kids what to do. The crash had broken a few windows, and within seconds, the upside-down car was filled with water. \\"It was frightening how fast we were completely underwater,\\"remembers Andersen, a soft-spoken product development manager.\\"You're thinking, is this how it's all going to end?\\" Having lost all sense of direction, Andersen began to search the freezing water for the kids.

In addition, the weather was fine on that New Year's Eve, which further led Andersen to believe that the drive to the Bear River Mountains would be uneventful. However, despite his familiarity with the road and the seemingly favorable weather conditions, Andersen found that the higher they drove, the more slippery the roads became due to ice. This unexpected slipperiness ultimately caused the car accident that led to their vehicle falling into the freezing cold Logan River. As the car rolled into the river, its windows broke, and it was quickly filled with water, endangering Andersen and the three children who were with him: his nine-year-old daughter Mia, four-year-old son Baylor, and nine-year-old neighbor Kenya.

These brave men were able to help Andersen safely retrieve all three children from the submerged vehicle, shouting with concern about who else might still be trapped inside.

Possible A: veldt, ocean, savannah, africa, jungle  Why is \\"africa\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","output":"\\"Africa\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is a continent known to have diverse habitats, including grasslands, savannahs, and jungles, where lions are commonly found. Africa is home to the largest lion population, and these big cats are native to several African countries. The other possible answers provided in the question can be analyzed as follows: 1. Veldt: Veldt, also known as veld, refers to the open grasslands of South Africa, which is an African country. Lions reside in grasslands and savannahs, making the veldt a suitable habitat for lions. However, this answer is region-specific to South Africa, while Africa is broad and encompasses a variety of lion habitats. 2. Ocean: Lions are not aquatic animals and do not live in the ocean. They are terrestrial mammals known for their preference for dry regions and grasslands. 3. Savannah: Savannahs are tropical grasslands with scattered trees, and they are one of the primary habitats where lions are found. The African savannah is particularly famous for its lion population. However, using \\"Africa\\" as the answer would cover other habitats where lions are found in addition to savannahs. 4. Jungle: Lions typically prefer open areas, such as grasslands and savannahs, where they can more easily hunt their prey. However, some lions may inhabit the jungle in West and Central Africa or the forests of the Gir National Park in India, making it another possible answer connected with human common sense. That said, using \\"Africa\\" as the answer still encompasses more habitats, including the jungle. In conclusion, \\"Africa\\" as an answer is aligned with human common sense because it acknowledges the continent's diverse habitats and locations where lions naturally dwell. This answer covers grasslands, savannahs, and jungles within Africa, making it a more comprehensive choice compared to more specific options like veldt or savannah."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: I've got the wind up somehow. Hypothesis: I've got the wind up before the pitch. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we must first analyze what the premise and the hypothesis mean. Here, we'll break down the meaning of each and then discuss the relationship between them. Premise: \\"I've got the wind up somehow.\\" In this context, \\"wind up\\" is an idiomatic expression which means to be agitated, anxious, nervous, or worried about something. When someone says they have the wind up \\"somehow,\\" it implies that the cause or the reason for being anxious is not entirely known, or perhaps there are multiple possible causes. This premise focuses on the emotional state of an individual who experiences anxiety or nervousness due to an uncertain situation. Hypothesis: \\"I've got the wind up before the pitch.\\" This hypothesis is introducing a specific scenario in which the speaker is suggesting that their anxiety or nervousness is occurring \\"before the pitch.\\" The phrase \\"the pitch\\" likely refers to an event in a sports context, such as baseball, where a pitcher throws a ball to a batter, or in a broader sense, it could refer to a presentation or proposal made to someone else, such as a sales pitch. In either sense, the emotional state in the hypothesis remains the same. The nervousness or anxiety is being experienced, however, now the cause of that emotional state is identified as occurring before a particular event (\\"the pitch\\"). Now, let's examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise reveals an emotional state of unease without providing a specific cause or situation. In contrast, the hypothesis provides a specific context concerning when this emotional state occurs. In this case, it is before an event, such as a presentation or a sports match. If we consider the premise as a superset of all possible situations where someone might have the wind up for unknown or uncertain reasons, the hypothesis can be seen as a subset of these situations, referring specifically to the time before a pitch. In other words, the hypothesis is offering a more focused context than that of the premise. However, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is necessarily entailed by the premise. The premise leaves room for various possibilities, whereas the hypothesis presents a specific context. Although the hypothesis could potentially be one example falling within the broader scope of the premise, it cannot be said that the premise necessarily leads to or infers the hypothesis's exact context. In summary, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. While both the premise and the hypothesis explore circumstances in which an individual experiences anxiety, the premise does not provide enough information to determine that the anxiety is occurring before a pitch. The hypothesis, on the other hand, narrows down the context and specifies the situation where the anxiety occurs. So, while the hypothesis may be a valid example of a situation in which someone has \\"the wind up,\\" it is not entirely dictated by the premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By Meghan Keneally PUBLISHED: 14:22 EST, 6 December 2013 | UPDATED: 16:55 EST, 6 December 2013 Bode Miller's wife is now saying that it was 'fate' that she had a miscarriage earlier this year because they wouldn't have been able to spend as much time with his baby from a previous relationship. How much time they are able to spend with the 9-month old is the basis of a contentious custody battle between the Olympian skier and his ex-girlfriend Sara McKenna. McKenna, an ex-marine who moved from California to New York when she was seven months pregnant, was awarded temporary custody of her young son over the Thanksgiving holiday, but now the bitter exes and their legal teams will be back in a Manhattan court next week for the next hearing. That reason is the fact that they want to gain more legal access to Bode's son with OPTIONS: - Bode, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. - Bode Miller, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. - California, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. - Manhattan, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. - McKenna, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. - Meghan Keneally, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. - Miller, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. - Nate vs Sam, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. - New York, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. - Olympian, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. - Sara McKenna, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. - Thanksgiving, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names.","output":"- McKenna, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What did the captain from West Point do as soon as he gets to Furnace Creek? is inside the article: Troops are massacred at a Furnace Creek fort in 1880 after an army captain, Walsh, cites orders forcing him to abandon a wagon train. Apache Indians hid inside the wagons to gain access to the fort. General Blackwell is blamed for the incident and court-martialed. Denying that he sent any such order, the general has a stroke and dies on the witness stand. No written evidence of the order is presented. One of his sons, Rufe, a captain from West Point, travels west to find out what happened. His brother, Cash, reads of their father's death in a Kansas City newspaper and also heads toward Furnace Creek in search of answers. Using an alias, Cash learns that Capt. Walsh has become a drunkard. A mining boss, Leverett, is impressed by the stranger in town and hires him, not knowing Cash's real name or intent. Rufe arrives in town and also assumes a false identity. Cafe waitress Molly Baxter, whose father was killed at the fort, still considers General Blackwell the man to blame. But the real villain is Leverett, who bribed Walsh and organized the Apache raid. A guilty conscience causes Walsh to write a confession. Leverett sends one of his henchmen to do away with Walsh, but the confession is found by Cash. Rufe is framed, arrested and tried, but escapes. Cash gives him the confession and tells him to take it to the Army as proof.

Now answer this question: What are the two dialectical groups of Catalan?","output":"The Catalan language is divided into two main dialectical groups: Eastern Catalan and Western Catalan.

Eastern Catalan primarily includes dialects spoken in the eastern regions of Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, and the Roussillon area of France, while Western Catalan encompasses dialects spoken in the Valencian Community, western parts of Catalonia, and the eastern regions of Aragon.

Despite these dialectal variations, the two groups still maintain a high level of mutual intelligibility. Within each of these two groups, any lexical divergence can be explained as an archaism, implying that the variations are due to the retention of certain linguistic features from older forms of the language.

He and his gang are particularly upset by the hanging of a friend by Braxton, a land baron who takes the law into his own hands. Logan's men pull off a daring train robbery, only to lose much of the money. They decide to seek vengeance against Braxton by killing his foreman Pete Marker and by buying a small property close to Braxton's ranch, then rustling his stock. First the gang, without Logan, rides off across the Missouri River and north of the border to steal horses belonging to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. In their absence, Logan plants crops and enters into a relationship with Braxton's virginal daughter, Jane. Braxton is obsessed with both his rustling problem and his daughter. He sends for Robert E. Lee Clayton, a notorious \\"regulator\\" who, for a price, will take care of rustlers personally. Clayton arrives with a fancy wardrobe, a perfumed scent, an Irish brogue and a Creedmoor rifle (a Model 1859 Sharps rifle) with which he is deadly accurate from a very long distance. Quickly suspicious of Logan, who doesn't strike him as a farmer, Clayton dons a variety of disguises and begins to pick off Logan's gang, one by one. Identifying himself as \\"Jim Ferguson,\\" he kills Logan's young friend Little Tod by dragging him with a rope through the raging Missouri. Clayton spies on Logan with binoculars and taunts Braxton about his daughter's affair with a horse thief. Braxton attempts to discharge him but Clayton is determined to finish what he starts. He amuses himself by shooting two more of Logan's partners, Cary and Cy, from a distance and then by wearing a \\"granny\\" dress while brutally killing Logan's closest friend, Cal, with a handmade weapon.

The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command.

However, senior district judge Howard Riddle invited prosecutors to appeal. Long-running case: Rancadore and his wife report at Uxbridge Police Station in West London on March 18.

Q:Given the following context:  After several years having focused entirely on his career with the Regional Information Service, Jaojoby was approached in 1987 by Frenchman Pierre Henri Donat to contribute several recordings to Madagascar's first salegy compilation album, Les Grands Maîtres du Salegy (\\"Grand Masters of Salegy\\"). The runaway success of one of the tracks he composed and performed, \\"Samy Mandeha Samy Mitady\\", elevated salegy from a regional genre to one of nationwide popularity, leading a newspaper to declare him the \\"King of Salegy\\". High demand for live performances led the singer to return to Antananarivo in 1988 to form a band named \\"Jaojoby\\" that included former bandmates from Los Matadores and The Players. Jaojoby begin touring regularly at home and abroad, performing his first international concerts in Paris in 1989.

Jaojoby's second album, Velono, was the first salegy album to be recorded in France, as well as the first of his albums to be produced in a professional-quality recording studio. Following the 1994 release of Velono, Jaojoby became a regular on the international music festival circuit and has performed at such events as WOMAD in Reading, the Festival du Bout du Monde in Brittany, WOMEX in Spain, the Festival des Musiques Métisses in Angoulême, the MASA Festival in Abidjan, and similar events in Germany, the Netherlands, and Portugal. Jaojoby's excitement over his rise to international celebrity was attenuated by the 1995 death of the band's original drummer, Jean-Claude Djaonarana, who had first performed with Jaojoby as a member of Los Matadores.  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person who formed the band named Jaojoby?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - The nuclei of some atoms have too few or too many neutrons - The atoms become unstable - The atoms split - In alpha decay, two protons and two neutrons are released from the atom - In beta decay, a neutron changes into a proton and an electron - The proton joins the nucleus of the atom - The electron is released -   Question: suppose if the nuclei is altered happens, how will it affect the radioactivity level will increase.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"The phenomenon of alteration in the nuclei of atoms, particularly in terms of the number of neutrons, can lead to an increase in radioactivity levels. When an atom's nucleus has too few or too many neutrons, it becomes unstable, resulting in the atom undergoing radioactive decay. The two main types of decay are alpha decay and beta decay, with each type affecting radioactivity levels differently. When an atom undergoes alpha decay, it releases an alpha particle, consisting of two protons and two neutrons. This event signifies a transformation of the original atom into a different element. Consequently, the release of these subatomic particles increases the radioactivity of the surrounding environment, as well as causes the formation of a new element with a different atomic mass and number. On the other hand, beta decay occurs when a neutron in an unstable nucleus transforms into a proton and an electron. The proton remains within the nucleus, while the electron, also known as a beta particle, is released into the environment. Similar to alpha decay, beta decay leads to an increase in radioactivity levels and the formation of a different element. Supposing that a disturbance occurs in the nuclei of specific atoms, causing them to have an altered balance between protons and neutrons, this, in turn, will impact the rate of radioactive decay that these atoms exhibit. When considering the second effect mentioned, which is the increase in radioactivity levels due to particle emission, the perturbation of the nuclei will likely lead to a quantitative change in the rate of decay. If the perturbation causes the atom to become more unstable, the rate of radioactive decay and consequent radioactivity levels will increase. This is because a higher number of unstable atoms will decay more rapidly, releasing a greater amount of subatomic particles into the environment, thus increasing the radioactivity. Alternatively, if the perturbation somehow restores stability to the nucleus or makes it less prone to decay, the radioactivity levels may decrease or have no effect. In such a case, fewer subatomic particles would be released into the environment, minimizing or stabilizing radioactivity levels. In conclusion, the effect of nuclear perturbations on radioactivity levels depends on the degree and nature of the disturbance. The outcome can lead to an increase, decrease, or have no effect on radioactivity levels, considering the specific conditions of the alteration and the overall stability of the affected atoms."},{"instruction":"Answer the question below:   Kathy did some experiments on two different alkanes and one of the alkanes had twice as many carbon atoms than the other.

An illness prevented Merckx from taking part in the Milan-San Remo at the start of the 1973 calendar. During a span of nineteen days, Merckx won four classics including Omloop Het Volk, Liege-Bastogne-Liege, and Paris-Roubaix. He decided to race the Vuelta a Espana and the Giro d'Italia, instead of racing the Tour de France. He won the opening prologue of the Vuelta to take an early lead. Despite Ocana's best efforts, Merckx won a total of six stages on his way to his only Vuelta a Espana title. In addition to the general classification, Merckx won the race's points classification and combination classifications.  Four days after the conclusion of the Vuelta, Merckx lined up to start the Giro d'Italia. He won the opening two-man time trial with Roger Swerts and the next day's leg as well. Merckx's primary competitor, Fuente, lost a significant amount of time during the second stage. He won eighth stage that featured a summit finish to Monte Carpegna despite Fuente attacking several times on the ascent. Fuente tried attacking throughout the race of the race, but was only able to make time gains on the race's penultimate stage. Merckx won the race after leading from start to finish, a feat only previously done by Alfredo Binda and Costante Girardengo. He also became the first rider to win the Giro and Vuelta in the same calendar year.  The UCI Road World Championships were held in Barcelona, Spain in 1973 and contested on the Montjuich circuit. During the road race, Merckx attacked with around one hundred kilometers left. His move was marked by Freddy Maertens, Gimondi, and Ocana. Merckx attacked on the final lap, but was reeled in by the three riders. It came down to a sprint between the four, of which Merckx came in last and Gimondi in first.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Idea of New Attention Disorder Spurs Research, and Debate With more than six million American children having received a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, concern has been rising that the condition is being significantly misdiagnosed and overtreated with prescription medications. Yet now some powerful figures in mental health are claiming to have identified a new disorder that could vastly expand the ranks of young people treated for attention problems. Called sluggish cognitive tempo, the condition is said to be characterized by lethargy, daydreaming and slow mental processing. By some researchers’ estimates, it is present in perhaps two million children. Experts pushing for more research into sluggish cognitive tempo say it is gaining momentum toward recognition as a legitimate disorder — and, as such, a candidate for pharmacological treatment. Some of the condition’s researchers have helped Eli Lilly investigate how its flagship A.D.H.D. drug might treat it. The Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology devoted 136 pages of its January issue to papers describing the illness, with the lead paper claiming that the question of its existence “seems to be laid to rest as of this issue.” The psychologist Russell Barkley of the Medical University of South Carolina, for 30 years one of A.D.H.D.’s most influential and visible proponents, has claimed in research papers and lectures that sluggish cognitive tempo “has become the new attention disorder.” In an interview, Keith McBurnett, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, and co-author of several papers on sluggish cognitive tempo, said: “When you start talking about things like daydreaming, mind-wandering, those types of behaviors, someone who has a son or daughter who does this excessively says, ‘I know about this from my own experience.’ They know what you’re talking about.” Yet some experts, including Dr. McBurnett and some members of the journal’s editorial board, say that there is no consensus on the new disorder’s specific symptoms, let alone scientific validity. They warn that the concept’s promotion without vastly more scientific rigor could expose children to unwarranted diagnoses and prescription medications — problems that A.D.H.D. already faces. “We’re seeing a fad in evolution: Just as A.D.H.D. has been the diagnosis du jour for 15 years or so, this is the beginning of another,” said Dr. Allen Frances, an emeritus professor of psychiatry at Duke University. “This is a public health experiment on millions of kids.” Though the concept of sluggish cognitive tempo, or S.C.T., has been researched sporadically since the 1980s, it has never been recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which codifies conditions recognized by the American Psychiatric Association. The editor in chief of The Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology, Charlotte Johnston, said in an email that recent renewed interest in the condition is what led the journal to devote most of one issue to “highlight areas in which further study is needed.” Dr. Barkley declined repeated requests for interviews about his work and statements regarding sluggish cognitive tempo. Several of the field’s other key researchers, Stephen P. Becker of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Benjamin B. Lahey of the University of Chicago and Stephen A. Marshall of Ohio University, also declined to comment on their work. Papers have proposed that a recognition of sluggish cognitive tempo could help resolve some longstanding confusion about A.D.H.D., which despite having hyperactivity in its name includes about two million children who are not hyperactive, merely inattentive. Some researchers propose that about half of those children would be better classified as having sluggish cognitive tempo, with perhaps one million additional children, who do not meet A.D.H.D.’s criteria now, having the new disorder, too. “These children are not the ones giving adults much trouble, so they’re easy to miss,” Dr. McBurnett said. “They’re the daydreamy ones, the ones with work that’s not turned in, leaving names off of papers or skipping questions, things like that, that impinge on grades or performance. So anything we can do to understand what’s going on with these kids is a good thing.” But Dr. McBurnett added that sluggish cognitive tempo remained many years from any scientific consensus: “We haven’t even agreed on the symptom list — that’s how early on we are in the process.” Steve S. Lee, an associate professor of psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles, who serves on the editorial board of The Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology, said in an interview that he was conflicted over the journal’s emphasis on sluggish cognitive tempo. He expressed concern that A.D.H.D. had already grown to encompass too many children with common youthful behavior, or whose problems are derived not from a neurological disorder but from inadequate sleep, a different learning disability or other sources. About two-thirds of children with an A.D.H.D. diagnosis take daily medication such as Adderall or Concerta, which often quells severe impulsiveness and inattention but also carries risks for insomnia, appetite suppression and, among teenagers and adults, abuse or addiction. “The scientist part of me says we need to pursue knowledge, but we know that people will start saying their kids have it, and doctors will start diagnosing it and prescribing for it long before we know whether it’s real,” Dr. Lee said. “A.D.H.D. has become a public health, societal question, and it’s a fair question to ask of S.C.T. We better pump the brakes more diligently.” Dr. McBurnett recently conducted a clinical trial funded and overseen by Eli Lilly that investigated whether proposed symptoms of sluggish cognitive tempo could be treated with Strattera, the company’s primary A.D.H.D. drug. (One of Strattera’s selling points is that it is not a stimulant like Adderall and Concerta, medications more susceptible to abuse.) His study, published in The Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology, concluded, “This is the first study to report significant effects of any medication on S.C.T.” An Eli Lilly spokeswoman said in an email, “Sluggish cognitive tempo is one of many conditions that Lilly scientists continue to study to help satisfy unmet medical needs around the world.” Representatives of the drug companies that make the best-selling medications for A.D.H.D. — Shire (extended-release Adderall and Vyvanse), Novartis (Focalin) and Janssen (Concerta) — said they are not currently conducting research into sluggish cognitive tempo. However, because the new condition shares so many symptoms with A.D.H.D., these products might easily be repositioned to serve the new market. Dr. Barkley, who has said that “S.C.T. is a newly recognized disorder,” also has financial ties to Eli Lilly; he received 118,000 from 2009 to 2012 for consulting and speaking engagements, according to propublica.org. While detailing sluggish cognitive tempo in The Journal of Psychiatric Practice, Dr. Barkley stated that Strattera’s performance on sluggish cognitive tempo symptoms was “an exciting finding.” Dr. Barkley has also published a symptom checklist for mental health professionals to identify adults with the condition; the forms are available for 131.75 apiece from Guilford Press, which funds some of his research. Dr. Barkley, who edits sluggish cognitive tempo’s Wikipedia page, declined a request to discuss his financial interests in the condition’s acceptance. “I have no doubt there are kids who meet the criteria for this thing, but nothing is more irrelevant,” Dr. Frances said. “The enthusiasts here are thinking of missed patients. What about the mislabeled kids who are called patients when there’s nothing wrong with them? They are not considering what is happening in the real world.” An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of one of the researchers of sluggish cognitive tempo. He is Stephen P. Becker, not Steven. In addition, the article misstated the institution with which another researcher, Stephen A. Marshall, is affiliated. It is Ohio University, not Miami University in Ohio.

How is \\"Many studies are underway in the Mountain National Parks.\\" said in French?","output":"In French, the sentence \\"Many studies are underway in the Mountain National Parks\\" can be translated as \\"De nombreuses études sont en cours dans les parcs nationaux de montagne.\\" To break this translation down, we can divide it into the following components: 1. \\"De nombreuses études\\" (Many studies): \\"De nombreuses\\" is the term used to convey the meaning of many or numerous, and \\"études\\" is the French word for studies or research. 2. \\"sont en cours\\" (are underway): The French phrase \\"en cours\\" signifies something that is ongoing or currently happening. When combined with the verb \\"sont\\" (which is the conjugation of the verb \\"être\\" or \\"to be\\" for plural nouns), it communicates that there are multiple studies currently taking place. 3. \\"dans les parcs nationaux de montagne\\" (in the Mountain National Parks): \\"Dans\\" is the preposition used to indicate location or placement, and \\"les parcs nationaux\\" translates to \\"the national parks.\\" To specify the type of national park, \\"de montagne\\" (of mountain) is added after the noun, signifying that these studies are taking place in mountainous national parks.

Write an article with the title: \\"CIA torture architect breaks silence to defend 'enhanced interrogation'\\" Article:","output":"Title: CIA Torture Architect Breaks Silence to Defend 'Enhanced Interrogation' Introduction: In a surprising move, the architect behind the CIA's notorious torture program, known as \\"enhanced interrogation,\\" has come forward to defend the controversial practices that were implemented during the post-9/11 era. This marks the first time that a high-ranking official from the intelligence community has spoken publicly about the morally contentious techniques, including waterboarding, stress positions, and sleep deprivation. Step 1 - Present the subject's key points: Dr. James Mitchell, a retired Air Force psychologist and contractor for the CIA, has recently broken his silence to justify the use of enhanced interrogation techniques. In his defense, Dr. Mitchell claims that the methods were necessary to extract vital information from high-profile terrorists, ultimately leading to the prevention of further attacks on American soil. He also emphasizes that the tactics were legal and authorized by government officials, although acknowledging the discomfort involved for detainees. Step 2 - Delve into the background of the enhanced interrogation program: The CIA initiated the enhanced interrogation program soon after the 9/11 attacks, under the Bush administration. It continued until 2009, during which time several captured terrorists, such as Kahlid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind behind the attacks, were subjected to these controversial methods. These tactics have been widely criticized due to their inhumane nature and have caused significant damage to America's global standing and reputation. Step 3 - Highlight the key criticisms of the program: Human rights organizations, members of Congress, and the international community have heavily criticized the CIA's enhanced interrogation program. They argue that the tactics utilized amount to torture, which violates both U.S. and international law. Critics also point out the methods' lack of effectiveness, citing instances where detainees provided false or already accessible information under duress, leading to wasted resources and misguided intelligence actions. Step 4 - Include Dr. Mitchell's counterarguments: Dr. Mitchell rebuts the criticism by stating that the enhanced interrogation program did, in fact, yield valuable information that would not have been obtained otherwise. He insists that the discomfort experienced by detainees during the process was carefully calibrated to leave no long-term physical or psychological harm. Mitchell also cites the urgency of the post-9/11 environment, suggesting that unconventional methods like waterboarding were necessary under such extraordinary circumstances. Step 5 - Discuss current perspectives and ongoing debate: While President Obama officially put an end to the enhanced interrogation program in 2009, the debate surrounding its moral and legal implications remains heated. Both the U.S. government and the CIA have continued to grapple with the challenging legacy of the era. Dr. Mitchell's decision to defend the program publicly adds another dimension to the conversation and raises new questions about the ethical boundaries of national security measures. Conclusion: Dr. James Mitchell's public defense of the CIA's enhanced interrogation program has reignited the debate regarding the delicate balance between national security and adherence to ethical standards. As the world faces new and evolving threats, it's crucial to develop effective strategies that protect not only the physical safety of citizens but also the foundational principles that underpin democratic societies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: While many women are busy with planning their bridal showers  , a baby shower usually comes as a complete surprise. A baby shower is a party where a pregnant   woman is \\"showered\\" with gifts and good wishes. A baby shower is usually given by a close female friend or a relative of the mother-to-be. Sometimes co-workers of a pregnant person will also hold a baby shower for her. The baby shower is usually given when the mother-to-be is between 6 and 9 months pregnant. _ the date of a baby's birth isn't always exact. Sometimes a baby shower can also happen after the baby is born. A baby shower can be held in someone's home or outside, like in a restaurant or a catering hall. Traditionally only women are invited to a baby shower. However, more and more baby showers are also including the father-to-be. Like a bridal shower, a mother-to-be will register   a wish list of things she wants at one or several stores. This list usually includes things the mother wants for her baby like clothes, diapers and even furniture. This way friends and family members can go to the stores and buy something from the list. Registering helps make sure that there aren't repeat items, like 30 bottles when a new mom only needed 15. At a baby shower, people can give cards with wishes for the new baby and mom. Most of these cards also include money or gift cards to help the mom-to-be buy whatever else she needs for the baby. Sometimes there are games as well. In one game everyone guesses the date of the baby. Another game lets people taste baby food and guess the flavor.

News article: The NFL preseason matters a little more than you think It’s the eternal question: How much does the NFL preseason really matter? No one looks at spring training as a harbinger of things to come in the baseball season. Few even know the NBA or NHL preseason exists (legend has it that the latter starts a few days after the end of the Stanley Cup Finals). But football fans, always looking for some clue to the future successes of their teams, try and glean some information from the silly season in August, when the stars usually sit and benchwarmers dominate. We know we shouldn’t. We say it’s meaningless, yet every season we try to convince ourself that it does. If a team goes 4-0, that momentum might carry them into the regular season. If they’re 0-4, then preseason doesn’t matter at all, and you’ll rattle off the records of some of the all-time great teams who didn’t win in preseason (e.g. the 1991 Washington Redskins, who went 17-2 after an ugly 1-3 preseason). But what’s the real answer? FTW looked at five years at data to find out that, surprisingly, you can find a little information about how a team will fare based on its preseason record. But only a little and only if you look real hard. Granted, this is only five years of data with about 160 preseason wins and losses and 60 playoff teams, so it’s hardly gospel, but it does provide an interesting look into how the exhibition season can lead to the extra season in January. There’s nothing in the numbers to ensure or remove playoff chances for teams based on preseason records. But teams that make the playoffs actually do tend to have better preseason records than teams that don’t. In the past five years, 75% of playoff teams have had two wins or more. Only 25% have had zero or one wins in the preseason. That’s a pretty startling statistic for a group of “meaningless” games. But that’s only half the question. We can’t just look at how many 2-2 or 3-1 playoff teams made the postseason, but how many didn’t. That leads us to our next chart. In it, we look at the collective preseason win totals of teams from 2010-2014. The X-axis represents the number of wins each NFL team had in that specific preseason. (For example, in 2010, two teams had zero wins in the preseason, six teams had one win, 14 teams had two wins, nine teams had three wins, four teams had one win, and so on throughout each year. Note: In one year, the New York Giants won five games. Their total has been knocked down to four in these numbers.) This is where it gets slightly more interesting. While getting two or more wins is still the best path to the playoffs, your percentage of making the playoffs with a given record barely changes. You’re actually more likely to get in with an 0-4 record than a 4-0 record. In the chart above, for instance, a team had about a 40% chance of making the playoffs by going 0-4, 2-2, 3-1 or 4-0. Those percentages all hovered around 40%, which is, not surprisingly, how many teams get into the playoffs in a given year. So even though more teams disproportionately make it with 2-4 wins (that number would be 60% in everything were equal, it’s 75% instead), 40% of teams with an 0-4 mark are still making it in. The reason more teams in the playoffs have 2+ wins is because that’s what most teams have in the preseason. The outlier is 1-3, in which only 28% of teams make the playoffs, something I imagine would revert closer to the mean if we used a larger sample size. Okay, now that we’ve gone way too deep into preseason football, what does it all mean? Basically, it’s better to go 2-2 than it is to go 0-4, but the percentage of teams making the playoffs with a specific preseason record is the same across the spectrum. But, really, last year’s NFC East is a perfect example of what can be the utter meaningless and randomness of preseason games. The New York Giants went a perfect 5-0, then only went 6-10 in the regular season. Washington went 3-1, then only managed four wins in the regular season. Meanwhile, Dallas was 0-4 in exhibition games and went on to go 12-4 and came within a catch of going to the NFC championship. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"1. The NFL preseason has often been considered as less relevant in determining a team's success during the regular season, but recent data analysis shows it might be more significant than previously thought. 2. A study looking at five years of data found that 75% of playoff teams achieved at least two preseason wins, while only 25% had zero or one win. 3. Although 2+ preseason wins are more common among playoff teams, the percentage of teams making the playoffs with a specific preseason record (0-4, 2-2, 3-1, or 4-0) is roughly the same across the board, around 40%. 4. Last year's NFC East division showcased the potential randomness and lack of correlation between preseason and regular-season success, with the New York Giants having a perfect preseason but underperforming in the regular season, while the Dallas Cowboys had a poor preseason yet excelled in the regular season. 5. The findings suggest that while preseason records don't guarantee playoff chances, there is a slightly higher likelihood for teams with better preseason performances to make the playoffs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English","output":"In May 2006, the European Union suspended negotiations for the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with Belgrade, citing the lack of cooperation of the Serbs with the United Nations Tribunal. To provide more context on this issue, the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) is a type of agreement that the European Union (EU) enters into with countries from the Western Balkans, including Serbia, as a framework for cooperation and preparation for their future integration into the EU. These agreements cover various areas, such as political dialogue, trade, and legislative approximation, aiming to harmonize the legal frameworks of the aspiring country with that of the EU. Serbia's cooperation, or lack thereof, with the United Nations (UN) International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was a crucial aspect of its progress toward EU integration. The ICTY was established in 1993 to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the wars in the former Yugoslavia from 1991 to 2001. During the 1990s, Serbia was involved in a series of conflicts, including the breakup of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the wars in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo. The EU wanted Serbia to cooperate fully with the ICTY to ensure that individuals responsible for war crimes would be held accountable and that justice would be served. In May 2006, due to Serbia's lack of cooperation with the ICTY, specifically their inability or unwillingness to apprehend and transfer suspects to The Hague, the EU decided to suspend their negotiations for the Stabilization and Association Agreement. This move was intended to send a strong message to Serbia, emphasizing that full cooperation with the ICTY is a prerequisite for further EU integration. This suspension also aimed to encourage Serbia to enhance its efforts to capture war crime fugitives and cooperate with the international tribunal more effectively. Over the years, Serbia's relations with the EU have evolved, but cooperation with the ICTY and dealing with the legacy of its past conflicts remain critical factors in Serbia's path to EU integration."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Chesley Sullenberger was born in Denison, Texas, His father was a descendant of Swiss-German immigrants named Sullenberger. He has one sister, Mary. The street on which he grew up in Denison was named after his mother's family. According to his sister, Sullenberger built model planes and aircraft carriers during his childhood, and says he became interested in flying after seeing military jets from an Air Force base near his house. Sullenberger was appointed to the United States Air Force Academy, entering with the Class of 1973 in June 1969. He was selected along with around a dozen other freshmen for a cadet glider program, and by the end of that year, he was an instructor pilot. In the year of his graduation, 1973, he received the Outstanding Cadet in Airmanship award, as the class \\"top flyer\\". Following graduation with a Bachelor of Science and his commissioning as an officer, the Air Force immediately sent Sullenberger to Purdue University to pursue a master's degree prior to entering Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT).  Following completion of his graduate degree at Purdue, he was assigned to UPT at Columbus AFB, Mississippi, flying the T-37 Tweet and T-38 Talon. After earning his wings in 1975 as a USAF Pilot, he completed replacement training in the F-4 Phantom II at Luke AFB, Arizona. This was followed by his assignment to the 493d Tactical Fighter Squadron of 48th Tactical Fighter Wing at RAF Lakenheath, United Kingdom, where he flew as a United States Air Force fighter pilot in the F-4D Phantom II.  Following his assignment at RAF Lakenheath, he was reassigned to the 428th Tactical Fighter Squadron of the 474th Tactical Fighter Wing at Nellis AFB, Nevada, again flying the F-4D. He advanced to become a flight leader and a training officer, and attained the rank of captain, with experience in Europe, the Pacific, and at Nellis Air Force Base, as well as operating as Blue Force Mission Commander in Red Flag Exercises.

Obviously he will rotate out at some point, but that point has not yet been determined and it will not occur anytime soon. Until then, he will continue to ably lead our coalition forces in Afghanistan.      General David Petraeus is expected to leave his post as commander of United States troops in Afghanistan, the Times Of London reports early Tuesday evening.      The Washington Post reported earlier in the day:      No final decisions have been made, but military officials said that Petraeus, who took command last July, will rotate out of Afghanistan before the end of the year. The general who replaces Petraeus will have to navigate a tricky relationship with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Pakistani leaders...      According to the Times, the Pentagon is expected to name a replacement for Petraeus by the end of the year.      President Barack Obama tapped Petraeus to replace Gen. Stanley McChrystal last summer after controversy swirling around critical comments the then-commander made about Obama administration officials to Rolling Stone landed him out of his post.      Reuters reports:      Petraeus has been talked about for a while as a possible successor to Admiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), who is expected to retire in October. Any move would be part of a broader shake-up in the administration, which will also see Defense Secretary Robert Gates retire this year. ... His departure, especially with Gates on his way out, could create the space for Obama to recalibrate Afghan strategy, backing away from the military surge and focusing more on a political settlement - if he wants to do so.      The Post notes that Petraeus is not the only leading U.S. official in Afghanistan expected to rotate out of his post this year. Among others, U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan Karl Eikenberry, who has expressed reservations about the country's Afghan war strategy, will reportedly leave his job in coming months.      The Times reports:      It forms part of a sweeping reorganisation of top American officials in Afghanistan, which the Obama Administration hopes to present as proof that its strategy does not depend on the towering reputation of one man. ||||| The Pentagon has denied that the commander of US and Nato forces in Afghanistan, General David Petraeus, is planning to quit by the end of the year.      The Times reported that the Pentagon was looking to replace Petraeus, who was appointed eight months ago.      But the Pentagon said that while it constantly reviewed rotations, particularly as a number of senior posts were about to fall vacant, no decision had been made about Petraeus.      Petraeus is popular in the US, credited with first turning around Iraq and now, as head of Nato's International Security Assistance Force (Isaf), helping to reverse Taliban gains in southern Afghanistan and bring a degree of stability.      Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon spokesman, said: \\"Despite some sensational speculation by one of the London papers, I can assure you General Petraeus is not quitting as Isaf commander, but nor does he plan to stay in Afghanistan for ever.      \\"Obviously he will rotate out at some point, but that point has not yet been determined and it will not occur any time soon. Until then, he will continue to ably lead our coalition forces in Afghanistan.\\"      By the end of the year, Petraeus will have done 18 months, a normal rotation for the post, and he would be in the running for a more senior post back in the US.      US forces are due to begin a drawdown in July but Petraeus will fight to keep as many as possible in Afghanistan to try to pacify the country, in a repeat of the strategy he used in Iraq. He might then ask to stay into next year.      Petraeus has been touted as a possible Republican presidential candidate to take on President Barack Obama for the White House next year, but has repeatedly denied he is planning to run. ||||| A:","output":"Part #1: Summarizing text with multiple news articles separated by special token \\"|||||\\".

The goal of their game was to write the word \\"shmily\\" in a surprise place for the other to find. They took turns leaving \\"shmily\\" around the house, and as soon as one of them discovered it, it was their turn to hide it once more. They dragged \\"shmily\\" with their fingers through the sugar and flour containers to await whoever was preparing the next meal. \\"Shmily\\" was written in the steam left on the mirror after a hot shower, where it would reappear bath after bath.

The notes were put inside shoes and left under pillows. \\"Shmily\\" was written in the dust upon the mantel and traced in the ashes of the fireplace. This mysterious word was as much a part of my grandparents' house as the furniture. It took me a long time before I was able to fully appreciate my grandparents' game. Skepticism has kept me from believing in true love --- one that is pure and enduring  . However, I never doubted my grandparents' relationship. It was based on passionate affection which not everyone is lucky enough to experience. But there was a dark cloud in my grandparents' life: my grandmother had breast cancer. The disease had first appeared ten years earlier. As always, Grandpa was with her every step of the way. He comforted her in their yellow room, painted that way so that she could always be surrounded by sunshine, even when she was too sick to go outside.

Grandma was gone. \\"Shmily.\\" It was written in yellow on the pink ribbons of my grandmother's funeral bouquet  .

Syria's head of antiquities had suggested on Monday that the Temple of Bel was still standing, despite reports of a massive explosion at the weekend. But Unosat analysts said the main structure had been reduced to rubble, as well as a line of columns beside it. IS captured the Unesco World Heritage site from government forces in May. \\"Unfortunately, the images we acquired do show that the main building of the temple has been destroyed,\\" Einar Bjorgo, Unosat's manager, told the BBC early on Tuesday. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) considered the Temple of Bel - the great sanctuary of the Palmyrene gods - one of the most important religious buildings of the 1st Century AD in the East. Maamoun Abdul Karim, the head of the Syrian Department of Antiquities and Museums, said its destruction was a \\"catastrophe\\". \\"I feel very sad and I am very pessimistic... for the future of Palmyra,\\" he told BBC Radio 5 live. \\"I am sure we will have more bad images [in the future] because these people... are ignorant, they are very criminal,\\" he added. \\"They don't respect any image, any identity of the people.\\" IS threat to 'Venice of the Sands' History's lesson in how to save artefacts Understanding sadness at loss of sites Why IS destroys ancient sites Mr Abdul Karim had said on Monday that there was a large explosion at the Temple of Bel, but that he believed most of the site remained intact. The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says the temple is bounded by a high perimeter wall, and the whole sprawling site of Palmyra is controlled by IS, so it would have been hard for outside witnesses on the ground to verify what had happened without putting themselves at risk. IS has ransacked and demolished several similar ancient sites that pre-date Islam in Iraq, denouncing them as symbols of \\"idolatry\\". The sale of looted antiquities is nevertheless one of the group's main sources of funding. It has also been accused of destroying ancient sites to gain publicity. Authorities removed hundreds of statues and priceless objects before IS overran Palmyra earlier this year. Last week, it was confirmed that another important site at Palmyra, the Temple of Baalshamin, had been blown up. Unosat released satellite images showing the extent of the damage, proving that parts were heavily damaged or completely destroyed. Earlier last month, the group beheaded 81-year-old Khaled al-Asaad, the archaeologist who had looked after the Palmyra ruins for 40 years. The world-famous Greco-Roman ruins of Palmyra are in the desert north-east of the Syrian capital, Damascus. Syrian government forces have sought to drive IS out of the Palmyra area in recent months and there has been fierce fighting in nearby towns.

The destruction of the Temple of Bel has been referred to as a \\"catastrophe\\" and raises concerns about the future of other historical sites in Palmyra that are under threat from ISIS. The terrorist group has demolished several other ancient sites in the past, claiming them to be symbols of \\"idolatry,\\" while also profiting from the sale of looted antiquities.

I was walking through the house one morning and suddenly I could see NOTHING out of one eye. When I told my husband,who was right there when it happened, he assumed my eye was just blurry or something had gotten in the eye. He took me to the ophthalmologist who verified that I could not see out of the eye. Then we subsequently got the worse news that it was a neurological condition with a long name I do not remember that there was nothing he could do about. He said that I would either get my sight back or I you and all we could do was wait and see if it came back. This was right before finals that semester but he told me I absolutely could not be studying or using my good eye for reading or basically anything that would strain it or I could end up losing sight in that eye also. Needless to say, as a mom of two children ages 2 1/2 and 6 months,I could not afford to lose ALL of my sight! So, I had to wait. I could not drive like that either which made matters worse. Both my husband and I were in school fulltime (until then), fortunately it was the end of the semester, unfortunately it was BEFORE finals. My sight did come back but not for about 5 months. When it first started to come back I still couldn't drive because although I could see I did not have my peripheral vision, that did not fully come back for quite a while.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. The following article contains an answer for the question: What two brands of amplifiers do grunge guitarists use? , can you please find it?   Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a \\"thick\\" middle register and rolled-off treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet. Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers  and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\".  In the song Mudride, the band's guitars were said to have \\"growled malevolently\\" through its \\"Cro-magnon slog\\". Answer:","output":"Grunge guitarists typically use Marshall and Mesa-Boogie amplifiers. Marshall amplifiers are known for their loudness and powerful sound, while Mesa-Boogie amplifiers have been used by notable grunge musicians such as Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl in early Foo Fighters songs. These amplifiers, combined with the use of distortion and fuzz pedals, help create the signature grunge guitar sound."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If less water becomes a gas due to the perturbation, it may affect the efficiency of the salt removal process. The direct effect will be that a smaller amount of water will be available to condense into the second container, resulting in a lesser quantity of fresh water produced.  Indirectly, this could also lead to a higher concentration of salt in the first container as less water has evaporated. However, this does not necessarily mean that more salt will be removed overall. Since the salt particles are not affected by the rate of evaporation, their amount remains the same.

It has two separate regions, the cochlea and the vestibule, which are responsible for hearing and balance, respectively. The neural signals from these two regions are relayed to the brain stem through separate fiber bundles. However, these two distinct bundles travel together from the inner ear to the brain stem as the vestibulocochlear nerve. Sound is transduced into neural signals within the cochlear region of the inner ear, which contains the sensory neurons of the spiral ganglia. These ganglia are located within the spiral-shaped cochlea of the inner ear. The cochlea is attached to the stapes through the oval window. The oval window is located at the beginning of a fluid-filled tube within the cochlea called the scala vestibuli. The scala vestibuli extends from the oval window, travelling above the cochlear duct, which is the central cavity of the cochlea that contains the sound-transducing neurons. At the uppermost tip of the cochlea, the scala vestibuli curves over the top of the cochlear duct. The fluid-filled tube, now called the scala tympani, returns to the base of the cochlea, this time travelling under the cochlear duct. The scala tympani ends at the round window, which is covered by a membrane that contains the fluid within the scala. As vibrations of the ossicles travel through the oval window, the fluid of the scala vestibuli and scala tympani moves in a wave-like motion. The frequency of the fluid waves match the frequencies of the sound waves (Figure 14.6). The membrane covering the round window will bulge out or pucker in with the movement of the fluid within the scala tympani.   Q: What part of the ear is often described as a bony labyrinth?

Generate a question that has the following answer:  Matthew.  for the following movie plot:  After leaving a party at a women's dormitory (aka the \\"virgin vault\\"), Matthew (Jonathan Tucker) is trapped in an elevator with an unknown, and unseen, woman when the power goes out. Matthew and this unknown woman have sex in the dark. When Matthew wakes up in the morningâstill in the elevatorâhe finds himself alone with a pair of her panties.[1] On a mission to find his mystery maiden by finding a matching bra for the panties, Matthew becomes the maintenance man of the virgin vault. After releasing mice, he goes room to room, setting traps. He convinces the panicked women to leave their rooms and then starts to look for a match. When he is unsuccessful, he continues to break things (such as the air conditioning) in an effort to find his woman. He also fixes the television set, which is greatly received by women he refers to as \\"Jane-ites\\", as they have a great interest in films adapted from books by Jane Austen. He doesn't get much help from his roommate Rod (James DeBello), who keeps telling him to give up, and together they philosophize about men and women. Rod tells him that he doesn't need a girlfriend and that it's futile to try to find the \\"bra matching the panties\\", and Matthew accuses him of being too machismo. Rod introduces Matthew to the \\"penile power\\", which involves the use of weights attached to his penis as a means of increasing the organ's size. He does this and insults women to make himself feel better about the problem he has with his manhood; he suffers from hypospadias. Early on, Matthew watches as a woman named Patty (Emmanuelle Chriqui) and her boyfriend Crick (Johnny Green) fight. Crick is the epitome of the macho man stereotype, with his big pectorals, conceited attitude, and abusiveness. He wears a pony-tail, a manicured goatee, \\"male make-up\\", and chews nicotine gum, much to Matthew's dismay. Matthew tries to save Patty, but is hurt by Crick.

Using compost, pour the compost over the garden bed until it looks slightly raised..  (B). Using sand, pour the sand over the garden bed until it looks slightly raised..","output":"To fill garden beds, you have two options as mentioned - using compost or using sand. Below are detailed methods on how to accomplish filling your garden beds using both of these methods. Option A: Using Compost Compost is a great way to fill garden beds as it not only adds nutrients to the soil, but also improves its structure and water retention capabilities. Here's a step-by-step guide to filling garden beds using compost: 1. Measure the area: Measure the length, width and depth of your garden bed to determine the amount of compost you will need to fill it. Generally, a depth of 2-4 inches is recommended, depending on the type of plants you will be growing. 2. Obtain compost: Purchase enough compost to fill the garden bed or make use of homemade compost from your backyard compost bin. 3. Check quality of compost: Make sure that the compost you are planning to use is well-rotted and free of weed seeds or harmful pathogens. Good compost should have an earthy smell, dark brown color and rich, crumbly texture. 4. Prepare the garden bed: Remove any cover material, such as mulch or leaves, and weed the area. Loosen the soil surface with a garden fork or trowel. If your soil needs additional nutrients, consider adding well-rotted manure or other organic matter. 5. Spread the compost: Pour the compost over the garden bed and spread it evenly across the surface using a rake or your hands. Aim for an even layer and make sure to cover the entire bed, leaving no gaps. 6. Mix the compost with the topsoil: Using a garden fork or shovel, mix the compost into the top layer of soil to blend them together. This step helps in better integration of compost with the existing soil structure. 7. Water the garden bed: Moistening the soil after filling the garden bed helps to settle the soil, while providing a good growing environment for your plants. 8. Once filled, you can plant your seeds or transplants in the newly enriched soil and watch your garden thrive. Option B: Using Sand Sand can also be used to fill garden beds, particularly if you want to improve soil drainage or create a specific type of environment for your plants. Follow these steps to fill garden beds using sand: 1. Measure the area: Determine the amount of sand needed to fill the garden bed based on its length, width, and depth. 2. Acquire the sand: Purchase the appropriate amount of horticultural sand from a garden center. Avoid using beach or playground sand as it may contain harmful salts or contaminants. 3. Prepare the garden bed: Remove any cover material and weeds, just as you would when using compost. If you're amending an existing bed, loosen the soil surface with a fork or trowel. 4. Add the sand: Pour the sand over the garden bed and spread it evenly across the surface using a rake or your hands. Distribute the sand so that no spots remain uncovered. 5. Mix sand with the topsoil: Incorporate the sand into the existing soil using a garden fork, shovel, or rototiller. This will help prevent the formation of distinct layers and ensure that both materials are well-integrated for better drainage. 6. Evaluate the mixture: Assess the soil mixture in the garden-bed to confirm it has the proper composition for your plants or has an ideal drainage capacity. Adjust the proportion of sand or other amendments if necessary. 7. Water the garden bed: Moisten the soil after filling the garden bed to help settle it and provide a suitable environment for plant growth. 8. Plant your seeds or transplants in the updated soil. In conclusion, choosing either option A or B to fill your garden beds depends on your specific needs, available resources, and the type of plants you plan to grow. Each method offers its own benefits, and you can customize these approaches to support your unique gardening goals."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  St Kilda (Scottish Gaelic: Hiort) is an isolated archipelago situated 64 kilometres (40 mi) west-northwest of North Uist, in the North Atlantic Ocean. It contains the westernmost islands of the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. The largest island is Hirta, whose sea cliffs are the highest in the United Kingdom.  Three other islands (Dùn, Soay and Boreray) were also used for grazing and seabird hunting. The islands are administratively a part of the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar local authority area.The origin of the name St Kilda is a matter of conjecture. The islands' human heritage includes numerous unique architectural features from the historic and prehistoric periods, although the earliest written records of island life date from the Late Middle Ages. The medieval village on Hirta was rebuilt in the 19th century, but illnesses brought by increased external contacts through tourism, and the upheaval of the First World War contributed to the island's evacuation in 1930. The story of St Kilda has attracted artistic interpretations, including Michael Powell's film The Edge of the World and an opera.Permanent habitation on the islands possibly extends back at least two millennia, the population probably never exceeding 180 (and certainly no more than 100 after 1851). The entire remaining population was evacuated from Hirta (the only inhabited island) in 1930. The islands house a unique form of stone structure known as cleitean. A cleit is a stone storage hut or bothy; whilst many are still to be found, they are slowly falling into disrepair. There are known to be 1,260 cleitean on Hirta and a further 170 on the other group islands. Currently, the only year-round residents are military personnel; a variety of conservation workers, volunteers and scientists spend time there in the summer months.The entire archipelago is owned by the National Trust for Scotland. It became one of Scotland's six World Heritage Sites in 1986, and is one of the few in the world to hold mixed status for both its natural and cultural qualities....  answer the following question:  What archipelago has the highest sea cliffs in the United Kingdom.

The album  was recorded in Los Angeles, California with Reign in Blood producer Rick Rubin. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they \\"couldn't top Reign in Blood\\", and that whatever they recorded would be \\"compared to that album\\", he believed they \\"had to slow down\\", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\".

Summarize this article: MADISON, WIS. - Tens of thousands of demonstrators swarmed the state Capitol building here Saturday in protest of Gov. Scott Walker's proposal to strip public employees of most of their collective bargaining rights.      Protesters have crowded around the Capitol for more than a week, since unrest erupted over the Republican governor's plan. Local media quoted police as saying the crowds Saturday were on track to rival those last weekend, which were estimated at nearly 70,000. Walker threatened on Friday to trigger as many as 12,000 layoffs beginning next week unless lawmakers enact his plan.      The demonstration is certain to be the largest of dozens taking place around the country against Walker and other Republican governors who have taken similar stands against their public employee unions. The progressive group MoveOn.org said it would hold \\"Save the American Dream\\" rallies in all 50 states, including one that drew hundreds of people to Dupont Circle in the District on Saturday afternoon.      Although unions have offered concessions they say would close the state's budget gap, Walker remained determined to achieve a resolution that he said would give state and local governments leverage to limit employee costs well into the future.      Without legislation to pare back employee health-care and pension benefits while repealing most collective bargaining rights for many public employees, Walker said, he would be forced to make cuts elsewhere in the budget that could lead to massive numbers of state and local employees losing their jobs.      \\"If we want to avoid the layoffs that will eventually come at the state and local level, the only way to achieve that\\" is to pass the bill, Walker said.      The layoffs would mark an escalation of a battle that has paralyzed the state Capitol. Fourteen Democratic state senators have fled Wisconsin to prevent the state Senate from having a quorum for considering the measure. Walker backed off earlier remarks that the layoffs would begin this week.      Nationally, Walker's efforts to break the power of public service unions - being replicated to some degree in several other Republican-led states - have thrown public employee unions into an existential crisis.      As a group, public employees generally earn less than comparably educated private-sector employees, but they tend to enjoy far better health-care and retirement benefits. The issue of their compensation has gained particular resonance at a time when states and municipalities across the country are struggling with huge budget deficits and ballooning costs for employees' health-care and pension obligations.      The controversy has lifted Walker to national prominence, and he says he is determined to make Wisconsin a leader in remaking the way state and local governments deal with their employees.      The clashes over public employee unions continued in other state capitals. In Indianapolis, hundreds of union supporters demonstrated at an otherwise quiet statehouse Friday as there appeared to be no end in sight to a partisan standoff that has paralyzed the legislature.      \\"I'm here to help save the jobs of thousands of hardworking Hoosiers,\\" said Jim Szucs, a Teamster from South Bend, Ind. ||||| Police: No more sleeping bags in the Wis. Capitol      MADISON, Wis.  Police officers handed out fliers Friday saying they plan to restrict access to the Capitol as protesters geared up for another round of weekend demonstrations over the state budget battle.      Police told protesters who have been camping inside the Capitol building for eight days that they will begin collecting sleeping bags, coolers and folding chairs in an effort to return the Capitol to normal business hours Sunday night.      \\"We are closing the Capitol for a short period of time for public health reasons, as well as for general building maintenance,\\" Chief Charles Tubbs of the Wisconsin Capitol Police said in a statement issued late Friday. \\"Everyone agrees that our State Capitol is a source of pride for our state and that we should take a break to take care of the building.\\"      Protesters who have lived there for several days say they¹re prepared to stage non-violent resistance if police try to clear them out.      Bridget Peterson of Duluth, Minn., has been camping inside the Capitol for eight days. \\"People are going to want to fight this somehow even if we lose this space,\\" she said.      Republicans in the Wisconsin Assembly took the first significant action on Gov. Scott Walker's plan to strip collective bargaining rights from most public workers, abruptly passing the measure early Friday morning.      The vote ended three straight days of punishing debate in the Assembly, but the fight is far from over. Senate Democrats who have fled to Illinois to prevent a vote in that chamber say they won't return unless Walker agrees to discuss a compromise.      By Scott Olson, Getty Images Hundreds of people have been living in Wisconsin's Capitol 24 hours a day to protest the governor's budget plans.      On Friday, Walker didn't sound conciliatory.      During an afternoon appearance in Green Bay, he said, although \\"we got to find a way to make it comfortable for those 14 senators to come back home,\\" Republicans had no intention of backing off the main tenets of the bill.      Walker's plan contains a number of provisions that he says are designed to fill the state's 137 million deficit, including requiring public workers to contribute more to their pensions and health insurance and strip them of their right to collectively bargain benefits and work conditions.      Tens of thousands of people have jammed the Capitol since last week to protest, pounding on drums and chanting so loudly that police providing security have resorted to earplugs.      Hundreds of people have been living in the building 24 hours a day to protest the plan.      Demonstrators dragged in air mattresses and blankets and sleep on the building's marble floors between never-ending rounds of chants, marches and drum circles. The scene inside resembles a small village with stands and food stations.      Police began circulating the fliers that outline the crackdown Friday morning. In a statement, Jim Palmer, executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association, asked the governor to keep the building open.      \\"The law enforcement officers from across the state that have been working at the Capitol have been very impressed with how peaceful everyone has been,\\" Palmer said.      He called on police officers to join the sleep-in at the Capitol.      Protesters plan to go ahead with a rally scheduled for Saturday.      Demonstrators have been conducting non-violent civil disobedience training to plan for the day when the Capitol is cleared. While some activists said Friday that they will leave willingly if asked, many others say they will have to be carried out.      \\"You can't carry out 2,000 people,\\" said Will Adams, a student from Champaign-Urbana, Illinois. \\"Or maybe you can.\\"      Numerous signs hung by activists remind demonstrators that \\"this is a peaceful protest.\\"      Peterson said demonstrators and police have not had any problems so far. She said she thinks everyone is cool-headed enough to keep things non-violent no matter what the authorities do.      \\"I really, really hope so,\\" she said.

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation 0 = 5*a + 13*a - a - 17 for a, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. The left side of the equation already has a 0, so we don't need to modify it. On the right side of the equation, combine the terms related to 'a': 5*a + 13*a - a = (5 + 13 - 1)*a = 17*a Thus, the simplified equation is: 0 = 17*a - 17 Step 2: Isolate the variable 'a'. To find the value of 'a', isolate it on one side of the equation. To do this, we need to eliminate the -17 from the right side of the equation. To eliminate -17, add 17 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 17 = 17*a - 17 + 17 Which simplifies to: 17 = 17*a Step 3: Solve for the variable 'a'. Now that we have the simplified equation, 17 = 17*a, proceed to solve for the value of 'a'. Since 17*a means 17 multiplied by 'a', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 17 to find the value of 'a': 17 / 17 = (17*a) / 17 This simplifies to: 1 = a So, the solution to the equation 0 = 5*a + 13*a - a - 17 is a = 1."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The first part, \\"death to smoochy is often very funny,\\" is clearly positive, as the author praises the humor of the subject, indicating that they enjoy the material and find it genuinely amusing. This part of the sentence is likely to make the reader look forward to watching the movie, as the emphasis on humor implies that it is entertaining and engaging. The second part of the sentence, \\"but what's even more remarkable is the integrity of devito's misanthropic vision,\\" offers a more complex evaluation. On one hand, it can be seen as positive-negative, as it acknowledges the negative or darker aspect of the subject - the \\"misanthropic vision\\" of the creator. Misanthropy usually refers to a general dislike of humanity or being pessimistic about human nature, and such a theme is often considered negative or unappealing.  However, it is important to note that the author uses the word \\"remarkable\\" to describe the \\"integrity\\" of this vision. This implies that the author appreciates and admires how well the creator has maintained and expressed their misanthropic perspective throughout the film. In this respect, this part of the sentence can also be seen as a positive evaluation of the creator's artistic consistency and the coherence of the work's thematic elements. Altogether, the sentiment of the sentence is perceived as a balance of positive and positive-negative evaluation. This evaluation expresses admiration for both the humor and consistency of the film's darker themes and suggests that the author is intrigued and impressed with the overall quality and coherence of the film.

Pour the batter into your waffle iron. Cook until medium golden brown. Keep warm.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Mastering the Art of Perfect Waffles: A Comprehensive Guide Intro:  Waffles - a universally-loved dish, combining soft, fluffy interiors with crispy, golden exteriors into delightfulness that can be either sweet or savory. From breakfast to dinner and even dessert, this versatile meal is sure to please regardless of when it's served or what it's topped with. But, are your homemade waffles truly reaching their maximum potential? Follow this comprehensive guide to ensure every waffle you make is nothing short of perfect. 1. Preheat Your Waffle Iron: A well-preheated waffle iron is key to cooking those perfectly browned waffles with consistent texture throughout. Preheating the waffle iron allows it to reach and maintain a stable temperature, essential for evenly cooking your batter.  Most waffle irons have an indicator light or beep to let you know when they're ready. If yours doesn't, you can generally assume that it takes about 5-10 minutes for the iron to come to temperature. Make sure you don't skip this crucial step, as using an improperly heated iron leads to uneven cooking and disappointing waffles. 2. Preheat Your Oven (if necessary): If you're cooking for a crowd, preheating your oven is an excellent way to keep waffles warm and crisp while you finish cooking the remaining batter. Set your oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit (95 degrees Celsius) and place a wire rack on a baking sheet. As you finish each batch of waffles, transfer them to the wire rack and keep them in the oven. The low temperature ensures the waffles stay warm without overcooking, while the wire rack ensures air can circulate, preventing sogginess. 3. Mix Your Dry Ingredients: Combining your dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl first ensures proper distribution of the leavening agents (such as baking powder), which affects how well the waffles rise. Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and any additional spices or add-ins you prefer (such as cinnamon or cocoa powder). Make sure to sift the dry ingredients to break up any lumps, as they can lead to uneven cooking in the waffle iron. 4. Combine the Wet Ingredients: In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients, which typically include milk, eggs, melted butter or oil, and vanilla extract. Whisking in a separate bowl ensures a homogeneous blend, providing the perfect foundation for a smooth waffle batter. 5. Beat Together Both Mixtures: Gently pour the wet ingredients over the dry ingredients, and stir using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Mix until just combined and smooth, breaking up any lumps, but be cautious not to overmix, as this can cause the waffles to become tough. If desired, you can also fold in ingredients such as chocolate chips, berries, or nuts at this stage. 6. Pour the Batter into Your Waffle Iron: Before pouring the batter, make sure to lightly coat your preheated waffle iron with cooking spray or brush it with oil or melted butter to prevent sticking. Using a measuring cup or ladle, pour enough batter to cover approximately 2/3 of the waffle iron's surface. The batter will expand as it cooks, filling the remaining space and creating that perfect waffle shape. 7. Cook Until Medium Golden Brown: Close the lid of the waffle iron and bake until the waffle is medium golden brown, with slightly crisp edges and a tender interior. Cooking time will vary depending on your waffle iron and batter, usually between 3-6 minutes.

Please answer the following question: Some futurologists have assumed that the vast upsurge  of women in the workforce may mean a rejection of marriage. Many women, according to this hypothesis, would rather work than marry. The converse  of this concern is that becoming a multi-paycheck household could encourage marriage. In the past, only the earnings and financial prospects of the man counted in the marriage decision. Now, however, the earning ability of a woman can make her more attractive as a marriage partner. Data show that economic downturns tend to put off marriage because the parties cannot afford to establish a family or are concerned about rainy days ahead. As the economy comes to life, the number of marriages also rises. The increase in divorce rates follows to the increase in women working outside the home. Yet, it may be wrong to jump to any simple cause-and-effect conclusions. The impact of a wife's work on divorce is no less cloudy than its impact on marriage decisions. The realization that she can be a good provider may increase the chances that a working wife will choose divorce over an unsatisfactory marriage. But the reverse is equally plausible . Tensions grounded in financial problems often play a key role in ending a marriage. By raising a family's standard of living, a working wife may strengthen her family's financial and emotional stability. Psychological factors also should be considered. For example, a wife blocked from a career outside the home may feel caged in the house. She may view her only choice as seeking a divorce. On the other hand, if she can find fulfillment through work outside the home, work and marriage can go together to create a stronger and more stable union. Also, a major part of women's inequality in marriage has been due to the fact that, in most cases, men have remained the main breadwinners. A working wife may rob a husband of being the master of the house. Depending upon how the couple reacts to these new conditions, it could create a stronger equal partnership or it could create new insecurities. It is said in the passage that when the economy falls  _ A) men would choose working women as their marriage partners B) more women would get married to seek financial security C) even working women would worry about their marriages D) more people would prefer to remain single for the time being Answer:","output":"D) more people would prefer to remain single for the time being"},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Renowned journalist Politkovskaya, 48, was shot to death in the elevator of her Moscow apartment building in October 2006. Dozens of journalists have been killed and brutally... (Associated Press)      MOSCOW (AP) — The brazen killing of exiled Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko in the Ukrainian capital Kiev on Tuesday evening has highlighted the dangers of working as a journalist in Russia.      Dozens of Russian journalists have been killed or brutally beaten in recent years, in clear retribution for their work. In most cases, their attackers walked free.      Here's a look at some of the high-profile cases:      ANNA POLITKOVSKAYA      Anna Politkovskaya was a prominent journalist at the Novaya Gazeta newspaper who was famous for her critical coverage of the war in Chechnya. She was shot dead in her apartment block in 2006.      Politkovskaya chronicled the killings and torture of civilians by the Russian military. She wrote a book critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his campaign in Chechnya, documenting widespread abuse of civilians by government troops.      Politkovskaya frequently received threats and was vilified by state media as being unpatriotic.      Five men were convicted in the killing but the investigators never found those who ordered the murder, and her family blamed the government for its unwillingness to go after the masterminds.      ___      MIKHAIL BEKETOV      Beketov suffered brain damage and lost a leg after a brutal assault in 2008 following his reporting and campaign against a highway project against Moscow. He died five years later.      Beketov wrote about corruption in Khimki, a town near the 8 billion highway. The founder and editor of a local newspaper, Beketov was among the first to raise the alarm about the destruction of the local forest and suspicions local officials were profiting from the project.      In November 2008, Beketev was beaten so viciously that he was left unable to speak. He was in coma for several months and spent more than two years in hospitals. His attackers were never found.      ___      ANASTASIA BABUROVA      Freelance journalist Baburova was shot and killed in 2009 on a sidewalk in central Moscow as she attempted to intervene when a human rights lawyer, renowned for his work on abuses in Chechnya was also murdered by a masked gunman.      Lawyer Stanislav Markelov was shot in the back of the head at close range in broad daylight by a gunman who followed him from a news conference. Baburova, who was walking back with the lawyer from the news conference, was also killed as she attempted to help Markelov.      Baburova, a freelance journalist in her mid-20s, had worked for the Novaya Gazeta newspaper, also Politkovskaya's employer.      ___      OLEG KASHIN      Intrepid reporter Kashin was viciously beaten by two unidentified attackers outside his home in November 2010 and narrowly escaped death. He spent days in an induced coma with a fractured skull, and had one finger partially amputated. He survived and eventually recovered.      Kashin has written on a wide range of social and political issues, some politically sensitive. Shortly after the attack, Kashin said he suspected then-Pskov governor Andrei Turchak to be behind the attempt on his life as a reaction to a critical post he wrote about him on his blog.      Russia's then-President Dmitry Medevdev at the time pledged to solve the attack. Kashin was originally full of praise for the investigators who appeared to be trying to find his attackers, but the probe stalled shortly afterward.      Frustrated with lack of progress in the investigation, Kashin conducted his own probe into the attack and several years later publicly accused Turchak of placing an order to cripple or kill him. Turchak has never been questioned, and has denied the accusations. He currently holds a senior post in the ruling pro-Kremlin party.      ___      KHADZHIMURAD KAMALOV      Kamalov, founder of a newspaper in Russia's North Caucasus critical of authorities, was gunned down outside his office in Makhachkala, capital of the Dagestan region, in December 2011.      Kamalov's leading independent weekly paper Chernovik has reported extensively on police abuses in the fight against an Islamist insurgency that originated in neighboring Chechnya and has spread across the region.      In 2008, authorities brought a criminal case against several Chernovik journalists under anti-extremist legislation after they published an interview with a former guerrilla leader. A court acquitted them earlier this year.      Kamalov's killers were never found.      ___      ARKADY BABCHENKO      Babchenko served in the Russian army and fought during Russia's two wars in Chechnya during the 1990s, first as a conscript, later as a contract soldier. He then became a journalist and worked as a military correspondent for several Russian media outlets. He has written several memoirs of his time as a soldier.      A scathing critic of the Russian government, Babchenko covered Russia's war with Georgia and the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, blaming Russia for targeting civilians.      In December 2016, Babchenko outraged many when he wrote in a Facebook post that he wasn't sorry for the military band and state television journalists who died in a plane crash on their way to Russia's military base in Syria. Several Russian lawmakers even called for stripping Babchenko of his citizenship over the comment, and Russian state media called him a traitor.      Babchenko fled Russia in February 2017, fearing for his life. He moved to Kiev last fall where he worked as a host for the Crimean Tatar TV station, ATR.      Babchenko was shot dead in Kiev on Tuesday, and was found in his apartment by his wife. ||||| Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko, right, and Vasily Gritsak, head of the Ukrainian Security Service speaks to the media during a news conference at the Ukrainian Security Service on Wednesday, May... (Associated Press)      Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko, right, and Vasily Gritsak, head of the Ukrainian Security Service speaks to the media during a news conference at the Ukrainian Security Service on Wednesday, May 30, 2018. Babchenko turned up at a news conference in the Ukrainian capital Wednesday less than 24 hours... (Associated Press)      KIEV, Ukraine (AP) — A Russian journalist who was reportedly gunned down in Ukraine's capital strolled into a news conference that authorities called Wednesday to discuss the investigation of his death, revealing that the slaying had been staged to foil an alleged Kremlin hit plot.      \\"I'm still alive,\\" Arkady Babchenko, 41, told startled fellow reporters at the news conference held less than 24 hours after police reported he had been shot and killed at his Kiev apartment building.      Ukrainian police said Tuesday that Babchenko, a strong critic of the Kremlin, was shot multiple times in the back Tuesday and found bleeding there by his wife. Authorities said they suspected he was killed because of his work.      Babchenko apologized to his wife, who he said was not briefed on the scheme in advance, \\"for the hell she had to go through in the past two days. There was no choice there, either.\\"      Neither he nor Vasyl Gritsak, head of the Ukrainian Security Service, provided details of how they staged Babchenko's injuries or made his wife believe he was dead.      The movie-like twist came as Gritsak convened the news conference to announce that the security agency and the police had solved Babchenko's reported slaying. He then confused everyone there by inviting the supposed slaying into the room.      To applause and gasps, Babchenko took the floor and apologized to the friends and family who mourned for him and were unaware of the plan.      \\"I'm still alive,\\" he said. \\"I know that sickening feeling when you bury a colleague. I'm sorry you had to go through this but there was no other way.\\"      Before ushering Babchenko into the room, Gritsak said investigators had identified a Ukrainian citizen who allegedly was paid 40,000 by the Russian security service to organize and carry out the hit. The unidentified Ukrainian man in turn allegedly hired an acquaintance to be the gunman, Gritsak said.      The man allegedly paid to organize Banchenko's killing was detained Wednesday, he said, showing a video of the arrest.      Gritsak said killing Babchenko was part of a larger alleged plot by Russian security services. The Ukrainian man was also supposed to procure large quantities of weapons and explosives, including 300 AK-47 rifles and \\"hundreds of kilos of explosives,\\" to perpetrate acts of terror in Ukraine, he said.      Babchenko said he was not allowed to go into the details of the sting operation, but said Ukrainian law enforcement had been aware of a contract on his head for two months. He said he was approached by the Ukrainian Security Service, the SBU, a month ago.      \\"The important thing is my life has been saved and other, bigger terrorist attacks have been thwarted,\\" he said.      Babchenko, one of Russia's best-known war reporters, fled the country in February 2017 after receiving death threats. He spoke and wrote about leaving the country because of the threats against him and his family. He said his home address was published online and the threats he received were made by phone, email and social media.      Ilya Ponomarev, a former Russian lawmaker who also moved to Ukraine, said Babchenko continued being threatened after he settled last fall in Kiev, where he worked as a host for the Crimean Tatar TV station. Babchenko did not take the intimidation too seriously, Ponomarev said Wednesday before the fact that the slaying was staged came out.      Moscow's annexation of Crimea and support for separatist insurgents in eastern Ukraine were topics on which the journalist was scathingly critical of the Kremlin.      Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko lashed out Wednesday at Ukrainian politicians and civil groups who accused the government following Babchenko's faked assassination of allowing contract killings to happen.      ___      Vasilyeva reported from Moscow.

Vasily Gritsak, head of the Ukrainian Security Service, told a news conference on Wednesday the agency faked Babchenko's death to catch those who were trying to kill him.      Kiev and national police had said Babchenko, a strong critic of the Kremlin, was shot multiple times in the back at his apartment building and found bleeding by his wife.      He showed up at Gritsak's new conference on Wednesday and thanked everyone who was mourning his death.

Babchenko fled Russia last year, fearing for his life, and settled in Ukraine. He had served in the Russian army during the two wars in Chechnya in 1990s and became one of Russia's best-known war reporters.      Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the State Duma, told Russian news agencies Wednesday that Russia would be happy to help with the investigation if Ukrainian authorities requested it.      Ukrainian authorities have said they think Babchenko was killed because of his work. Several Ukrainian politicians blamed the Kremlin for the killing. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed those comments as cynical. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko, who was reported killed in his Kiev apartment on 29 May, appeared alive at a news conference on 30 May.

How do you do this: Make cookies without oven.","output":"Making cookies without an oven might seem challenging but it's absolutely possible. There are a few different methods you can follow such as stovetop cooking, using a microwave, or steaming. Here's a detailed method on how to make no-bake cookies using a stove: Ingredients: 1) 2 cups of sugar 2) 1/2 cup of milk 3) 1/2 cup of unsalted butter 4) 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder 5) 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter 6) 3 cups of oats 7) 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract Procedure: 1. Begin by laying out a piece of wax paper or a silicone baking mat on your countertop or table. This is where you'll put the cookies to cool and harden, so you'll want to have this ready to go before you start cooking.   2. In a saucepan, combine the sugar, milk, butter, and unsweetened cocoa powder. Stir everything together until it's well combined. 3. Heat the saucepan over medium-high heat until the mixture comes to a boil. Allow the mixture to continue boiling for about a minute. Be sure to stir the mixture often to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan and burning. 4. After a minute, remove the saucepan from the heat. Add the peanut butter to the saucepan and stir it until it's fully incorporated into the mixture. 5. Add the oats and vanilla extract to the saucepan and stir everything together until the oats are fully coated in the mixture. 6. Once the oats are coated, you can begin forming your cookies. Using a spoon, scoop out some of the cookie mixture and place it on the wax paper or silicone baking mat. You can make the cookies as large or as small as you'd like. 7. Repeat the previous step until you've used up all of your cookie mixture. 8. Leave the cookies on the wax paper or silicone baking mat to cool and harden. This should take about 15-20 minutes. 9. Once the cookies have hardened, they're ready to eat! Simply lift them off the wax paper or silicone baking mat and enjoy! Remember, for no-bake cookies it's crucial to let them harden properly, it would be ideal to leave them overnight. If they're still soft and mushy, they likely need more time to set. The exact setting time can vary depending on the specific ingredients you used and the size of your cookies. Please note also that no-bake cookies are generally softer in texture than baked cookies, due to their cooking process. So, they won't have the same crispy texture as oven-baked cookies. But, they'll still be delicious and satisfy your sweet craving. Please also handle the hot mixture carefully while making the cookies. The sugar and butter mixture can become extremely hot and could cause burns if not handled carefully., Consider having an adult present if kids are involved in making these cookies.  Do remember, no-bake cookies have a shorter shelf life compared to baked cookies. Depending on the recipe, they can last up to a week if properly stored in an airtight container."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Such conversations are often necessitated by issues that affect all member states of the European Union (EU). The matters discussed can cover a wide array of topics from economic policies, security, human rights, environmental sustainability, among other things. In the European Union, discussions between member states and the European Parliament are vital. The European Parliament is one of the key legislative bodies of the EU, along with the Council of the European Union. The Parliament consists of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), who are directly elected by EU citizens. The function of the Parliament is to debate and pass European laws, with the Council, based on proposals presented by the European Commission. It is therefore crucial that there be open and direct communication or discussions between these entities to ensure that all decisions made are for the benefit of all member states and that they reflect the will and best interests of the citizens they represent. On the other hand, the member states are the individual countries that belong to the European Union. There are currently 27 countries in the EU, ranging from more significant nations like Germany and France to smaller countries like Malta and Cyprus. These member states, while maintaining their sovereignty, work together within the EU framework to achieve common objectives and promote shared values.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.  Now, I have a new situation: Two pedologists studied different types of soil. Yun studied forest soils, while Jian studied grassland soil. They were both very surprised with they findings.  Answer this question please: Which scientist read more about  tree leaves falling on the forest floor? A:","output":"A: Yun, the scientist who studied forest soils, likely read more about tree leaves falling on the forest floor. This is because the forest ecosystem primarily relies on the fallen tree leaves as a principal source of soil organic matter. In contrast, Jian, who studied grassland soil, focused more on the organic matter contributed by the deep, fibrous grass root systems. Consequently, Yun would have encountered more information about tree leaves falling and their impact on forest soil during the course of their research."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Not retroactively but prospectively. And it will ban the same for big clips, drums or strips of more than 10 bullets.\\"      Her remarks come just two day after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. — where Adam Lanza reportedly used a Bushmaster .223 assault rifle to kill 26 people, including 20 children.      Assault weapons were banned under the Federal Assault Weapons Ban from 1994 to 2004, but Congress allowed the ban to lapse. Obama has said he would support a reintroducing of the bill.      \\"There will be a bill.

One such suggestion was made by former Education Secretary William Bennett, who proposed that schools consider arming certain employees as a means of defense against potential mass shootings. Bennett's recommendation came with the caveats that armed employees should be trained and responsible individuals. He cited the brave actions of Sandy Hook Elementary's principal and school psychologist who tried to protect the students but were ultimately unarmed and overpowered. Similarly, Rep. Louie Gohmert suggested that more guns, rather than fewer, could help protect citizens in situations like the Newtown school shooting, and that a gun in the principal's office could have changed the outcome. However, other lawmakers and prominent figures argued for stricter gun control measures to protect citizens. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein vowed to reintroduce a federal ban on assault weapons, urging the support of President Barack Obama. The proposed bill would ban the sale, transfer, importation, and possession of assault weapons and ammunition clips that can hold more than 10 bullets. The Federal Assault Weapons Ban previously enacted such restrictions from 1994 to 2004 but was allowed to lapse by Congress. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg called for a revision of the nation's gun laws and argued that the influence of the National Rifle Association (NRA) was overrated, stating that the polls showed the public supported measures to end gun violence. The Newtown school shooting sparked renewed discussions on gun control and the role of firearms in protecting citizens, along with debates on the interpretation of the Second Amendment, which guarantees the right to bear arms."},{"instruction":"Title: Simply the BEST Review: This is a great CD , It will change your standard ,the sound is outoutstanding , It is a MUST BUY for Classical listener.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation.  Now, I have a new situation: Jason recently learned that he has cancer. After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out. After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure.

Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

Please answer the following question: I have always been a “handyman” involved in various building projects around the house. One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that.

Which entity is this text about? Plato (; Greek: Platon Platon, pronounced [pla.to:n] in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423 - 348/347 BC) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire work is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years. Others believe that the oldest extant manuscript dates to around AD 895, 1100 years after Plato's death. Although Socrates influenced Plato directly as related in the dialogues, the influence of Pythagoras upon Plato also appears to have significant discussion in the philosophical literature. Pythagoras, or in a broader sense, the Pythagoreans, allegedly exercised an important influence on the work of Plato. According to R. M. Hare, this influence consists of three points: (1) The platonic Republic might be related to the idea of \\"a tightly organized community of like-minded thinkers\\", like the one established by Pythagoras in Croton. (2) There is evidence that Plato possibly took from Pythagoras the idea that mathematics and, generally speaking, abstract thinking is a secure basis for philosophical thinking as well as \\"for substantial theses in science and morals\\". (3) Plato and Pythagoras shared a \\"mystical approach to the soul and its place in the material world\\". It is probable that both were influenced by Orphism.  Pythagoras held that all things are number, and the cosmos comes from numerical principles. The physical world of becoming is an imitation of the mathematical world of being. This ideas were very influential in Heraclitus, Parmenides and Plato.  Aristotle claimed that the philosophy of Plato closely followed the teachings of the Pythagoreans, and Cicero repeats this claim: \\"They say Plato learned all things Pythagorean\\" (Platonem ferunt didicisse Pythagorea omnia).  George Karamanolis notes that  Numenius accepted both Pythagoras and Plato as the two authorities one should follow in philosophy, but he regarded Plato's authority as subordinate to that of Pythagoras, whom he considered to be the source of all true philosophy--including Plato's own. For Numenius it is just that Plato wrote so many philosophical works, whereas Pythagoras' views were originally passed on only orally.  The precise relationship between Plato and Socrates remains an area of contention among scholars. Plato makes it clear in his Apology of Socrates that he was a devoted young follower of Socrates. In that dialogue, Socrates is presented as mentioning Plato by name as one of those youths close enough to him to have been corrupted, if he were in fact guilty of corrupting the youth, and questioning why their fathers and brothers did not step forward to testify against him if he was indeed guilty of such a crime (33d-34a). Later, Plato is mentioned along with Crito, Critobolus, and Apollodorus as offering to pay a fine of 30 minas on Socrates' behalf, in lieu of the death penalty proposed by Meletus (38b). In the Phaedo, the title character lists those who were in attendance at the prison on Socrates' last day, explaining Plato's absence by saying, \\"Plato was ill\\". (Phaedo 59b)  Plato never speaks in his own voice in his dialogues. In the Second Letter, it says, \\"no writing of Plato exists or ever will exist, but those now said to be his are those of a Socrates become beautiful and new\\" (341c); if the Letter is Plato's, the final qualification seems to call into question the dialogues' historical fidelity. In any case, Xenophon and Aristophanes seem to present a somewhat different portrait of Socrates from the one Plato paints. Some have called attention to the problem of taking Plato's Socrates to be his mouthpiece, given Socrates' reputation for irony and the dramatic nature of the dialogue form.  Aristotle attributes a different doctrine with respect to Forms to Plato and Socrates (Metaphysics 987b1-11). Aristotle suggests that Socrates' idea of forms can be discovered through investigation of the natural world, unlike Plato's Forms that exist beyond and outside the ordinary range of human understanding.  Mythos and logos are terms that evolved along classical Greece history. In the times of Homer and Hesiod (8th century BC) they were quite synonyms, and contained the meaning of tale or history. Later came historians like Herodotus and Thucydides, as well as philosophers as Parmenides and other Presocratics that introduced a distinction between both terms, and mythos became more a nonverifiable account, and logos a rational account. Plato, being a disciple of Socrates, and a strong partisan of philosophy based on logos, it seems that should have avoided the use of myth-telling. Instead he made an abundant use of it. This fact has produced analytical and interpretative work, in order to clarify the reasons and purposes for that use.  Plato, in general, distinguished between three types of myth. First there were the false myths, like those based on stories of gods subject to passions and sufferings, because reason teaches that God is perfect. Then came the myths based on true reasoning, and therefore also true. Finally there were those non verifiable because beyond of human reason, but containing some truth in them. Regarding the subjects of Plato's myths they are of two types, those dealing with the origin of the universe, and those about morals and the origin and fate of the soul.  It is generally agreed that the main purpose for Plato in using myths was didactic. He considered that only a few people were capable or interested in following a reasoned philosophical discourse, but men in general are attracted by stories and tales. Consequently then, he used the myth to convey the conclusions of the philosophical reasoning. Some of Plato's myths were based in traditional ones, others were modifications of them, and finally he also invented altogether new myths. Entity:","output":"The text is about the ancient Greek philosopher, Plato. It discusses various aspects of his life, philosophies, influences, and contributions to the Western philosophical tradition. A significant part of the text is focused on Plato's relationship with other philosophers of his time such as Socrates and Pythagoras, the latter of whom is said to have had significant influence on Plato's work. The text also explores the content and motivations of Plato's famed dialogues and his theories concerning Mythos and Logos. The influence of Plato's Academy in Athens, believed to be the first institution of higher learning in the Western world, is likewise outlined. Additionally, it delves into Plato's written works and the unique circumstances surrounding their survival and transmission over centuries, unlike the works of many of his contemporaries. The text also highlights aspects of contention among scholars, such as the precise relationship between Plato and Socrates, and the different interpretation of Socrates between Plato and other philosophers like Aristotle.

The U.S. Supreme Court signaled Wednesday it may be open to new limits on the government's ability to track someone's movements by accessing data on that person's cellphone.  A case before the high court could result in a landmark decision in the ongoing debate over civil liberties protections in an era of rapid technological change.  At issue is whether law enforcement will be able to access cellphone data that can reveal a person's whereabouts without having to first obtain a court-issued search warrant.  The case stems from the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. On Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information.  They also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  \\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\"  Some of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age.  \\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said.  Chief Justice John Roberts, who often sides with conservatives on the court, said the central question was whether the cellphone information should be accessible to the government \\"without a warrant.\\" Question: How long after Timothy Carpenter was convicted did he continue to rob people?

What is the solution?","output":"Sure. Let's solve the equation step by step. Step 1: Combine like terms on the right side of the equation. The equation is: 2683*v = -3250*v + 5364*v - 70556. Combining -3250*v and 5364*v, we have: 2683*v = 2114*v - 70556. Step 2: Subtraction of 2114*v from both sides. By doing so, we aim to isolate 'v' on one side of the equation.  Subtracting 2114*v from both sides results in:  2683*v - 2114*v = -70556, which simplifies to  569*v = -70556. Step 3: Solving for 'v'. We will now divide both sides by 569 to find the value of 'v'. Doing so gives us:  v = -70556 / 569. This simplifies to: v = -123.9297 (rounded to four decimal places). So, the solution to the equation is v = -123.9297."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It includes controlling physical access to the hardware, as well as protecting against harm that may come via network access, data and code injection, and due to malpractice by operators, whether intentional, accidental, or due to them being tricked into deviating from secure procedures. Protecting a device from harm requires deviating from what procedures? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"The question seems to ask about the specific procedures from which one needs to deviate in order to protect a device from harm. However, the passage does not talk about deviating from any procedures but rather emphasizes implementing secure procedures to protect the devices and information systems from threats. Therefore, it would be more accurate to discuss the procedures important for protecting devices and information systems from harm. These include: 1. Implementing strong passwords and multi-factor authentication to control access. 2. Regularly updating software and applying security patches to protect against known vulnerabilities. 3. Installing and regularly updating antivirus and anti-malware software to guard against malware threats. 4. Utilizing firewalls and network security measures to restrict and monitor incoming and outgoing traffic. 5. Educating users on safe practices, such as avoiding phishing emails, not downloading attachments from unknown sources, and not clicking on suspicious links. 6. Backing up data regularly to ensure safe recovery in case of a security breach or data loss. 7. Encrypting sensitive data both in transit and at rest to safeguard against unauthorized access. 8. Implementing proper access control measures, such as the principle of least privilege, which grants users access only to the resources necessary for their job responsibilities. 9. Regularly conducting security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities. 10. Developing and maintaining a disaster recovery plan to minimize downtime and data loss in the event of a security incident. Considering these points, it is important to focus on adhering to secure procedures rather than deviating from them to protect devices and information systems from harm. The passage does mention the possibility of operators being tricked into deviating from secure procedures, which could lead to harm, but it infers the importance of not deviating from secure procedures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Trisha dreamed of being a Playboy Bunny since the days she still had buck-teeth and fried egg boobs. She blu-tacked page threes above her bed-head and had me snap topless Polaroids till they littered the floor. She told me to imagine she had 36DDs and peroxide blonde hair. I used to wish like hell that she wasn't my cousin. When she was fifteen Trisha started putting out for the boys in the Kwik-Save car park for a tenner a time. She said she was an entrepreneur, not a prostitute. She started going steady with a kid called Keith. He was a fryer in the fish and chip shop. He had a future and a Ford Cortina. She got a job waitressing and she worked all the hours she could. Keith couldn't handle me and Trisha being as close as we were. Especially the time he caught Trisha bending over me in nothing but a frilly market stall thong while I worked the angles best I could to get a dangle-shot. Next night he took her in the car park woods and doped her up to the eyeballs. He took out a bottle of India ink and told her he would etch the love-heart she'd always wanted. Instead, he safety-pinned the word 'inbred' into her arse. Trisha's step-dad tracked the spits of blood and found her sobbing in the bathroom of their long-stay static. It didn't take him long to slap out the truth. He went straight round to Keith's place with a crow-bar and did enough damage to make sure he'd need more than laser treatment to put things right. Keith wasn't rolling in spare change so Trisha's step-dad took the Cortina as payment in lieu of her getting herself fixed up. Trisha got me to stash the Cortina up the lane at the back of Boyes' farm. Weekend nights, I drove her out to the dual carriageway truck-stop where she found a faster way to make her fortune in the fogged-up cabs.

Given the below context:  Although The Big Cypress is the largest growth of cypress swamps in South Florida, such swamps—as well as portions of sawgrass marshes—can be found near the Atlantic Coastal Ridge and between Lake Okeechobee and the Eastern flatwoods. Hardwood hammocks and pineland are often interspersed with the cypress ecosystem. Much like tree islands that are colloquially referred to as \\"heads\\", cypress trees grow in formations that resemble domes, with the tallest and thickest trunks in the center, rooted in the deepest peat. As the peat thins out, cypresses continue to grow, but are smaller and thinner, giving the small forest the appearance of a dome. They also grow in strands, slightly elevated on a plateau of limestone and surrounded on two sides by sloughs. Other hardwood trees can be found in cypress domes, such as red maple (Acer rubrum), swamp bay (Persea palustris), and pop ash (Fraxinus caroliniana). If cypresses are removed, hardwoods take over, and the ecosystem is recategorized as a mixed swamp forest. Because the cypress domes and strands retain moisture and block out much of the sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in cypress forests and in the past 100 years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000 wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the...  Guess a valid title for it!

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: I caught this Cuban film at at an arthouse film club. It was shown shortly after the magisterial 1935 Silly Symphony cartoon where the Isle of Symphony is reconciled with the Isle of Jazz. What with the recently deceased Ruben Gonzalez piped through speakers in this old cinema-ballroom and a Cuban flag hanging from peeling stucco rocaille motifs, the scene was set for a riproaring celebration of engaged filmmaking and synchronised hissing at the idiocies of Helms-Burton. But then the film started. And the cinema's peeling paint gradually became more interesting than the shoddy mess on-screen. The storyline of Nada Mas promises much. Carla is a bored envelope-stamper at a Cuban post office. Her only escape from an altogether humdrum existence is to purloin letters and rewrite them, transforming basic interpersonal grunts into Brontëan outbursts of breathless emotion. Cue numerous shots of photogenic Cubans gushing with joy, grief, pity, terror and the like. The problem is that the simplicity of the narrative is marred by endless excursions into film-school artiness, latino caricature, Marx brothers slapstick and even - during a particularly underwhelming editing trick - the celluloid scratching of a schoolkid defacement onto a character's face. Unidimensional characters abound. Cunda, the boss at the post office, is a humourless dominatrix-nosferatu. Her boss-eyed accomplice, Concha, variously points fingers, eavesdrops and screeches. Cesar, the metalhead dolt and romantic interest, reveals hidden writing talent when Carla departs for Miami. A chase scene (in oh-so-hilarious fast-forward) is thrown in for good measure. All this would be fine in a Mortadello and Filemon comic strip, but in a black-and-white zero-FX flick with highbrow pretensions, ahem. Nada Mas attempts to straddle the stile somewhere between the 'quirky-heroine-matchmakes-strangers' of Amelie and the 'poetry-as-great-redeemer' theme of Il Postino. Like Amelie, its protagonist is an eccentric single white female who combats impending spinsterdom by trying to bring magic into the lives of strangers. And like Il Postino, the film does not flinch from sustained recitals of poetry and a postman on a bicycle takes a romantic lead. Unfortunately, Nada Mas fails to capture the lushness and transcendence of either film. There are two things that might merit watching this film in a late-night TV stupor. The first is the opening overhead shot of Carla on a checker-tiled floor, which cuts to the crossword puzzle she is working on. The second is to see Nada Mas as a cautionary example: our post Buena Vista Social Club obsession with Cuban artistic output can often blinker us into accepting any dross that features a bongo on the soundtrack. This film should not have merited a global release - films such as Waiting List and Guantanamera cover similar thematic territory far more successfully.

From the moment my G.F. arrived, the staff is very friendly. We arrived around noon and our room we booked was ready (did not book a strip view because I was going to try for a room upgrade). I cant remember the guys name at the front desk that we had, but when I asked for a room upgrade, he did not hesitate at all and gladly upgraded us.

The water temperature is absolutely perfect!  The pool area fills in very quickly, so if you want a good seat in the prime real estate, make sure to get there as soon as the pool opens.

The city was built upon the Euphrates and divided in equal parts along its left and right banks, with steep embankments to contain the river's seasonal floods. Babylon was originally a small Semitic Akkadian city dating from the period of the Akkadian Empire c. 2300 BC.  - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.  - The Parthian Empire (247 BC  224 AD), also known as the Arsacid Empire, was a major Iranian political and cultural power in ancient Iran and Iraq. Its latter name comes from Arsaces I of Parthia who, as leader of the Parni tribe, founded it in the mid-3rd century BC when he conquered the region of Parthia in Iran's northeast, then a satrapy (province) in rebellion against the Seleucid Empire. Mithridates I of Parthia (r. \\"c\\". 171138 BC) greatly expanded the empire by seizing Media and Mesopotamia from the Seleucids. At its height, the Parthian Empire stretched from the northern reaches of the Euphrates, in what is now central-eastern Turkey, to eastern Iran. The empire, located on the Silk Road trade route between the Roman Empire in the Mediterranean Basin and the Han Empire of China, became a center of trade and commerce.  - The Seleucid Empire (\\"Basileía tn Seleukidn\\") was a Hellenistic state ruled by the Seleucid dynasty, which existed from 312 BC to 63 BC; it was founded by Seleucus I Nicator following the division of the Macedonian empire vastly expanded by Alexander the Great. Seleucus received Babylonia and, from there, expanded his dominions to include much of Alexander's near eastern territories. At the height of its power, it included central Anatolia, Persia, the Levant, Mesopotamia, and what is now Kuwait, Afghanistan, and parts of Pakistan and Turkmenistan.  - Mithridates or Mithradates I (Parthian: \\"Mihrdat\\", , \\"Mehrdd\\"), (ca. 195 BC  132 BC) was king of the Parthian Empire from 165 BC to 132 BC, succeeding his brother Phraates I. His father was King Phriapatius of Parthia, who died ca. 176 BC). Mithridates I made Parthia into a major political power by expanding the empire to the east, south, and west.

The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.  - Phraates II ( Persian :    ) , was king of the Parthian Empire from 132 BC to 126 BC.

Is this product review negative? Answer:","output":"Yes, this product review is undoubtedly negative in nature. The title itself, \\"Don't waste your money,\\" clearly conveys a strong sense of disapproval and dissatisfaction with the product. The reviewer elaborates on several points to substantiate their opinion. Firstly, they explicitly state that the CD was a \\"total waste of time and money\\" and claims that they didn't learn anything from it, which directly implies that the product did not meet their expectations in terms of educational value. Additionally, the reviewer criticizes the professionalism with which the product was created. They mention that the CD's quality was so poor that it appeared to have been made in a subpar environment, perhaps a \\"back room somewhere.\\" This notion only strengthens the negative sentiment expressed toward the product, as it suggests a lack of care or craftsmanship that customers might reasonably expect from a high-quality, professional product. The review also specifically identifies audible flaws in the recording itself, such as the sound of the author flipping pages, pausing, and stumbling when they lose their place. These observations further contribute to the overall negative impression of the product, as they imply that the production values were substandard. Sound quality is an essential aspect of any audio recording, and a customer's ability to perceive these issues within the final product could easily lead to disappointment or frustration. The emphatic \\"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!\\" statement at the end of the review serves as a clear warning to potential buyers to avoid purchasing the product. There is no ambiguity about the author's disappointment with the CD, and they are actively discouraging others from making the same mistake. This demonstrates that not only did their experience with the product fail to meet their expectations, but they also feel strongly enough about it to try and deter others from wasting their resources as well. In conclusion, the product review is unambiguously negative, with the reviewer expressing strong dissatisfaction with the CD's quality, content, and overall value. They provide specific examples of the CD's flaws to support their opinion and strongly caution potential buyers against spending their money on the product. The points raised in the review depict an overall disappointing and frustrating experience, which the reviewer does not hesitate to share with others to spare them a similar outcome."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Donald Trump told a group of Republican lawmakers at a meeting Tuesday he backs a pair of their immigration bills under consideration in the House of Representatives. The meeting came as criticism continued over the Trump administration's policy of separating children from their parents and other adults at the southern border with Mexico as they illegally enter the United States. In his remarks to lawmakers, according to White House principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah, Trump \\"endorsed both House immigration bills that build the wall, close legal loopholes, cancel the visa lottery, curb so-called \\"chain migration,\\" and solve the border crisis and family separation issue by allowing for family detention and removal.\\" Republican Rep.

Kansainvälisten yritysten vaikutus maailmantaloudessa ja työllisyydessä ei ole jäänyt huomaamatta sillä ne ovatkin monin tavoin vaikuttaneet erilaisten tuotteiden markkinoihin ja niiden kehitykseen. Valta- ja markkina-asemansa ansiosta nämä yritykset pystyvät usein kontrolloimaan ja hallitsemaan sekä resurssien jakelua että kysyntää, mikä voi aiheuttaa kilpailun vääristymistä ja epätasapainoa markkinoilla. Monikansallisilla yrityksillä on kuitenkin myös merkittävä rooli kansainvälisessä työllisyydessä. Esimerkiksi sata suurinta niistä työllistävät 16 % maailman työvoimasta, mikä osoittaa niiden mittavan roolin työpaikkojen luojina. Näiden yritysten globaali ulottuvuus mahdollistaa työllisyyden tarjoamisen eri maissa, mikä voi johtaa talouskasvuun ja tasa-arvoisemman tulojen jakautumisen parantamiseen.

Step 1: Identify the main keywords and their general connotations. The main keywords in the sentence are \\"uptight\\", \\"middle class\\", \\"bores\\", and \\"antonia\\". The general connotation of \\"uptight\\" is negative, as it implies being overly stiff or tense. \\"Middle class\\" is neutral in terms of sentiment, as it merely refers to a socioeconomic class. \\"Bores\\" is negative, as it suggests that the person in question is uninteresting or dull. \\"Antonia\\" is a name, and therefore neutral in terms of sentiment. Step 2: Combine the connotations of the keywords to determine the overall sentiment. Since there are negative connotations with both \\"uptight\\" and \\"bores\\", and neutral connotations with \\"middle class\\" and \\"Antonia\\", it can be concluded that the overall sentiment of the sentence leans towards the negative side.

Information:  - Zalmoxis  is a divinity of the Getae and Dacians (a people of the lower Danube), mentioned by Herodotus in his \\"Histories\\" IV, 9396.  - The Danube (, known by various names in other languages) is Europe's second-longest river, after the Volga River, and also the longest river in the European Union region. It is located in Central and Eastern Europe.  - See Kogaionon ( genus ) for the mammal from the Upper Cretaceous . Kogaionon was the holy mountain of the Geto - Dacians , the place where Zalmoxis stayed in an underground cave for three years . After his disappearance into Kogaionon , he was considered dead by the Getae but after three years he resurrected and showed himself to the people , who became convinced by his holy preaching when he emerged from Kogaionon . Strabo claims that a river with the same name flowed in the vicinity . One modern translation of Kogaionon is \`\` sacred mountain '' , which would be connected to a probable Dacian word kaga meaning \`\` sacred '' , attested in two early 2nd century inscriptions from Tomis . Kogaionon 's location is still under debate , but thought to be either in the area around the Dacian capital Sarmizegetusa Regia ( there is a 2291m summit there called Gugu and there are speculations that it could be the holy mountain ; it may also have been Dealul Grditei where the ruins of the sanctuaries of Sarmizegetusa are located ) or even the Ceahlu mountain , because every year on 6/7 August the shadow of the mountain forms a pyramid which is thought to have been made by the Dacians .  - The Getae or or Gets (singular ) are several Thracian tribes that once inhabited the regions to either side of the Lower Danube, in what is today northern Bulgaria and southern Romania. Both the singular form \\"Get\\" and plural \\"Getae\\" may be derived from a Greek exonym: the area was the hinterland of Greek colonies on the Black Sea coast, bringing the Getae into contact with the Ancient Greeks from an early date. Several scholars, especially in the Romanian historiography, posit the identity between the Getae and their westward neighbours, the Dacians.  - Herodotus (\\"Hródotos\\") was a Greek historian who was born in Halicarnassus in the Persian Empire (modern-day Bodrum, Turkey) and lived in the fifth century BC (484 425 BC), a contemporary of Socrates. He is widely referred to as \\"The Father of History\\" (first conferred by Cicero); he was the first historian known to have broken from Homeric tradition to treat historical subjects as a method of investigationspecifically, by collecting his materials systematically and critically, and then arranging them into a historiographic narrative. \\"The Histories\\" is the only work which he is known to have produced, a record of his \\"inquiry\\" (or \\"historía\\") on the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, including a wealth of geographical and ethnographical information. Some of his stories were fanciful and others inaccurate; yet he states that he was reporting only what was told to him and was often correct in his information. Despite Herodotus' historical significance, little is known of his personal history.    What object entity has the relation of 'country' with the subject 'kogaionon'?

Arjen Robben believes his attempt to con the referee early in Sunday’s dramatic last-16 win over Mexico did not influence the result or the penalty decision that came after he again fell theatrically under a challenge. The Dutch FA reacted aggressively on Monday when they realised just how much profile had been given to Robben’s post-match admission that he had tried to illegally win a free-kick during the 2-1 win in Fortaleza. However, after learning that FIFA would not take any retrospective action following his admission of gamesmanship, Robben attended a specially arranged press conference on Monday and reiterated his confession of the night before. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Robben say it was a clear penalty and see some of his dives. Admission: Arjen Robben has confessed to diving during the first half of Holland's victory over Mexico. Turning point: Arjen Robben's left foot is clipped by the boot of Mexico defender Rafael Marquez. Theatrics: Robben fell under the challenge but his reaction was what convinced the referee. ‘I was not afraid of FIFA action, no,’ said Robben. ‘I. am an honest guy but it had no influence on the game. It’s a shame. because yesterday in an interview after the game I was very honest. ‘Maybe sometimes you are punished for honesty, but I always prefer to be honest.‘I. said there was one foul in the first half where I went to the ground. because I thought he would tackle me, but he took his leg away at the. last moment and I went to the ground without a touch. ‘It was a stupid action from me, but it had no influence on the game, had nothing to do with the penalty kick. ‘In the first half we should have had a penalty kick, in the second half the penalty at the end was a clear foul. ‘It. is a shame there is so much discussion because we put on a great. performance as a team. That should be the main thing. Sometimes, you. know, I like to be honest and I apologise for this action in the first. half, but that is football. It had nothing to do with the result of the. game.’ Outraged: Mexico coach Miguel Herrera remonstrates with officials and Dutch players at the full time whistle. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, scorer of Holland’s injury-time winner against Mexico on Sunday, has more goals (35) than starts (34) for the national team. Robben. was accused of diving three times by Mexico coach Miguel Herrera after. his team’s defeat and it is clear the Bayern Munich winger will come. under scrutiny when Holland face Costa Rica here on Saturday. Herrera believes that Robben dived to win the decisive penalty at the death. ‘I don’t change myself,’ said Robben. ‘That’s my personality. ‘I think it’s good. I apologised for one stupid action, but it didn’t have an influence in the game. ‘We had two clear penalties, one was given. That is it. I don’t think we should talk about it any more.’ Decider: Marquez appeals after Robben goes down for the late penalty that won Holland the game.

Van Gaal hauled Van Persie off 15 minutes from the end of Sunday. night’s dramatic win and watched as his replacement Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. set up one goal and scored the winner from the penalty spot. Not going to plan: Robin van Persie did not have a great game against Mexico and was taken off. Super sub: Klass-Jan Huntelaar celebrates scoring the dramatic and controversial late goal for the Dutch. Afterwards, Van Gaal was asked if Van Persie was injured and said: ‘No. The substitution of Van Persie was tactical. ‘Let’s not forget before he joined team he was recovering from an injury. ‘It’s. difficult for him to keep up 90 minutes especially in these conditions. Anyway, this trainer wants to win. So he makes the changes and the. substitutions he needs. ‘It’s simple. Nothing else matters.’ Van. Persie is still expected to start in Saturday’s quarter-final but. holding midfielder Nigel de Jong is unlikely to recover from the groin. injury that forced him off the field early on in the Mexico game. ‘I don’t know but I think it might be difficult,’ added Van Gaal. ‘It is a muscle injury.’ Decisive: Louis van Gaal substituted a subdued Van Persie against Mexico and Holland went on to win. Van. Gaal has denied that his team have a straight forward route to the last. four, even though quarter-final opponents Costa Rica are ranked 28th in. the world and had to play extra-time against Greece on Sunday. ‘Let. me tell you the Dutch media thought we would never survive the first. round, so how we ended up becoming up favourites, I’ll never know,’ he. said. ‘This group of players is very modest. ‘We have outstanding spirit, outstanding atmosphere, and that led to victory. ‘Costa Rica very difficult opponents, otherwise they wouldn’t have ended up in a quarter-final.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Dutch footballer Arjen Robben confessed to diving during the first half of Holland's victory over Mexico in the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

Title: Brotherhood of the Wolf Movie plot: The film begins during the French Revolution, with the aged Marquis d'Apcher as the narrator, writing his memoirs in a castle, while the voices of a mob can be heard from outside. The film flashes back to 1764,[8] when a mysterious beast terrorized the province of GÃ©vaudan and nearby lands. GrÃ©goire de Fronsac, a knight and the royal naturalist of King Louis XV of France, and his Iroquois companion Mani, arrive in GÃ©vaudan to capture the beast. Upon arrival, they rescue Jean Chastel, an aged healer, and his daughter La Bavarde from an attack by soldiers. The young and enlightened ThomasâMarquis d'Apcherâlater befriends the two outsiders. Fronsac is initially skeptical about the beast's existence, since survivors describe it as much larger than any wolf he has ever seen. However, by studying the bite size on a victim of the beast, he deduces that it must weigh roughly 500Â lb (227Â kg). Captain Duhamel, an army officer leading the hunt for the beast, has killed dozens of ordinary wolves, but has not come close to the actual killer. While staying in GÃ©vaudan, Fronsac romances Marianne de Morangias, the daughter of a local count, whose brother, Jean-FranÃ§ois, was also an avid hunter and a world traveler, before losing one arm to a lion in Africa. Fronsac is also intrigued by Sylvia, an Italian courtesan at the local brothel. While investigating another victim, Fronsac finds a fang made of steel, which increases his doubts of the beast's existence. Another witness swears that the beast is controlled by a human master. Fronsac studies the patterns of the attacks and victims, trying to find a common thread and reveal a murderer. As the investigation proves to be unfruitful, the king's weapons master, Lord de Beauterne, arrives to put an end to the beast. However, instead of doing so, Beauterne kills an ordinary wolf and tells Fronsac to alter the corpse so it resembles the monster accordingly.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: While you can't lose weight from one part of your body specifically, losing weight from your entire body will also lower the amount of fat in your thighs. If you have good underlying muscle tone, this should leave you with slimmer, firmer thighs. Your first step should be to start keeping track of how many calories you eat per day — you may be surprised how quickly they can pile up. Calorie counters can be a huge help here. These handy online programs allow you to input the food you eat each day to get an accurate count for your calorie intake, then input your height, weight, sex, and exercise level to figure out how many calories you've burnt. Great calorie counters are available at Fatsecret.com, Myfitnesspal.com, and more.There are even calorie counter apps available for download to mobile devices. Once you know how many calories you're eating each day, losing weight is simple (though often not easy.) As long as you eat fewer calories than you burn during the day, you will lose weight — it's just a matter of time. The greater the gap between the calories you intake and the calories you expend, the quicker you'll lose weight. Note, however, that any diet that leaves you unbearably hungry or unable to function is not a healthy one. In general, one pound of body mass is equal to about 3,500 calories. Losing this many calories is more or less equal to losing one pound. In other words, if you have a calorie deficit of 500 calories per day, you'll lose about a pound per week because 500 × 7 = 3,500. Going on a diet doesn't mean starving your body of the things it needs to function. In fact, since you're eating less than you normally would, it's extra important to eat healthy so that your body gets adequate nutrition. As you stick to your diet, remember that you're aiming to skimp on calories, not nutrients, and plan your meals accordingly.  This means that high-calorie, low-nutrient foods (like processed foods, sweets, greasy snack foods, and so on) should be the first things to go. In fact, if you tend to overindulge in these sorts of foods, you may notice that removing them from your diet is enough to make you lose weight without changing anything else. On the other hand, high-nutrient, low-calorie foods are a must. For example, nutrition-dense vegetables like kale and spinach can give you loads of vitamins and minerals for very few calories, while whole wheat grains provide plenty of energy and filling fiber. Even lean meats like chicken breast can provide filling, satisfying protein (a must if you're trying to build muscle) without having a caloric load that's unmanageable. For more information, see our article on so-called superfoods. \\" Going on a diet shouldn't mean making yourself absolutely miserable. It's OK to enjoy life's culinary pleasures from time to time, especially at special occasions like holidays, birthday parties, and so on. As long as you return to your diet the next day, any sort minor indulgence is unlikely to hurt your progress in the long term. In fact, the boost in morale from a single diet \\"cheat\\" day can be so rewarding that some dieticians actually recommend it. Think of it like the productivity boost you get at work or school after going on vacation — taking some time off makes it easier to stay focused in the long term. As noted above, there are wrong ways to lose weight. For instance, losing weight too quickly can be harmful — even a cause of numerous health problems if it's prolonged. In addition, any sort of diet that relies on starvation, purging, or other drastic solutions should be out of the question. These tactics constitute eating disorders — potentially serious conditions that require medical intervention. Summary:","output":"To lose fat in your thighs, focus on losing weight from your entire body through calorie control and a balanced diet. Track your daily calorie intake using online calorie counters or mobile apps. Aim for a calorie deficit to lose weight, but don't starve yourself or compromise nutrition. Focus on high-nutrient, low-calorie foods like vegetables and lean meats, while cutting out high-calorie, low-nutrient foods. Be mindful of moderation and allow for occasional indulgences during special occasions. Avoid extreme weight loss methods, as they can lead to health complications and are unsustainable in the long term."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Most members are not paid a salary but can claim a daily allowance of up to £300 for Parliamentary duties. The ERS said the Lords was \\"growing out of control\\" but a peer told the BBC that they do more than just vote. Darren Hughes, deputy chief executive of the ERS, said: \\"The prime minister said he regrets not reforming the second House in the last parliament. \\"It's time for him to act and finally fix our broken upper chamber.\\" However, Baroness Flather - a former Conservative peer who is now an independent, or \\"crossbencher\\" - said the report \\"missed the point\\". She said some crossbenchers rarely vote, but they still contribute to sittings by raising questions, speaking in debates and by meeting people. \\"I speak all the time in debates and questions. I became a crossbencher because I want to speak about issues I know the Tories don't want me to speak about. \\"I might not vote but I am there and I am doing what I think I should be doing. I am not just going in for 20 minutes,\\" she said. Members do not have to vote in the House of Lords to be eligible for the £300 daily allowance - they can claim it for carrying out other duties. According to the financial guide for members, they can claim the allowance if they attended a sitting of the House, or undertook \\"qualifying work away from Westminster\\". The daily allowance replaced separate overnight allowances, day allowances, and office costs in the previous system. Members do not have to claim the allowance, or they can claim a reduced allowance of £150 a day.

Answer:","output":"Moses Henry \\"Moss\\" Cass, born on 18 February 1927 in Narrogin, Western Australia, is a former member of the Australian House of Representatives. He is of Australian nationality. Cass was educated in state schools and later graduated in medicine from the University of Sydney. He worked as a research fellow at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne and as the director of the Melbourne-based Trade Union Clinic and Research Centre. Moss Cass served as a parliamentarian in the Australian House of Representatives, representing the federal seat of Maribyrnong. He was elected in 1969 after winning the seat from the Liberal Party. As a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), Cass was part of the first national Labor government in 23 years when Gough Whitlam led the party to power in the 1972 election. Cass was appointed Minister for the Environment and Conservation and was succeeded by Neville Bonner when he retired from politics in 1983. As a minister, Cass was concerned about the effects of uranium mining and its adverse impact on the Northern aboriginal people. He was unsuccessful in preventing the flooding of Lake Pedder in Tasmania, but he did contribute to the end of sand mining on Fraser Island and the government protection of the Great Barrier Reef. Cass’s predecessor in the federal seat of Maribyrnong is not explicitly mentioned in the provided bio. Before entering politics, Cass had an occupation as a medical professional, working as a research fellow at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne and as director of the Melbourne-based Trade Union Clinic and Research Centre. His union activities led to his pre-selection as the Labor candidate for the federal seat of Maribyrnong. As for his term duration, Cass served as a member of the House of Representatives from his election in 1969 until his retirement in 1983. His term as Minister for the Environment and Conservation started in 1972 when the Labor government came into power and ended before his retirement from politics in 1983.

Premise: A man kissing a baby at a marathon. Hypothesis: A man is enjoying dinner with family at a restaurant. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"No, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The premise and the hypothesis are focused on two separate events and scenarios which are not directly related to one another. Let's break the premise and the hypothesis down to better understand why the conclusion cannot be derived from the given information. Premise: \\"A man kissing a baby at a marathon.\\" The premise introduces a scenario where a man is kissing a baby at a marathon. The marathon is an outdoor running event, and it is likely that the man and the baby have some relationship or connection, for instance, the man could be the baby's father, uncle, or a family friend. This situation could happen in a public area with several participants and onlookers. It's a scene of a social gathering, and the man is showing affection to the baby in the presence of others. Hypothesis: \\"A man is enjoying dinner with family at a restaurant.\\" The hypothesis describes a different situation altogether. It narrates a man having dinner with his family in a restaurant, which implies an indoor setting. The focus is on the man enjoying dinner, and there's no mention of the baby or the marathon. It illustrates an intimate social setting between family members in a dining atmosphere where people share conversations and experiences over a meal. Now, let's examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. They both describe distinct scenarios, with the first one mentioning a man kissing a baby at a marathon (outdoor), and the second one talking about a man enjoying dinner with his family at a restaurant (indoor). These two situations do not provide enough information to establish a connection or validate the hypothesis based on the premise. For example, we cannot assume from the premise that the man kissing a baby at a marathon is the same man enjoying dinner with his family at the restaurant, as there is no specific link mentioned between their situations. The premise and the hypothesis each describe unique events, independent from one another, and we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He is trying to devise a technique that would  be able to control chemical reactions. For that, he conducted two tests. In the first test, he used warmer reactants. He called it reactant A. In the second test, he used cooler reactants. He called it reactant B.  But I can use this background: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage.  What is an answer for this question: In which reactants the particles would collide with greater force, reactant A or reactant B? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided and the principles of chemical reactions, the answer to your question is: In reactant A, the particles would collide with greater force. To further elaborate, let's break down the information and principles that lead to this conclusion: 1. Temperature and reaction rate: It is established that when the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. This is because the particles in the reactants have more energy at higher temperatures, which allows them to move faster. Faster-moving particles are more likely to collide with one another, leading to a quicker and more efficient reaction. 2. Reactant A and B temperature differences: In this situation, Rob, the chemist, has conducted two tests with different temperature reactants. Reactant A consists of warmer reactants, while reactant B has cooler reactants. Considering the principles mentioned in point 1, we can infer that Reactant A has a higher temperature than Reactant B. 3. Particle collision and force: At higher temperatures, particles in the reactants have more energy, causing them to move at a faster pace. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. This increased force can lead to more successful and effective chemical reactions. 4. Food spoilage example: The given example of food spoilage demonstrates how chemical reactions occur faster at higher temperatures. Food spoils due to chemical reactions, and we store food in the refrigerator or freezer to slow down these reactions by decreasing the temperature. Lower temperatures result in slower chemical reactions, reducing the rate of spoilage. Taking all these points into consideration, Reactant A, which has warmer reactants, would experience particles colliding with greater force due to the higher temperature and the increased energy of the particles. This would lead to faster and more effective chemical reactions in Reactant A as compared to Reactant B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:The child was lonely, what did he want from his parents? - overabundance - comprehensive - plentitude - superabundance - presence  The best answer is A:","output":"The child, in his solitude, craved certain fundamental aspects from his parents that are not merely defined by materialistic expressions or financial provisions but are rich in emotional cohesiveness and are of substantial significance in child's healthy growth and development.  His deep yearning was for their overabundance of love, care, and affection. In each moment of his childhood, he wished to feel the overwhelming wave of their adoration. He wished for tender kiss on his forehead before he fell asleep, for warm hugs during his daily downfalls, for loving praises in his small victories, and even comforting silence in his moments of meltdowns. The child's solitude was a phase longing for an overabundance of parental affection. Additionally, the child desired a comprehensive understanding from his parents. He wished that his parents wouldn't just see his joy, tears, and fears in fragments but rather understand him in a holistic manner. He desired that his parents comprehend his interests and passions, support his dreams and aspirations, and guide him not only towards academic excellence but also navigate life skills with ethically moral compass.  The child's solitude also echoed a strong desire for plenitude, not in terms of material possessions, but in terms of emotional availability from his parents. He wished his parents to wholly and fully exist in his life, without their time or attention divided. He wished them to share his worldview, participate actively in his journey, and contribute with dedicated involvement into his growth and evolution as an individual.  Moreover, he longed for a superabundance of presence from his parents. He needed them to not only be physically present but also emotionally, cognitively, and lovingly present in his life. He wished his parents to understand the importance of 'being there' for him, to simply sit with him, answer his curious question, listen to his little stories, and even watch him sleep. He needed them to genuinely be a part of his life, not occasionally, but as a constant that he could rely on.  In summary, the child in his loneliness deeply yearned for an overabundance of love and affection, a comprehensive understanding, a plenitude of emotional availability, and a superabundance of presence from his parents. His loneliness was essentially a silent cry and a call for these elemental but often overlooked aspects that could vastly enrich and enhance the quality of his childhood and his emotional health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It was designed to supersede the DVD format, in that it is capable of storing high-definition (720p and 1080p) and ultra high-definition video resolution (2160p). The plastic disc is 120 mm in diameter and 1.2 mm thick, the same size as DVDs and CDs. Conventional (pre-BD-XL) Blu-ray Disc discs contain 25 GB per layer, with dual layer discs (50 GB) being the industry standard for feature-length video discs. Triple-layer discs (100 GB) and quadruple layers (128 GB) are available for \\"BD-XL\\" re-writer drives. The name \\"Blu-ray\\" refers to the blue laser (specifically, a violet laser) used to read the disc, which allows information to be stored at a greater density than is possible with the longer-wavelength red laser used for DVDs. The main application of Blu-ray is as a medium for video material such as feature films and physical distribution of video games for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Besides the hardware specifications, Blu-ray is associated with a set of multimedia formats.  - A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects, and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision.

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.  - Horror is a genre of fiction which is intended to, or has the capacity to frighten, scare, disgust, or startle their readers or viewers by inducing feelings of horror and terror. Literary historian J. A. Cuddon has defined the horror story as \\"a piece of fiction in prose of variable length... which shocks or even frightens the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing\\". It creates an eerie and frightening atmosphere. Horror is frequently supernatural, though it can be non-supernatural.

Find the right ending to this passage. (CNN) -- When Bill Gates testified via videotape in Microsoft's antitrust trial in 1998, he was combative and defensive, as if he couldn't believe how stupid the entire procedure was. He didn't expect the tape to be shown in court. It was, and it was a disaster. Public opinion turned -- instead of a billionaire genius who had built Microsoft into the most valuable tech company in the world, he was a condescending monopolist who didn't have time for the legal system. Amazingly, Gates didn't see it coming. As Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen relates in his recent autobiography, the anti-Microsoft sentiment \\"cut Bill to the core.\\" Gates told the media that government attorney David Boies was \\"really out to destroy Microsoft.\\" For Google's sake, here's hoping he handles it with more grace than OPTIONS: - Bill. - Bill Gates. - CNN. - David Boies. - Gates. - Google. - Larry Page. - Matt Rosoff. - Microsoft. - Paul Allen. - Rosoff. - anti-Microsoft.","output":"- Bill Gates.

Leeds said last week they were under no pressure to sell their captain after he handed in a transfer request.

Q:Given the below context:  The Shackleton–Rowett Expedition (1921–22) was Sir Ernest Shackleton's last Antarctic project, and the final episode in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. The venture, financed by John Quiller Rowett, is sometimes referred to as the Quest Expedition after its ship Quest, a converted Norwegian sealer. Shackleton had originally intended to go to the Arctic and explore the Beaufort Sea, but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic. Quest, smaller than any recent Antarctic exploration vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. The major part of the subsequent attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, Frank Wild. The shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20°E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier.

The reporter speaks of Muntz's various accomplishments and discoveries before commenting that he was recently dishonored by scientists who believed his latest find, the large skeleton of a bird, was a hoax. Intent on proving them wrong, Muntz is seen boarding his zeppelin with his team of dogs and promises to return once he has brought back living proof of his find. After the show, Carl runs down the street with his balloon, named after Muntzs zeppelin The Spirit of Adventure. He passes an old, rundown house where he hears someone shout out Muntz's famous slogan: Adventure is out there!Carl goes inside to investigate and meets a young, outgoing tomboy who shares his passion for exploration and admiration of Charles Muntz. Startled by her loud, boyish demeanor at first, Carl loses his balloon in the rafters. The girl, Ellie (Elie Docter), helps him retrieve it, though Carl falls from a beam and breaks his arm. Ellie sneaks into his room that night and shows him her adventure book where she expresses a desire to one day move to the top of Paradise Falls in South America, showing him a picture that she 'ripped right out of a library book'. She makes him promise that they will go together someday before leaving. A musical montage shows Carl and Ellie eventually getting married and moving into the old house where they first met. Their marriage is blissful and they get jobs as a balloon salesman and zookeeper, respectively.

Anyway, if guys' little tricks and dating games ever get you down, read this book. It'll help you turn the tables on that guy you could never figure out. Also, a couple of the love scenes were really hot!! Answer: A:","output":"The tone of the product review provided is overall positive. The reviewer praises numerous aspects of the book, starting with its unique perspective, allowing insights into what the male character might be thinking, a feature that clearly delights the reviewer. This quality of the book seems to fill a void for the reader who expresses a desire for more books with a similar approach.  Another major point the reviewer highlights is the book's capacity to entertain while also encouraging the reader to reflect. This balance is crucial for readers who look for depth in their reading material and appreciate the incorporation of humor, making the reading experience enjoyable and not too heavy.  In addition to the overall enjoyment, the reviewer indicates the book offers practical value by offering an interpretation of 'guys' little tricks and dating games'. This suggests that the content is relatable on a personal level and can act as a tool when dealing with similar situations, making the book even more appealing to prospective readers who might find themselves facing similar issues. The reviewer's recommendation to read this book if the reader is feeling overwhelmed by their own dating experiences is a clear endorsement of the book and the insight it offers. The comment about some of the love scenes being 'really hot' further adds to the positive review. This comment indicates that the book might contain exciting, engaging content that readers who prefer a bit of spice in their romances will appreciate. However, the review does not make any specific negative observations about the book. While the title of the review might suggest a negative tone on first glance due to the use of the term 'ex-boyfriend', on closer analysis, it appears to be more of a clever play on words emphasizing the novel's theme rather than expressing any dissatisfaction. All these factors lead to the conclusion that the review is predominantly positive and enthusiastically endorses the book 'Love Monkey'. It seems to suggest this book is compelling, insightful, and even potentially helpful for those trying to understand the dynamics of romantic relationships and the opposite sex."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Where have Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana and Narendra Damodardas Modi served in politics? Answer:","output":"The Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) is a financial inclusion program launched by the Government of India and implemented by the Department of Financial Services, Ministry of Finance. The primary aim of this scheme is to provide affordable access to financial services to the unbanked and underprivileged sections of Indian society. These services include bank accounts, credit, insurance, and pension facilities. PMJDY was launched by the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Damodardas Modi, on August 28, 2014. This program is a crucial part of the government's policy framework to foster inclusive growth and ensure social security for all citizens. Narendra Damodardas Modi is an Indian politician who has served as the 14th Prime Minister of India since 2014. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Prior to his tenure as Prime Minister, Modi held various positions in politics, both at the state and national levels. Narendra Modi's political career began in the 1970s when he joined the RSS, a right-wing Hindu nationalist organization, as a full-time worker. In the 1980s, Modi held various positions within the BJP, including General Secretary for the party in Gujarat, his home state. His leadership roles within the BJP led him to be appointed the Chief Minister of Gujarat in October 2001, following the resignation of his predecessor, Keshubhai Patel. Modi gained national prominence during his time as Chief Minister of Gujarat. From 2001 to 2014, Modi implemented several economic reforms, infrastructure development projects, and social welfare schemes aimed at improving the standard of living for the people of Gujarat. His administration faced controversy, however, particularly related to the 2002 Gujarat riots and alleged human rights abuses during his tenure. Nevertheless, Modi successfully led the BJP to three consecutive electoral victories in Gujarat, and his leadership was instrumental in consolidating the party's position both at the state and national levels. In 2014, Narendra Modi was appointed the Prime Ministerial candidate for the BJP in the Indian General elections. He successfully led his party to a landslide victory, securing a majority for the BJP in the Indian Parliament, a feat only achieved a few times in the history of Indian politics. Modi's charismatic leadership and reputation for effective governance helped the BJP expand its voter base across India. As Prime Minister, Modi has implemented various economic and social policies, aimed at promoting financial inclusion, improving infrastructure, and fostering a more business-friendly environment in India. One of the flagship programs during his tenure has been the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana, which has played a pivotal role in helping the unbanked population gain access to basic financial services. This program has been widely recognized for its impact on poverty alleviation and financial inclusion in the country. In conclusion, the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana and Narendra Damodardas Modi have served in politics through their efforts in promoting financial inclusion, economic growth, and social welfare in India. PMJDY has become a crucial component of Modi's policy framework in his capacity as Prime Minister, while Modi's political career has spanned various roles from grassroots activism to the highest office in the Indian Government. Their combined efforts in these areas have made a significant impact on the lives of millions of Indians and have contributed to shaping the nation's trajectory in the 21st century."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(CNN) -- The coalition is growing -- not just in words, but in action. Just over two weeks after U.S. President Barack Obama vowed \\"America will lead a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat\\" posed by ISIS, more than 50 countries have signed up, so far, to support the fight. They include new entrants Belgium, Denmark and Britain, which will all send fighter jets to Iraq to assist that nation's government and the United States in the anti-ISIS military campaign. Even the foreign minister of Russia -- which has butted heads repeatedly with Washington, including over whether the President of neighboring war-torn Syria needs to go -- signaled Friday his country is ready to back Iraq in fighting terrorists, \\"above all the Islamic State,\\" which is what ISIS calls itself. For all these issues in Iraq, what to do on the ground in","output":"Syria remains a complex and contentious matter. While the United States and its coalition partners are focused on dismantling ISIS's strongholds in both Iraq and Syria, finding a unified approach to address the ongoing Syrian crisis has proven to be challenging. The primary concern of the international community involves balancing the need to weaken ISIS while simultaneously avoiding the unintentional strengthening of the Assad regime, which many nations, including the U.S., view as illegitimate and oppressive. To effectively combat ISIS on the ground in Syria, the coalition must embark on a multifaceted strategy. This could involve increasing support for moderate Syrian rebel groups who are fighting against both ISIS and the Assad regime, providing them with necessary resources and training to bolster their position in the conflict. Additionally, targeted airstrikes against ISIS infrastructure and leadership within Syria could help weaken the group's presence and slow their territorial expansion. Diplomacy and fostering regional cooperation are also essential components of the coalition's approach in Syria. Engaging with both regional and international actors, including Russia and Iran, despite their differing views on the Syrian regime, may help facilitate a political solution to the ongoing conflict - one that addresses not only the threat posed by ISIS but also the future of Syria's government and its people's wellbeing. Ultimately, finding a viable solution to the Syrian crisis requires the international community to navigate a delicate balance of interests and objectives. As the coalition expands and more nations pledge their support in the fight against ISIS, achieving a comprehensive strategy to tackle the issue both in Iraq and Syria becomes increasingly crucial."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: LSU still the best, despite BCS With the off-the-board exception of Kevin Federline's courthouse victory, nobody has been credited with a significant win in several weeks. This lack of impressive triumph is even more acute in college football, an entity that's having a trickier time choosing its top dog than the GOP's 2008 presidential-candidate auditions. The official approach to weeding out BCS contenders began Sunday, when Ohio State was saddled with the No. 1 ranking. In case you're a newcomer to this national grinding of teeth, please note that establishing the BCS hierarchy is a painstaking, three-pronged process. One prong is wielded by members of the Harris Poll, who are alleged to be dedicated football observers with a working knowledge of where to find the Versus network. Another prong is maintained by college coaches, many of whom freely admit to ignoring teams that aren't on their schedules. Based on certain game-planning glitches, we're not sure if these coaches are paying much attention to the teams they're actually going to play. The third prong is attached to computers, which sift through certain variables and spit out an objective rendering that typically initiates riots on sports-talk radio. For the record, a Netherlands-based genius who studies artificial intelligence recently predicted that humans and robots will become disturbingly intimate by 2050. If this genius had studied past BCS computer results, he'd probably conclude that this has been going on for years. Anyway, before examining the \\"We're No. 1!\\" cases of our first debate-worthy BCS top 10 of 2007, it should be pointed out that the prevailing dilemma could have been avoided if LSU and USC had behaved as anticipated. The Tigers, who'd seized top billing during the recent and astonishing stagger of USC, lost at Kentucky when coach Les Miles decided that traveling the treacherous Southeastern Conference road requires four consecutive running plays into the beating heart of a defense. USC, which began the season as our betting favorite, has been beset by an uncanny run of injury, unsatisfactory player development and, perhaps, failure to subscribe to the notion that standing strategically pat is no match for tactical progression. The Trojans, whose grotesque home loss to Stanford has been bracketed by an ugly performance at Washington and a survival home victory against Arizona, check in at No. 14. Beyond their unexpected failure to pass the eyeball test, the Trojans are hamstrung by the lousy efforts of their first six opponents. With Nebraska turning out to be far worse than anticipated, USC's foes have a combined record of 13-27, a number that generated a computer rank of 23 (they're ninth in both the Harris and coaches' poll). That schedule component  and USC's BCS standing  could change dramatically with victories at Oregon (10), Cal (12) and Arizona State (8), although recent play suggests quite an upgrade is needed to make that happen. But please note that the Trojans currently are working without (among others) All-America tackle Sam Baker, top running back Stafon Johnson, playmaking linebacker Brian Cushing, true freshman center Kristofer O'Dowd, veteran guard Chilo Rachal, athletic tackle Charles Brown and crazed middle linebacker Rey Maualuga. If USC has most of these guys back for the stretch run  combined with hinted maturity from freshmen Joe McKnight (RB), Ronald Johnson (WR) and Everson Griffen (DE)  the corresponding weaknesses of their highly ranked foes can be exploited. Or they can acquiesce to the prevailing, nationwide malaise and continue to fall apart. 1. Ohio State: The Buckeyes' non-conference gauntlet offered Youngstown State, Akron, 2-4 Washington and Kent State. Their Big Ten conquests are Minnesota, Northwestern and Purdue. So, how does Ohio State slip into No. 1? Zero losses and that name, baby. Their regular-season benediction features Penn State (road), Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan (road). The Buckeyes may be capable of losing one of these games, but there's not a convincing obstacle in that quartet. If the Buckeyes remain unconquered, we'll get to spend another five weeks wondering if they have the team speed to knock off their BCS title-game opponent. 2. South Florida: Yeah, this is not Bill Russell's USF. The Bulls, who have a blisteringly fast defense and a tough, versatile QB named Matt Grothe, are No. 1 with the computers. Despite playing Florida Atlantic and Central Florida, this microchip love was made possible by victories over Auburn (there) and West Virginia. To keep evolving, the Bulls must knock off Rutgers (road), Cincinnati, Louisville and Pittsburgh (road). 3. Boston College: The roll call of the vanquished features Notre Dame (1-6), Bowling Green, Division II UMass, N.C. State (1-5) and Army. The combined record of the Eagles' foes, however, is a relatively solid 21-24. Yeah, that's how bad things are around the country. A lot of doubt about this team that can be erased by winning at Virginia Tech and Clemson, in addition to knocking off Florida State and Miami at home. Then again, beating those teams wouldn't exactly prove that much. 4. LSU: The Tigers have had a couple of cream puffs on the schedule, but an impressive 29-18 mark from the opposition includes three ranked once-beatens (Virginia Tech, South Carolina and Kentucky) and twice-beaten Florida. LSU still deserves to be considered the best team, but stepping in ahead of a one-loss team that just knocked off the Tigers (Kentucky) defines the crazed nature of this BCS party. 5. Oklahoma: Right, losing to Colorado is nothing to brag about, but at least the Sooners have two legitimate wins (Texas and Missouri) and one that seemed decent (Miami) at the time. Let's see if they'll be man enough to take out Mike Gundy's Oklahoma State Cowboys. Remember, the Pokes have a QB \\"that does everything right,\\" and he's not even starting. In my opinion, they have the second-best, seven-week resume in the nation. 6. South Carolina: The Gamecocks' opponents have a fine combined record of 27-21. Coach Steve Spurrier's only loss was at LSU, while the victory list includes Georgia and Kentucky. I also believe his USC team could whup Stanford. 7. Kentucky: A signature win over LSU vaults the Wildcats into the top 10, although their 30-17 opponents' mark includes five wins from Division II Eastern Kentucky and four from defenseless Louisville. 8. Arizona State: Coach Dennis Erickson's first Sun Devils team has advanced by going unbeaten against teams that are 19-27. Don't worry, there will be plenty of ranked playmates to use as evidence of (Cal, Oregon and USC) greatness; just make sure the home games sell out more than a week before kick-off. 9. West Virginia: The loss at USF doesn't seem all that tragic now, but the Mountaineers may need a passing game to survive a three-game run against Rutgers (road), Louisville (well, maybe not) and Cincinnati (road). West Virginia still lacks a signature win, unless Mississippi State and Maryland can be considered above print level. 10. Oregon: The Ducks lost at home to Cal, but somehow managed to come in ranked ahead of the Bears. The unexpected stumbles from Cal and USC will challenge Oregon to perform its customary level of underachievement later than usual. With more rankings fires to acknowledge and extinguish before all of the smoke can even begin to clear, my 1 and 1A choices, respectively, are LSU and Oklahoma.

(AP) — Chris Hargis and Lori Doppelheuer both initially escaped a fire consuming their old row house, but neither one stayed outside for long: Each rushed back into the flames and smoke in a desperate bid to save their five children.      Firefighters work Tuesday, Oct. 20, 2015, in Marysville, Ky. Maysville Mayor David Cartmell says two adults and three children have been killed in a fire at a set of apartment buildings. Cartmell says... (Associated Press)      Hargis was able to rescue two daughters, ages 15 and 7.      But Doppelheuer never made it back out. She was found dead in the back of the house upstairs with the bodies of three other children: 10-year-old Christopher Kearney, 3-year-old Eagan Hargis and 20-month-old Kieran Hargis.      The fire gutted three brick buildings built in 1840. Two others were damaged. Investigators believe it started on the back porch of one of them. Also killed was a neighbor of Hargis and Doppelheuer, 68-year-old Larry R. Brickels.      Authorities have ruled out arson, but the exact cause of the fire is under investigation. The home where the children died did not have any working smoke detectors, Maysville Fire Chief Kevin Doyle said. The building where Brickels died did.      \\"The type of construction that these row houses are, are essentially a large pile of kindling,\\" Doyle said.      A neighbor who survived said she saw Doppelheuer, 35, rush back inside as flames shot out of the building.      \\"We were saying, 'God, no, God, no,' and I knew she wasn't coming back out,\\" Ruth Austen said, holding and comforting a crying cat she said belonged to the victims.      Hargis, also in his 30s, ran in and out of the burning building several times, Doyle said.      Hargis' mother, Beverly Hargis, said he was able to rescue the two girls.      \\"He threw a blanket over them, scooped them up and took them out,\\" she said.      Firefighters tried to get inside one of the burning buildings and go upstairs, but the stairwell was weakening, and intense fire forced the crew back outside, Doyle said.      He said another crew was sent up a ladder into a second-story window of the building where the family died, but the roof started collapsing.      \\"And we knew that there was no survivable space in the rear of that portion, which is where the victims ended up being,\\" Doyle said.      The chief said about 40 firefighters from several departments helped battle the blaze, which displaced about 30 people. No firefighters were injured.      Family members said Doppelheuer had served in the Marines for four or five years but did not have details about her military service.      Relatives of the victims hugged and consoled each other while standing vigil across the street. Some pulled out a few belongings salvaged from the charred house. ||||| An early morning fire that left a mother, her three children and a neighbor dead started on an enclosed back porch, officials said Tuesday.      Arson investigators with the Kentucky State Police were on the scene just hours after the fire broke out and make an preliminary determination of the starting point of the fire, Maysville Fire Chief Kevin Doyle said. How the fire started is yet to be determined, he said.      The bodies of the mother and children were found just before 9 a.m. and removed from the burned out home on West Second Street. The man was found earlier and transported to Meadowview Regional Medical Center where he was pronounced dead by Mason County Coroner David Lawrence, according to police.      The victims include Lori Doppelheuer, 36, and her children, Eagan Hargis, 3, Kieran Hargis, 20 months, and Christopher Kearney, 10; along with a neighbor, Larry R. Brickels, 68. Doppelheuer and her children were found in the back of their home at 219 West Second Street. Brickels was located in his home at 217, a two-apartment home where another couple escaped the flames.      The house at 217 had a working smoke detector. The other homes apparently did not.      \\"There was a smoke detector in the children's room (of 219),\\" Doyle said. \\"However, the battery had been taken out.\\"      When firefighters arrived on the scene at about 1 a.m., two homes in historic 1840s Armstrong Row row houses were engulfed in flames, according to Maysville Mayor David Cartmell. Firefighters continued fighting the blaze throughout the morning and into early afternoon, knocking down hot spots as they erupted.      Maysville Police Chief Ron Rice said when officers arrived on the scene after receiving the 911 call, they went door-to-door alerting residents of the danger.      Rice identified the two primary houses involved as 217 and 219. Another official said 221 also was involved but was unoccupied at the time of the fire.      Maysville Fire Chief Kevin Doyle said firefighters initially tried to enter the residence through the front door but were driven back by heavy smoke. They then attempted to enter through a rear entrance but were driven back by flames and a collapsing roof. It was obvious the area was \\"unsurvivable,\\" officials said.      During a press briefing Tuesday afternoon, a clearly emotional Doyle said the mother and three children were found together in the back part of the house on the upper floor.      \\"It was very evident that they had tried to escape,\\" Doyle said.      According to Doyle, the father and two older children managed to get out of the home. The father was instrumental is helping those children escape and may have reentered the home numerous times trying to rescue his family, Doyle said.      Rebecca Cartmell, community volunteer leader for the Bluegrass Chapter of the American Red Cross, said she was originally called to the scene to offer support for firefighters with coffee, water and snacks. She said the Lewisburg Volunteer Fire Department brought in their rehab unit to assist.      After the scale of the fire became apparent, Rebecca Cartmell said the Red Cross moved to additionally offer support to the residents displaced by the fire. She numbers those affected at about a dozen although that number could change, she said.      West Second Street remained closed in early afternoon and traffic was being detoured around the scene. Police said they did not know how long the closure would be effective.      The MFD was assisted at the scene by the Fernleaf Volunteer Fire Department, Washington VFD with Lewisburg VFD standing by, the Maysville Police Department, Kentucky State Police, KSP Arson investigator, Mason County Coroner, Red Cross and the Kentucky Fire Marshall.      Several gofundme pages have been established to benefit the fire victims.

It begins its journey at Praça da Figueira, a popular square situated in the center of Lisbon, known for its shops and cafes. The tram departs from this bustling hub and travels to Belém, a district in the western part of the city known for its numerous historical and cultural attractions. These include the Belém Tower, the Jerónimos Monastery, and the Cultural Center of Belém, among others. The second part of the sentence is: \\"The famous number 28 passes through the Bairro Alto and Alfama.\\" This portion of the text is referring to another famous tram route in Lisbon, the number 28. The 28 tram's route is notable for the areas it covers, passing through some of the city's most historic neighborhoods. It regularly travels through Bairro Alto and Alfama.  Bairro Alto is a central district in Lisbon that's famous for its vibrant nightlife, bohemian atmosphere, and numerous restaurants and Fado houses. It's known for its steep streets and tightly packed buildings—seeming to embody the charm of old Lisbon.  On the other hand, Alfama is Lisbon's oldest district. It's a maze of narrow streets and small squares situated on the hill between the São Jorge Castle and the Tejo River. Its name comes from the Arabic Al-hamma, meaning 'hot fountains' or 'baths'. The area contains numerous historical attractions, including the aforementioned castle and an ancient cathedral. It's also famous for its Fado Houses, where visitors can enjoy Portugal's traditional Fado music. In summary, the sentence provides a brief overview of the routes of two famed trams in Lisbon—each journey offering a unique insight into the character and history of the city."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Beccaria believed that the purpose of punishment was to deter potential criminals from committing crimes, and he argued against the use of torture and the death penalty. \\"Dei delitti e delle pene\\" had a profound influence on criminal law and justice reform both in Europe and in the United States, as it shaped the thinking of Enlightenment thinkers such as Voltaire, Montesquieu, and Thomas Jefferson."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Symbiosis (from Greek σύν \\"together\\" and βίωσις \\"living\\") is close and often long-term interaction between two different biological species. In 1877 Albert Bernhard Frank used the word symbiosis (which previously had been used to depict people living together in community) to describe the mutualistic relationship in lichens. In 1879, the German mycologist Heinrich Anton de Bary defined it as \\"the living together of unlike organisms.\\"  The definition of symbiosis has varied among scientists. Some believe symbiosis should only refer to persistent mutualisms, while others believe it should apply to any type of persistent biological interaction (in other words mutualistic, commensalistic, or parasitic). After 130 years of debate, current biology and ecology textbooks now use the latter \\"de Bary\\" definition or an even broader definition (where symbiosis means all species interactions), with the restrictive definition no longer used (in other words, symbiosis means mutualism).  Some symbiotic relationships are obligate, meaning that both symbionts entirely depend on each other for survival. For example, many lichens consist of fungal and photosynthetic symbionts that cannot live on their own.

BookWars is a creative documentary which is told in an unconventional, narrative style. The film opens with the narrator (who is also the film's director) driving out West along a desert highway, relating to the audience his previous experiences as a streetside bookseller in New York City. The entire documentary – including the central events involving his experiences among the street booksellers in New York – is thus \\"told\\" as a long conversation. The narrator describes his post-graduation years in New York, and how he ended up at one point virtually penniless. Driven by a desperate need to pay the rent, he resorts to wheeling his own books out to the street to try to sell them. He reveals that he was not only successful in making a significant amount of cash on that first day, but he has also met a variety of interesting and strange characters of the streets of New York – including other street booksellers. A motley assortment of street booksellers on West 4th street, in Greenwich Village, New York City, are first introduced. Among them: \\"Slick\\" Rick Sherman, a semi-professional magician; Al Mappo, so named because he only sells maps and atlases; Emil, who says only he \\"escaped\\", though we do not know from where; and Pete Whitney: King of the booksellers, toad collector, and collage artist. BookWars next introduces another group of street booksellers who hawk their trade on nearby 6th Avenue. Mainly black and minority individuals, they ply books and magazines in parallel fashion to the nearby West 4th street booksellers, who are primarily white. The booksellers on 6th Avenue suffer greater exposure to the law, with many claiming this to be due to racial profiling.

Researchers divide 20 high-risk diabetic patients into two groups.Both groups were given standard diabetes medicine.Group L viewed 30 minutes of humor of their choice, while Group C, the control group, did not.This went on for a year of treatments. By two months into the study, the patients in the laughter group had lower level of the hormones epinephrine  , considered to cause stress, which is known to be deadly.After the 12 months, _ rises 26 percent in Group L but only 3 percent in Group C.In another measure, C-reactive proteins, a maker of heart disease, drop 66 percent in the laughter group but only 26 percent in the control group. \\"The best doctors believe that there is a physical good brought about by the positive emotion, happy laughter,\\" said study leader Lee Berk of Loma Linda University.And other research has found that humor makes us more hopeful.Still, more study is needed, Berk said.The research by Berk found that humor can bring about similar changes in body chemistry, which was proved in the new study.The research result will be presented this month at the meeting in the US.Research at the University of Maryland School of Medicine shows that laughter causes the inner lining of blood vessels to expand, increasing blood flow in a way thought to be healthy. \\"Lifestyle choices have an important effect on health and these are choices which we and patients should pay attention to, rather than prevention and treatment,\\" Berk said in a statement this week.

Article: Once you have quickly assessed the situation and checked the consciousness and circulation of the victim you need to act very quickly. If there is no pulse you must begin CPR immediately, and continue it for two minutes (which is about five cycles of CPR) and then call for Emergency Medical Services. If you are alone it is important to start CPR before calling for help.  If someone else is there send them for help. If you are alone, do not call until you have completed two minutes of CPR.   Dial your local emergency number. Call 911 in North America, 000 in Australia, 111 in New Zealand, 112 by cell phone in the EU (including the UK) and 999 in the UK. If possible, send someone else to get an AED (Automatic External Defibrillator) if there is one in the building or nearby. CAB is the basic process of CPR. It stands for Chest Compressions, Airway, Breathing. In 2010, the recommended sequence changed with chest compressions placed before airway opening and rescue breathing. Chest compressions are more critical for correcting abnormal heart rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia), and because one cycle of 30 chest compressions only requires 18 seconds, airway opening and rescue breathing are not significantly delayed. Chest compressions, or hands-only CPR is recommended if you have not been properly trained or are worried about performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a stranger. When performing CPR on a child the positioning of your hands is especially important, given that a child will be more fragile than an adult. Locate the child's sternum by moving two fingers to the bottom of the rib cage. Identify where the lower the ribs meet in the middle and then place the heel of your other hand on top of your fingers. Just use the heel of this hand to do the compressions. Compress the chest, with elbows locked, by pushing straight down about 2 inches (5.1 cm) deep. The smaller body of a child needs less pressure than an adult would. If you begin to hear or feel a cracking sound, that may indicate that you are pushing too hard. Continue, but apply less pressure with the compressions. Do 30 of these compressions, and do them at a rate of at least 100 compressions per minute if you are the only rescuer.  Allow complete chest recoil after each compression.  Minimize pauses in chest compression that occur when changing providers or preparing for a shock. Attempt to limit interruptions to less than 10 seconds. If there are two rescuers, each should complete a round of 15 compressions. Place your hand on the victim's forehead and two fingers on his chin. Lift the chin gently with the two fingers while carefully pushing down on the forehead with your other hand. If you suspect a neck injury, gently pull the jaw upward rather than lifting the chin. Once you have done this you should look, listen and feel for breathing.  Put your ear close to the victim's mouth and nose and listen carefully for any signs of life. Watch for chest movement and feel for any breath on your cheek.  If there are no signs of life, place a breathing barrier (if available) over the victim's mouth. Keeping the airway open, take the fingers that were on the forehead and pinch the victim's nose closed. Make a seal with your mouth over the victim's mouth and breathe out for about one second.  Make sure you breathe slowly, as this will make sure the air goes in the lungs not the stomach. Make sure you keep your eye on the victim's chest.  If the breath goes in, you should see the chest slightly rise and also feel it go in. If the breath goes in, give a second rescue breath.  If the breath does not go in, reposition the head and try again. If it does not go in again, the victim may be choking. You'll need to do more chest compressions in this case. Keep in mind abdominal thrusts (the Heimlich maneuver) should only be performed on someone who is conscious. You should do CPR for two minutes (five cycles of compressions to breaths) before checking for signs of life, a pulse or breathing. Continue CPR until someone takes over for you; emergency personnel arrive; you are too exhausted to continue; an AED is attached, charged, and the person running it asks you to clear the body; or pulse and breathing return.  Don't forget to call the emergency services after the first two minutes of CPR. After you call them, continue to administer CPR until they arrive. If an AED becomes available, turn on the AED, place the pads as instructed (one over the right chest and another over the left side). Allow the AED to analyse the rhythm, and give one shock if indicated, after clearing everyone from the patient (yell \\"CLEAR!\\" first). Resume chest compressions immediately after each shock for another 5 cycles before reassessing. If the victim begins breathing, gently manoeuvre them into the recovery position. What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a shorter version of something, like a story or an article, that tells the main points or important parts. So, if that article was about how to do CPR, a summary might be: \\"CPR is a way to help someone who is not breathing. You need to do chest compressions and give breaths to help them.

Sentence 4: When they all arrived and were about to start the police showed up. Now, consider the two choices for the fifth sentence: a. Within a week the dog was back to normal. b. They arrest the cool kids and instead of popularity she became hated. Compare the options based on their relevance and connection to the rest of the story. Option 'a' talks about a dog, which is not mentioned anywhere in the preceding story. Option 'b' is directly related to the party and the consequences of the police showing up, so it makes more sense. Therefore, the best choice for the fifth sentence is option 'b': They arrest the cool kids and instead of popularity she became hated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Portugal After years of high increase, the unemployment in Portugal has been in a continuous falling trend since the third quarter of 2014, decreasing from a peak of 17.7% achieved in the early 2013 to a rate of 11.9% in the second quarter of 2015. However, it is high still high compared with what was the normal average Portuguese unemployment rate in the past. In the second quarter of 2008 the unemployment rate was 7.3%, but the rate immediately rose the following period. By December 2009, unemployment had surpassed the 10% mark nationwide in the wake of worldwide events, by 2010, the rate was around 11% and in 2011 it was above 12%.[citation needed] The first quarter of 2013 signified a new unemployment rate record for Portugal, as it reached 17.7%— up from 17% in the previous quarter — and the Government has predicted an 18.5% unemployment rate in 2014.

If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\".  Question: Why did Bill Yoast stays on as Boone's assistant? Movie title: Remember the Titans Movie plot: In 1971, at the desegregated T. C. Williams High School, a black head coach Herman Boone (Washington) is hired to lead the school's football team. Boone is assigned to the coaching team under current coach Bill Yoast (Patton), nominated for the Virginia High School Hall of Fame. But in an attempt to placate rising racial tensions and the fact that all other high schools are \\"white\\" only, Boone is assigned the head coach job. At first he refuses as he thinks it is extremely unfair to Yoast, but accepts when he sees what it means to the black community. Yoast is then offered an assistant coach's job by the school board and initially refuses, but reconsiders after the white players pledge to boycott the team if he does not participate. Dismayed at the prospect of the students losing their chances at scholarships, Yoast changes his mind and takes up the position of defensive coordinator under Boone. Black and white football team members frequently clash in racially motivated conflicts at their football camp, including some between captain Gerry Bertier (Hurst), and Julius Campbell (Harris). But after forceful coaching and rigorous athletic training by Boone, which includes an early morning run to Gettysburg, and a motivational speech, the team achieves racial harmony and success. After returning from football camp, Boone is told by a member of the school board that if he loses even a single game, he will be fired. Subsequently, the Titans go through the season undefeated while battling racial prejudice, before slowly gaining support from the community. Just before the state semi-finals, Yoast is told by the chairman of the school board that he will be inducted into the Hall of Fame after the Titans lose one game, implying he wants Boone to be fired over his race. During the game, it becomes apparent that the referees are biased against the Titans. Upon seeing the chairman and other board members in the audience looking on with satisfaction, Yoast realizes they've rigged the game and warns the head official that... Answer:","output":"Bill Yoast decides to stay on as Boone's assistant for various reasons. Initially, Yoast is unhappy with the school board's decision to replace him with Herman Boone as the head coach. Nonetheless, he reconsiders accepting the offer as an assistant coach for a couple of significant reasons. 1. Player Boycott: When the white players on the team pledge to boycott if Yoast does not participate, he sees the potential negative implications for the players. If the players boycott the team, it could affect their chances of getting college scholarships. Yoast puts the interests of the young athletes before his own, making it crucial for him to take up the assistant coach position. 2. Racial Tensions and Unity: Yoast understands the importance of bridging the racial divide among the team members, the community, and the school. By working as an assistant coach, he hopes to help create an environment where the players can work together and overcome their prejudices. The collaboration between him and Boone becomes an essential symbol of unity for everyone involved. The players learn to respect one another through their shared passion for football and their dedication to the team's success. 3. Personal Integrity and Commitment: Yoast's decision also revolves around his personal values and commitment to the football team. Despite being unhappy about the coaching changes, his long-standing dedication to the team and his coaching career compels him to take on the assistant's role. He believes he can continue making a meaningful contribution to the sport he loves by working under Boone. 4. Moral Stand against Discrimination: The decision to stay on as an assistant also highlights Yoast's moral stand against discrimination. He is disturbed when he realizes that the school board chairman wants to induct him into the Hall of Fame after ensuring that Boone, as a black coach, loses a game. He refuses to be part of such a racially-prejudiced plan, does not seek personal gains, and remains focused on the team's welfare. In summary, Bill Yoast stays on as Boone's assistant because he believes in the potential of their combined efforts to rebuild the racially-divided team and community. He selflessly puts the interests of the football team members first, ensuring they have a fair chance at earning college scholarships. Yoast's commitment to personal integrity and taking a stand against racial discrimination also play significant roles in shaping his decision to work alongside Boone as an assistant coach. His decision ultimately contributes to the team's success, both on and off the field, helping the Titans become an inspiring beacon of unity and triumph in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The hypothesis states that they made some very good picks – which relates to the actual result of the draft, rather than the opportunity the team had in making these picks due to their poor record. While it is possible to infer that having more and better choices could potentially lead to making some very good picks, the premise does not guarantee this outcome. The team's ability to evaluate talent, weigh their options, and make strategic decisions would ultimately determine if the hypothesis is true. So, from the given options, it would be correct to choose option 2: \\"it is not possible to tell.\\" This is because there isn't sufficient information in the premise to confidently conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true.

Would the answer to this question be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value?","output":"The answer to this question would be a location. General Douglas MacArthur was in South Korea when he was recalled by President Harry S. Truman. This event took place during the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953. General MacArthur played a significant role in the war as the commander of the United Nations Command (UNC) forces. He was responsible for leading the coalition of countries, including the United States, in their efforts to push back against the invasion of South Korea by North Korea. MacArthur was a controversial figure during the war due to his aggressive tactics and desire to expand the conflict by invading China, which had entered the war in support of North Korea. This stance put him at odds with President Truman, who favored a more restrained approach to the conflict in order to prevent an escalation of the war and potentially draw in the Soviet Union, which was allied to China and North Korea. One of the key moments that led to MacArthur's recall was a letter he sent to Republican House Minority Leader Joseph W. Martin in April 1951, where he criticized Truman's policy of limited-war and argued for an expansion of the conflict. This letter became public, and it greatly embarrassed the president as it was seen as insubordination. The tension between MacArthur and Truman eventually led the president to make the decision to recall the general from his command in Korea on April 11, 1951. Ultimately, General Douglas MacArthur's recall marked a significant moment in the history of the Korean War. The decision to remove the general from his position was controversial at the time, and it remains a subject of debate among historians. However, it is clear that MacArthur was in South Korea, leading the United Nations Command forces, when he was ultimately recalled by President Truman."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: A Canterbury Tale Movie plot: St George's Church tower, seen in the film after being gutted in the Baedeker raids (modern photograph) The story concerns three young people: British Army Sergeant Peter Gibbs (Dennis Price), U.S. Army Sergeant Bob Johnson (played by real-life Sergeant John Sweet), and a \\"Land Girl\\", Miss Alison Smith (Sheila Sim). The group arrive at the railway station in the fictitious small Kent town of Chillingbourne (filmed in Chilham, Fordwich, Wickhambreaux and other villages in the area), near Canterbury, late on Friday night, 27 August 1943. Peter has been stationed at a nearby Army camp, Alison is due to start working on a farm in the area, and Bob left the train by mistake, hearing the announcement \\"next stop Canterbury\\" and thinking he was in Canterbury. As they leave the station together Alison is attacked by an assailant in uniform who pours glue on her hair, before escaping. It transpires that this has happened quite a few times before, to other women. Alison asks Bob if he could spend the weekend in Chillingbourne to help her solve the mystery. The next day, while riding a farm cart in the countryside, Alison meets Peter, who surrounds her cart with his platoon of three Bren Gun Carriers. Alison agrees to meet Peter again. The three decide to investigate the attack, enlisting the help of the locals, including several young boys who play large-scale war games. The three use their detective skills to identify the culprit as a local magistrate, Thomas Colpeper (Eric Portman), a gentleman farmer and pillar of the community, who also gives local history lectures to soldiers stationed in the district. Alison interviews all the glue man's victims to identify the dates and times of their attacks. Gibbs visits Colpeper at his home and borrows the fire watch roster listing the nights Colpeper was on duty in the town hall, whilst a paper drive for salvage by Johnson's boy commandos lets Johnson discover receipts for gum used to make glue sold to Colpeper. The dates of the attacks correspond with Colpeper's night...

What is the best way to: To marinate meat.","output":"The best way to marinate meat involves selecting the right ingredients for the marinade, preparing the meat, and giving it enough time to absorb the flavors. Here is a step-by-step guide to effectively marinate meat: 1. Choose the type of meat: Different meats have varying flavors, textures, and absorption rates, which means the choice of meat and cut is important. Select a cut containing some fat since fat adds flavor and helps make the meat tender and juicy. 2. Prepare the meat: Wash the meat thoroughly and pat it dry with paper towels. Trim off any excess fat or silverskin, and cut the meat into the desired size and shape (steaks, cubes, or strips). 3. Create a marinade: A good marinade usually consists of an acidic component (e.g., vinegar, lemon juice, or yogurt), oil, and flavoring agents (herbs, spices, and other seasonings). Acid helps break down the proteins, tenderizing the meat, while oil helps transfer flavorings to the meat surface. Combine your chosen ingredients in a bowl and mix well to create a flavorful marinade. 4. Coat the meat: Place the prepared meat in a shallow dish, resealable plastic bag, or vacuum-sealing bag. Pour the marinade over the meat, ensuring that all pieces are evenly coated. If using a plastic bag, gently press out any excess air and seal the bag securely. 5. Refrigerate the meat: Marinating at room temperature can lead to bacterial growth, so always marinate in the refrigerator. The appropriate marination time depends on the type and size of the meat:    - For thin cuts like steaks and chops, 2-4 hours is typically sufficient.    - For thicker cuts and larger portions, 4-12 hours or overnight is preferable.    - For very dense or tough cuts, such as beef short ribs, 24 hours or more may be needed. 6. Turn or agitate the meat occasionally: To ensure even marination, periodically turn the meat in the dish or shake the sealed bag throughout the marination process. 7. Remove and discard the marinade: Once the recommended marinating time has passed, take the meat out of the marinade and discard the marinade. It is crucial not to reuse the marinade, as it can contaminate other foods. 8. Dry the meat: Use paper towels to gently pat the meat dry before cooking. This step helps create a better crust or sear on the surface and prevents flare-ups when grilling. 9. Cook the meat: Depending on your preference and the type of meat, you can now cook it using your preferred method, such as grilling, pan-frying, roasting, or baking. By following these steps, you'll properly marinate your meat and enhance its flavor and texture, giving you a delicious, tender final product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context:  Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 8 was his final major compositional project, occupying him intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938, though he never published it. During this time Sibelius was at the peak of his fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of at least the first movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945. Much of Sibelius's reputation, during his lifetime and subsequently, derived from his work as a symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time there was no reason to suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh. After Sibelius's death in 1957, news of the Eighth Symphony's destruction was made public, and it was assumed that the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived. Since...  Guess a valid title for it!

A series of murders of rich young women throughout the area of Globe, Arizona bear the distinctive signature of a serial killer. Clues lead Detective Charles Mendoza to visit Paul White, a sound expert installing hi-fi systems in wealthy people's homes. His special talent is to make a noise which echoes through the air cavities in his head and shows him where the sound of the speakers should come from and echo in the room. He is married to Joan, whom, ten years earlier, he had seduced away from Mike DeSantos, who was her then boyfriend. Joan and Paul have a daughter, Danielle, together. Paul, installing equipment at Dr. Sutter's home, proximal to the most-recent murder, is approached by Detective Mendoza-- they have a cordial conversation about sound equipment, but it turns abruptly, when Mendoza asks Paul if he still hunts. Mendoza questions Paul about whether he knew the victim, and then asks him about the tires on his van-- a tread pattern that has been located at the scene of the murder. Mendoza meets with his partner Phil at the police station, where Phil has gathered criminal record information on Paul-- they speculate on what kind of person he might be based on that information. Mendoza, working from photos of the crime scene, begins to identify some aspects of the killer's M/O. Paul visits Fred, proprietor of the local diner-- Fred mentions that Ann Mason has been asking after Paul, ostensibly to work on her satellite system.

And if you are experiencing that right now, I’m so sorry for you, but it gets better. Hear me out. I was once dating this girl from college who showed genuine interest in me and for that and many other reasons, I really liked her. Well, you could say I loved her. We had been together for a week. One day, we went on a trip. It was all fun and games and laughing. I had the best time of my life. We were walking on the beach of a lake during sunset. We were talking and suddenly, I felt her tone getting more and more depressed. At some point, she concluded that “we need to take a break.” Trying to understand her arguments for that, the break turned into a breakup. Now, one-week-into-a-relationship-with-awesome-girl me couldn’t handle this sudden change of affairs. I spent weeks reliving this day, especially the conversation on the beach, and trying to figure out where it went wrong. I even got into an episode of mania. Having to see her every day in college was torture. It was probably the worst breakup in my life. I seriously considered transferring to another university. Several weeks into the breakup, I decided, with the aid of my friends, that I have to move on. To be honest, I relapsed a lot. One time, I actually sat down with her and said I still have feelings for her. What really helped me to get out of this was the thing I hated the most at that time: taking a break. I avoided her, in real life and on social media, and eventually, I forgot that she even existed. I developed new hobbies and made new friends. Now, I healed properly and we’re back to being friends (Yes, it’s possible to stay friends with your ex). It was a bad experience to live through indeed, but it really changed me into a more stable, more productive person. In a way, I’m thankful to this girl for who I am today. Stay strong!

Li Yuan rose in rebellion in 617, along with his son and his equally militant daughter Princess Pingyang (d. 623), who raised and commanded her own troops.

The number of ‘morning-after’ motorists caught over the drink-drive limit the day after a night out on the tiles  is increasing. Arrests between 6am and 8am for drink-driving following a  heavy night rose by nearly 4  per cent last year, according to police figures. Many motorists do not realise they are still at risk of being over the limit even after hours of sleeping it off. A police breathalyser: Many people do not realise that they could still be over the legal drink driving limit the morning after a night out. And with Christmas and New Year looming – the peak time for morning-after offences, accounting for 10 per cent of the annual total – arrests are likely to soar further. A separate survey of 1,688 drivers by insurers LV showed that 3 per cent – or 1.2million – admitted driving while over the legal limit the morning after a drinking session in the past two years. Some 37 per cent insisted that driving was unavoidable, 26 per cent said they were only going a short distance and 19 per cent thought they were all right to take to the road. Seven per cent even thought it was acceptable to drive because they were not on a motorway, and 13 per cent believed they were only a little over the limit so it did not matter. The report noted that most morning-after drink-drivers still have around five hours to go before they become sober enough to drive. Arrests between 6am and 8am for drink driving following a heavy night rose by nearly four per cent last year. The arrest figures were obtained by LV under a Freedom of Information Act request and were based on replies from 22 police forces. They show that 350 drivers were arrested for drink-driving between 6am and 8am in 2011, rising to 363 in 2012 – an increase of 3.7 per cent. The LV survey showed that 46 per cent of drivers underestimated how long it took for alcohol to leave the body – or did not know, while 30 per cent of men and 19 per cent of women admitted to having driven at least once after a heavy drinking session the night before. The LV report says: ‘Morning-after drink-driving is on the increase, with more motorists putting themselves and other road users at risk. 'This upward trend is being exacerbated by a lack of awareness among drivers about how long it takes alcohol to leave their system.’ The current drink-drive limit is 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood, 35mg per 100ml of breath or 107mg per 100ml of urine. This equates to approximately four units for an average man and two to three units for an average woman. Official guidelines say it takes an hour for the body to break down one unit. But experts say that this is not a reliable measure because it will vary depending on the person’s age, weight, gender and metabolic rate. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"This article says that more people are getting caught driving when they still have alcohol in their system the morning after drinking. This is a problem because it can be dangerous to drive if you've had too much to drink. Some people don't realize that they might still be over the legal limit even after sleeping for a few hours. The number of people caught doing this has gone up by almost 4% in one year. As Christmas and New Year's celebrations are coming up, this problem might get worse. Many people don't know how long it takes for alcohol to leave their body, and so they might drive when they shouldn't."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The media is ruining science A year ago last week, researchers from Drexel University released a study about the benefits of “sexting” in relationships, which included a figure that suggested that the vast majority of adults — around 82 percent — had sexted at some point in the past year. As expected, the surprising statistic was widely covered online, including by CNN, the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune, Slate, the Huffington Post and here at The Post. What was rarely mentioned in these media articles, though, was that the research had not been published in any academic journal. Instead, the data was compiled through an Internet survey as part of a presentation to the American Psychological Association’s annual convention. Sure, the results were interesting, but the research is simply not generalizable to the entire public. Unfortunately, examples like this are legion in the world of science journalism. As a result, the scientific community has lately been making an effort try to end the stream of misleading articles — going so far as to redesign the way academic journals review and publish studies. [Are scientists blocking their own progress?] Part of the problem is that there’s a lot of adverse incentive for people to distort scientific studies. Science and health media writers are constantly in need of new, sexy studies (preferably ones that somehow mention “sex” in the headline). Meanwhile, scholars and academic journals face pressure to produce work that gets attention from media outlets — doing so can elevate the stature of their research, which in turn promotes their funding. At the same time, researchers have become very good at playing with data — such as shifting the length of their experiments or picking and choosing which variables to control for — in order to come out with the results they want. (FiveThirtyEight has a great tool that allows you to play with different economic variables to show that the economy had statistically done better under both Republicans and Democrats.) In between, media agents for research institutions have become adept at turning complicated scientific jargon into compelling press releases — usually at the expense of accuracy. Reporters crop down those releases even further, stretching, exaggerating and torturing academic papers until their original meaning of the study has been completely lost. Without a doubt, the rising demand for more studies has taken a toll on science’s credibility. In the past decade, researchers have been debating ways to free their work of so-called “publication bias,” including “preregistration” or “results-free” peer review. In this concept, scientists submit their work to academic journals and peer reviewers without the results included. That way, academics would only be allowed to review the methodology and the questions posed at the onset of each study. Theoretically, journals would free themselves of the tendency to only publish papers with exciting findings. Problem solved, right? Well, it’s a good idea, but it’s not perfect. The academic journal Comparative Political Studies recently pulled together a special issue made up entirely of these “results-free” submissions. In an essay reviewing the resulting papers, CPS editors highlighted some major pitfalls: First of all, studies don’t always go as planned. In peer reviewing methodology first, scientists risk becoming too rigid in their experimental design, making it difficult to carry out their study as promised if they have to adapt to unexpected variables. Secondly, the results-free model seems to favor some study designs over others — such as quantitative over qualitative designs. There’s also the legitimate concern about what happens if methodologies come out with null results — that is, if the only result a study can produce is to prove the hypothesis incorrect. Such a paper could end up being extraordinarily boring or not answering the essential question at issue. Imagine a headline like: “We don’t know which gene puts you at a greater risk of depression, but we’re pretty sure it’s not the gene we thought it was.” [Why are we telling scientists to destroy human life?] That’s not to say the “results-free” model is worthless — it does have potential. In fact, the editors lauded the model for incentivizing researchers to focus on theory and research design. The problem is that it simply doesn’t solve all the problems facing scientific publication. What’s more, it shouldn’t be up to scientists to fix them. As the CPS essay shows, scientists can only reform themselves so far; a lot of the blame must be put on reporters and the general public. The main problem with scientific studies is not how they are conducted; it’s how they’re consumed. Both the general public and members of the media alike tend to treat studies as if they’re infallible. If a newspaper or a politician cites a newly published scholarly work, rarely do we ever hear someone challenge it. In all honesty, the best way to challenge scientific findings is simply to find the time and read the original study. Evaluate the methodology for yourself. Are there legitimate limitations to the research? Does the sample size seem large enough? If at any point the answers to these questions seem way over your head and the long gobbledygook of equations looks like another language, try Googling it. Check out other articles on the topic, or simply start with the basics. The unfortunate reality is that some scholarly research cannot be simplified without giving up essential nuance. The general public can’t blame science for being too hard — it can only blame reporters for not having the intellectual rigor or, more likely, the time to work through the difficult questions. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The media is contributing to the distortion and simplification of scientific studies, which is harming science's credibility. The public and journalists must take responsibility for understanding and evaluating study methodologies, rather than expecting scientific findings to be infallible and quick to grasp."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Each radioactive isotope has a characteristic decay time period—the half-life—that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an exponential decay process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life. Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth.  I am facing a new situation today: David was working in his chemistry lab. He selected two isotopes, sample A and sample B. Sample A had longer half-life, but sample B had shorter half-life. After some time he checked sample A when its one half-life had passed. He noted it as sample A1. Then he came back to see it again when two half-lives had passed. He noted it as sample A2.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which sample would have more isotopes, sample A or sample A1? A:","output":"Sample A would have more isotopes than sample A1. This is because when one half-life has passed, only 50% of the isotopes in sample A would remain, and this is what we call sample A1.

Given the following context:  The movie opens with shots from the Spanish Civil War, and a line of Spanish refugees crossing the border into France after defeat by the Francoists. Republican guerrilla fighter Manuel Artiguez turns away from the border and back towards Spain. His friends stop him, saying \\"Manuel, the war is over!\\". The story returns twenty years later, to a young boy named Paco, who asks a man named Pedro why Artiguez, who is legendary for his fierce resistance to Franco even after the defeat of the Republicans, has stopped his guerrilla raids against the Francoists in Spain. Pedro sends Paco into France to find his uncle and Artiguez. Paco tells Artiguez that he wants him to kill Viñolas, a Guardia Civil officer, for killing his father. Paco lets Artiguez know that his father was killed because he wouldn't tell the police where to find Artiguez, whom Viñolas must capture if he is to retain his rank in the Guard.  Meanwhile, Viñolas has learned that Artiguez's mother is dying, and sets a trap at the hospital in San Martín to capture Artiguez, presuming that he will come to see his mother. Like all Republican sympathizers, she is contemptuous and deeply suspicious of all Catholic clergy, who collaborated with the fascist Franco regime, both during and after the war.

Q:Following up from my recent blog post explaining why dietary supplements offer few benefits for most people, new research has found that people who take a mineral supplement actually consume more minerals from their normal diet than non-supplement users. The notion of the ‘worried well’ is certainly alive and kicking. Vitamin and mineral supplements are big business. Reported figures in Australia suggest that 27% of women and 15% of men take some form of supplement with vitamin C, B complex, multivitamins, vitamin E and calcium all being popular choices. Contrary to the rationale for needing supplements in the first place, people who take supplements are more likely to be healthier than people who don’t take supplements. Supplement users also tend to be leaner, smoke less, exercise more, and eat more fruit and vegetables. While it may seem obvious that people who take supplements likely consume more nutrients from their regular diet to start with, this hasn’t been well studied in large population groups. Using data from a nationally representative government health survey, researchers from the United States looked at the mineral intake from food and supplements of over 8000 men and women between 2003 and 2006. The results were clear cut: people taking mineral supplements were consuming more minerals from their normal diet than those who didn’t take supplements. The observation was even stronger in women than in men. The eight most popular mineral supplements taken were calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, copper, potassium and selenium. Proving that it is possible to have too much of a good thing, supplement users were more likely to be exceeding the recommended upper level of intake for magnesium, zinc, iron and calcium. For someone who believes that they are reasonably healthy and are conscious of what they eat most of the time, taking a mineral supplement ‘just in case’ offers little to no benefit.

Context: SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

Bio: emmanuel \`\` manu '' pluton is a french former competitive bodybuilder , film actor , and pornographic actor . A:","output":"From the provided biographical snippet, several key details about Emmanuel \\"Manu\\" Pluton can be identified: 1. Nationality and Birth Place: Emmanuel \\"Manu\\" Pluton is French, which implies he was either born in France or holds French citizenship. 2. Profession(s): He has held multiple roles during different phases of his career, namely:        a. Competitive Bodybuilder: Early in his career, Manu Pluton chose to focus on sports, specializing in bodybuilding. Given that he was a competitive bodybuilder, it can be inferred that his physique and strength met exceptionally high standards and that he may have participated in numerous competitions, possibly even earning accolades and titles.    b. Film Actor: Pluton later transitioned to acting in films. While the bio does not provide a detailed breakdown of his filmography or which genres he primarily worked in, the fact that he is recognized as a film actor implies that he has worked in mainstream cinema.    c. Pornographic Actor: Pluton is also recognized as a pornographic actor. This indicates a significant shift in his career, as the responsibilities, skills required, and industry norms for pornographic films differ drastically from mainstream cinema. It's uncertain from this short bio whether his time as a pornographic actor overlapped with his mainstream acting career or whether one followed the other.     3. Nickname: The name \\"Manu\\" is used as a more informal, likely more familiar, form of his full name, Emmanuel. This could suggest that he may be known by this name within the industries he worked in, among his fans, or in his personal relationships. 4. Status: The term \\"former\\" is used to describe his bodybuilding profession, suggesting he no longer competes professionally in this field. The bio does not clarify whether he is still active in the film industry or as a pornographic actor, so without further information, his current profession remains unclear. These are the primary points that can be derived about Manu Pluton from the provided bio. Incidentally, it leaves out details pertaining to his family background, education level, the timeline of his career changes or details about his bodybuilding and acting accomplishments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While both The Vampire Diaries and Twilight revolve around supernatural themes and romantic relationships involving vampires, they are separate entities with distinct stories and characters. The Vampire Diaries is a television series based on the book series of the same name written by L.J. Smith, while Twilight is a series of novels written by Stephenie Meyer, which were later adapted into a successful film franchise starring Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. The Vampire Diaries and Twilight share similar themes and gained popularity around the same time; however, they remain independent stories with no direct connection to one another. The Vampire Diaries television series was developed by Kevin Williamson and Julie Plec and aired on The CW network for eight seasons from 2009 to 2017. The story centers around the lives of two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon Salvatore, who become entangled in a complex love triangle with a human girl named Elena Gilbert. The plot involves various supernatural elements, including vampires, werewolves, witches, and hybrids, creating a rich and intriguing world for the characters to inhabit. On the other hand, the Twilight series focuses on a teenage girl named Bella Swan, who moves to Forks, Washington, and falls in love with Edward Cullen, a vampire. The Twilight saga explores the challenges and dangers involved in their unique relationship, as well as their encounters with other vampires and supernatural creatures. The Twilight film series consists of five movies released from 2008 to 2012.

It was a meticulously planned operation, and the group of thieves, led by Tony \\"The Actor\\" Pino, spent months studying the layout of the depot and perfecting their strategy. They made duplicates of the keys and practiced eliminating any evidence that could be traced back to them. On the day of the heist, the thieves entered the Brink's depot with ease, thanks to their duplicated keys. They managed to disarm the five employees present at the time, tying them up and gagging them. Then, wearing gloves and masks to avoid leaving any traces, they went about emptying the cash, checks, money orders, and additional valuables from the vault. The entire operation took just over 30 minutes, and the thieves escaped without being detected. The crime instantly became one of the most notorious heists in American history. The total value of the stolen items was around 2.7 million, which is equivalent to over 29 million in today's money. The audacity and scale of the robbery prompted a massive manhunt by local and federal law enforcement agencies, but it proved difficult to locate the culprits. The thieves had done a remarkable job of covering their tracks, such as by painting their getaway vehicle to change its appearance. Ultimately, most members of the gang were apprehended due to one of the gang members, Joseph \\"Specs\\" O'Keefe, who had become disgruntled over his share of the stolen money and turned informant after being arrested on an unrelated crime. O'Keefe provided details about the heist and the members involved, leading to the arrest of the remaining gang members in 1956. The Great Brink's Robbery remains a prime example of a well-planned and executed heist, capturing the imagination of the public for decades.

Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers \\"diminishing returns\\" as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event.

Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 video game review Formats: Xbox 360 (tested), PS3, PC Developer: Infinity Ward Publisher: Activision Released: 11 November 2009 Score: 10/10 So here it is at last; the biggest game of 2009. The sequel to one of the most successful first person shooter (FPS) titles of all time. The most anticipated video game release of the year. The title which looks set to break international sales records in spite of the fact that its publisher has decided to charge £10 more than the standard price for a new release. The game that may yet reanimate the recently (and hopefully still) laid-to-rest debate on video game violence. The first video game of this year to receive its own premiere in Leicester Square. While it arrives creaking under the weight of its own hype, the press accolades and advertising campaign that herald its arrival make Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 sound like the entertainment revelation the whole world has been waiting for; it swaggers into retail outlets with all the confidence of a rock star taking the stage in front of its most committed fans. But can it possibly hope to live up to the ludicrous expectations heaped upon it? In a word, yes, and however irksome the submit-or-die nature of the publicity swirling around its release may be, Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 really is one of the best video games released all year. Naysayers may point out at this stage that 2009 hasn't exactly been a banner year for the gaming industry. But consider the obstacles Modern Warfare 2 has to conquer; not only does it have to satisfy the demands of one of largest and the most fanatical fan bases in gaming, it has to go one better than Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, a game that is still selling very respectably a year and a half on from its release (largely thanks to its incredible multiplayer mode). It's a testament to abilities of Infinity Ward's talented pool of developers that Modern Warfare 2 doesn't just surpass the quality of its predecessor, it flies past it like a ski-jumper. This is largely due to the fact that Infinity Ward has managed to craft a game which perfectly balances the inclusion of some fantastic new features with the maintenance of everything that worked in the first Modern Warfare instalment (COD4) in terms of its core gameplay experience. The control system is smooth and intuitively mapped to the controllers. The visuals have been given a polish and the frame rate is excellent. The sound effects remain largely unchanged from COD4, but this is by no means a bad thing when one considers how integral to the in-game experience they are. The weapons feel weighty and give a satisfying kick depending on their size. Overall, the experience of playing Modern Warfare 2 is very similar to COD4; Infinity Ward hurl everything at the player including the kitchen sink and the result is a white-knuckled, visceral shooter which hits the player at gut-level throughout its entire duration. The sense of a world that exists outside the game is obliterated by the firefights onscreen. The player is both thrilled and disorientated by the constant pace of the action which comes so thick and fast that the player really does feel that death (or at least game over) could come at any second. It's in this way that Modern Warfare 2, more than any other shooter in the market, both challenges the player's reflexes and accuracy while at the same time engaging their primal need for survival. It all adds up to some of the best shooter action money can buy. Modern Warfare 2 contains three main modes: campaign, multiplayer and special ops. The first two are fairly self-explanatory, while the third is a new feature. Modern Warfare 2's campaign kicks off with a couple of brief tutorials to familiarise players with the controls. It then plunges them headlong into the game's story, which, without giving too many plot details away, takes the ingredients from COD4's campaign (overlapping narratives and missions being undertaken by US armed forces and the British SAS), adds more twists and turns than a spaghetti junction and then ramps up the testosterone to unimaginable levels. It should pointed out at this stage that, when considered from a reasonable, real-world perspective, the story of Modern Warfare 2 is utterly ridiculous and its plot has more holes in it than a hunk of swiss cheese. But then, the game's story exists merely as an excuse to hang action set pieces on, and in this regard it's an unqualified success, mainly because Infinity Ward's level design is peerless Aside from the aforementioned excellent gameplay, the developers pack the missions with epic set pieces, breakneck tension, scenes which garner reactions of shock and awe and more than a few moments which will that prompt audible gasps from anyone watching or playing the game. There simply isn't a mission that goes by which doesn't succeed in nailing the player's jaw to the floor. There are, it has to be said, more than a few of scenes of disturbing violence which have the power to unsettle players – the footage that has already been leaked is probably the most obvious (but not the last) example of this. But these scenes are meant to have this effect within the context of the plot. Despite the silly extremes of certain plot developments, there is a serious undercurrent to the campaign's story which not only takes a hard unblinking look at the destabilising effects of armed conflict but also the fact that some of the people who operate within that environment exhibit a fish-eyed pragmatism which belies their brutal nature. The extremes to which some of the characters – even those with less questionable motives – go in order to accomplish their goals would mark them out as sociopaths in any other context. Modern Warfare 2 may toss a large chunk of reality into the rubbish skip in terms of its story, but it nails the motives of its protagonists to the wall. Depending on their accuracy, players will probably finish off the campaign in around six to eight hours, and although they'll probably play it through more than once, the game's online multiplayer mode is where its true longevity lies. Once again, Infinity Ward have kept the nuts and bolts of their multiplayer intact, while adding in some new features that are sure to delight the faithful. The RPG/perk reward system remains the same and with players advancing through the ranks depending on their abilities and gaining experience points with each battle. There are new Killstreak rewards which unlock weapons drops and air strikes – which are always handy in a firefight – and players also have the option of customising their Killstreaks, which allows them to unlock more advantages and battle assets. This customisation, however, remains balanced; players aren't able to rain down drone attacks after just a couple of kills. There's also the new Deathstreak feature which helps out the less accurate players (like me) with 'rewards' such as the ability to steel your killer's military class and weapons. Aside from the new weapons and equipment, players have far more options when it comes to customising how they approach the multiplayer. There are the preloaded classes such as Ranger and Overwatch, as well as some unlockable classes such as Riot Control. Players can also unlock the option to create their own classes, which in itself opens up a plethora of new ways to enjoy this mode – fancy tackling foes with just a riot shield and a rocket launcher? Help yourself. Another handy addition to online multiplayer, is in-game host migration. If a match host (usually on the losing side) decides to leave the game, the mode won't reset to the main lobby as in COD4, but will instead select a new host from the remaining players and the game continues. Up to 18 players (9 vs 9) can take part at any time in various match types which include Free-For-All, Search & Destroy, Domination, Team Deathmatch and new Demolition and Capture The Flag. As far as DLC is concerned, Infinity Ward have remained tight-lipped, although Microsoft announced earlier this year at E3 that two of Modern Warfare 2's map expansion packs would be made available to Xbox 360 owners first. The game's new mode is Special Ops which can be played solo or in co-op, both local and online. It's unlocked by completing the campaign mode, and is essentially a series of mini-missions; their design is similar to the epilogue mission in COD4's campaign mode, \\"Mile High Club\\". They're divided into four groups – Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta – and are based on sections within the campaign's levels. They include scenarios such as defending a raised platform in a snow-covered shipyard, racing snowmobiles across tundra and taking out guerrillas in a favela in Rio de Janeiro while avoiding civilian casualties. A couple of fan-favourites from COD4 are also included, such as the chilling Death From Above mission in AC-130 Spectre Gunship. Special Ops range from one to three stars in their level of difficulty, and players can use the stars they earn to unlock more challenges. There are 23 missions in all, and a lot of them are highly addictive; the temptation to better one's time in the snowmobile race is particularly compelling. All told, Modern Warfare 2 crosses into the must-have category of video games effortlessly. It offers an unmatched shooter experience, a compelling story mode, a slick package of mini missions and a multiplayer which is pretty much unparalleled in depth. It's sure to satisfy the demands of its fan base, and anyone who considers themselves a fan of shooters in general should definitely pick up a copy. It may be debatable as to whether Modern Warfare 2 is objectively the best release of 2009, but it's certainly the finest game in its genre, as well one of the truly great games of this or indeed any year.

With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent economic fallout, all eyes are on Davos as experts gather to place their bets on when – and how – global growth will bounce back. In this article, we will delve into the insights and expectations shared by the attendees, exploring the potential catalysts that could drive worldwide economic recovery. Post-Pandemic Challenges and Economic Realignment The pandemic has triggered significant economic realignment, revealing the fragility of global supply chains and the need for an accelerated shift towards digitalization and sustainable practices. Furthermore, the crisis has exposed underlying social and economic inequalities, which would pose significant challenges to policymakers on reshaping post-pandemic growth trajectories. Thus, the discussions in Davos are no longer limited to predicting the timeframe for growth resurgence, but also about ensuring that the recovery is inclusive, sustainable, and resilient. Technology's Role in Economic Recovery Digital transformation has emerged as a key point of consensus among the Davos attendees for driving economic growth. With remote work becoming the norm in many industries, businesses have been forced to adapt and invest in digital infrastructure. The widespread adoption of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, blockchain, and automation could boost productivity, catalyze GDP growth, and create new job opportunities. Still, it is crucial to address the digital divide that disproportionately impacts underserved populations and regions, preventing them from harnessing the full potential of technology-driven economic growth. Investment in Infrastructure for Sustainable Growth While global leaders remain cautiously optimistic about the prospects of economic recovery, they argue that substantial investments in infrastructure should be a priority. A renewed focus on sustainable infrastructure, including clean energy, green technology, and smart cities, could stimulate job creation and promote resource efficiency. Moreover, as nations worldwide ramp up their commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and shifting towards low-carbon economies, investments in renewable energy and related sectors will not only fuel growth but also build resilience against future crises. Global Cooperation for Equitable Economic Recovery The pandemic has demonstrated the interconnectedness of the global economy, and any economic resurgence relies heavily on international collaboration. The Davos discussions underscore the importance of strengthening global institutions to coordinate policy interventions and ensure cohesive strategies. For instance, the recently announced agreement by the G7 nations to create a global corporate minimum tax can be seen as a step towards global cooperation in ensuring fair and equitable economic policies. Experts in Davos stress that international cooperation in trade, investment, and climate action is paramount in addressing the post-pandemic global challenges. The Forecast on Global Growth Revival The timeline for global economic recovery cannot be pinpointed with certainty, given the interconnected nature of the world economy and the many variables at play. However, recent predictions by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggest that the world is on the path to revival. The IMF projects the global economy to grow by 6% in 2021 and 4.9% in 2022, driven primarily by a rapid recovery in the United States and other advanced economies. However, this growth may not be evenly distributed, and emerging markets may experience a more protracted recovery. Conclusion As leaders gather in Davos to place their bets on when global growth will return, it is clear that the path ahead requires careful navigation. Leveraging technology, investing in sustainable infrastructure, and fostering global cooperation are essential to ensuring a swift and equitable recovery. Whether the predictions of a robust rebound materialize will depend on the ability of nations to address the challenges laid bare by the pandemic and implement measures for a more resilient global economy."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

It is pretty little, so is easy to travel with, it came with a travel pouch so we just tucked it in our carry on bag. Runs for quite a while on 4 AAA batteries. It also can be plugged in the wall and will charge your ipod fast while plugged in. It came with a giant assortment of connector pieces to fit almost any ipod out there, plus can be used with a cable to plug in a discman or MP3.

Article: If you've ever seen a James Bond movie,you'll know that the hero gets around in a smart Aston Martin car. Even if you know full well that you could never afford such an expensive vehicle, you don't forget the name, or the car. Why? You have been affected by product placement. Companies pay a film to place their products in the movie. Product placement took off in the West in the 1980s and is now catching on in China. Two Hunan Satellite TV dramas are recent examples:Ugly Wudi and Let's Go Watch the Meteor Shower (<<>> ). Shampoo, mobile phones, cars and fitness centers-anything can be product-placed. Advertisers value the mass appeal of the movies, knowing that a successful film can showcase their goods to hundreds of thousands of viewers. But when product placement takes over, artistic considerations can take a back seat. Cai Zhiyong has been product-placing for years. The Beijing-based advertiser admits there is a conflict between art and business. He explains the way one ad works. In If You are the One (<<>> ), the actress Shu Qi plays a flight attendant. The movie contains product placement for airline companies.  _ filmmakers often have to give less consideration to the quality of their work because they need money from advertisers. In the original story for Meteor Shower, the heroine's mother owned an ice cream shop. But no ice cream company wanted to sponsor   the film. For this reason, the story was changed. In the film the man drinks 20 cups of milk tea instead of eating ice cream. So you may see the power of business over the movies, since the script   was perhaps written so that a product could be placed-whether it was ice cream or milk tea.

Kill 'Em All features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. \\"Metal Militia\\", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity....

I have a habit of making mental errors; some funny, some not. This one just happens to be funny. We had “open critiques” in art school. The idea was A- to point out how we could do it better, and B- to toughen us up for the advertising world. It’s brutal, cruel, and cutthroat, and get ready for your stupid clients to ruin your tasteful design and fuck it all kinds of up to put a picture of their ugly-ass crotch dropping on there, or a huge starburst that says “SALE SALE SALE!”. You had to learn not to care, and do your fulfilling artwork on the side. It’s just a job; nothing personal. We were in the middle of a critique, and it was turning ugly. The only time our professor would jump in was if it turned personal. It had. He laid back and let us fight it out, until someone told the girl we were critiquing that “with your taste from growing up in a trailer park, looks like you’ll be working for the Auto Trader” (a shitty, newsprint magazine that people sell used cars in- the worst of the worst design jobs). Before our professor could comment, I blurted out “For fuck’s sake, Mom….” I was about to say “tell them to break it the fuck up!” until the laughter started. Then I realized I’d called my professor, who had an MFA and spent 20 years in advertising at Saatchi and Saatchi, “Mom”. He responded with such amazing, quick wit; “Ms. Hood, I admire your devotion to your mother; just remember she stays home while you come to class.” I caught hell for it that entire semester. Luckily, we (almost) all had pretty tough skins, so it was amusing, even to our somewhat staid professor. He wrote on my end of semester assessment “Respectfully, Not Your Mom.” I still keep that assessment to remind me to wear life like a loose garment.

At that very moment, a truck rams their car from behind and Paige crashes through the windshield. Both of them are rushed to the emergency room, and as Leo, in a voice-over talks about how \\"moments of impact help in finding who we are\\" the movie cuts to how Paige and Leo first met.

Answer:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"veins and arteries.\\" Androgens are a group of hormones that play a significant role in the development and maintenance of male characteristics and reproductive functions. They stimulate the growth and function of reproductive organs, especially in males. The primary androgen hormone is testosterone, which primarily affects the development of male characteristics such as facial hair growth, muscle mass, and a lower voice pitch. In terms of male reproductive organs, androgens stimulate the growth and function of the testes, production of sperm, and support of sex drive (libido). In summary, androgens stimulate reproductive organs, predominantly in males, and are not directly related to the function of veins and arteries."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have a math problem that looks like this: 0 = 25*s - 19*s + 12, and we need to find out what 's' is. First, let's combine the terms with 's' in them. So, 25*s - 19*s is like having 25 apples minus 19 apples. That would give us 6 apples, right? So we have 6*s instead, and our equation now looks like this: 0 = 6*s + 12. Now, let's get rid of the 12 that's being added to 6*s. What kind of math should we do to remove 12? That's right! We should subtract it from both sides of the equation. So the equation looks like this: -12 = 6*s. Now, we have only one more step. We need to find out what 's' is. We have -12 = 6*s, and we want to remove the 6 that's being multiplied by 's'. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 6. So it will look like this: -2 = s. And there you have it! The solution for 's' is -2. The math problem says that 0 = 25*(-2) - 19*(-2) + 12, which is true!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Whore Context: Liz (Russell) is a Los Angeles prostitute the audience first sees attempting to get a customer on a busy downtown street near a tunnel. She addresses the audience directly on her life and problems throughout the film. When a van stops by, she gives it the brush off, recalling the last time she serviced a man in a van: it turned out there were several other men in the van, who gang-raped her and left her for dead. A passer-by (Jack Nance) helps her to the hospital, and even pays her bill there. She sends him a thank you note. Liz isn't merely attempting to get a customer, however: she is attempting to escape her pimp, Blake (Benjamin Mouton). Blake is a well-dressed, businesslike and extremely controlling man who catches up with her at a convenience store. He demands money, and Liz has no choice but to agree though she gives him the finger as he leaves. As Liz stops off at a strip club for a drink, she explains how she ended up as she did: she was a small town girl, who married a violent drunk named Charlie (Frank Smith). Though they have a child together, she can no longer take it and leaves him, taking her son with her, as he's sleeping it off. She takes a job on the graveyard shift at a diner, and when a customer offers her more money to have sex with him, she decides, given her rather low pay, to take it. She does this independently for a time until she meets Blake, who takes her to LA. Though Blake does do some things for her (including getting her tattooed), he is ultimately as cruel as her husband, so she decides to escape from him. A local homeless person/street performer named Rasta (Antonio Fargas) decides to treat Liz to a movie. Though Rasta is a bit scary (his act involves walking on broken glass), Liz agrees. At this point the scenes of Liz and Rasta at the movie are intercut with Blake explaining his life to the audience, giving the impression that Liz and Rasta are watching Blake's soliloquy. After the movie, Liz talks to the audience about her son, whom she clearly loves, though he's now in...

High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) above sea level.[5][6][7] At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.[8].  Story: Riley has just been diagnosed with a disease that requires him to be in an area that has low atmospheric pressure to help his breathing.

Write a title for this article: President Obama is asking Congress to pass legislation that would extend the 10-year term of Robert S. Mueller III, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, by two years, the White House said in a statement Thursday. Mr. Mueller’s tenure is scheduled to end on Sept. 4. Mr. Mueller, who took office a week before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, has overseen the transformation of the F.B.I. from an agency dedicated to criminal investigations to one that is a major player in the nation’s global antiterrorism effort. “In his 10 years at the F.B.I., Bob Mueller has set the gold standard for leading the bureau,” Mr. Obama said in the statement. “Given the ongoing threats facing the United States, as well as the leadership transitions at other agencies like the Defense Department and Central Intelligence Agency, I believe continuity and stability at the F.B.I. is critical at this time.” While it is unclear how Congress will respond, Mr. Mueller enjoys widespread bipartisan support on Capitol Hill — appointed by President George W. Bush, Mr. Mueller won unanimous confirmation from the Senate in 2001 and was appointed to previous jobs by President George H.W. Bush, a Republican, and President Bill Clinton, a Democrat — and Mr. Obama’s request is likely to get deference. The announcement comes after Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. began conducting a high-level search for a replacement. F.B.I. directors are limited by law to a single 10-year term, and Mr. Mueller has been traveling globally on what has been characterized as his farewell tour. While a two-year extension would keep Mr. Mueller in place past the 2012 election, White House press secretary Jay Carney said considerations of presidential politics were not a factor in setting two years as the length of the extension. He cited instead the difficulty of the director’s job, and the fact that Mr. Mueller had held it for nearly 10 years in particularly stressful times.","output":"\\"Obama Seeks Two-Year Extension for FBI Director Mueller Amidst Agency Transformation and Global Threats\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: The barristers who represented Man Haron Monis in court just three days before he staged a bloody 17-hour siege work in the same building as victim Katrina Dawson. The gunman's lawyers Guy Renolds SC and David Hume work at Sixth Floor Selborne Wentworth Chambers, two floors below Eight Selborne Chambers office where Ms Dawson and colleague Julie Taylor work, the Daily Telegraph reported. The building is around the corner from the Lindt cafe in Sydney's Martin Place, where Ms Dawson and cafe manager Tori Johnson were fatally shot and 16 other hostages escaped after a terrifying ordeal at the hands Monis. Scroll down for video. Barristers Guy Renolds SC and David Hume represented Man Haron Monis (pictured) in court on Friday. Mr Hume and Mr Renolds SC work in the same building (pictured) as Monis's victim Katrina Dawson. Three days before he stormed a Sydney cafe with a shotgun Man Haron Monis had an appeal against conviction rejected in the High Court. Last Friday morning, after reluctantly pleading guilty to twelve charges of sending malicious notes disguised as 'sympathy letters' and making phone calls to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan, 50-year-old Monis had taken his case to the High Court. But Monis was rebuffed. He had already been rejected by the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal (NSWCCA). He had already taken his case - that charges of using a postal service or similar to menace, harass or cause offence were unconstitutional - once to the High Court. In February last year, six members of the High Court returned their judgement. It was a split decision, divided evenly between three male judges who agreed with Monis that the charges were unconstitutional. Three female judges ruled that the appeal court decision that the charges against him were constitutional should hold. Separated from two adult daughters back in Iran, Monis had also been denied contact with his two sons - now aged 10 and four years old - in a long running custody battle with his ex-wife's family. On Tuesday morning many innocent people were injured and two were tragically killed in the deadly siege. Last Friday Monis went to the High Court again. Represented by Sydney barrister Guy Reynolds SC, he made an application to remove the Appeal court decision to the High Court. By 10am, the court's Chief Justice Robert French and Justice Stephen Gageler swiftly dismissed his application. Monis, who was not present in the court, was telephoned and told his bid had failed. Separated from two adult daughters back in Iran, Monis had also been denied contact with his two sons - now aged 10 and four years old - in a long running custody battle with his ex-wife's family. Following a bitter and vengeful relationship with the children's mother Noleen Hayson Pal after she ended it in 2011, Monis had been charged with intimidating her but was lucky enough to have the charge and an Apprehended Violence Order against him dismissed in May 2012. In April the mother of Monis' children Noleen Hayson Pal was stabbed 18 times and set alight in the stairwell of his western Sydney flat in Werrington. But in April 2013, Ms Pal was stabbed 18 times and set alight in the stairwell of his western Sydney flat in Werrington and seven months later, in October last year, police charged Monis with accessory to murder. His girlfriend, Amirah Droudis, a Greek Australian Muslim convert was charged with Ms Pal's murder. Ms Droudis was also charged over the hate letters, for aiding and abetting Monis. In September last year, Monis told police he had known Droudis for six years but that their relationship had not begun until May 2013 - the month following Ms Pal's murder. Seven months later, in October last year, police charged Monis with accessory to murder while his girlfriend Amirah Droudis was charged with Ms Pal's murder. Ms Droudis was due to appeal her charges in court next February, the same months Monis would face a trial on the multiple sex charges, including two of inciting a teenage girl to commit an indecent act. No date had been set for the murder trial. But it was the mark against his name over the poison pen letters which had dominated Monis's thoughts since 2009, as he went from the District Court to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to the High Court and back to the High Court again, only to be rebuffed. Seventy-two hours later, Monis took a shotgun into Martin Place.

Three days later, Soviet militsiya officer Arkady Renko (William Hurt) investigates the discovery of their bodies a short distance from the skating rink. All have been shot in the chest and mouth; their faces and fingerprints have been completely removed with surgical instruments. Renko is left anxious and paranoid when the KGB refuse to take over the investigation. Renko enlists the help of Professor Andreev (Ian McDiarmid) to reconstruct their faces.During his investigation, Renko crosses paths with William Kirwill (Brian Dennehy), a New York police detective who is in the Soviet Union investigating the disappearance of his brother James. At a weekend getaway at the dacha of Chief Prosecutor Iamskoy (Ian Bannen), Renko also makes the acquaintance of the American sable importer Jack Osborne (Lee Marvin) and his girlfriend Irina Asanova (Joanna Pacua).Renko is eventually able to piece together the victims' identities: James Kirwill, and two young Russians who were friends of Irina.

Sadly, today's children are sometimes being armed with more dangerous tools like weapons, drugs and gangs in the USA. Once a relatively peaceful environment, many schoolyards of today are becoming unsafe for both students and teachers. Home schools are available to give you choices. Home schooling provides top-quality education, flexibility and freedom to create your own schedule. At Sunny Home School we believe the choice should be yours. Thanks to modern technology, home schooling information is becoming readily available across the nation. A recent study by the ITBS (Iowa Tests of Basic Skills) and TAP (Tests of Achievement and Proficiency) shows us that students of home schools do particularly well when compared with the nationwide average. In every subject at every grade level, students of home schooling scored obviously higher than those in public and private schools. If you're new to home schooling, you may be asking yourself, \\"Will home schools really work for my children?\\" Fact: A nationwide study using a random selection of 1,516 families found students of home schooling to be scoring, on average, at or above the 80thpercentile (80) in all areas, on standardized achievement test. (Note: The national average on standardized achievement test is the 50thpercentile.) Collectively, the staff at Sunny Home School brings 65 years of experience in home schooling curriculum. We've placed students in the top 2% of the nation in math and many are successfully moving on to college.

The text continued, \\"To become a shade, an everliving must experience and survive a devastating trauma, which in turn pushes them beyond their mortal boundaries. When an everliving crosses this line, the darkness within them takes over, amplifying their thirst for power and destruction. The newly turned shade will then embark on a destructive and terrifying journey, haunting the lives of both mortals and everlivings alike.\\" Sarah's face was a combination of horror and fascination as she looked up from the document. \\"Jack, have you ever encountered a shade before?\\" Jack shook his head, his expression grim. \\"No, but I've heard the stories. I always thought they were just legends, meant to scare young recruits into following orders or something, but this... this seems all too real.\\" Running his finger down the page, Jack uncovered a hidden part of the text: \\"There are three primary abilities that shades possess: first, they can possess and control the minds of lesser beings, bending them to their will; second, they can manipulate and summon dark energies for a variety of purposes, including offensive and defensive measures; and third, they possess the power of imperceptibility, allowing them to blend seamlessly into the shadows and escape detection.\\" Jack sighed, rubbing his forehead as he tried to process the information. \\"So, not only are shades incredibly powerful, but they're also nearly impossible to find. We're going to have to figure out a way to track them down and stop them from causing any more damage.\\" Sarah bit her lip, already analyzing the different methods they could use to locate and vanquish a shade. \\"We'll need the help of the Council for this; they're the only ones with the resources and knowledge to assist us.\\" Jack nodded, his determination renewing as he started to put away the documents. \\"We'll go to them first thing in the morning. In the meantime, we need to gather some essentials and make a plan of action.\\" Together, Jack and Sarah set to work, preparing for the dangerous mission that lay ahead of them. Between the cryptic documents and the unnerving legends surrounding shades, they knew that the task would be far from easy. But with the world in peril and innocent lives at stake, the two friends embarked on this frightening quest, for they were the last line of defense against the relentless and terrifying force that was a shade."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context:was amused that we 're going to an air transportation conference , and my travel buddy is totally afraid of flying . amused self by reading i know this much is true in its entirety , watching episodes of house , remembering that 21 is in fact a really awful movie , and sleeping . Question What maybe the reason the travel buddy is afraid of flying . Answer:","output":"One possible reason the travel buddy is afraid of flying could be due to a fear or phobia known as aviophobia. This fear can stem from several factors: 1. Past negative experiences: If the travel buddy has had a traumatic or negative experience with flying in the past, such as turbulence or an emergency landing, they may be afraid to fly again. 2. Fear of the unknown: Some people are naturally apprehensive about new or unfamiliar experiences, including flying. If the travel buddy has never flown before or has limited experience, they may be afraid of the unknown aspects of the experience. 3. Lack of control: Flying involves placing trust in the airline, the pilots, and the aircraft itself. For some people, this lack of control can be anxiety-inducing and lead to a fear of flying. 4. Fear of heights: If the travel buddy has a fear of heights, known as acrophobia, the idea of being thousands of feet in the air might be terrifying for them. 5. Media influence: Oftentimes, the media portrays air travel accidents or emergencies. This can create a heightened perception of risk and contribute to a fear of flying. 6. Claustrophobia: The confined spaces in an airplane might trigger feelings of claustrophobia or discomfort, leading to a fear of flying. Understanding the root cause of their fear can help the travel buddy address and potentially overcome their fear of flying."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.
