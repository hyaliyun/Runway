News article: Drag the Red searchers get forensics crash course in Winnipeg A group of Drag the Red volunteers is receiving a crash course in forensics by anthropologists at the University of Winnipeg. Drag the Red searchers started their second year of combing the Red River in May. The group has been dragging hooks from boats across the river bottom since last fall, driven to action after the death of Tina Fontaine. Researchers and volunteers with Drag the Red came together at the U of W Saturday to learn how to sharpen their efforts and search more safely. Drag the Red organizer Bernadette Smith said they're ecstatic to have professionals participating this year. Drag the Red searchers were shown how to spot bones by forensic anthropologists at the University of Winnipeg June 6. The bone in the foreground is from a pelican, a bird that's commonly found along the Red River. (Sara Calnek/CBC) \\"We were super happy, because now we have people who are trained in this sort of thing,\\" she said, adding the group wants to be more targeted with what they turn over to police so as to not waste investigators' time. \\"We asked if they could do a training day with our group so that we know exactly what we're looking for, are on the right track ... and that we're not bringing things in that necessarily don't need to be brought in.\\" Emily Holland, an anthropology professor at Brandon University and a trained forensic specialist, said she wanted to help the group search more effectively, \\"so they're looking as critically and cautiously as they can.\\" \\"It's going to be very difficult. If you think about the scale of what these people are undertaking. there is a lot of land, a lot of water,\\" she said. Emily Holland, an anthropology professor from Brandon University, said she wanted to help Drag the Red volunteers make their search efforts more safe and efficient. (Angela Johnston/CBC) She stressed the potential for dehydration, sun stroke and being exposed to biohazards associated with decomposed human remains needs to be taken into account before venturing out onto the water. Holland said one of the purposes of the course was to give volunteers a basic framework for how to spot bones in their search areas. \\"Bone can look like lots of things. It has a very particular structure: hard dense outer layer, looks like a tube,\\" said Holland, adding once bones are recovered they need to be sent to an expert to be identified. Emily Holland, an anthropology professor at Brandon University, said she got involved with Drag the Red because she wanted to help bring the friends and family of missing persons some closure. (CBC) \\"It's just about really making sure they know what bone looks like.\\" She added that searchers could come across partial remains on shorelines. \\"These aren't nice things to think about but these are the kinds of things that happen,\\" said Holland. \\"As a forensic anthropologist, I do that part of my work because people matter. I can't do anything about what has happened to someone before, but I can try to help find them. I can help ID them and help tell their story and bring closure to families.\\" Smith said the extra help is encouraging her and other volunteers to keep at it, despite the challenges encountered last year. \\"Last year we hit a lot of learning curves. We really didn't know what we were doing,\\" said Smith. Chris Speidel, a friend of Tina Fontaine's mom, has been helping with Drag the Red since its first year. (CBC) \\"We're going to continue to learn with the efforts of other people who have the expertise.\\" Chris Speidal got involved last year because he's good friends with Tina Fontaine's mom. He started out by driving volunteers to and from search locations before getting involved on the ground. \\"It was emotional, knowing all of the people that were missing,\\" he said. \\"Before I never thought much of it, until it hit home, so that's what really inspired me to do it.\\" Drag the Red plans to search every day until October. A range of bones from different species were on hand for the group. (Angela Johnston/CBC) What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"Drag the Red is a group of volunteers who search the Red River looking for clues to help solve unresolved cases, like the death of Tina Fontaine. They've been doing this job for a couple of years, using hooks from boats to search the bottom of the river.  To help them do a better job, professionals from the University of Winnipeg are teaching them about forensics. Forensics is a kind of science that helps to solve crimes. They're learning things like how to recognize bones when they see them and how to stay safe while doing this work. An anthropology professor named Emily Holland also wants to help this group. She says it's important to be very careful and thorough when doing this kind of work because searching a river can be dangerous and very hard. Because of this crash course, they will be better equipped to spot things that can help the police solve their cases, without bringing in unnecessary items that waste investigators' time. The hope is this training will help them find more clues to help the families of missing persons find closure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(AAP) A German man has escaped the death penalty after being convicted of trying to smuggle cocaine into Bali. Peter Hans Naumann's sentence of 15 years' jail comes as Indonesian authorities prepare to execute up to 10 foreign drug offenders including Bali Nine Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. Naumann, 48, was arrested by customs officials at the resort island's airport in September after they noticed him acting suspiciously following his arrival on a flight from Bangkok. An initial search turned up no drugs but further examinations in hospital found he had 11 capsules of cocaine in his stomach. He confessed during his trial that he had been promised US5000 (A6560) to deliver the drugs. Presiding judge Putu Gde Hariyadi told a court in the Balinese capital Denpasar Naumann had been \\"proven legally and convincingly guilty of importing narcotics\\". The judge said mitigating factors included that \\"the defendant regretted his action, was polite during the trial and had not been involved in a crime before\\". He handed him a 15-year jail term, and ordered him to pay a fine of one billion rupiah US75,700 (A99,370) or spend an additional three months in jail. However, judges decided not hand him the toughest penalty in Indonesia for drug trafficking, the death sentence. President Joko Widodo, who took office in October, has taken a hard line against the drugs trade, claiming that Indonesia is facing an \\"emergency\\" due to rising narcotics use, and vowing to show no clemency for traffickers on death row.

It's true that we are getting to know more and more, and we actually live in \\"the information age\\". Our human vanity  makes us believe that we really have to know everything! Surprisingly, we do not have this ability. The question \\"what is happening in the Bermuda Triangle\\" is the very proof. Where is the Bermuda Triangle located? The mysterious triangle is believed to be situated between Florida, Bermuda and Puerto Rico, where too many unusual events have happened. On December the 5th1945, five U.S. military planes took off from Florida on a clear day only to disappear over Bermuda. Furthermore, some other disappearances took place; in 1947, an American C54 plane simply disappeared at 100 miles from Bermuda; at 80 miles, a Star Tiger plane disappeared in 1948. Even Columbus had trouble in Bermuda. Some of his journals were about the strange happenings there: \\"the waters are changing their colors\\" and \\"compasses are going wild\\". Maybe it's why it is called the Devil's triangle or the Atlantic cemetery. Many _ were stated in order to explain the strange events. In spite of these attempts, the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle remains unsolved. Some people get to say that maybe aliens are involved in it. Other imaginative scientists relate the happenings in Bermuda to Einstein's theory, saying that the missing ships and planes are translated to another dimension of space and time and taken into another world. Maybe we will just have to wait to go to Heaven and ask the One who made it. The answer will surely be a satisfying one! Question: Columbus' journals told us that in Bermuda  _  .

It is usually used to refine the riding aids (commands) and to back up the natural aids (the leg, seat, hands and voice). The spur is used in many equestrian disciplines. There are rules in most equestrian organizations about spur design, use and penalties for using spurs in any manner that constitutes animal abuse.  - Canaan (Northwest Semitic: \\"\\"; Phoenician: ; Biblical Hebrew/ Masoretic: [\\"; nan]\\") was a Semitic-speaking region in the Ancient Near East during the late 2nd millennium BC. In the Bible it corresponds to the Levant, in particular to the areas of the Southern Levant that provide the main setting of the narrative of the Hebrew Bible, i.e., the area of Israel, Philistia, Phoenicia, and other nations.  - Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\".

In the Samaritan Pentateuch , Benjamin 's name appears as \`\` Binyaamem '' ( Hebrew :  , \`\` Son of my days '' ) . In the Qur'an , Benjamin is referred to as righteous young child , who remained with Jacob when the older brothers plotted against Joseph . Later rabbinic traditions name him as one of four ancient Israelites who died without sin , the other three being Chileab , Jesse and Amram .  - According to the Bible, Amnon (\\"faithful\\") was the oldest son of David, King of Israel, with his wife, Ahinoam, who is described as \\"the Jezreelitess\\".  - Originally, a patriarch was a man who exercised autocratic authority as a pater familias over an extended family. The system of such rule of families by senior males is termed patriarchy.  - A tradition is a belief or behavior passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. Common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyers' wigs or military officers' spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings. Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of yearsthe word \\"tradition\\" itself derives from the Latin \\"tradere\\" or \\"traderer\\" literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways.   - The Samaritan alphabet is used by the Samaritans for religious writings, including the Samaritan Pentateuch, writings in Samaritan Hebrew, and for commentaries and translations in Samaritan Aramaic and occasionally Arabic. Samaritan is a direct descendant of the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet, which was a variety of the Phoenician alphabet in which large parts of the Hebrew Bible were originally penned. All these scripts are believed to be descendants of the Proto-Sinaitic script. That script was used by the ancient Israelites, both Jews and Samaritans. The better-known \\"square script\\" Hebrew alphabet traditionally used by Jews is a stylized version of the Aramaic alphabet which they adopted from the Persian Empire (which in turn adopted it from the Arameans). After the fall of the Persian Empire, Judaism used both scripts before settling on the Aramaic form. For a limited time thereafter, the use of paleo-Hebrew (proto-Samaritan) among Jews was retained only to write the Tetragrammaton, but soon that custom was also abandoned.  - Hebrew Bible or Hebrew Scriptures is the term used by biblical scholars to refer to the \\"Tanakh\\", the canonical collection of Jewish texts, which is the common textual source of several canonical editions of the Christian Old Testament. They are composed mainly in Biblical Hebrew, with some passages in Biblical Aramaic (in the books of Daniel, Ezra and a few others).  - The Israelites (\\"Bnei Yisra'el\\") were a Semitic-speaking people of the ancient Near East, who inhabited a part of Canaan during the tribal and monarchic periods. The ancient Israelites are considered to be an outgrowth of the indigenous Canaanite populations that long inhabited the Southern Levant, Syria, ancient Israel and the Transjordan.  - The Torah (\\"instruction, teaching\\"), or in Christianity, the Pentateuch (\\"five books\\"), is the central reference of the religious Judaic tradition. It has a range of meanings. It can most specifically mean the first five books of the twenty-four books of the Tanakh, and it usually includes the rabbinic commentaries ('). The term \\"Torah\\" means instruction and offers a way of life for those who follow it; it can mean the continued narrative from Book of Genesis to the end of the Tanakh, and it can even mean the totality of Jewish teaching, culture and practice. Common to all these meanings, Torah consists of the foundational narrative of Jewish peoplehood: their call into being by God, their trials and tribulations, and their covenant with their God, which involves following a way of life embodied in a set of moral and religious obligations and civil laws (').  - Belief is the state of mind in which a person thinks something to be the case, with or without there being empirical evidence to prove that something is the case with factual certainty. Another way of defining belief sees it as a mental representation of an attitude positively oriented towards the likelihood of something being true. In the context of Ancient Greek thought, two related concepts were identified with regards to the concept of belief: \\"pistis\\" and \\"doxa\\". Simplified, we may say that \\"pistis\\" refers to \\"trust\\" and \\"confidence\\", while \\"doxa\\" refers to \\"opinion\\" and \\"acceptance\\". The English word \\"orthodoxy\\" derives from \\"doxa\\". Jonathan Leicester suggests that belief has the purpose of guiding action rather than indicating truth.  - In monotheism, God is conceived of as the Supreme Being and principal object of faith. The concept of God as described by most theologians includes the attributes of omniscience (infinite knowledge), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), divine simplicity, and as having an eternal and necessary existence. Many theologians also describe God as being omnibenevolent (perfectly good) and all loving.  - The Book of Exodus or, simply, Exodus (from , \\"éxodos\\", meaning \\"going out\\" \\"Shm\\", \\"Names\\", the second word of the beginning of the text: \\"These are the names of the sons of Israel\\" ), is the second book of the Torah and the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament).  - Bethuel (\\"Bêl\\", house of God), in the Hebrew Bible, was an Aramean man, the youngest son of Nahor and Milcah, the nephew of Abraham, and the father of Laban and Rebecca.  - Biblical Hebrew (\\"Ivrit Miqra'it\\" or \\"Leshon ha-Miqra\\"), also called Classical Hebrew, is an archaic form of Hebrew, a Canaanite Semitic language spoken by the Israelites in the area known as Israel, roughly west of the Jordan River and east of the Mediterranean Sea. The term \\"Hebrew\\" was not used for the language in the Bible, which was referred to as Canaanite or Judahite, but the name was used in Greek and Mishnaic Hebrew texts. Biblical Hebrew is attested from about the 10th century BCE, and persisted through and beyond the Second Temple period, which ended in the siege of Jerusalem (AD 70).  - The Samaritan Pentateuch, also known as the Samaritan Torah (Hebrew:   \\"torah shomronit\\"), is a text of the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, written in the Samaritan alphabet and used as a scripture by the Samaritans. It constitutes their entire biblical canon.  - Miriam, according to the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament, was the elder sister of Moses by seven years and Aaron by four years, and the only daughter of Amram and Jochebed. She was a prophet and first appears in the Book of Exodus.  - The Levant (Arabic:  \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\".  - Philistia (\\"Pleshet\\") was, according to and , a Pentapolis in south-western Levant, comprising Ashkelon, Ashdod, Ekron, Gath, and Gaza. The Philistines or Peleset were believed to be Indo-European speaking invaders to the region, arriving either from Crete and the Aegean or western Anatolia during the Bronze Age Collapse.  - Solomon (\\"Šlomo\\"; \\"Shlemun\\"; ', also colloquially: ' or '; \\"Solomn\\"), also called Jedidiah\\"' (Hebrew ), was, according to the Bible (Book of Kings: 1 Kings 111; Book of Chronicles: 1 Chronicles 2829, 2 Chronicles 19), Quran, hadith and \\"Hidden Words\\" a fabulously wealthy and wise king of Israel and a son of David, the previous king of Israel. The conventional dates of Solomon's reign are circa 970 to 931 BC, normally given in alignment with the dates of David's reign. He is described as the third king of the United Monarchy, which would break apart into the northern Kingdom of Israel and the southern Kingdom of Judah shortly after his death. Following the split, his patrilineal descendants ruled over Judah alone.  - The Tree of Jesse is a depiction in art of the ancestors of Christ, shown in a tree which rises from Jesse of Bethlehem, the father of King David and is the original use of the family tree as a schematic representation of a genealogy. It originates in a passage in the biblical Book of Isaiah which describes metaphorically the descent of the Messiah, and is accepted by Christians as referring to Jesus. The various figures depicted in the lineage of Jesus are drawn from those names listed in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke.  - The Southern Levant is a geographical region encompassing the southern half of the Levant. It corresponds approximately to modern-day Israel, Palestine, and Jordan; some definitions also include southern Lebanon, southern Syria and/or the Sinai Peninsula. As a strictly geographical description, it is sometimes used by archaeologists and historians to avoid the religious and political connotations of other names for the area.  - The Book of Genesis (from the Latin Vulgate, in turn borrowed or transliterated from Greek , meaning \\"origin\\" \\"Brš\\", \\"In [the] beginning\\") is the first book of the Hebrew Bible (the Tanakh) and the Christian Old Testament.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - In the Book of Genesis, Zilpah ( \\"meaning uncertain,\\" Standard Hebrew \\"Zilpa\\", Tiberian Hebrew \\"Zilpâ\\") was Leah's handmaid, whom Leah gave to Jacob \\"to wife\\" to bear him children. Zilpah gave birth to two sons, whom Leah claimed as her own and named Gad and Asher.

How many indian units of power does a 100 watt bulb consume in 1 hour? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Select from: 1). no; 2). yes;","output":"1). No; The two questions are not paraphrases of each other. They are related questions, but they address different aspects of power consumption.  The first question asks about the power consumed by a 60-watt bulb in 1 second. Watt is a unit of power that indicates the rate of energy conversion or consumption per unit time (1 Watt = 1 Joule per second). So, a 60-watt bulb consumes energy at a rate of 60 Joules per second. Therefore, the power consumed by the 60-watt bulb in 1 second is 60 Joules. The second question asks about the Indian units of power consumed by a 100-watt bulb in 1 hour. In India, power consumption is measured in terms of 'Units' (or Kilowatt-hours). 1 Unit is equal to 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh). To find the energy consumed by a 100-watt bulb in 1 hour, we can first convert 100 watts to kilowatts by dividing by 1000 (1 kW = 1000 W). So, a 100-watt bulb has a power rating of 0.1 kW. Now, we can find the energy consumed in 1 hour by multiplying the power rating by the duration in hours, which is 1 hour in this case: Energy consumed (kWh) = Power rating (kW) * Duration (hours) = 0.1 kW * 1 hour = 0.1 kWh = 0.1 units So, the energy consumed by a 100-watt bulb in 1 hour is 0.1 Indian units. In summary, while both questions involve power consumption and electric bulbs, they are not paraphrases of each other because they address different aspects of the topic and provide different information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a more detailed explanation: Electromagnetic energy encompasses a vast spectrum of wavelengths and frequencies, which allows for its diverse range of uses. Some common applications of electromagnetic energy include: 1. Communication: Radio waves, one form of electromagnetic energy, are widely used for transmitting information wirelessly. Televisions, radios, and mobile phones rely on radio wave transmission for communication. 2. Heating and cooking: Microwaves, another type of electromagnetic energy, are used in domestic appliances such as microwave ovens and industrial heating processes. They are efficient in transferring energy to heat food or other materials quickly and evenly. 3. Medicine and healthcare: X-rays, a high-energy type of electromagnetic radiation, are employed to provide detailed images of the body's internal structures. This helps diagnose and treat various ailments, such as bone fractures and tumors. Other medical imaging technologies like MRI scanners also utilize electromagnetic energy. 4. Remote sensing and navigation: Electromagnetic waves are employed in remote sensing applications like weather forecasting, which uses radar and satellite imaging to observe and predict atmospheric conditions. They are also used in GPS navigation systems found in vehicles and personal devices. 5. Energy production: The sun's light, a visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, is essential for photosynthesis and solar power generation. Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity, harnessing electromagnetic energy for sustainable power solutions. 6. Security: Infrared radiation, another form of electromagnetic energy, serves various security purposes, such as motion detectors and night vision goggles. X-ray scanners at airports and other sensitive areas help detect concealed items. These examples illustrate the importance of electromagnetic energy in our daily lives. The devices in our homes and offices, mentioned in the paragraph, are only some of the many ways we utilize electromagnetic energy for our benefit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

From left to right: Lester, Bishop, Davis, Sinatra, and Martin The gang plans the elaborate New Year's Eve heist with the precision of a military operation. Josh Howard (Sammy Davis Jr.) takes a job as a sanitation worker driving a garbage truck while others work to scope out the various casinos. Sam Harmon (Dean Martin) entertains in one of the hotel's lounges. Demolition charges are planted on an electrical transmission tower and the backup electrical systems are covertly rewired in each casino. At exactly midnight, while everyone in every Vegas casino is singing \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" the tower is blown up and Vegas goes dark. The backup electrical systems open the cashier cages instead of powering the emergency lights. The inside men sneak into the cashier cages and collect the money. They dump the bags of loot into the hotels' garbage bins, go back inside, and mingle with the crowds. As soon as the lights come back on, the thieves stroll out of the casinos. A garbage truck driven by Josh picks up the bags and passes through the police blockade. It appears to have gone off without a hitch. Their ace electrician, Tony Bergdorf (Richard Conte), has a heart attack in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip and drops dead. This raises the suspicions of police, who wonder if there is any connection. Reformed mobster Duke Santos (Cesar Romero) offers to recover the casino bosses' money for a price. He learns of Ocean being in town and his connection to Foster, who is the son of Duke's fiancee (Ilka Chase). Santos pieces together the puzzle by the time Bergdorf's body arrives at the mortuary.

Please answer the following question: Background: Ionizing radiation has many practical uses in medicine, research and construction, but presents a health hazard if used improperly. Exposure to radiation causes damage to living tissue; high doses result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), with skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure and death, while any dose may result in an increased chance of cancer and genetic damage; a particular form of cancer, thyroid cancer, often occurs when nuclear weapons and reactors are the radiation source because of the biological proclivities of the radioactive iodine fission product, iodine-131. However, calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation is still not well understood and currently estimates are loosely determined by population based data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and from follow-up of reactor accidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster. The International Commission on Radiological Protection states that \\"The Commission is aware of uncertainties and lack of precision of the models and parameter values\\", \\"Collective effective dose is not intended as a tool for epidemiological risk assessment, and it is inappropriate to use it in risk projections\\" and \\"in particular, the calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective effective doses from trivial individual doses should be avoided.\\"  Paragraph: Michael and Robert are scientists who work in a nuclear reactor facility.

Movie title: Burn After Reading Movie plot: Faced with a demotion at work due to a drinking problem, Osbourne Cox angrily quits his job as a CIA analyst and resolves to write a memoir about his life and career. When his pediatrician wife Katie finds out, she sees it as a justifiable opportunity to file for divorce and continue her adulterous affair unimpeded. Taking her lawyer's advice, she copies financial records and several other files from her husband's computer onto a CD. These files contain a rambling, meaningless diatribe by Cox on purported CIA activities. When the CD gets left on the locker room floor of Hardbodies, a local gym, by a careless law firm employee, it falls into the hands of dim-witted personal trainer Chad Feldheimer and his co-worker Linda Litzke, who mistakenly believe the numerical data in the Coxes' bank records, and especially, Cox's diatribes, to be highly sensitive government information. After getting the data traced back to Osbourne, who thinks his memoirs have been stolen, Chad and Linda plan to give the disc back to him for a reward, with Linda planning to use the money to pay for plastic surgery. When a phone call and subsequent meeting with Osbourne provoke a furious reaction and go horribly wrong, Chad and Linda turn over the disc to the Russian embassy, offering more information in return for monetary compensation. With no other data to give them, Linda persuades Chad to sneak into the Coxes' home to get more files from their computer.

Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).  Jimmy is currently shopping at his local grocery store during his weekly trip to get food and other necessities. He first picks up some frozen pizzas, his favorite meal when he is feeling lazy after work, and then stops off to pick up a loaf of bread. He then walks over to the dairy section to pick up some cheese for his lunches. Jimmy never buys milk, but today he has a sudden urge to get some. He walks over to the milk refrigerators and looks at all the options. He is currently debating between two brands, Luchene and Jean's. While trying to decide, he notices a sticker on the Luchene gallon that says \\"organic,\\" but is unable to find any such indication on the gallon of Jean's milk. After asking an employee, it is confirmed that Jean's is not organic milk. Unable to make up his mind, Jimmy simply leaves without buying any milk.  Which brand requires more cows to produce the same amount of milk? The answer to this question is:","output":"The organic brand, Luchene, would likely require more cows to produce the same amount of milk as the conventional brand, Jean's. This is mainly because organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds and the increased use of roughage."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Five.  for the following movie plot:  Su Can (Vincent Zhao) is a general who leads a military force to save a prince from a large fortress of enemies in the mountains.

Su's father informs them that Yuan is returning from the military to be a governor. He warns Su that Yuan may not have come back simply to reconcile with family but to seek revenge. This is because years ago, Su's father killed Yuan's father when the latter went too far in learning a evil martial arts technique called the Five Venom Fists. Su's father then took Yuan in, but he harbors concern that Yuan is still vengeful. Su is naive and assures his father that everything will be alright.When Yuan returns, a homecoming party is held. Yuan greets his sister Ying, Feng, and Su's father. Su's father knows what is impending and asks Yuan to take his revenge on him alone, sparing Su and his family. Using his mastery of the Five Venom Fists, Yuan kills Su's father and decapitates him. He expresses his desire to be with his sister (Ying) and her son Feng as a family. When Su hears the news of his father's murder, he rushes to the scene of his father's death and is attacked by the Iron Twins. He chases them to a rapid where Yuan is offering Su's father's head to his real father as a symbol of revenge taken. A battle ensues between Yuan and Su.

Question: ACME Triple-Strength Fortified Leg Muscle Vitamins? Movie plot title: Stop! Look! And Hasten! Movie plot: A famished Wile E. Coyote, (Eatibus Anythingus), trudges across the floor of the desert, catching anything that he can find, from a fly to an empty tin can, with the intention of eating it. Suddenly, he is flattened by the Road Runner, (Hot-roddicus Supersonicus). Wile recovers, blinks his eyes, and has a vision of a wonderful Road Runner feast. He then ditches the tin can and chases after the Road Runner, adopting a low stance to reduce his drag which allows him to close in on the Road Runner, but the bird finds another gear and rockets away, leaving the coyote's eyes to pop out of his sockets. Dejected, he plans his next scheme.Wile sets up a pulley, rope and rock trap to try smashing the passing Road Runner, hoping its extra complexity will stop Wile from being squashed, but the rock finds a way to squash the coyote as the Road Runner stops to mock him.A furious Wile arms himself with a lasso as he waits for the Road Runner, but a truck trips the lasso before the bird can get there, and drags Wile across the hard ground. As the coyote paces off the road, we see that the friction has left Wile with a bare rear end.Wile then uses a How-To book to build a Burmese tiger trap. He digs a square pit in the road and fills it with a sheet camouflaged as a road. As he hides behind a nearby rock, he hears the Road Runner go \\"beep beep\\", followed by the sound of the trap being activated.

At home, Andrew had his father book a doctor's appointment for headaches he's been having. During the scene, the father tells a lie but takes it back, and says he does not know why he lied.The morning after the party, Andrew proceeds to his doctor's appointment, meeting in the waiting room a girl named Sam, a pathological liar. She will later explain that most times she does not know why she lies, it's like a tic; but still one can trust her to admit her lies.

Please answer the following question: Eating less food at night time is sensible advice for someone trying to lose weight. The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we’re inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn’t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‘normal’ evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants’ diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is the most probable reason why the participants decided to join the trails? Options:  A. not enough information  B. to stop eating at night  C. to attempt to lose weight  D. to be able to eat more during the day A:","output":"A. not enough information"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: When we can see well, we do not think about our eyes often: It is only when we cannot see perfectly that we come to see how important our eyes are. People who are nearsighted  can only see things that are very close to their eyes. Many people who do a lot of close work, such as writing and reading, become nearsighted. Then they have to wear glasses in order to see distant things clearly. People who are farsighted face just the opposite problem. They can see things that are far away, but they have difficulty reading a book if they don't hold it at arm's length. If they want to do much reading, they must get glasses too. Other people do not see clearly because their eyes are not exactly the right shape. This, too, can be corrected by glasses. Some people's eyes become cloudy because of cataracts  . Long ago these people often became blind. Now, however, it is possible to operate on the cataracts and remove them. When night falls, colors become fainter  to the eyes and finally disappear. After your eyes have grown used to the dark, you can see better if you use the side of your eyes rather than the centers. Sometimes, after dark, you see a small thing to one side of you. It seems to disappear if you turn your head in its direction. This is because when you turn your head, you are looking at the thing too directly. Men on guard duty sometimes think they see something moving to one side of them. When they turn to look straight at it, they cannot see it anymore, and they believe they were mistaken. However, this mistake happens because the center of the eye, which is very sensitive   in daylight, is not as sensitive as the sides of the eye after dark, Question: To see a small thing at night, we need to look   _  .

Mean-spirited, ugly, nasty retro-action thriller, about a bodyguard who is determined to find (and destroy!), the killers of the girl he was supposed to protect. This film is almost an anachronism in today's politically correct atmosphere. Director Scott doesn't have any desire to apologize for the inherently immorality behind the film's dramatic structure. Scott is either not aware or doesn't care for 30 years of social advances. I really don't think we will see a more violent film any time soon, so you better go and see this one while you can.

That's what scientists led by the University of Aberdeen conclude after observing how mice shed extra weight. In a Molecular Metabolism study, pointed out by the Telegraph and Daily Record, researchers explain how male mice with increased appetite and reduced physical activity were able to shed extra weight with obesity medication. However, the same medication failed to show much transformation in female mice. \\"What we have discovered is that the part of the brain that has a significant influence on how we use the calories that we eat is wired differently in males and females,\\" researcher Lora Heisler explains in a release. Brain hormones called POMC peptides help regulate appetite, physical activity, energy expenditure, and body weight. Male mice who took obesity medication meant to boost the production of POMC peptides enjoyed reduced appetite, as well as increased energy expenditure and physical activity. But female mice saw only their appetite affected. Since most obesity medications in the US target the POMC neurons, researchers say women aren't fully benefiting from treatment. \\"Currently there is no difference in how obesity is treated in men and women,\\" yet the female obesity rate is double that of men in some parts of the world, Heisler notes. She adds the study could change how doctors tackle obesity and lead to \\"new sex-specific medications.\\" (One possible treatment: freeze-dried poop.)

Paragraph: Born in Moscow, Pushkin published his first poem at the age of fifteen. By the time he finished school as part of the first graduating class of the prestigious Imperial Lyceum in Tsarskoe Selo near Saint Petersburg, his talent was already widely recognized within the Russian literary scene. After school, Pushkin plunged into the vibrant and raucous intellectual youth culture of the capital, Saint Petersburg. In 1820 he published his first long poem, Ruslan and Lyudmila, amidst much controversy about its subject and style. Pushkin gradually became committed to social reform and emerged as a spokesman for literary radicals. This angered the government, and led to his transfer from the capital (1820).

While he is shooting, shy student Sam Merrick picks up the camera to take a look. Defensive and angry, George beats Sam up. Sam confides in both his protective older brother Rocky and his budding girlfriend, Millie, who urges Sam to take a higher road.Sam's older brother Rocky confides in his friends, Clyde and Marty, who are also familiar with George's reputation as a bully (he previously mocked Clyde for having two gay dads). While they agree that they need to stand up for Sam, they have different approaches. Clyde, who is sensitive and a bit of an outsider himself within the group, is more sympathetic and passive. Marty, who has issues with anger and trauma stemming from his father's suicide, his mother's apathy and his older brother's abuse, favors a more righteous form of revenge.Eventually, they hatch a plan with Sam to invite George on a fake birthday party for Sam, which George all-too eagerly accepts. They plan to drive to a local creek where they will spend the afternoon on a boat and, in an orchestrated game of Truth or Dare, get George to strip his clothes and jump in the lake, leading him to hitch a ride home in the nude.When the gang consisting of Sam, Rocky, Marty, Clyde and Millie (who is not yet aware of the plan) arrive at George's house, he is working on his video diary for the day. He leaves without telling his mother where he will be, and gives Sam a present a large, high-end water gun. They run into Marty's obnoxious older brother at a convenience store on the way.Throughout the drive and the journey to the boat it becomes clear that George, while annoying and occasionally harsh, is truly desperate to fit in and resorts to aggression as a cover-up. He also admits to having a learning disability, which he hopes to be accepted for. En route to the boat, Sam tells Millie about the plan.

Movie plot: Los Angeles is being terrorized by a masked serial killer whose modus operandi is to break into stores after hours, murder the workers, and take the surveillance tapes so he can use them to relive his crimes. At Steve's liquor store (the main door to which has been boarded up due to an incident with a homeless man) the employees, customers, and a deliveryman named Morty discuss the killer, the 500,000 being offered as a reward for his capture, and how they would kill him, the mentioned methods being eye gouging, exsanguination in plastic wrap, sawing, and decapitation. After the store closes, Steve has a clerk named Donny, and two regulars (a prostitute named Jess, and a phone sex worker named Mona) stay to play cards in the upstairs apartment as a means of keeping Steve's nephew Jimmy (an addict going through drug withdrawal) occupied. Unbeknownst to the quintet, the Convenience Store Killer has chosen them as his next victims, cutting the homeless man (who resides in a nearby alley) in half before sneaking into the building. When Mona goes downstairs to look for the source of strange noises, the Convenience Store Killer stabs her in the eyes with cornettos, and hides her body in a freezer.

Summarize this article: Photographed by Annie Leibovitz      » SEE THE SLIDESHOW «      Michelle Williams owns a series of photographs by her friend Dan Estabrook, titled Nine Symptoms, that depicts, in the style of a Surrealist Victorian medical textbook, the physical manifestations of falling in love: shortness of breath, heart-rate increase, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, weakness, fever, chills, delirium, and euphoria. On a sultry Saturday night in July, I find myself experiencing at least six of them as I ring the doorbell to Estabrook’s Brooklyn brownstone, where I am about to meet Williams for the first time. She’s invited me for a picnic dinner in the backyard, on loan for the evening, to talk about her latest project, My Week with Marilyn, in which she brings to life the doomed star whom Norman Mailer once called “the sweet angel of sex.” So I’ve put on my favorite shirt (a checked seersucker number), combed my hair, and brought along two bottles of chilled rosé, which, like me, are beaded with perspiration.      Suddenly there is a slight, luminously beautiful girl with very short, very blonde hair, a vintage flowered sleeveless dress, and bare feet. “Hi,” she says, smiling. “I’m Michelle.” A few minutes later, we’re sitting in a brick wall–enclosed garden, talking over glasses of wine in the muggy twilight. It could be a scene out of a bohemian Brooklyn remake of The Seven Year Itch, the Billy Wilder classic featuring Marilyn Monroe at her most luscious as a model who bedazzles a married man during a New York heat wave.      Click here to see a slideshow of Michelle Williams's best red carpet moments.      On-screen, Williams often exudes a bruised, wary fragility, whether as a betrayed wife in Brokeback Mountain or a young mother watching her marriage crumble in Blue Valentine. Here, though one can still detect a faint undercurrent of melancholy, she is bright and animated, quick to laugh. She gestures with small, slim, expressive hands as the conversation ranges from her affinity for dresses from the 1930s and long-discontinued Eberhard Faber Blackwing 602 pencils (“I love things that are old and beautiful and tell a story, even if it’s a sad one”) to the novels of Vladimir Nabokov, whose notoriously complex Ada is a favorite. “I think Nabokov once said that genius is finding the invisible link between things,” she tells me. “And that’s how I choose to see life. Everything’s connected, and everything has meaning if you look for it.”      Williams has been described as guarded in interviews, but her mood now seems relaxed and open. “I feel like something has changed for me, but it’s a new change, so it’s going to be hard for me to describe,” she says. “Maybe it has something to do with turning 30. I don’t feel as shy or nervous or self-conscious. I have more confidence that I can handle what life brings me. I don’t feel scared to have an idea and express it.” She adds, “I feel giddy about it because it’s a complete transformation. It’s like I’ve found my voice.”      With My Week with Marilyn, she’s also just come off a role that required the biggest transformation of her career. The idea of playing such an iconic figure was daunting. “As soon as I finished the script, I knew that I wanted to do it, and then I spent six months trying to talk myself out of it,” she says. “But I always knew that I never really had a choice.” And, she adds, “I’ve started to believe that you get the piece of material that you were ready for.”      Click here to read our October 2009 profile of Michelle Williams in Vogue.      Williams, who was born in Montana but raised in San Diego, grew up with pictures of Monroe on her bedroom wall. “I had one of her in a field of trees in Roxbury, Connecticut. She’s wearing a white dress and she’s barefoot and she’s got her arms spread and she’s laughing. There was just something about that image of her—so lovely and joyful and free. I’ve always thought of her as that woman-child, not an icon, which is probably why I let myself approach the role.”      As an icon, of course, Monroe continues to loom over our cultural landscape (her unforgettable billowing dress from The Seven Year Itch just sold at auction for 4.6 million), and the unhappy trajectory of her short life—from the traumatic childhood to the broken marriages to the pill overdose at 36—has become a kind of American myth. “Everybody has their own idea of who Marilyn was and what she means to them,” Williams says. “But I think that if you go a little bit deeper, you’re going to be surprised by what you find there.”      Based on a pair of slim memoirs by the late documentary filmmaker Colin Clark (son of Sir Kenneth), My Week with Marilyn chronicles the turbulent story behind the shooting of The Prince and the Showgirl, the 1957 comedy in which Monroe starred opposite Sir Laurence Olivier (played here by Kenneth Branagh with rueful élan), who was also its director. The promising collaboration between England’s greatest actor, who hopes to become a Hollywood movie star, and America’s blonde bombshell, who wants to be taken seriously as an actress, quickly devolves into a clash between an autocratic director and a woman constitutionally unable to show up on time, learn her lines, or come out of her dressing room without an entourage that quells her emotional storms with pills, booze, and flattery. As Colin, a 23-year-old gofer on the set, played with offbeat, bright-eyed fervor by Eddie Redmayne, tells Monroe, “This film won’t help either of you.”      It is Colin’s brief encounter with Monroe as her confidant, protector, and almost lover that gives My Week with Marilyn its tender heart. Dougray Scott stars as Monroe’s aloof husband, Arthur Miller; Dominic Cooper as her anxious business partner Milton Greene; and Zoë Wanamaker as her Svengali-like acting coach Paula Strasberg; there are stylish cameos by Simon Russell Beale, Sir Derek Jacobi, and, as Dame Sybil Thorndike, Dame Judi Dench.      If the film never quite achieves the high drama and urgency of a period piece like The King’s Speech, it does glowingly evoke a vanished era in filmmaking. But the main attraction is Williams, who brings Monroe to life with heartbreaking delicacy and precision without resorting to impersonation or cliché. It’s not hard to see why the film’s director, Simon Curtis, wanted her. “Not only is she beautiful and brilliant,” he tells me, “but she brings such intellect to her work along with an intuitive grasp of character, extraordinary depth of feeling, and a kind of innate glamour—I guess we call it star quality, don’t we? For a director, it’s the dream package.” Curtis recalls their first meeting at her house in upstate New York. “It was a wonderful, almost magical day,” he says. “And I thought, My God, I pray she wants to do the part, because I can’t imagine making it without her. We stopped somewhere on the way to dropping me off at the bus back to the city, and a fan asked for her autograph. Then the fan turned to me and said, ‘Is this your father?’ That brought me back down to earth instantly.”      Williams spent six months immersing herself in all things Monroe. She read biographies, diaries, letters, poems, and notes, pored over photographs, listened to recordings, watched movies, and tracked down obscure clips on YouTube. “I’d go to bed every night with a stack of books next to me,” she recalls. “And I’d fall asleep to movies of her. It was like when you were a kid and you’d put a book under your pillow hoping you’d get it by osmosis.”      Her turn from indie waif to Hollywood sex goddess involved working with a choreographer to perfect Monroe’s walk and gaining weight to approximate her curves. “Unfortunately, it went right to my face,” she says, puffing up her cheeks to illustrate. “So at some point it became a question of, Do I want my face to look like Marilyn Monroe’s or my hips?” (She opted for the former and filled out the latter with foam padding.) In the end, she says, “it felt like being reborn. It felt like breaking my body and remaking it in her image, learning how she walked and talked and held her head. None of that existed in my physical memory, and I knew I needed as much time as possible to make it part of me.”      Williams may have become a star as a blonde teen siren on Dawson’s Creek, but since then, despite plenty of on-screen nudity and some graphic scenes, she has studiously avoided trading on her sex appeal. She cites a story that Monroe used to tell about walking down the beach in a bikini as a teenager and suddenly feeling the whole world open up to her. “Any messages that I got as a child about what it is to have a woman’s body or to be sexual were all negative—that people wouldn’t take you seriously or that they would take advantage of you,” she says. “So I couldn’t relate to that at all.” But surely she took some vicarious pleasure slipping into Jill Taylor’s lush period costumes? “The expectation to be beautiful always makes me feel ugly because I feel like I can’t live up to it,” she says. “But I do remember one moment of being all suited up as Marilyn and walking from my dressing room onto the soundstage practicing my wiggle. There were three or four men gathered around a truck, and I remember seeing that they were watching me come and feeling that they were watching me go—and for the very first time I glimpsed some idea of the pleasure I could take in that kind of attention; not their pleasure but my pleasure. And I thought, Oh, maybe Marilyn felt that when she walked down the beach.”      Her costars were in awe of her daily metamorphosis. Branagh, who passed the time getting into makeup by listening on headphones to Olivier reading the Bible, says, “I’d look over and there is Michelle. Half an hour later, Marilyn has arrived but is a bit sleepy. Half an hour later, I look round and Marilyn is now very frisky. And finally, just before we’re due to be called, Marilyn is fully there—the dress is on, the hair is in place, there’s a glint in the eye.”      Williams’s transformation is all the more remarkable because she disappears into it so completely, managing to capture the essence of a glamorous, mercurial creature with the simple, unadorned truthfulness that is the hallmark of her acting. She is as captivating gazing forlornly into a dressing-room mirror as she is re-creating Monroe’s famously winsome dance routine from the original film. Williams has always had an astonishing gift for revealing the inner lives of her characters in unguarded moments (watch her near-solitary performance in Kelly Reichardt’s 2008 indie feature Wendy and Lucy). Here she brings it to the portrayal of a woman who lived through the gaze of others. “Someone once said that Marilyn spent her whole life looking for a missing person—herself. And so she cobbled together what people thought, felt, saw, and projected onto her and made a person out of it. She had no calm center inside herself that she could come home to and rest.”      Williams’s working home during the shoot was Pinewood Studios, where The Prince and the Showgirl was filmed, and Parkside House, where the newly wed Monroe and Miller spent a tempestuous four months. But more than the physical setting, “it was a very moody, needy, desperate, insecure place that I was in playing Marilyn,” she says. One can’t help thinking, given her personal experiences, that it must have been particularly wrenching to play a scene in which Monroe appears to have overdosed on pills, prefiguring her death six years later. Whatever her struggles, Williams apparently didn’t alienate her all-English costars the way Monroe did. “She brought that very American spirit of play to a British set,” recalls Redmayne, “charming us completely and making us step out of our comfort zones.”      Redmayne recalls with particular fondness shooting a sequence in which his character and Monroe escape for an idyll in the English countryside—skinny-dipping in a lake, sharing a kiss, visiting Eton and causing a small riot among the students. “I happen to have gone to Eton,” Redmayne says. “So it was very weird returning and walking around with Michelle Williams looking like Marilyn Monroe. The boys were so excited to see Michelle—the hormones were really flying—and she was flirting with them, signing autographs, blowing kisses, and sort of loving it. There wasn’t too much acting needed.”      As Williams recalls, “It was lovely to connect with that happy, free Marilyn I knew as a little girl.”            In the days after our alfresco dinner, Williams and I exchange e-mails about where we should go to continue the conversation. I suggest Far Rockaway, a longtime mecca of surfing, sunbathing, and seaside frolic near Kennedy Airport that has lately become a destination for food-obsessed hipsters. Williams seems up for the idea, writing, “It sounds like an adventure and I need one.”      On a bright and sweltering Sunday, I meet Williams at the three-story brownstone in Boerum Hill where she lives with her daughter, Matilda. Reminders of Heath Ledger, from whom Williams was separated when he died in 2008, are everywhere—in family photos, in the oversize stuffed animals that he bought for Matilda, in the large, brooding mountainscape by the Australian photographer Bill Henson that hangs in the living room. The most vivid reminder, of course, is Matilda herself, a spirited, sunny six-year-old whose face, a felicitous mix of both her parents, lights up when Williams walks into the room. “Supermommy!” she shouts, running to throw her arms around her mother’s waist. “Hiya, Superdaughter,” Williams says, kneeling down to kiss her forehead.      Williams tells me that they split their time between their place in the country and Brooklyn, where, she says, “I wanted her to have the warmth and bustle and security of family.” Out on the ivy-covered terrace, I’m introduced to said clan—Williams’s younger sister, Paige, and her husband, Zach, and their friends Jeremy and Lauren, all of whom live in the house, and Williams’s half-sister Kelley, who is visiting with her five-year-old son, Evan—and I get recruited to shoot a group portrait. Before we leave, Matilda proudly shows me two new teeth. She giggles when I tell her that they’re the most grown-up-looking grown-up teeth that I’ve ever seen. Out on the sidewalk, Williams says, “Is there anything better than making a kid laugh?”            On the A train to Rockaway, we compare iPhone music playlists (on hers: soul, R&B, and her daughter’s current favorite, Stevie Wonder) and discuss which artistic heroes of one’s youth it’s still OK to like (yes: Diane Arbus and J. D. Salinger; no: Hermann Hesse). No one on the crowded train takes much notice of Williams, who’s dressed for the occasion in a vintage red sundress and pale-pink ballet flats.      At the beach, we stroll along the hot, teeming boardwalk among throngs of cool kids eating locally sourced tacos. Williams puts on a pair of large black Ray-Bans—and not just because it’s sunny. She gamely jokes that she’d imagined a scene “more like Coney Island in the winter, or something out of Stardust Memories, with a dilapidated boardwalk and deserted beach.” Suddenly, she seems vulnerable. I think of a sequence from My Week with Marilyn in which the screen goddess’s attempt to go shopping in London sparks a near riot of hysterical fans, ending with Williams as Monroe staring sadly out a limousine window behind a pair of dark glasses. Nothing like that happens here. But after years of having her personal space breached by strangers, most of them with cameras, Williams can be forgiven a certain skittishness in crowds. “You feel like you’re in the zoo,” she says matter-of-factly.      While she understands that it comes with the territory, Williams hates seeing her daughter subjected to the same relentless invasion of privacy. “That’s what seems the most rotten thing about it to me,” she says. “And I’m going to do everything in my power to make her feel safe and protected, and to extend her childhood for as long as possible.”      The hurricane of grief that came with Ledger’s death seems to have finally passed. “Three years ago, it felt like we didn’t have anything, and now my life—our life—has kind of repaired itself,” Williams tells me later that evening over dinner in Brooklyn. “Look, it’s not a perfectly operating system—there are holes and dips and electrical storms—but the basics are intact.” Still, she says, in a fundamental way nothing will ever be the same: “It’s changed how I see the world and how I interact on a daily basis. It’s changed the parent I am. It’s changed the friend I am. It’s changed the kind of work that I really want to do. It’s become the lens through which I see life—that it’s all impermanent.”      Williams shuts her eyes, then opens them again and says, “For a really long time, I couldn’t stop touching people’s faces. I was like, ‘Look at you! You move! You’re here!’ It all just seemed so fleeting, and I wanted to hold on to it.”            My Week with Marilyn opens at the New York Film Festival this month, but Williams is already back at work, playing another iconic blonde—in this case, Glinda in Sam Raimi’s big-budget Oz: The Great and Powerful, which is shooting in Detroit. Her costars include James Franco as a con man from Kansas who becomes the great wizard of the title, and Rachel Weisz and Mila Kunis as Glinda’s spell-casting frenemies. Williams describes the state of mind in which she usually starts a film by pretending to claw her face and moaning, “Uuuuuurgh!” But this time it’s different. “I think I’d forgotten somewhere along the line that work could be fun, and this is really fun,” she says. “And it’s much nicer to exist in the space of a good witch who grants wishes and tries to help people than in the space of a human mess, like pretty much all the characters I play.”      Williams is obviously hardworking—she’s made 25 movies in the last ten years, and she’s about to come out opposite Seth Rogen in Sarah Polley’s Take This Waltz, a mournfully comic look at a couple whose marriage is in crisis. But she’s not, she says, particularly ambitious, and she recently told herself, “It’s time to quit or take on the classics.” Lo and behold, one of her idols, an actress turned director whose memoir Williams had been carrying around with her wherever she went, offered her a role in an upcoming film adaptation of a nineteenth-century stage classic. Williams asked me not to reveal any more than that, because nothing’s been finalized and, she says, “it’s just too precious to me.” But let’s simply say that of all the movies she’s made about relationships that end badly, this one turns out the worst.      Williams speculates that she may be drawn to stories about the vicissitudes of romantic love because “relationships have always seemed very mysterious, and therefore worth exploring. I’m single, so it’s still kind of a mystery—a worthwhile mystery, one that I want to be on the scent of.” She confesses that she misses having a guy around when it’s time to haul wood at her house upstate. But, unlike Monroe, she doesn’t define herself through the men in her life: “I’m not lonely, and I think that has a lot to do with what’s on my bedside table rather than what’s in my bed.”      In the meantime, Williams hasn’t entirely let go of Marilyn. Not long after our trip to Rockaway, she invites me to go with her to Feinstein’s, an old-school supper club in the Regency Hotel, to hear a jazz singer named Rebecca Kilgore perform songs made famous by Monroe. Williams sways her shoulders in time to such numbers as “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend” and “Every Baby Needs a Da-Da-Daddy.” Afterward, we stop for a drink at a bar in the East Fifties that Williams likes because it evokes the New York of another era, complete with a corny piano player, tin ceilings, and walls lined with faded photographs of long-dead personalities. We’re seated at a table near the back of the room beneath, as it happens, a photo of Joe DiMaggio, Monroe’s second husband. “I wish that I could play her for the rest of my life,” Williams says. “Because when can you say that you’ve really solved the riddle? When can you say that you really know her?”      One of the riddles Williams still hasn’t solved is how a creature filled with so much life and joy could also be filled with so much misery and pain. “Her deepest desire was to be taken seriously as an actress, but she doesn’t really shine in her serious roles,” she tells me. “Where she happens to shine is in comedy and in song and dance, but she denied that. She essentially said, ‘It’s not what I’m good at.’ She didn’t know it, but she clearly was incandescent.” ||||| I've been a fan of Michelle Williams ever since she was bad-girl Jen Lindley on Dawson's Creek. Now at 31, she's one of Hollywood's brightest stars. Nominated for two Oscars (Brokeback Mountain and Blue Valentine), her latest role will be as Marilyn Monroe in the upcoming film My Week With Marilyn, which opens November 4. Williams graces the cover of Vogue's October issue and talks about her decision to play the icon, her family, what it was like to lose Heath Ledger, and what getting back in the dating pool has been like.      And, uh, she sounds, uh, kinda perfect. She's come a long way since Capeside.      Williams just comes across like a well-balanced, happy, working mom who wants to do great work, raise a healthy, gleeful daughter, and learn from the lessons life has dealt her. I don't know, there was something really refreshing about her interview, something zen, that you don't usually read about in celebrity sit-downs. There's usually a defensiveness you can pick up when a star gets asked questions by a journalist, but I didn't detect any of that with Michelle. Did I mention that I love her?      Totally can't wait to see her new movie. It's about the week Marilyn spent with Laurence Olivier while filming The Prince and the Showgirl in 1957.

A man is wearing a headset and an apron. 2. The man is filling up a cup with a beverage. The man wearing a headset and an apron may imply that he is in a service-oriented role or at a job that requires some form of interaction with customers, perhaps taking orders or providing information. The headset, in particular, suggests that he may be involved in an occupation that requires hands-free communication, which is commonly found in various drive-thru establishments, including fast food restaurants. The fact that he is filling up a cup with a beverage could indicate that he’s fulfilling a customer's order. However, the statement does not specify the exact location or establishment where the man is working. While it could be possible that the man is working at a Wendy's drive-thru, he could also be working at any other fast food restaurant, coffee shop, or a drive-thru service in a completely different industry. The information provided is not exclusive to Wendy's and, therefore, it would be speculative to assume that the man is working at a Wendy's drive-thru. In conclusion, although the given statement provides some insight into the man's role and the environment he might be in, it doesn't offer enough precise information to draw a definitive connection to Wendy's or any other specific establishment.

Ann learns her favorite playwright, Jack Driscoll, is the screenwriter. As their tramp steamer, the SS Venture, journeys to the mysterious Skull Island, Ann and Jack fall in love. The people on the ship consist of Englehorn the captain and his crew, including Hayes, a World War One veteran, Lumpy the cook, Choy the janitor, and the Venture's lookout Jimmy. Captain Englehorn has second thoughts about the voyage, prompted by Lumpy and Hayes' speculation of trouble ahead. Deep in the southern waters, the Venture receives a radio message informing Englehorn there is a warrant for Carl's arrest due to his defiance of the studio's orders to cease production. The message instructs Englehorn to divert to Rangoon, but the ship becomes lost in fog and runs aground on the rocky shore of Skull Island.

The reviewer shares a personal experience of purchasing the item as a Christmas gift for their father, indicating that they thought it would be a suitable and thoughtful present. The fact that the father already has a St. Christopher medal for his truck suggests that he values these types of items, and the reviewer believed that a motorcycle-specific medal might be appreciated as well.

Even in modern democracies, Freemasonry is sometimes viewed with distrust. In the UK, Masons working in the justice system, such as judges and police officers, were from 1999 to 2009 required to disclose their membership. While a parliamentary inquiry found that there has been no evidence of wrongdoing, it was felt that any potential loyalties Masons might have, based on their vows to support fellow Masons, should be transparent to the public. The policy of requiring a declaration of masonic membership of applicants for judicial office (judges and magistrates) was ended in 2009 by Justice Secretary Jack Straw (who had initiated the requirement in the 1990s).

The ready-made arose from a joint consideration that the work itself is considered an object (just as a painting), and that it uses the material detritus of the world (as collage and papier collé in the Cubist construction and Assemblage). The next logical step, for Duchamp, was to present an ordinary object as a self-sufficient work of art representing only itself.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write some highlights for the following article: It all started with Madonna -- the original Madonna -- and the 16th-century Italian artists who paid tribute to her with chalk and pastel artwork they drew directly on the street. Madonnari, as the artists came to be called, made a living traveling from town to town and collecting coins from people who admired their work. It was the visual arts equivalent of busking, and the tradition continued until World War II, when, for obvious reasons, it became impractical to sit in the middle of a street and create art. After the war, the art of the Madonnari languished, but before it could die out completely, a group in the city of Curtatone, Italy, decided to revive it. The first I Madonnari festival in Curtatone, in the province of Mantova (Mantua), was held in 1973, with some of the prewar Madonnari among the participating artists. And that was the catalyst for a new generation of \\"street painters\\" who travel from city to city, and festival to festival, creating chalk artwork that hardly lasts longer than the handful of days required to make them. Discover the world's most visited museums. Typically, a chalk art or \\"street painting\\" festival has separate categories for \\"copyists,\\" who reproduce famous paintings; \\"free artists,\\" who create original two-dimensional works; and 3-D artists, whose work may be realistic or fantastical. Many festivals also make room for children, teens and amateurs. The wonder of these works of art is the way they materialize before the eyes of the onlookers. \\"First, there was nothing,\\" said Denise Kowal, founder of the Sarasota Chalk Festival, which will take place in November. \\"Now, there is this art. And you watched it happen.\\" In truth, the art does not spring into existence overnight. It is carefully planned by the artists, who arrive with preliminary sketches and paintings that they will turn into large-scale pieces. Where they work is also carefully planned by the festival organizers, who provide them with precisely measured spaces in which to create their work. Even the pavement is a consideration, as every patch and crack makes a difference when the asphalt is your canvas. \\"The quality of the street determines the clarity of detail in the work,\\" Kowal said. Here are some of the world's top chalk art festivals that prove where the sidewalk ends, the art begins. Victoria International Chalk Art Festival, Victoria, British Columbia. September 14 and 15. Now in its second year, this festival was inspired by local chalk artist Ian Morris, who has plied his trade on Government Street in Victoria for more than a decade. He will be joined by a roster of international artists including Dutch artist Leon Keer, renowned for his 3-D surrealist chalk art; California artists Lori Escalera and Joel Yau; Oregon artist Cathy Gallatin; and Toronto-based artist Jo Lalonde, better known as the \\"Chalk Chick.\\" Festival Bella Via, Monterrey, Mexico. October 11 to 13. Italy might have given birth to the Madonnari, but Mexico's tradition of street painting/chalk art is just as strong. \\"Some people don't go to museums, so we make public spaces a place for creativity and art,\\" said Rosy Loyola, the festival's director. Equally important is the festival's commitment to fostering young artists. Among standouts to watch for are Veronica Violeta GonzÃ¡lez Garza, Carlos Enrique Robledo Moreno, Margarita Botello and Omar Saenz. Parque Mirador Asta Bandera will be the venue when this festival celebrates its 10th anniversary this fall. Sarasota Chalk Festival, Sarasota, Florida. November 13 to 18. Since its inception in 2007, the Sarasota Chalk Festival has expanded in size and scope. (This year, it will add two more blocks around Burns Square.) It has also expanded the definition of what chalk art is and can be. So, for example, the \\"Going Vertical\\" segment of the event incorporates walls and buildings in addition to pavement art. You can also expect to see the world's top 3-D chalk artists, such as Tracy Lee Stum and Kurt Wenner, who is credited with inventing the 3-D form.

I call my story the story of a bad boy, partly to distinguish myself from those faultless young gentlemen, and partly because I really was not an angle. I may truthfully say I was a friendly, impulsive teenager. I didn't want to be an angel. In short, I was a real human boy, such as you may meet anywhere in New England. Whenever a new scholar came to our school, I used to ask him \\" My name's Tom Bailey; what's your name?\\" If the name struck me favorably, I shook hands with the new pupil _ , but if it didn't, I would turn and walk away, for I was particular on this point. I was born in Rivermouth almost fifty years ago, but, before I became very well acquainted with that pretty New England town, my parents moved to New Orleans. I was only eighteen months old at the time of the move, and it didn't make much difference to me where I was, because several years later, when my father proposed to take me North to be educated, I had my own view on the subject. I instantly kicked over the little boy, Sam, who happened to be standing by me at the moment, and declared that I would not be taken away to live among a lot of Yankees! You see I was what is called \\" a Northern man with Southern principles,\\" I had no recollection of New England: my earliest memories were connected with the South. I knew I was born in the North, but hoped nobody would find it out. I never told my schoolmates I was a Yankee, because they talked about Yankees in a scornful way which made me feel that it was quite a shame not to be born in the South. And this impression was strengthened by Aunt Chloe, who said, \\"There wasn't no gentlemen in the North no way.\\" With this picture of Northern civilization in my eye, the readers will easily understand my terror at the bare thought of being transported to Rivermouth to school, and possibly will forgive me for kicking over little Sam, when my father announced this to me. As for kicking little Sam, I always did that, more or less gently, when anything went wrong with me. My father was greatly troubled by... Tom Bailey's feeling on moving to Rivermouth can best be described as   _  .

With its origins in traditional American style of wrestling and still being under the same genre, it has become an entity in itself. Despite the similarity to its American counterpart in that the outcome of the matches remains predetermined, the phenomena are different in the form of the psychology and presentation of the sport; it is treated as a full contact combat sport as it mixes hard hitting martial arts strikes with shoot style submission holds, while in the U.S. it is rather more regarded as an entertainment show. Wrestlers incorporate kicks and strikes from martial arts disciplines, and a strong emphasis is placed on submission wrestling, and unlike the use of involved storylines in the U.S., they are not as intricate in Japan, more emphasis is placed on the concept of Fighting Spirit, meaning the Wrestlers display of physical and mental stamina are valued a lot more than theatrics. Many of Japan's wrestlers including top stars such as Shinya Hashimoto, Riki Choshu and Keiji Mutoh came from a legitimate martial arts background and many Japanese wrestlers in the 1990s began to pursue careers in mixed martial arts organizations such as Pancrase and Shooto which at the time retained the original look of puroresu, but were actual competitions.

Question: Information:  - The Duchy of Normandy grew out of the 911 Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte between King Charles III of West Francia and Rollo, leader of the Vikings. From 1066 until 1204 it was held by the kings of England, except for the brief rule of Robert Curthose (10871106) and Geoffrey Plantagenet (11441150). Normandy was declared forfeit by Philip II of France in 1202, and seized by force of arms in 1204. It remained disputed territory until the Treaty of Paris of 1259, when the English sovereigns ceded their claim, except for the Channel Islands.  - Normandy (pronounced , Norman: \\"Normaundie\\", from Old French \\"Normanz\\", plural of \\"Normant\\", originally from the word for \\"northman\\" in several Scandinavian languages) is one of the regions of France, roughly corresponding to the historical Duchy of Normandy.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.

William is a doctor.. b). Benjamin is a doctor..","output":"a). William is a doctor. Dr. William Stevens was a brilliant and seasoned physician who specialized in gastroenterology at St. Mary's Hospital. Over the course of his career, William had built a reputation for being a skilled diagnostician, with an unmatched ability to empathize with his patients. He was known for going above and beyond the call of duty to ensure that his patients received the very best care possible. Benjamin Thompson, a 42-year-old software engineer, had been experiencing acute abdominal pain and discomfort for several weeks. After a thorough examination and consultation with his primary care physician, Benjamin had been urgently referred to Dr. William Stevens. Benjamin's symptoms, coupled with his family history of gastric ulcers, led the primary care physician to believe that he may have a severe case requiring specialized attention. Upon reviewing Benjamin's medical file, Dr. Stevens came to agree with the assessment of the referring physician. He ordered some tests to be run immediately, including an endoscopy. The results confirmed that Benjamin did, indeed, have multiple severe ulcers in his stomach and duodenum. With this diagnosis in hand, Dr. Stevens wasted no time in beginning Benjamin's treatment. The first step in the aggressive course of action that Dr. Stevens devised was an intravenous proton pump inhibitor. This medication would help to reduce the amount of stomach acid that was being produced, giving Benjamin's ulcers a chance to begin healing. Dr. Stevens also prescribed oral medications to further decrease the corrosive effects of the stomach acid and to alleviate the constant, gnawing pain that Benjamin was experiencing. During all of this, Dr. Stevens was visiting Benjamin every day to monitor his progress and adjust the treatment based on a variety of factors. He wanted to ensure that Benjamin was as comfortable as possible during the healing process. As the days passed, Benjamin began to feel better. The numerous medications that Dr. Stevens had prescribed were starting to take effect, and the pain in his abdomen was beginning to subside. The IV line that had been inserted into Benjamin's arm to deliver the proton pump inhibitor had become much less daunting as he grew more accustomed to it. However, Dr. Stevens knew that even though Benjamin was starting to feel better, his treatment was far from over. It was crucial to identify and eliminate the root cause of the ulcers to prevent their recurrence. After thoroughly reviewing his patient's medical history, diet, and lifestyle habits, Dr. Stevens deduced that Benjamin's high-stress job and penchant for consuming copious amounts of caffeine likely played a significant role in the development of his ulcers. Dr. Stevens advised Benjamin to explore stress-management techniques, such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or even tai chi. He also recommended cutting back on caffeine and adopting a more balanced, healthy diet. Though this part of the treatment plan would require considerable commitment and behavior modification on Benjamin's part, it was essential to ensuring his long-term health. As the weeks went by, Benjamin continued his regimen under the watchful eye of Dr. Stevens and began implementing the lifestyle changes necessary to promote healing. Much to Dr. Stevens's satisfaction, Benjamin's ulcers gradually began to heal, and his overall condition improved significantly. Upon completion of his treatment, Benjamin was eternally grateful to Dr. Stevens for not only saving his life but also providing him with the guidance and knowledge to prevent future complications. What had started as a flu-like illness had escalated into a life-threatening condition, but thanks to Dr. William Stevens and his tireless dedication to patient care, Benjamin was able to make a full recovery and return to a normal life, free of pain and uncertainty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the answer: Which deposed king of England died in Pontefract Castle in 1400?","output":"The deposed king of England who died in Pontefract Castle in 1400 was Richard II. Born on January 6, 1367, Richard became King of England at the young age of 10 after the death of his grandfather, King Edward III. He was the second and last monarch of the House of Plantagenet's main branch, which was responsible for leading England into major historical events such as the Hundred Years' War against France and the establishment of England as a powerful medieval kingdom. Richard II's reign began on June 22, 1377, and lasted until his deposition on September 30, 1399. His time as king was marked by a mixture of glorious achievements and significant challenges that would shape his life and legacy. Among the early accomplishments during his reign were his success in suppressing the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 and reasserting royal authority. Richard was known for his strong belief in the Divine Right of Kings, the idea that monarchs are chosen by God and should be absolute rulers. However, Richard's reign also faced several hurdles and missteps. His court was often rife with political intrigue, rivalries, and tension; a situation that was exacerbated by Richard's own tendency to favor certain nobles and seek to concentrate power in his hands. This ultimately led to the formation of the Lords Appellant, a group of powerful English noblemen who seized power from Richard and executed several of his close advisors in 1387-1388. Although Richard regained control of his kingdom in 1397-1399, his harsh reprisals against the Appellants only further alienated the English nobility. The crucial turning point in Richard's life and reign came with the arrival of his cousin, Henry Bolingbroke, later known as Henry IV, who returned from exile in 1399. Initially, Henry claimed to be seeking the recovery of his own lands and titles. However, as support for his cause grew, he leveraged the dissatisfaction with Richard amongst the English nobility and set his sights on the throne itself. Richard was captured and forced to abdicate by Henry, who then seized power as King Henry IV of England. Richard's deposition marked the end of the Plantagenet line and the beginning of the Lancaster dynasty. Following his forced abdication, Richard II was imprisoned in Pontefract Castle, located in West Yorkshire. The castle was known for its gloomy, dark, and forbidding atmosphere, making it a fitting place for a captive king. There are various accounts of Richard's time in captivity, with some stories suggesting that he was treated harshly, while others claim that his accommodations were more comfortable than might be expected. Regardless of the precise nature of his confinement, Richard's ill-fated reign came to a tragic conclusion when he died in the castle on February 14, 1400. The exact cause of Richard II's death remains unclear and has sparked considerable debate among historians. Some suggest that he was murdered or starved to death on the orders of King Henry IV as a way to eliminate any possible threats to the new king's rule. Other historians believe that Richard may have succumbed to natural causes, illness, or even despair due to his imprisonment. His body was initially buried at Kings Langley Church in Hertfordshire, but in 1413, King Henry V, Henry IV's son, ordered Richard's remains to be properly reinterred in Westminster Abbey, where they still rest today. In conclusion, Richard II, the last monarch of the Plantagenet's main branch, met his tragic end while being imprisoned at Pontefract Castle in 1400. Following a tumultuous reign that both featured great accomplishments and suffered from political instability and strife, Richard ultimately fell prey to his own cousin, Henry Bolingbroke, who deposed him and seized the throne as King Henry IV. While Richard's time as king and his violent death remain shrouded in mystery and debate, his legacy as a controversial and polarizing figure in English history endures to this day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this \\"Know your function. Select values of x. Calculate the values of the function. Calculate the average rate of change of the function. Interpret the result.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Understanding Functions, Their Values, Rates of Change, and Interpretation Introduction A function is a mathematical relationship that associates each element in a given domain (input values) with exactly one element in a specific range (output values). In other words, a function is a rule that transforms each input into a unique output. Understanding the nature of these mathematical relationships, selecting the input values, calculating the output values, and analyzing the average rate of change of a function is crucial in various fields, including science, engineering, and economics. In this article, we will break down the process of knowing a function, selecting input values (x), calculating function values, analyzing the average rate of change, and interpreting the result. Step 1: Knowing a Function The first step in understanding a function is to identify the given function's equation, domain, and range. The equation represents the relationship between the input and output values. A function's domain and range are integral in defining and restricting the possible input and output values. For instance, consider a linear function \`f(x) = 2x + 3\`. The equation represents how each x value (input) is related to the output value, or f(x). In this case, the domain and range are all real numbers, as there are no restrictions on the input and output values. Step 2: Selecting Values of x Once the function is identified, the next step is to select various input values of x to study the function's behavior. Choosing the input values depends on the problem context, domain constraints, and the level of detail required in the analysis. Input values might be equidistant, random, or strategically chosen based on particular scenario requirements. In the example of \`f(x) = 2x + 3\`, we could select the x values -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 and 3 to analyze the function within a narrow range. Step 3: Calculating the Values of the Function After selecting the x values, the next step is to calculate the corresponding function values (f(x)). To do this, plug each x value into the function's equation and compute the resulting output values. For \`f(x) = 2x + 3\`, the function values for the selected x values would be:  - f(-2) = 2(-2) + 3 = -1 - f(-1) = 2(-1) + 3 = 1 - f(0) = 2(0) + 3 = 3 - f(1) = 2(1) + 3 = 5 - f(2) = 2(2) + 3 = 7 - f(3) = 2(3) + 3 = 9 Step 4: Calculating the Average Rate of Change of the Function The average rate of change of a function is the ratio of the change in the output value to the change in the input value over a specific interval. It is a measure of how the value of the function changes, on average, as the input value changes. For our example, we can calculate the average rate of change over each interval of consecutive x values: - For the interval [-2, -1]: (f(-1) - f(-2))/(-1 - (-2)) = (1 - (-1))/(-1 - (-2)) = 2 - For the interval [-1, 0]: (f(0) - f(-1))/(0 - (-1)) = (3 - 1)/(0 - (-1)) = 2 - For the interval [0, 1]: (f(1) - f(0))/(1 - 0) = (5 - 3)/(1 - 0) = 2 - For the interval [1, 2]: (f(2) - f(1))/(2 - 1) = (7 - 5)/(2 - 1) = 2 - For the interval [2, 3]: (f(3) - f(2))/(3 - 2) = (9 - 7)/(3 - 2) = 2 Step 5: Interpret the Result Finally, interpret the result based on the findings. In our example, the function appears to have a constant average rate of change of 2 across all selected intervals, indicating that it is a linear function with a slope of 2. This means that for every unit increase in the input value x, the output value of the function, f(x), increases by 2 units, showing a linear and proportional relationship between the input and output values. In conclusion, understanding a function, selecting input values, calculating output values, determining the average rate of change, and interpreting the result is a vital process in various fields. These steps offer a comprehensive approach to analyzing the behavior of a function and its real-world applications, allowing a more profound understanding of the mathematical relationships that govern a specific scenario."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872?  There was considerable local opposition to the Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection.   This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of George Armstrong Custer, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park.

Given the question: Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.”  Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. What will likely happen to those who continue to eat burgers and cheese fries?

There's my name, Alexander Spencer, typed on the front. I throw it under the bed. The piles of envelopes are growing. The envelopes were applications to all the colleges I was supposed to attend. I did open the first envelope. Then I saw the application, all those blank spaces I was supposed to fill with my own writing, spaces for my name and birth date and grade average and ... statement of purpose. I looked at them for a long time. I could write for hours and not fill all those spaces. So I put the application back in the envelope. I would fill it out the next day, when I had time. But another envelope arrived. And then the pile began. The pile scares me -- it is really like a monster. All the while, I feel the weight of a million envelopes raining down on my head until my grandmother calls me and wants to know how I am. \\"I am overcome by too many tasks,\\" I say. \\"Honey, you just take it bit by bit,\\" she says, and she reminds me about the green beans. When I was a little kid I hated green beans. But my mom said I couldn't leave the table until I ate ten green beans. All alone at the table, I stared at the green beans for what seemed like hours. It was a mountain of green beans. I couldn't do it. My grandma came to me and asked if I could eat one green bean. \\"But Grandma, I have to eat ten!\\" She said all I had to do was to eat one green bean. One tiny little green bean. So I ate one. It was bad, but not as bad as I'd thought it would be. Then she asked me again if I could eat one. So I ate one green bean nine more times. My grandma doesn't know about the envelopes, but she tells me anyone can do one thing every day. Back in my room, I lay down on the bed. Just like I used to do when I was a little kid, I hang my head down to look at the pile of envelopes. There it is. But instead of a monster, I see a pile of green beans. Who's afraid of green beans? Question: What do you think the author will do next? Answer: pick from the following. (1). He will fill out the applications one after another.; (2). He will go to the college that he dreams of.; (3). He will throw away all the envelopes.; (4). He will eat up the green beans.; Answer:","output":"(1). He will fill out the applications one after another. Considering the author's realization that the pile of envelopes is like a pile of green beans and his past experience of overcoming the challenge of eating green beans one at a time, it is likely that the author will approach the college applications in the same manner. He will most likely start filling out the applications one after another, breaking the task into smaller, more manageable parts, as his grandmother had suggested. By addressing one application at a time, the author will be more likely to overcome the challenge and eventually complete all the applications."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: We actually watched this twice in the theater because we could not believe how bad it was the first time. Maybe we'd missed something... nope, what's missing was missed from the beginning of preproduction. I actually went back to Robbin's novel to see if I could find the problem, and I discovered that what I thought was funny and exciting back in the day is now just so much disconnected and fuzzy-headed junk. So, the initial problem with the film was deciding to do it at all, and the rest of the train wreck progressed from there. Absolutely nothing works - not a blessed thing. Some beautiful exterior photography gets steamrolled by random camera placement in interior shots. All of the actors look at least uncomfortable - Angie Dickenson looks positively mortified - except for Rain Phoenix, who gives the impression that she is too unaware to realize how awful her performance really is. The dialog is one, long, unwavering cringe. Scenes don't make sense from second to second, and the connections between them are nonexistent. And yet, the movie stumbles blindly on, convinced that it is saying something profound. This is too bad to even be funny; it is simply excruciating. Gus Van Zant has done other good-to-great movies which I encourage you to see, and I'm happy he survived (and appears to have learned from) this mess.","output":"The sentiment of the review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses strong dissatisfaction with almost every aspect of the film. Firstly, the reviewer points out that they watched the movie twice, but could not find any redeeming qualities. They discuss going back to the original novel to identify any potential issues, only to find that it, too, is now considered disconnected and \\"fuzzy-headed junk.\\" The initial issue, according to the reviewer, is that the decision to make the film in the first place was misguided. They describe the film as a train wreck, indicating that all components of the movie are disastrous. There is disappointment with the technical aspects such as the interior camera placement, with the reviewer saying \\"beautiful exterior photography gets steamrolled\\" by random interior camera shots. When discussing acting performances, the reviewer suggests that most actors seemed uncomfortable, while Rain Phoenix is criticized for being \\"unaware\\" of how poor her acting is. Angie Dickinson, in particular, is described as looking \\"positively mortified.\\" The dialogue is described as \\"one, long, unwavering cringe,\\" and the reviewer also mentions issues with scene coherence and connectivity. They emphasize that the film continues without providing any profound insights. Ultimately, the reviewer finds the film abysmal, declaring it \\"too bad to even be funny\\" and \\"simply excruciating.\\" They do acknowledge that the director, Gus Van Sant, has done other good-to-great movies and express relief that he appears to have learned from this experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Context: Unlike seal hunting in Canada, where pups are hunted for fur, poachers in China catch seals primarily to sell to zoos or to use the genital organs for traditional Chinese medicine. Hypothesis: China still uses traditional Chinese medicine.","output":"To derive the hypothesis from the context given, here are the steps to take: Step 1 - Analyze the Context: It's clear from the text that seals in China are poached for two major reasons - sold to zoos and utilized in traditional Chinese medicine. Step 2 - Focus on Relevant Information: Our focus is on the fact that the seals' genital organs are being used, specifically for traditional Chinese medicine. It doesn't specify whether this happens continuously or it is a historically known usage. Step 3 - Formulate hypothesis: The sentence indicates that the use of seals' genital organs in traditional Chinese medicine is a current occurrence. The only point where the text could potentially mislead is if the practice was historical but has since been abandoned, however, there's no suggestion of a change in practice over time. Step 4 - Validate hypothesis: Based on the context, it appears valid to assume that 'China still uses traditional Chinese medicine'. The text refers to the use of the seals' genital organs in traditional medicine in the current sense. So, it's reasonable to derive the hypothesis: China still uses traditional Chinese medicine from the provided context. However, the context does not offer a comprehensive view into the overall use of traditional Chinese medicine in China, it only specifies one application within it. As a result, while the hypothesis can be drawn, it's scope is limited by the context. Any broader interpretations about the practice of traditional Chinese medicine in China would need additional supporting context."},{"instruction":"Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who did not take up singing seriously until 1937?, using the article: Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore.

The options are - emergency room, library, injured person, patient, and hospital. Step 3: Eliminate irrelevant options. In this case, a library is a place for books and resources, not medical help; an injured person and a patient are not locations, but rather individuals in need of help themselves. These options can be removed from consideration. Step 4: Assess the remaining options. We are left with two options - emergency room and hospital. The emergency room is specifically designed for dealing with urgent and life-threatening medical conditions, whereas a hospital offers broader medical services, including treatment for less urgent issues. Step 5: Choose the most appropriate option. Since the question specifically asks for a non-urgent wound, the emergency room is not the best choice. The hospital, on the other hand, can accommodate a wider range of medical conditions, including non-urgent wounds.

Answer:","output":"Frederick Hamilton Scott Hart, an Indian Australian businessman and politician, was born on March 26, 1836, in Madras, India. Despite being born in India, Frederick later found his way to Australia, where he would make a name for himself as a prominent member of society. From a young age, Frederick showed great interest in business and entrepreneurship, using those skills to amass considerable wealth and influence throughout his life. He became a well-known businessman and was respected among his peers for his work ethic and keen understanding of the business world. As Frederick's influence grew, he became more involved in the political arena. Eventually, he was appointed to the Queensland Legislative Council in Australia, which marked the beginning of his political career. He took office on July 11, 1872, and continued to serve the council faithfully until his death on July 15, 1915. As a member of the Queensland Legislative Council, Frederick Hart played an instrumental role in passing legislation and was a staunch advocate of the Church of England's values and principles. His dedication to the Church was so unwavering that he remained a devoted member throughout his life, even in the face of adversity and opposition. In his personal life, Frederick Hart was married to Harriett Isabel Blanche Horsley. Together, the couple shared a loving and supportive relationship until Harriett's untimely death in 1894. This tragic event left a significant impact on Frederick, who deeply mourned the loss of his beloved wife and partner. Despite facing hardships in his personal life, Frederick Hart remained an influential figure politically and socially. His tireless dedication to the Queensland Legislative Council earned him respect and admiration from his peers and constituents alike. Ultimately, his long and storied career came to an end on July 15, 1915, when he passed away in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Fredrick Hamilton Scott Hart was laid to rest at Toowong Cemetery, leaving behind a legacy of dedication to public service, business acumen, and devotion to his faith.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: More than 150 dolphins, marine turtles and beaked whales have been washed up dead on beaches in Africa. Hypothesis: Turtles will continue to wash up on the beaches of africa","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is unclear whether the hypothesis \\"Turtles will continue to wash up on the beaches of Africa\\" is true or not. The paragraph only states a fact that more than 150 dolphins, marine turtles, and beaked whales have been washed up dead on African beaches, but it does not provide further information on the cause of this phenomenon or if it is an ongoing event. To determine if the hypothesis is true, we would need more detailed information about the current situation as well as the contributing factors and ongoing environmental developments that may affect the probability of marine turtles continuing to wash up on African beaches. Factors that could affect this hypothesis are: 1. Causes of death: If the cause of death of the marine turtles (as well as dolphins and beaked whales) is an ongoing issue, such as water pollution or habitat destruction, there is a higher chance that these animals will continue to wash up on the beaches of Africa. 2. Conservation efforts: If there are ongoing conservation efforts to address the issue, such as monitoring and cleaning up pollution or implementing policies to protect marine wildlife, the hypothesis may not hold true, as these efforts may reduce the number of marine turtles, dolphins, and beaked whales being washed ashore. 3. Migration and breeding patterns: Another factor to consider is migration and breeding patterns of marine turtles. If these patterns bring the turtles closer to the African coast during certain seasons, there might be an increased likelihood of turtles washing ashore. However, this does not inherently mean that they will continue to wash ashore indefinitely. 4. Natural or human-induced factors: Understanding any natural or human-induced factors contributing to the phenomenon would also be crucial in determining the validity of the hypothesis. For example, if extreme weather events, ocean currents, or fishing practices are playing a significant role in causing marine turtles to wash up on the beaches, addressing these issues can mitigate the situation. 5. Data trends: Analyzing the data trends over time can help identify any patterns or recurring incidents, supporting or refuting the hypothesis. If this event has been happening for a prolonged period and shows no signs of decline, the hypothesis may be more likely to be true. In conclusion, without access to further information and considering the potential factors that could impact the phenomenon, it is not possible to confidently determine whether the hypothesis that turtles will continue to wash up on the beaches of Africa is true or not. A more thorough investigation and data analysis are required to validate or refute the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

By Kerry Mcdermott PUBLISHED: 09:53 EST, 1 April 2013 | UPDATED: 01:33 EST, 2 April 2013 A Tory councillor was condemned as ‘egotistical’ and ‘arrogant’ yesterday for naming a park after his son without permission. Andre Gonzalez De Savage had the sign declaring the land ‘Adam’s Park’ erected after helping to arrange play equipment for it. Last week council officials discovered that he did not have permission to rename  the land and had the sign taken down at  the weekend. 'Arrogant': Andre Gonzalez De Savage (left) erected a sign emblazoned 'Adam's Park' at the public space A defiant Mr Gonzalez De Savage said he was ‘very annoyed’, insisting that the honour was deserved as his eight-year-old son Adam had been a member of a council ‘planning team’ working on the park in East Hunsbury, Northamptonshire. and the group decided to call it","output":"'Adam's Park' as a tribute to his hard work and dedication despite his young age. The park, which previously did not have an official name, was transformed with the installation of play equipment, benches, and landscaping under the guidance of the council's planning team and the support of local residents. The controversy began when several other council members and some community members expressed their disapproval of the decision, citing that Mr. Gonzalez De Savage had not followed proper naming procedures and that it showed favoritism towards his son. Critics felt that the decision should have been made through public consultation or at least a council vote to ensure fairness and transparency. Following the backlash, a council spokesperson acknowledged that the correct process had not been followed and announced that a full review of the naming decision would take place, including a public consultation to allow residents to have their say on the park's name. The council also stated that any future naming decisions would adhere to established protocols to avoid similar situations. Gonzalez De Savage defended his actions, stating that his intentions were to recognize the hard work of his son and the rest of the planning team who had put in long hours to transform the park into a welcoming and enjoyable space for the community. He also mentioned that the majority of the planning team, which comprised 8-12 members, had unanimously agreed on the name 'Adam's Park.' During the public consultation, community members were invited to submit suggestions for the park's name. A range of options were proposed, from historical figures to local landmarks. After gathering feedback and considering the community's input, the council held a vote to select the most appropriate and representative name for the park. Ultimately, the council decided to name the park 'East Hunsbury Community Park,' reflecting the area's history and the community's collaborative efforts in revitalizing the public space. Though the name 'Adam's Park' was not chosen, the council acknowledged and appreciated Adam's involvement in the park's renovation and development. In response to this decision, Gonzalez De Savage expressed disappointment that his son's name was not retained, but recognized the importance of following the democratic process and respecting the community's opinion. He praised the collaborative efforts of the council, the planning team, and the community members who had all contributed to the successful transformation of the park. This incident will serve as a learning experience for the council to ensure that proper protocols are followed in similar situations in the future. It also highlights the need for public officials to maintain a balance between personal involvement and impartiality when working on community projects. Meanwhile, the park's new name signifies the unity and collective efforts of the East Hunsbury community in making the park a vibrant, family-friendly space for all to enjoy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Plot title: Weekend at Bernie's Movie plot: Larry Wilson (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard Parker (Jonathan Silverman) are two low-level financial employees at an insurance corporation in New York City. While going over actuarial reports, Richard discovers a series of payments made for the same death. Richard and Larry take their findings to the CEO, Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser), who commends them for discovering insurance fraud and invites them to his Hamptons island beach house for the Labor Day weekend. Unbeknownst to Larry and Richard, Bernie is behind the fraud. Nervously meeting with his mob partner Vito (Louis Giambalvo), Bernie asks to have Larry and Richard killed. However, after Bernie leaves, Vito decides Bernie has been attracting too much attention with his greed and his relationship with Vito's girlfriend, Tina (Catherine Parks), and orders that he be killed instead. Bernie arrives at the island before Larry and Richard and plans the murders with Paulie (Don Calfa), the hitman, on the phone, unaware the conversation is being recorded on his answering machine. Bernie then plants cash and a fake confession note implicating Larry and Richard in the insurance fraud. Paulie arrives, killing Bernie with a drug overdose. When Larry and Richard arrive at Bernie's house, they find Bernie's body. Before they can call the police, guests arrive for a party that Bernie used to host every weekend. To Larry and Richard's amazement, the guests are too engrossed in their partying to notice he is dead, with the dopey grin from the fatal injection and his sunglasses concealing his lifeless state. Fearing implication in Bernie's death, and wanting to enjoy the luxury of the house for the weekend, Larry proposes he and Richard maintain the illusion that Bernie is still alive, a notion that Richard finds absurd. Only the arrival of Richard's office crush, Gwen Saunders (Catherine Mary Stewart), convinces him to go along with Larry's plan. Tina arrives at the house, and has Larry and Richard direct her to Bernie. There, she also fails to realize he is dead. At that... My question: Where does Larry Wilson work?

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Organisms that have a diploid life cycle spend the majority of their lives as diploid adults. All diploid adults inherit half of their DNA from each parent. When they are ready to reproduce, diploid reproductive cells undergo meiosis and produce haploid gametes. These gametes then fuse through fertilization and produce a diploid zygote, which immediately enters G 1 of the cell cycle. Next, the zygote's DNA is replicated. Finally, the processes of mitosis and cytokinesis produce two genetically identical diploid cells. Through repeated rounds of growth and division, this organism becomes a diploid adult and the cycle continues. This is the life cycle of humans.   Q: What is the series of changes in the life of an organism?

It's difficult to look back on one's own childhood without some element of nostalgia .I have four brothers and sisters, and my memories are all about being with them.Playing board games on the living room floor, or spending days in the street with the other neighborhood children, racing up and down on our bikes, or exploring the nearby woods.My parents scarcely appear in these memories, except as providers either of meals or of severe blame after some particularly risky adventure. These days, in the UK at least, the nature of childhood has changed dramatically.Firstly, families are smaller, and there are far more only children.It is common for both parents to work outside the home and there is the feeling that there just isn't time to bring up a large family, or that no one could possibly afford to have more than one child.As a result, today's boys and girls spend much of their time alone.Another major change is that youngsters today tend to spend a huge amount of their free time at home, inside.More than anything this is due to the fact that parents worry far more than they used to about real or imagined dangers, so they wouldn't dream of letting their children play outside by themselves. Finally, the kind of toys children have and the way they play is totally different.Computer and video games have replaced the board games and more interesting activities of my childhood.The irony  is that so many ways of playing games are called \\"interactive\\".The fact that you can play electronic games on your own further increases the sense of loneliness felt by many young people today. Do these changes mean that children today have a less relaxing childhood than I had? I personally believe that they do, but perhaps every generation feels exactly the same.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Life for the partners of Cates, Katalinic & Lund holds little of the glamour one might expect from a career in law. Instead of lunches at Lut��ce, they caucus at the Palace Diner in Queens. Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street corners, not securing box seats at Madison Square Garden. To make ends meet, one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse. Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab. A sign of failure, of a feeble economy, perhaps? Hardly. They are heeding the call of a growing pool of law schools, which are for the first time pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to get there. Forget the lure of large firms, the security of a government post. Here is how to grapple \\"in the service of justice,\\" as many of the schools put it, instead. Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely dent the nation's legal needs, the law schools are urging graduates to buck tradition, pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start their own, all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford. This is not pro bono legal work; it is \\"low bono,\\" a term the schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are training students for. While its practitioners do charge for their services, they are also dead set on turning no one away - or at least as few as possible. \\"When you go into this kind of social justice law, it's really brutal and you're almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of years before there's a light at the end of the tunnel,\\" said Fred Rooney, director of the Community Legal Resource Network at City University of New York School of Law, from which the lawyers of the newly formed Cates, Katalinic & Lund graduated last May. \\"But if our graduates don't do it, the millions of people who cannot access justice in this country will continue to soar.\\" The movement, primly called the consortium, started four years ago by CUNY, Northeastern University, the University of Maryland and St. Mary's Law School in Texas. (St. Mary's later dropped out.) Since then, it has drawn seven additional law schools to its ranks: the University of Michigan, Rutgers and Syracuse Law Schools, New York Law School, University of New Mexico School of Law, Thomas M. Cooley Law School and Touro Law School. It has elicited at least initial interest from 19 more.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What was the first educational institution in Texas to leave \\"The consortium\\" of schools?\\" is \\"Thomas M Cooley Law School\\"?","output":"No, the correct answer is \\"St. Mary's Law School in Texas.\\" According to the paragraph, St. Mary's was one of the schools that started the consortium but later dropped out. Thomas M. Cooley Law School is one of the additional schools that joined the consortium later."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: When December gets into full swing, it gets harder and harder to flip the switch from holiday festivities to emails and spreadsheets. Take it from me: I work from home as a freelance writer. While I love the flexibility and freedom of this arrangement, it can be challenging to get motivated without a team of colleagues and a conventional office environment to show up at every day, especially at this time of year. But here’s what I’ve found to be one key to my success: a set, regular, step-by-step morning routine. Some parts of the routine are constructive, and others are more ritualistic, but I’ve discovered that my greatest times of productivity occur when I stick to this practice. So, if you’re having trouble wrapping your head around the workday, try kicking it off with my eight-step plan. Whether you work in your cubicle or your kitchen, these tips will arm you with that extra “oomph” you need to get started on the grind—and stay focused on it all day long. My day starts at 6:30 AM with Ashtanga yoga, a moving meditation that grounds me, stretches me out, gives me focus, gets my blood flowing, and puts me in the right frame of mind for work. I can’t imagine my life without yoga, but if it’s not for you, just pick another get-your-heart-pumping activity: a run, a stretch, a Pilates routine, or a spin class are all great ways to start your morning. Straight from yoga, I race for my coffee (I would probably inject it intravenously if I could). My caffeine addiction notwithstanding, a little extra jolt can be helpful to distinguish between night and day. If you’re not a coffee drinker, you might find that a cold shower, protein shake, or cup of tea can have the same rejuvenating benefits. First the coffee, now the food—remember Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs? If you haven’t satisfied your growling stomach, there’s no way you’ll be able to focus on work. Along the same lines, make sure that you’re rested and hydrated—taking care of yourself is the best way to remain focused throughout the day. Okay, I admit it: I do sometimes work in my pajamas (it’s one of those work-from-home perks). But I find that I’m much more productive and energized if I take the time to dress professionally—and don’t just throw on something I’ve pulled out of the laundry pile. Something about a crisp white button down and a bright scarf makes me feel ready for work—even if I’m my only company for the day. Whether you’re in a formal office space or you work from your desk at home, it’s important that you’re organized and that you equip yourself with the tools necessary to get the job done. For example, I like a clean desk, good lighting, a supportive chair, and my coffee within arm’s reach. My computer has to be amply charged, and I need easy access to a notepad and pen. (A sleeping dog snuggling by my feet is an added plus.) Figure out what you need—and then make sure you have it there with you each morning. Wherever you are, distractions are hard to manage. Unexpected visitors, noisy co-workers, Facebook alerts, Tweetdeck updates, and a relentlessly ringing phone can all wreak havoc on a good work groove. But especially with the holidays only weeks away, it can be difficult to ignore our other obligations. So, to avoid compromising your attention to your work, make sure you’ve addressed those distractions—called your mom, sent that Evite, whatever—before you sit down at your desk. Before I initiate any project, I create a skeleton framework of what I need to do. Since I’m a writer, I’ll sometimes develop a detailed roadmap that includes references, bullet points, and a draft intro and summary paragraphs. But no matter what, I’ll begin with a list of notes that I keep near my laptop for reference.","output":"\\"Start Your Workday Right: 8 Morning Steps to Boost Productivity and Focus\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Two suspects appeared in court Tuesday. (Jill Disis / The Star)      2 Indianapolis men, 18 and 21, are in custody on preliminary charges of murder.      Larry Taylor (left) and Jalen Watson (right) were arrested in connection with the Amanda Blackburn slaying. (Photo: Provided by IMPD)      1:07 p.m. update: The Marion County Prosecutor's Office has requested an enhancement on the murder charge filed against a suspect in the Amanda Blackburn killing because Blackburn was pregnant.      If Larry Taylor is convicted of Blackburn's murder, the enhancement could add an additional six to 20 years behind bars. Blackburn was 12 weeks pregnant when she died.      The enhancement would come into play should Taylor be convicted of or plead guilty to murder, according to prosecutor's office spokeswoman Peg McLeish. At that point, she said, the state would have to make its case that the killing caused the termination of Blackburn's pregnancy.      10:34 a.m. update: The two men facing murder charges in Amanda Blackburn's slaying appeared at a court hearing Tuesday, where a judge entered not guilty pleas for them.      During the 20-minute hearing, public defenders were assigned to Taylor and Watson, who gave \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\" answers to the judge's perfunctory questions.      Tuesday's court appearance will also likely be the last until Jan. 8, when the two are scheduled for a pre-trial conference hearing. In the meantime, local authorities will be tasked with processing additional evidence taken from the crime scenes — something officials expect will take time to resolve.      \\"It doesn't quite work like on television,\\" said Marion County Deputy Prosecutor Denise Robinson. \\"It's a process that can take weeks and into months in this case. So the crime lab has quite a bit of work to do on the case.\\"      Robinson said Taylor's case could be under consideration for the death penalty, though she added that process has yet to be started.      Uncertainty also swirls around the fate of Diano Gordon, a third man police have accused of being involved in the string of burglaries that led to Blackburn's death. Gordon, who is named in a probable cause affidavit, has not been charged. Robinson said prosecutors are waiting for test results and other information before determining what charges may be filed against him.      Gordon is currently being held at the Marion County Jail on an unrelated parole violation.      Earlier: The crime spree that ended Amanda Blackburn’s life began with a series of burglaries carried out across the Northside of Indianapolis.      The Blackburn home was the third burglary in the early-morning hours of Nov. 10. The perpetrators, police said, were after money. But the chaos ended around 7 a.m., police said, when one of the suspects — a teenager — leaned over Blackburn’s body and shot her in the back of the head.      Then he leaned further, police said. He looked at her face. And he watched her bleed.      That harrowing account of events was made public Monday as the city’s top law enforcers announced a slew of charges against two suspects, accused triggerman Larry Taylor, 18, and suspected accomplice Jalen Watson, 21.      “We promised you ... that we would go after those violent individuals in our community,” Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Chief Rick Hite said. \\"(Police) put in a lot of time to bring justice.\\"      Taylor was charged with 13 counts, including murder, burglary, theft, robbery, criminal confinement, auto theft and a misdemeanor count of carrying a handgun without a license. Watson is facing 10 counts, including murder, burglary, theft, robbery and auto theft.      A third person suspected of involvement, 24-year-old Diano Gordon, is mentioned in court documents and was named at a news conference Monday, but he has not been charged. Officials say Gordon is being held in the Marion County Jail on an unrelated parole violation. It’s unclear what type of charges, if any, might be filed against him.      The arrests came nearly two weeks after Blackburn’s husband, Davey Blackburn, found his wife in critical condition in their shared home on Sunnyfield Court. Amanda Blackburn, 28, was 12 weeks pregnant when she was shot multiple times. She died two days later.      The Blackburns, who moved to Indianapolis from South Carolina two years ago and founded Resonate Church, drew significant interest across the country as Davey Blackburn began speaking out on national media about his wife's death.      He released a statement Monday after receiving news of the arrests.      \\"Though everything inside of me wants to hate, be angry and slip into despair, I choose the route of forgiveness, grace and hope,\\" a portion of the statement read. \\"Today I am deciding to love, not hate. Today I am deciding to extend forgiveness, not bitterness. Today I am deciding to hope, not despair. By Jesus' power at work within us, the best is still yet to come.\\"      (Photo: Provided by the Resonate Church)      Newly released court documents reveal the most complete account yet of how investigators think the crime happened — along with how, through a combination of DNA testing, cellphone records, surveillance footage and cooperating individuals, investigators ultimately pinned their suspects.      The timeline detailed in charging documents began around 4:30 a.m. the day Blackburn was shot, when a woman living about 10 miles from the Blackburn home awoke to find her apartment burglarized. She told police that burglars stole her cellphone, laptop, purse, keys and 2007 Chrysler Sebring. The woman’s security system, court documents say, took pictures of three people.      Police claim the Sebring became a getaway vehicle as the suspects drove across town to burglarize more homes in the 2800 block of Sunnyfield Court. One home on that block was burglarized around 5:30 a.m. Court documents say the men ripped a window screen and unlocked a patio door before stealing a laptop, Tiffany pearl necklace, pink sweater, bag of oranges, four televisions and other items.      The Blackburn home, two doors down on Sunnyfield, was targeted next. Police said the suspects entered the unlocked door after Davey Blackburn left to go to a gym at 6:11 a.m.      According to court documents, the men did not immediately decide to kill Amanda Blackburn. Instead, documents allege Taylor hit her with his gun, stole her bank cards and threw them in the getaway car with Watson and Gordon. Those two then drove to two ATMs, attempting to withdraw money. They communicated several times via phone with Taylor, who remained in the Blackburn house.      A cooperating individual who is unidentified in court records provided a narrative of that morning to police. That person told investigators that the two men in the car planned to leave Taylor behind after successfully withdrawing money from an ATM on 86th Street. But Taylor, court documents say, “threatened to kill the woman if they left him.”      Ultimately, the two decided to return for Taylor. Court documents attribute that decision to another person who called them and said Taylor was “family” and could not be left behind.      It's not clear when Blackburn was shot. A neighbor later told police she heard two gunshots and what sounded like a woman's scream about 6:45 a.m. According to the unidentified cooperating individual, Taylor later told several people that he shot Blackburn in the back of the head.      After picking up Taylor, court documents say, the two men dropped him off in a different neighborhood with a bag of stolen property and stashed the Sebring elsewhere.      (Photo: Provided by Indiana Department of Correction)      That Sebring, which was recovered late Nov. 11 about 3 miles east of the Blackburn home, would later become the first piece of evidence that helped investigators track down their suspects. Inside the stolen vehicle, police found a denied ATM transaction notice for Blackburn’s missing debit card.      More critically, detectives also found a pink sweater stolen from the other home on Sunnyfield Court. That evidence, Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry said, gave officials a “significant break” in the case via a DNA swab.      DNA found on the sweater was run through the FBI’s DNA index system. It returned a match for Watson, who has a prior felony conviction for burglary. Court documents claim Watson used the sweater to conceal his face as he attempted to use Blackburn’s stolen debit card at area ATMs.      Pieces began falling into place with that match. Investigators pulled phone numbers they say belonged to Watson and Gordon, whom they identified as close associates. According to phone records, their numbers pinged cell towers in areas where the Nov. 10 burglaries occurred.      Phone records also placed Taylor's phone at the scene of the crime. Additional research led investigators to Taylor, who was interviewed Thursday.      During that interview, Taylor would tell police only that he \\"possibly\\" rode in the Sebring and stopped on Sunnyfield Court, claiming he “was so messed up he could not remember.” Watson and Gordon also were taken into custody that day on unrelated parole violations after questioning about the killing.      Taylor, meanwhile, would not elude arrest for long. Saturday, court documents say, police interviewed the unnamed “cooperating individual” who gave them the sequence of events leading to Blackburn’s death — including a confession to the killing from Taylor himself. Taylor was arrested late Sunday.      That person characterized the crimes as motivated by greed, telling investigators the group “wanted more money” as they drove to their targets.      Ultimately, the unnamed individual told police, Taylor confessed to the crime at a later rendezvous point, where he told several people “he killed the woman.”      “Taylor stated that she charged at him and he shot her somewhere in the upper body so he would not be scratched,” the person told police.      Then Taylor shot her in the back of the head.      CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share IndyStar reporter Justin Mack on Monday's developments in the Amanda Blackburn homicide case.

After a two-week investigation that involved DNA testing, phone tracking and shoe-leather detective work, police on Monday charges Taylor and parolee Jalen Watson, 21, with Blackburn's murder.      A third burglary suspect, Diano Gordon, 24, was held on a parole violation but has not been charged in the slaying, apparently because he did not enter the Blackburn home.      Jalen Watson and Larry Taylor Indianapolis Police Dept.      Because the victim was pregnant, prosecutors said they would consider filing additional charges tied to the fetus. Although her underwear had been removed and her shirt pulled up, they said there was no evidence to support sexual assault charges.      As the arrests were announced, Davey Blackburn issued a statement that he was \\"extremely relieved.\\"      \\"Though everything inside of me wants to hate, be angry, and slip into despair I choose the route of forgiveness, grace and hope,\\" he wrote.      \\"If there is one thing I've learned from Amanda in the 10 years we were together, it's this: Choosing to let my emotions drive my decisions is recipe for a hopeless and fruitless life. Today I am deciding to love, not hate.\\"      Amanda Blackburn, seen here with her husband Davey, was killed during a home invasion in Indianapolis. Davey Blackburn / Resonate Church      The Blackburns' home was the third targeted by Taylor, Watson and Gordon on Nov. 10, according to the court documents.      At the first predawn break-in, the thieves stole a laptop, purse and car while the resident was sleeping. While in the home, they discovered a video camera was recording them.      \\"Taylor wanted to kill the occupant because he was seen on camera,\\" the affidavit said, citing the confidential witness.      Instead, the group drove to another house, broke in through a patio window and swiped four TVs, a laptop, jewelry, a bag of oranges — and a pink sweater that would eventually help police identify them, the affidavit said.      \\"They decided they wanted more money,\\" the court document said.      They made their way to the Blackburn house, where the husband had left the front door unlocked when he left for the gym, the papers say. Inside, they confronted Amanda Blackburn and \\"Taylor busted her in the mouth with his gun,\\" Watson allegedly told his buddies when he came out.      Watson and Gordon considered taking off while Taylor was in the house, but then he came out with ATM cards and they set off in search of a cash machine, prosecutors allege. They tried and failed to get 500 out of one machine but did get 400 from another, then drove back and got Taylor, the affidavit said.      The court papers outlined the evidence amassed by police against the suspects. The most important clue: Watson's DNA was found on the pink sweater taken from the second burglary, which was then used to cover a suspect's face while he tried to withdraw cash with Blackburn's cash card.      Detectives were then able to use phone numbers that Watson and his Facebook friend Gordon has registered with parole to conduct searches of cell calls near the burglary scenes. The found they had called an unknown number, which they then traced to Backpage ads linked to Taylor, prosecutors said.      Taylor waived his right to remain silent and admitted he was near one burglary scene in search of someone named Cheese, the court papers say. He said he might have stopped in the Blackburns' neighborhood \\"but claimed he was so messed up he could not remember.\\" ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Two suspects, Larry Taylor, 18, and Jalen Watson, 21, have been arrested in connection to the murder of Amanda Blackburn in Indianapolis.

Declarative memory can be further sub-divided into semantic memory, concerning principles and facts taken independent of context; and episodic memory, concerning information specific to a particular context, such as a time and place. Semantic memory allows the encoding of abstract knowledge about the world, such as \\"Paris is the capital of France\\". Episodic memory, on the other hand, is used for more personal memories, such as the sensations, emotions, and personal associations of a particular place or time. Episodic memories often reflect the \\"firsts\\" in life such as a first kiss, first day of school or first time winning a championship. These are key events in one's life that can be remembered clearly. Autobiographical memory - memory for particular events within one's own life - is generally viewed as either equivalent to, or a subset of, episodic memory. Visual memory is part of memory preserving some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience. One is able to place in memory information that resembles objects, places, animals or people in sort of a mental image. Visual memory can result in priming and it is assumed some kind of perceptual representational system underlies this phenomenon.[citation needed] Which type of memory is used when remembering something that we've seen?","output":"When you remember something that you've seen, you use visual memory.

Answer:","output":"The Lockheed A-12 was a reconnaissance aircraft built for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) by Skunk Works, an official pseudonym for Lockheed Martin's Advanced Development Programs (ADP), formerly known as Lockheed Advanced Development Projects. The A-12 was developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a part of Project OXCART, a highly classified CIA program aimed at creating a high-altitude, high-speed aircraft capable of conducting aerial reconnaissance missions over enemy territory. The A-12 was designed to be extremely fast, reaching speeds of over Mach 3, and to operate at high altitudes, above 85,000 feet, to avoid detection by radar and interceptors. The aircraft was used by the CIA for a relatively short period, from 1963 to 1968, before being replaced by the more advanced SR-71 Blackbird, which was developed based on the A-12 design."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The woman was deemed mentally ill. What is the effect of the preceding sentence?","output":"The sentence \\"The woman was deemed mentally ill\\" is a statement that reveals a judgment or an evaluation made about a woman's mental health. The effect of the statement can be examined from various aspects such as grammatical, emotional, social, and cultural perspectives. Here is a detailed examination of the possible effects of the preceding sentence: 1. Grammatical Aspect: The sentence is in the passive voice, which means the emphasis is on the subject, in this case, the woman, rather than the person or entity responsible for deeming her mentally ill. Using passive voice highlights her mental condition, and it might raise questions about who made this judgment and whether it's accurate or reasonable. 2. Emotional Aspect: The statement could potentially invoke a range of emotions in readers or listeners, depending on their perspectives and experiences. Some might feel sympathy or empathy for the woman, imagining the potential struggles and challenges she might face in her life due to her mental illness. For others, it may trigger fear or prejudice based on any preconceived notions about mental illness they may have. The sentence may also evoke a sense of curiosity or concern, prompting further questions about the woman's well-being, the nature of her mental illness, and whether she's receiving proper treatment and support. 3. Social Aspect: The sentence highlights the topic of mental illness, which has become a significant social issue in recent years. Although progress has been made in breaking down stigma and promoting awareness, discussing mental illness can still evoke different reactions and opinions. The statement might bring attention to prevailing societal attitudes, such as the potential discrimination, isolation, or marginalization faced by individuals with mental health challenges. Furthermore, it could spark a conversation about the adequacy of mental health care systems and the need for more resources to address mental health issues. 4. Cultural Aspect: Different cultures have varying beliefs and attitudes toward mental illness. By stating that the woman is deemed mentally ill, the sentence touches upon these cultural differences and might invite a discussion on how mental health is perceived and treated across different communities. Comparing and contrasting beliefs surrounding mental illness can shed light on the misconceptions or prejudices that exist in some cultures, offering opportunities to learn and promote understanding among people from diverse backgrounds. 5. Ethical Aspect: Deeming someone mentally ill carries significant ethical considerations. The statement could raise questions about the accuracy and fairness of the assessment and the potential biases of the person or entity that made the determination. It might lead to discussions about the importance of proper mental health assessments, informed consent, and the rights and autonomy of individuals with mental health disorders. In summary, the effect of the sentence \\"The woman was deemed mentally ill\\" goes beyond merely stating a fact about a woman's mental health status. It raises questions about the accuracy and fairness of such an assessment, evokes a range of emotional responses, highlights social and cultural aspects of mental illness, and carries potential ethical implications. The sentence could serve as a starting point for further conversations about mental health awareness, societal attitudes towards mental illness, and the challenges faced by individuals with mental health disorders."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Process:  - Magma rises through cracks in the Earth&#x27;s crust - The pressure causes plates to move - Magma explodes to the surface - The lava from the eruption cools to form new crust - After several eruptions, the rock builds up and a volcano forms -   suppose pressure builds up under crust happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER eruptions.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Chaos and a lack of communication are common threads among American survivors' stories of the Costa Concordia sinking, and making it to shore was only the beginning of a long ordeal for passengers trying to get home. Melissa Goduti of Wallingford, Connecticut, boarded the ship about three hours before it ran aground Friday night, killing at least 11 passengers. \\"All of a sudden, the boat leaned over like on a 70-degree angle, and everything just started falling -- dishes were falling, trash cans were falling, everything was falling,\\" Goduti told CNN affiliate CTNow. \\"Then the lights went out and everything was blacked, out and then the lights came back on.\\" Lynn Kaelin of Puyallup, Washington, told CNN affiliate KCPQ that it was \\"like having the Titanic without the water gushing through.\\" \\"I called my husband, not knowing if I'd see him again,\\" she said. \\"I thought we were going to die.\\" There were no announcements for a long time, and Goduti and her mother didn't see signs directing them toward lifeboats. \\"We were running around trying to ask what floor the lifeboats were on, and all the crew kept saying is, 'you don't need them, you're fine, everything is fine, we just got hit by a big wave,' \\" Goduti told CTNow. \\"All they kept saying was it's a generator issue, just a generator issue and that the boat was floating along and just needed to get stabilized,\\" she said. Nancy Lofaro of New Rochelle, New York, said the crew tried to do what they could, \\"but when we asked them, they said they had no information. They just didn't have any information to give us.\\" Lofaro estimates the first announcement came 30 to 40 minutes after the ship ran aground. Goduti and her mother feel lucky they found a lifeboat. \\"When our lifeboat dropped, it dropped. It wasn't an easy letdown by any means, but at least we got into the water and were safe, which is a lot better than, unfortunately, some people,\\" she said. Costa staff in Lofaro's lifeboat were debating who would drive the boat, and they didn't seem to know what to do, she said. Joan Fleser of Duanesburg, New York, seconds that opinion, calling the crew \\"inexperienced and untrained.\\" In a letter to passengers, Costa Cruises CEO Pier Luigi Foschi disputes that assessment: \\"The crew of the Costa Concordia acted bravely and swiftly in an extremely difficult situation and succeeded -- despite the terribly demanding conditions -- in evacuating more than 4,000 people in the shortest possible time: we are proud of our commitment and dedication to your safety.\\" He goes on to outline crew training, safety procedures and regulatory oversight. Survivors of the disaster say the scene on land was equally chaotic. Fleser said the lifeboat ride to the Tuscan island of Giglio was the last she saw of Costa Cruises employees until she, her husband and daughter reached a hotel in Rome on Saturday. The people of the island came out in force to help the stranded travelers, and a local priest opened up the church. Fleser and her family stayed at the home of a local family overnight. \\"The people of the island were wonderful,\\" Fleser said. Nancy Lofaro and her husband wandered around on shore, finding a church, a local cafe and a small hotel all packed. \\"There was no organization. There was nobody, and the staff was in shock as much as we were. There were no announcements. We saw Costa people ... walking around with a bullhorn, not using it,\\" Lofaro said. Fleser and her family were herded onto a ferry to the mainland the morning after the wreck, \\"but we had no idea where we were going.\\" Triage doctors, members of the coast guard, the Red Cross and other volunteer organizations met the cruise passengers and took them to a local school, where more local services were provided. Her daughter received a pair of sneakers there because she was still wearing high heels from the night before, Fleser said. The family then boarded a bus to Rome, where they were dropped off at a hotel. \\"The Marriott had no idea we were coming. All these refugee boat people land on their front door, and they say, 'Who are you? But we'll take care of you,' \\" Fleser said. There were two Costa cruise representatives at the hotel, \\"but every time we asked them if they could do something for us, they said they had no authority,\\" she said. The cruise line did pay for food, the hotel and their airfare home, Fleser said, although they booked them on a flight to Albany, Georgia, instead of Albany, New York -- a mistake the family discovered in the Atlanta airport. \\"Oh my god, we were just ready to lose it at that point.\\" More than 1,100 Costa employees have been working to assist passengers and crew since Friday night, Foschi said in his letter to passengers. The CEO of Costa's parent company, Carnival Corp., pledged support to passengers: \\"I give my personal assurance that we will take care of each and every one of our guests, crew and their families affected by this tragic event,\\" Micky Arison said in a statement. Before Fleser and her family could make the journey home, they needed new passports to replace those lost on the sinking ship. The U.S. Embassy's response was a big disappointment, Fleser said. \\"Other than getting our temporary passports, they gave us no assistance whatsoever. No food, no clothes, no money, no transportation. They told us to borrow some money, get a cab, come on down.\\" A hotel shuttle took Fleser and other Americans to the embassy, she said. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the agency arranged with the cruise line to have American passengers transported to a Rome hotel and to the embassy for documents. More than 100 emergency passports have been issued to stranded travelers. \\"We also provided all kinds of advice, telephone contacts to families, helped families create travel funds, provided them with passport photos, warm clothes, there were even a couple of families that needed diapers,\\" she said during a State Department briefing Wednesday. Fleser and her family arrived home shortly after midnight Tuesday. They received a voicemail from Costa saying the family would be reimbursed for the cruise and articles lost on the ship, she said, but the message didn't offer details of how those amounts would be determined. In addition to arranging lodging, transportation and counseling for passengers, Costa will address possessions lost on board and is in the process of refunding cruise fares and costs incurred while on board, the company said in a statement. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The article talks about the experiences of American survivors during the Costa Concordia sinking.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Daniel Henninger: If Saddam Had Stayed From the vantage point of history, Barack Obama's prime-time speech announcing the Iraq war's end is less important than the speech he gave eight years ago as a state senator in Illinois. This was the October 2002 \\"dumb war\\" speech to an anti-Iraq war rally in Chicago's Federal Plaza. Back then, Mr. Obama had a more complex view of the stakes in Iraq than he does now. Today, the Iraq war has been reduced to not much more than a long, bloody and honorable gunfight between U.S. troops and various homicidal jihadists and insurgents inside Iraq, a war sustained by George Bush, Dick Cheney and some neocon advisers mainly to \\"impose\\" democracy on the Iraqis. I think it is a profound mistake to confine the war's significance to the borders of Iraq. Mr. Obama himself raised the central question about Iraq in that 2002 speech: Did Saddam Hussein pose a danger beyond his borders, or not? \\"Let me be clear,\\" State Senator Obama told the Federal Plaza crowd, \\"I suffer no illusions about Saddam Hussein. . . . He has repeatedly thwarted U.N. inspection teams, developed chemical and biological weapons and coveted nuclear capacity. . . . But I also know that Saddam poses no imminent and direct threat to the United States. . . [H]e can be contained.\\" Daniel Henninger asks what the world look like today if Saddam Hussein had remained in power in Iraq. This is a widely held view. The Economist's editors this week said Mr. Obama was largely right that Iraq was a dumb war. What the war did, they say, was \\"rid the Middle East of a bloodstained dictator.\\" It did a lot more than that. Let us assume that Mr. Obama's \\"smarter\\" view had prevailed, that we had left Saddam in power in Iraq. What would the world look like today? Mr. Obama and others believe that Saddam and his nuclear ambitions could have been contained. I think exactly the opposite was likely. At the time of Mr. Obama's 2002 antiwar speech, three other significant, non-Iraqi events were occurring: Iran and North Korea were commencing toward a nuclear break-out, and A.Q. Khan was on the move. In March 2002, Mr. Khan, the notorious Pakistani nuclear materials dealer, moved his production facilities from Pakistan to Malaysia. In August, an Iranian exile group revealed the existence of a centrifuge factory in Natanz, Iran. A month later, U.S. intelligence concluded that North Korea had almost completed a \\"production-scale\\" centrifuge facility. It was also believed in 2002 that al Qaeda was shopping for nuclear materials. In The Wall Street Journal this week, Jay Solomon described how two North Korean operatives through this period developed a network to acquire nuclear technologies. He would have restarted his nuclear program. In short, the nuclear bad boys club was on the move in 2002. Can anyone seriously believe that amidst all this Saddam Hussein would have contented himself with administering his torture chambers? This is fanciful. Saddam was centrifugal. He moved outward, into war with Iran in 1980 and into Kuwait 10 years later. Saddam was a player, and from 2002 onward the biggest game in his orbit was acquiring nuclear capability. The definitive account of Saddam's WMD ambitions is the Duelfer Report, issued by the Iraq Survey Group in 2005. Yes, the Duelfer Report concluded that Saddam didn't have active WMD. But at numerous points in the 1,000-page document, it asserted (with quotes from Iraqi politicians and scientists) that Saddam's goal was to free himself of U.N. sanctions and restart his efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other WMD. The report: \\"Saddam wanted to recreate Iraq's WMD capability. . . . Saddam aspired to develop a nuclear capability.\\" The Survey Group described Iraqi plans to develop three long-range ballistic missiles. Saddam was obsessed with Iran. Imagine the effect on the jolly Iraqi's thinking come 2005 and the rise to stardom of Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, publicly mocking the West's efforts to shut his nuclear program and threatening enemies with annihilation. That year Ahmadinejad broke the U.N. seals at the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant. In North Korea, Kim Jong Il was flouting the civilized world, conducting nuclear-weapon tests and test-firing missiles into the Sea of Japan. In such a world, Saddam would have aspired to play in the same league as Iran and NoKo. Would we have \\"contained\\" him? Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Iran and Saddam Hussein in Iraq simultaneously would have incentivized Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Sudan to enter the nuclear marketplace. Pakistan and India would be increasing their nuke-tinged tensions, not trying as now to ease them. We ought to be a lot prouder of our troops coming home from Iraq than we are showing this week. They deserve a monument. That war wasn't just about helping Iraq. It was about us. The march across the nuclear threshold by lunatic regimes is a clear and present danger. The sacrifice made by the United States in Iraq took one of these nuclear-obsessed madmen off the table and gave the world more margin to deal with the threat that remains, if the world's leadership is up to it. A big if. Summary:","output":"The article by Daniel Henninger examines the potential implications if Saddam Hussein had remained in power in Iraq. Henninger posits that during the 2002 period when Barack Obama, then Illinois state senator, opposed the Iraq war, other significant events were unfolding, such as Iran and North Korea’s advances towards nuclear capabilities, and the movements of A.Q. Khan, the Pakistani nuclear materials dealer. He disputes Obama’s statement that Saddam could have been contained and his nuclear ambitions held in check, and instead suggests that Saddam, driven by a rivalry with Iran, would have aspired to develop nuclear capability and other Weapons of Mass Destruction. Consequently, he argues, the Iraq war removed a significant threat and secured more margin for the world to handle remaining nuclear threats."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The strike, which took place in the area of Saakow, was targeting a senior leader of the Islamist militant group. \\"At this time, we do not assess there to be any civilian or bystander casualties. We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information, when appropriate, as details become available,\\" Kirby said in a statement. The strike was carried out by an unmanned aircraft, and was an operation of the U.S. Defense Department, according to a U.S. defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. On Saturday, Somalia government forces captured a top Al-Shabaab commander, said two of the country's military officials. Zakariya Ismail Ahmed Hersi, Al-Shabaab's intelligence chief, was captured in a house near the town of El Wak, Somali military commander Isack Hussein Mursal told state-run radio. He was a close associate of former Al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane, who was killed in a U.S. airstrike near Barawe city in September. The capture came after militants with the group, which is linked to al Qaeda, attacked a large African Union base in Mogadishu last week, killing three Ugandan soldiers and a civilian. Al-Shabaab has said that attack was revenge for the U.S. airstrike that killed Godane. The State Department had offered a 7 million reward for information on Godane's location.

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation 0*p - 13414 = -341*p - 12*p for p, follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify both sides of the equation. Since 0*p is 0, the left side of the equation becomes: -13414 = -341*p - 12*p Step 2: Combine the terms on the right side of the equation. To do this, we add the coefficients of the p terms: -341 and -12. -341 + (-12) = -353 So, the right side of the equation becomes: -13414 = -353*p Step 3: Solve for p. To solve for p, we need to isolate p by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of p, which is -353: p = -13414 / -353 Step 4: Calculate the value of p. Dividing the numbers: p ≈ 38 So, the solution to the equation 0*p - 13414 = -341*p - 12*p is approximately p ≈ 38."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Today, we are going to talk about emotional trauma and how we can recognize it, deal with it, and focus on the future. Sometimes, things happen in our lives that make us feel really sad or scared, and that's called emotional trauma. It's important to learn how to work through these feelings so we can be happy and healthy again. 1. Recognize the Physical Signs of Emotional Trauma When we experience emotional trauma, our bodies can show signs too. Imagine you're feeling very scared, and your body might shake, your heart might beat fast, or your stomach might hurt. These feelings can happen when we're worried or upset about something. Here are some things to look out for in our body: - Feeling very tired or having trouble sleeping - Having headaches or stomachaches - Feeling jumpy or easily startled 2. Figure Out the Impact Emotional trauma can affect how we feel, think, and act. It's important to understand how it's making us feel so we can work through it. Here are some ways emotional trauma might make us feel: - We might be very sad or cry a lot - We might feel angry or want to yell and scream - We might feel scared, even if we know there's nothing to be afraid of - We might not want to play with our friends or do things we usually enjoy 3. Engage With Anxiety It's okay to be anxious or worried after going through a tough time. We can talk to our family, friends, or teachers about how we're feeling and let them help us feel better. Here are some things we can do: - Share our feelings with someone we trust, like our parents or friends - Draw or write about how we feel in a journal - Squeeze a stress ball or play with a fidget toy to help us feel calm 4. Focus on the Future We can't change what happened, but we can choose how we will react and move forward. Here are some ways we can think about the future in a positive way: - Make a list of things we're grateful for and remind ourselves of the good things in our life - Set small goals, like going on a bike ride or spending time with friends, to help us feel better - Focus on our favorite activities, like playing soccer or painting, to help us feel happy again Remember, it's okay to feel sad or scared after something bad happens. But with the help of our family, friends, and some handy tips, we can get through emotional trauma and feel better. Let's keep focusing on the future and growing stronger together!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Translation of a text that is sung in vocal music for the purpose of singing in another language—sometimes called \\"singing translation\\"—is closely linked to translation of poetry because most vocal music, at least in the Western tradition, is set to verse, especially verse in regular patterns with rhyme. (Since the late 19th century, musical setting of prose and free verse has also been practiced in some art music, though popular music tends to remain conservative in its retention of stanzaic forms with or without refrains.) A rudimentary example of translating poetry for singing is church hymns, such as the German chorales translated into English by Catherine Winkworth. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What is most vocal music set to in Western tradition?","output":"Yes, there is an answer to this question.

The Jones family and the Bell family both entered a medical study for diabetes.The members of Jones family had mostly type 1 diabetes, while Bell family members had type 2 diabetes because they ate junk-food.  Which family had more adults developing diabetes 2? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, the Bell family had more adults developing type 2 diabetes. The Jones family mainly had type 1 diabetes, which is an autoimmune disease often diagnosed in early childhood and is not related to lifestyle or diet. In type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, rendering the person unable to produce insulin on their own. As a result, individuals with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin injections or use insulin pumps for the rest of their lives to maintain proper blood sugar control. On the other hand, the Bell family members had type 2 diabetes, which is primarily associated with lifestyle choices such as poor diet and lack of exercise. Consuming junk food and leading an unhealthy lifestyle can contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes by causing insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to the insulin being produced. The pancreas then tries to produce more insulin to compensate, but over time it may fail to keep up, resulting in high blood sugar levels. Age, genetics, and obesity can also play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes, but modifiable risk factors like diet, weight, and physical activity are crucial. Given that the Bell family members developed type 2 diabetes primarily due to their intake of junk food, it is evident that their lifestyle habits contributed significantly to their condition. As a result, it can be concluded that the Bell family had more adults developing type 2 diabetes when compared to the Jones family, who were mainly affected by type 1 diabetes. It's important to note that while both types are forms of diabetes, they have different underlying causes and are managed differently."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: As he looks up at the Jade Dragon Mountain, Zhang Jinpeng basks  in the sunshine on the roof-top of his youth hostel in Lijiang, a popular tourist destination in Yunnan province in Southwest China. He is content and excited at the same time, since the hostel, which he named after his best-seller A Decade of Backpacking, opened earlier this month. Published in 2010, Zhang's book was considered a milestone in Chinese travel writing. It sold more than 600,000 copies and triggered a wave of travel books by other Chinese writers who were born in the late 1970s and 1980s. Different from travel guides and traditional Chinese travel literature that mainly depict  landscapes and scenery, these books by young travelers tell stories of their personal growth through traveling. In A Decade of Backpacking, Zhang recounts his travels around the world since 2001, after he graduated from Nan Kai University in Tianjin and decided to see the world. \\"At the time my book came out, there were few books that catered to young people's longing while traveling.\\" Zhang's book ignited a Chinese craze for travel writing. Featuring different themes, travel writing became a popular genre. But most of the books have one thing in common: The travelers are mostly young people. The Late Gap Year (2009), written by Sun Dongchun, tells the story of a young man who gave up a white-collar job and started a three-month trip for a volunteer program in Southeast Asia. The trip turned into a year-long travel. What's more, he even found his Miss Right and got married by the end of the story. We Always Travel Hand in Hand, published in 2012, was written by a young couple. Their travel romance, complete with beautiful pictures, first went viral on a Chinese micro-blog. Song Zhenshao, counselor at the psychological counseling center of Beijing Normal University, says: \\"To step out of ordinary life is a deep desire associated with freedom in people's hearts, and the hustle and bustle of city life intensifies  the desire.\\" But as more similar travelogues...

The book, published in 2010 and written by Zhang Jinpeng, sold more than 600,000 copies and sparked a wave of travel books by other Chinese writers born in the late 1970s and 1980s. A Decade of Backpacking was unique when it was released, as there were not many books catering to young people's longing while traveling. Zhang's travelogue differentiated itself from traditional Chinese travel literature and guides, which primarily focus on landscapes and scenery. Instead of merely describing places, the book recounts the author's personal growth through his journeys around the world since 2001. This approach resonated with younger readers who craved personal narratives and connectivity with the travel experience. Due to the success of \\"A Decade of Backpacking,\\" the travel writing genre exploded in popularity in China. Many young Chinese authors began sharing their travel stories as a way to explore their identities and personal growth. For example, travelogues like \\"The Late Gap Year\\" by Sun Dongchun and \\"We Always Travel Hand in Hand\\" by a young couple, feature different themes and narratives, but primarily focus on young travelers' journeys and experiences. Song Zhenshao, a counselor at the psychological counseling center of Beijing Normal University, explains that stepping out of ordinary life and seeking freedom is a deep desire within people's hearts, which may be intensified by the challenges of city life. The popularity of travel writing in China can be attributed to this yearning for adventure and personal growth, which was initially inspired by books like \\"A Decade of Backpacking.\\" As the milestone in this genre, Zhang Jinpeng's book played a pivotal role in stimulating a Chinese craze for travel writing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a detailed explanation to support this choice: 1. Subject-Verb Agreement: The sentence has a clear subject (\\"They\\") and verb (\\"rowed\\"), which are in agreement. In English grammar, subject-verb agreement refers to the fact that the subject and the verb in a sentence must correspond in person and number. In this case, \\"They\\" is a third-person plural pronoun, and \\"rowed\\" is the appropriate past-tense, third-person plural form of the verb \\"to row.\\" 2. Verb Tense: The verb \\"rowed\\" is in the simple past tense, which indicates that the action of rowing happened at a single point in the past. The use of past tense is appropriate here, as it signifies a completed action. 3. Syntax: The sentence follows the standard SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) word order, which is common in English language sentences. In this case, the object is not explicitly mentioned, but it is not necessary for a sentence to be considered grammatically correct. The sentence focuses on the action of rowing performed by \\"They,\\" and that can be enough to convey the intended meaning. 4. Clarity and Ambiguity: The sentence is simple and clear in its meaning. Although the context for the sentence is not provided, it can still be easily understood that a group of people (represented by \\"They\\") engaged in the activity of rowing at some point in the past. 5. Appropriateness: The sentence is neither offensive nor inappropriate for any specific audience. It describes a neutral action that can be understood by readers or listeners of various backgrounds. Based on these factors, a linguist would consider the sentence \\"They rowed\\" to be acceptable, following the strictest grammatical standards."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is somewhat subjective and depends on numerous factors, but based on widely accepted scientific consensus, we can discuss several actions that would have a significant impact.  Here are some possible actions, in approximated order of potential significance: Step 1: Reduce greenhouse gas emissions Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is perhaps the most critical step to combat climate change. Burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation is the largest single source of global greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, shifting to renewable sources of energy like wind and solar power is crucial. Step 2: Enhance energy efficiency Enhanced energy efficiency essentially involves accomplishing the same tasks using less energy. This includes more efficient buildings, industrial processes, vehicles, products, services, and even power plants. Step 3: Improve carbon sinks  Planting trees is an excellent method for absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, and improving and conserving existing carbon sinks like forests, peatlands, mangroves, and sea grass beds is an essential action to take. Conservation and sustainable management of forests can contribute to significant carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere. Step 4: Change dietary habits Eating less meat and more plant-based foods can significantly reduce greenhouse gases. Livestock farming contributes to 14.5% of all human-caused greenhouse emissions, according to the UN's Food and Agricultural Organization.  Step 5: Waste reduction and recycling  Reducing, reusing, and recycling can lower the amount of waste that goes into landfills. When organic waste in a landfill decomposes, it releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Step 6: Support and demand governmental and corporate action  Individual actions are not enough to combat climate change. Policies, regulations, and commitments set by governments and corporations can lead to systemic changes in greenhouse gas emissions.  Each aforementioned step contributes significantly towards mitigating the effects of climate change. However, all these actions work best when they are done together. An integrated approach involving various sectors and stakeholders, embracing many actions, is much likely to provide a long-term solution to climate change."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Upper Austria had been rebellious for centuries, with 62 known uprisings between 1356 and 1849, 14 of which occurred in the 16th century. However, the Peasants' War of 1626 was the costliest in terms of human life and damage to livestock and property. The war caused Martin Aichinger to lose his farm and begin roaming the country. He eventually became a religious leader who led a popular revolt against aristocratic rule. His revolutionary ideas frightened the rulers so much that they tried to arrest him, leading to another series of uprisings that ended in the Battle on the Frankenberg  in 1636.

To isolate 'a', we need to perform operations on both sides of the equation to simplify and get 'a' by itself. Let's start by adding 19 to both sides of the equation. This is done so we can get rid of the constant -19 on the left side of the equation. 2*a - 19 + 19 = -13 + 19 Simplifying, we get: 2*a = 6 Step 3: Solve for 'a'. Now, we just need to get 'a' by itself.

Option A: Joseph was going on a long vacation. Option B: Nick was going on a long vacation. Step 1: Analyze the relation between the hiring event and each option. We need to think about how each option relates to the fact that Joseph hired Nick to build a pool and whether it makes logical sense to have a causal relationship. Step 2: Evaluate the coherence of each option with the sentence. Option A states that Joseph was going on a long vacation. This does not seem to have a logical connection with hiring someone to build a pool. It doesn't explain why Joseph would hire Nick to build a pool if he himself would be away; thus, this option does not coherently follow. Option B states that Nick was going on a long vacation. This could mean that Joseph hired Nick to complete the pool project before he left for his trip. Although it's not a very strong connection, it does establish a potential reason for Joseph to choose Nick for the task, perhaps knowing Nick needed extra income or had availability before his vacation to finish the project.  Step 3: Choose the more coherent and logical option as the sentence ending. Between the two options, Option B seems more coherent and logical as a reason for Joseph hiring Nick to build a pool.

Write highlights for this article: MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- A series of attacks and gunbattles between Mexican drug cartel suspects and police left at least 14 people dead and 22 wounded Thursday night, officials and news reports said. Nine cartel suspects and three police officers died in two ferocious gunbattles in the central Mexican state of Hidalgo, federal official Jose Alberto Rodriguez Calderon said. Another four police were wounded, the government-run Notimex news agency said. El Excelsior newspaper put that figure at 10 agents wounded. Separately, grenade and heavy-weapon attacks on law enforcement installations in two cities in Guanajuato state killed a civilian and a police agent and wounded 18 others, news reports said. The Hidalgo shootouts started when state police searching for several federal agents reported missing found them alive and safe near an auto racetrack in the Mineral de la Reforma municipality, Rodriguez Calderon was quoted as saying in Notimex. Almost immediately after police found the agents, drug suspects nearby started shooting. A simultaneous shootout occurred in the city of La Calera, also in the Mineral de la Reforma municipality, the news agency said. Police were attacked with hand grenades in that confrontation, leaving two officers dead. A third officer died later in a hospital. The nine drug suspects were killed in La Calera, Rodriguez Calderon said. Each firefight lasted 20 minutes. Officials confiscated 1.2 million pesos (more than 92,000), 3 kilograms of cocaine (6.6 pounds), six AK-47 assault rifles, an Uzi submachine gun, two hand grenades, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, four luxury vehicles, 12 cell phones, 11 bullet-proof vests and seven handcuffs, Rodriguez Calderon said. No arrests were made, and one suspect got away, the federal official said. In Guanajuato state, also in central Mexico, gunmen attacked police stations in the cities of Silao and Irapuato, El Correo newspaper reported. In Silao, at least 20 heavily armed hooded men riding in three dark trucks carried out the attacks, the newspaper said. The attackers first launched three grenades against a police station and then fired with AK-47 and R-15 assault rifles, littering the ground with hundreds of spent shells. That attack killed two people. Ten of the wounded were reported to be gravely injured and were transferred to the nearby city of Léon. The assault also damaged 15 vehicles, five of which caught on fire. Thursday's attacks on police installations resembled assaults last month in a half-dozen cities in Michoacan state. Those attacks were attributed to La Familia Michoacana drug cartel, which was accused of torturing and killing 12 off-duty federal agents around the same time and dumping their bodies on a remote road. Federal police have arrested at least 10 members of La Familia, including some top leaders, since the July 13 killings. The killings and the attacks on police installations were among reprisals by La Familia after the federal police captured one of their top leaders, authorities said. An unprecedented wave of violence has washed over Mexico since President Felipe Calderon declared war on the drug cartels shortly after coming into office in December 2006. More than 10,000 people have died in that time span, about 1,000 of them police.

The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - The user interface (UI), in the industrial design field of humancomputer interaction, is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur. The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end, whilst the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators' decision-making process. Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer operating systems, hand tools, heavy machinery operator controls, and process controls. The design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to or involve such disciplines as ergonomics and psychology.  - Eclipse is a mod for the video game Half - Life 2 .

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What does the apocalypse Guy warns Eep about turn out to be? ?  A cave family called the Croods survives a natural disaster, due to the overprotective nature of their stubborn and stern patriarch named Grug. The only one who questions the family's sheltered life is his teenaged daughter Eep, who frequently disobeys her father's orders out of curiosity, which he finds dangerous. Grug and Eep, along with her mother and his wife Ugga, her grandmother Gran, and her younger brother and sister, Thunk and Sandy, face time sheltered in their cave home. Eep sneaks out when she sees what she discovers to be a torch of fire, and she encounters an inventive modern human boy named Guy and his pet sloth Belt. He warns her of an impending apocalypse and offers to take her with him, but concerned for her family, Eep stays, getting a shell horn from him to blow in case she needs his help. Reuniting with her frantic family, she tries to tell them what Guy told her, but fearing things that are \\"different\\" and \\"new\\", they destroy her horn. A massive earthquake then destroys their home, and to avoid carnivores and omnivores, they descend down into a tropical forest that lay hidden behind their cave all the time. Encountering a \\"Macawnivore\\", a brightly colored feline that Gran dubs \\"Chunky\\", the family flees him until he is scared off by swarms of piranhakeets that devour a ground whale. Using another horn, Eep calls to Guy who rescues them from the birds with his fire. After a great deal of confusion regarding their first contact with fire, Grug imprisons Guy in a log until he can guide them somewhere safe. Guy suggests the Croods go to a mountain where there are caves because the Crood family desires a cave. Grug refuses at first, but he decides to go with the promise of a cave. The other Croods were worried that they would get tired and bicker, but Grug doesn't listen. Answer:","output":"The apocalypse that Guy warns Eep about turns out to be a series of natural disasters, starting with a massive earthquake. The earthquake ends up destroying the Croods' cave home, forcing them to venture deeper into the terrain that was previously hidden behind their cave. Guy, who has a more modern understanding of the world compared to the cave-dwelling Croods, interprets these events as signs of an \\"apocalypse.\\" He tries to persuade Eep of the upcoming danger when they first meet, primarily using the fire – something utterly new and shocking for Eep – as a symbol of the looming threat. This apocalyptic scenario forces the Croods to leave their shattered home. As they navigate through the treacherous environment filled with carnivores, omnivores, and unfamiliar fauna, such as a \\"Macawnivore\\" and swarms of \\"piranhakeets\\", it becomes clear that Guy's warning was accurate.  The family's encounter with Guy and his \\"apocalyptic\\" prediction significantly disrupts the Croods' sheltered life. It results in their migration journey towards a safer place, a mountain which Guy claims to have caves. So, in essence, the apocalypse turns out to be a seismic geographical shift that destroys the Croods' home and thrusts them into an unfamiliar world filled with dangerous creatures and environments."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After the civil war, Cowboy dedicated his life to helping the people of Dustwood, making amends for his past actions, and becoming a beloved member of the community.  One day, a group of dangerous outlaws led by the ruthless and cunning criminal boss Edgar \\"The Viper\\" Voss (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) comes to Dustwood. They wreck havoc in the town, rob the local bank, and take several hostages, including Cowboy's old flame, Elizabeth (played by Emily Blunt). Knowing the brutality and ruthlessness of The Viper's gang, Cowboy has no choice but to act. Desperate to save the hostages and protect the town he has come to love, Cowboy seeks the assistance from the local sheriff, a retired Union officer, Sheriff Martin Callahan (played by Idris Elba) who becomes reluctant ally in the fight against Voss' gang. However, their alliance does not sit well with some townsfolk, given their history in the civil war. As Cowboy investigates Voss' true objective, he discovers that a recently found gold vein running under Dustwood is what the gang is really after. Protected by the local Native American tribe and rumored to be sacred grounds, Voss plans to take over the town completely and strip the land of its gold, regardless of the bloodshed it would cause. With time running out, and the gang's violent tendencies escalating, Cowboy must step up as the sergeant he once was, rallying the town, the reluctant sheriff, and even members of the Native American tribe in a defiant stand against Voss and his outlaws. In the climactic final battle, Cowboy, Sheriff Callahan, and their makeshift militia face off against The Viper's gang in a firefight that leaves many dead on both sides. As Cowboy corners Voss inside the crumbling mine, Voss reveals that he was the one responsible for the war crime that led to Cowboy's dark past, forcing Cowboy to confront his inner demons. Eventually, Cowboy and Voss engage in a brutal and gritty duel, ending with Cowboy killing The Viper and avenging the innocent lives lost due to his former actions.  With the hostages freed, the gold vein protected, and the town of Dustwood once again safe, Cowboy takes solace in the fact that he had redeemed himself as a sergeant, by standing up for justice, showing bravery and leadership.

Whether engaging in personal or professional conversations, knowing when to speak, when to listen, and how to leave a lasting positive impression is key in developing strong relationships. This article will provide a comprehensive guide on the importance of knowing when to stop talking, practicing good hygiene, and extending a friendly and genuine farewell, as well as asking for follow-up conversations when meeting someone for the first time. By following these tips, you can strengthen your communication abilities and better connect with the people you meet. 1. Knowing When to Stop Talking Effectively navigating conversations requires striking a delicate balance between speaking and listening. To ensure that a conversation remains engaging and comfortable for both parties, it's crucial to know when to stop talking. Here are a few tips to help prevent dominating the conversation: - Be aware of non-verbal cues: Pay attention to the listener's body language, facial expressions, and eye contact. If they seem disinterested or uncomfortable, it may be time to wrap up your point. - Offer opportunities for input: Avoid long monologues and instead ask open-ended questions that invite the other person to share their thoughts and experiences. - Practice active listening: Show genuine interest in what the other person is saying. Focus on their words and respond thoughtfully to demonstrate that you value their perspective. 2. Practicing Good Hygiene While discussing interesting topics is essential for establishing connections, personal appearance and hygiene also play a crucial role in forming positive first impressions. Here are some basic steps to ensure that you present yourself well: - Maintain personal grooming: Pay attention to your hair, facial hair, nails, and overall cleanliness. Regular grooming not only improves your appearance but also boosts self-confidence. - Dress appropriately: Dress for the occasion to showcase your ability to read social cues and situations. Choose clothes that are clean, well-fitting, and in good condition. - Pay attention to oral hygiene: Fresh breath and a clean smile allow you to engage in close conversations without worry. Brush your teeth, use mouthwash, and avoid pungent foods prior to social interactions. 3. Telling Her It Was Nice to Meet Her When concluding a conversation, leave a lasting positive impression by expressing gratitude for the interaction. Saying something as simple as, \\"It was nice to meet you,\\" not only demonstrates good manners but can also solidify the connection. Moreover, using her name in your farewell statement adds a personal touch that will make her feel valued and respected. 4. Asking If She Would Like to Talk Again If the conversation was engaging and you feel a genuine connection, don't hesitate to ask if she would like to talk again or exchange contact information. This displays your interest and allows both parties to expand upon the initial connection. Keep the following points in mind: - Assess the level of connection: Gauge her interest and comfort before suggesting further communication. - Be assertive yet respectful: Express your desire to continue the conversation without being overly pushy. Allow her the opportunity to agree or decline without feeling pressured. - Offer multiple forms of communication: Providing different options, such as a phone number or social media profiles, shows flexibility and accommodates her preferred mode of communication. Conclusion Creating lasting and meaningful connections requires thoughtful communication skills and good etiquette. By knowing when to stop talking, maintaining good hygiene, extending a sincere farewell, and asking for future conversations, you demonstrate empathy and respect for the person you're engaging with. As you continue to refine your communication abilities, you'll see improvements in your personal and professional relationships, leading to a richer and more fulfilling social life."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the passage below and choose the right answer to the following question (choices are it would increase or it would decrease ):  Objects that are closer together have a stronger force of gravity between them.

He led the Conservative Party from 1927 to 1938. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Richard Bedford Bennett was born in Canada.\\"?","output":"The given paragraph does not provide explicit information about the birthplace of Richard Bedford Bennett. While it states that he was a Canadian politician and served as the 11th Prime Minister of Canada, it doesn't specifically mention where he was born. It's common for people to be associated with a country because of their political roles or residential status without being born there. Hence, based on the given information, it cannot be conclusively determined that Richard Bedford Bennett was born in Canada. Additional information about his early life, his biography, or clear reference to his birthplace would be required to draw a definitive conclusion about his place of birth. We can, however, infer from his involvement in Canadian politics and his position as Prime Minister that he likely spent a significant portion of his life in Canada, had strong ties to the country, and was influential in its political sphere during his tenure. It's also important to note that this doesn't rule out the possibility of him being born in Canada. He might very well have been born in the country, but the given paragraph does not affirm this. For a reliable answer to this query, we would need more explicit information about his birthplace. The birthplaces of public figures like Bennett, especially those holding significant offices like that of a Prime Minister, are generally documented and accessible in reliable historical records or credible biographical sources.

(1). yes; (2). it is not possible to tell; (3). no;","output":"The premise \\"You're honest\\" does entail the hypothesis \\"You have the quality of honesty,\\" so the answer is (1) yes. To elaborate further, let's break down the premise and hypothesis. Premise: \\"You're honest.\\" This statement is asserting that the subject possesses the characteristic of being honest. The word \\"honest\\" is an adjective that describes a person who tells the truth, is sincere, and does not deceive or cheat others. In this case, \\"you're\\" is a contraction of \\"you are,\\" making the statement equivalent to saying, \\"You are honest.\\"  Hypothesis: \\"You have the quality of honesty.\\" This statement is proposing that the subject has the characteristic of honesty. The word \\"honesty\\" is a noun that refers to the quality or state of being honest. Just like in the statement above, the subject is said to have a certain characteristic - the quality of honesty, which essentially means the same thing as being honest. Now, when looking at both statements together, we can see that they convey the same message about the subject possessing honesty. The premise states that the subject is honest, while the hypothesis says that the subject has the quality of honesty.  Since both statements are expressing the same idea, it can be concluded that the premise does entail the hypothesis. Hence, the answer is (1) yes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

The animal was mauled in a dogfight so Monty intends to shoot him, but changes his mind after he looks it in the eye. Monty decides to take the dog to a nearby clinic instead. Fast forward to late 2002. Monty is about to begin serving a seven-year prison sentence for dealing drugs. He sits in a park with Doyle, the dog he rescued, on his last day of freedom. He plans to meet childhood friends Frank Slaughtery and Jacob Elinsky at a club with his girlfriend Naturelle. Frank is a hotshot trader on Wall Street; Jacob is an introverted high school teacher with a crush on 17-year-old Mary, one of his students. Monty visits his father, James, a former firefighter and recovering alcoholic who owns a bar, to confirm their plans to drive to the prison the following morning. Monty's drug money helped James keep the bar, so a remorseful James sneaks a drink when Monty goes to the bathroom. Facing himself in the mirror, Monty lashes out in his mind against everyone else: all the New York stereotypes he can think of, from the cabbies to the firefighters, the corner grocers to the mobsters, as if he hates them all. Finally, he turns on himself, revealing that he is actually angry for getting greedy and having not given up drug dealing before he was caught. In a flashback, Monty remembers the night he was arrested. Detectives come to Monty's apartment while he's still there. They find the drugs immediately and not after any real search, suggesting that Monty had been betrayed. Monty sold drugs for Uncle Nikolai, a Russian mobster. Kostya tries to persuade Monty it was Naturelle who turned him in, since she knew where he hid his drugs and money. Monty refused to turn state's evidence against Nikolai, but he's not sure what Nikolai will do at the club that night.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What were the last names of the two people the advance scout troop of 90 men were under? ?  By October 9, Cos had taken over San Antonio de Béxar. Stephen F. Austin sent an advance scout troop of 90 men under James Bowie and James Fannin to observe the Mexican forces. While taking refuge at Mission Concepción on October 28, they repelled an attack by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea during the battle. Austin continued to send troops to Béxar. Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll. The resulting skirmish became known as the Grass Fight, after it was discovered that the only cargo was grass to feed the horses. When Austin was selected to join Branch T. Archer and William H. Wharton on a diplomatic mission to seek international recognition and support, Edward Burleson was named as commander. On December 5, James C. Neill began distracting Cos by firing artillery directly at the Alamo, while Benjamin Milam and Frank W. Johnson led several hundred volunteers in a surprise attack.  The fighting at the Siege of Béxar continued until December 9 when Cos sent word he wanted to surrender. Cos and his men were sent back to Mexico, but would later unite with Santa Anna's forces.Approximately 300 of the Texian garrison at Béxar departed on December 30 to join Frank W. Johnson and James Grant on the Matamoros Expedition, in a planned attack to seize the port for its financial resources. Proponents of this campaign were hoping Mexican Federalists would oust Santa Anna and restore the 1824 constitution. When Sesma crossed the Rio Grande, residents of the Gulf Coast began fleeing the area in January 1836. Santa Anna ordered General José de Urrea on February 16 to secure the Gulf Coast. About 160 miles (260 km) north of Matamoros at San Patricio, Urrea's troops ambushed Johnson and members of the expedition on February 27 at the Battle of San Patricio. Sixteen Texians were killed, six escaped, and 21 were taken prisoner. Urrea's troops then turned southwest by some 26 miles (42 km) to Agua Dulce Creek and on March 2 attacked a group of the expedition...

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - wild ride - need for rest - a massive bear - playing marbles - constructing The answer is:","output":"The kids had been having fun all day, there was now a need for rest. This option is the most suitable answer for several reasons. First, after having fun all day, it is only natural that the kids would be tired and need some time to rest and recuperate. Engaging in various activities, whether they are physical or mental, can be exhilarating but also exhausting. It's important to acknowledge the need for breaks and allocate time to recharge in order to maintain a healthy balance. Second, the need for rest falls in line with the regular rhythm of daily life and activities. Human beings, especially children, require sufficient rest to ensure proper growth and development, both physically and mentally. Adequate rest allows children to process the experiences and learning of the day, build resilience and self-regulation, and improve overall well-being. The other options do not fit as well with the context of the question. While a \\"wild ride\\" could be a possible activity the kids might have experienced earlier in the day, it doesn't necessarily follow as the next immediate consequence of having fun all day. Similarly, \\"playing marbles\\" or \\"constructing\\" are specific activities that might not correlate with the activities the kids had been partaking in all day. Furthermore, \\"a massive bear\\" appears unrelated to the context of the question. It would be an unexpected and extreme situation if a massive bear suddenly appeared after the kids had been having fun all day. The presence of a bear would also likely introduce an element of danger, which is not implied by the question. Thus, based on a logical understanding of the context and the most natural outcome of spending an entire day engaging in fun activities, the most suitable answer is that there was now a need for rest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It occurs between particles or objects. It causes them to attract or repel each other. They do not even have to touch. This is unlike the typical push or pull you may be familiar with. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge. An electron has a negative electric charge. Forces on Charged Objects Most atoms are balanced electrically. They have the same number of positive and negative charges. Therefore, the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Neutrons do not matter as they have no charge. When an object loses some electrons, it becomes positively charged. There are now more protons than electrons inside the atom. The lost electrons may remain free. Or, they may attach to another object. The new object now has more electrons than protons. It then becomes negatively charged.

Later that year he resigned his conductorship of the Russian Music Society orchestra, to be replaced by Balakirev. Tchaikovsky had already promised his Characteristic Dances (then called Dances of the Hay Maidens) from his opera The Voyevoda to the society. In submitting the manuscript (and perhaps mindful of Cui's review of the cantata), Tchaikovsky included a note to Balakirev that ended with a request for a word of encouragement should the Dances not be performed.At this point The Five as a unit was dispersing. Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov wanted to remove themselves from Balakirev's influence, which they now found stifling, and go in their individual directions as composers. Balakirev might have sensed a potential new disciple in Tchaikovsky. He explained in his reply from Saint Petersburg that while he preferred to give his opinions in person and at length to press his points home, he was couching his reply \\"with complete frankness\\", adding, with a deft touch of flattery, that he felt that Tchaikovsky was \\"a fully fledged artist\\" and that he looked forward to discussing the piece with him on an upcoming trip to Moscow.These letters set the tone for Tchaikovsky's relationship with Balakirev over the next two years. At the end of this period, in 1869, Tchaikovsky was a 28-year-old professor at the Moscow Conservatory. Having written his first symphony and an opera, he next composed a symphonic poem entitled Fatum. Initially pleased with the piece when Nikolai Rubinstein conducted it in Moscow, Tchaikovsky dedicated it to Balakirev and sent it to him to conduct in Saint Petersburg. Fatum received only a lukewarm reception there. Balakirev wrote a detailed letter to Tchaikovsky in which he explained what he felt were defects in Fatum but also gave some encouragement. He added that he considered the dedication of the music to him as \\"precious to me as a sign of your sympathy towards me—and I feel a great weakness for you\\"....  Guess a valid title for it!

On the last day of British rule in Hong Kong late 1997, Detective Inspector Lee of the Hong Kong Police Force leads a raid at a shipping bar wharf, hoping to arrest the mysterious crime lord Juntao. He finds only Sang, Juntao's right-hand man, who manages to escape. However, Lee successfully recovers numerous Chinese cultural treasures stolen by Juntao, which he presents as a farewell victory to his departing superiors: Chinese Consul Solon Han and British Commander Thomas Griffin. Shortly after Han arrives in the United States to take up his new diplomatic post in Los Angeles, his daughter, Soo Yung, is kidnapped by Sang while on her way to her first day of school. The FBI informs Consul Han about the incident. Han calls in Lee to assist in the case. The FBI, afraid that the injury or death of Lee would result in negative attention internationally, decides to pawn him off on the LAPD just to keep him out of their way. The selfish, stubborn, and maverick Detective James Carter is tricked into doing this but Carter makes a plan to solve the case himself when he finds out that he has been given a boring task as punishment for botching a sting operation. Carter meets Lee at Los Angeles International Airport and proceeds to take him on a sightseeing tour of LA, simultaneously keeping Lee away from the embassy and contacting several of his underworld informants about the kidnapping.

According to Shell geoscientist Marion King Hubbert , the production rate of a limited resource will follow a roughly symmetrical logistic distribution curve -LRB- similar in shape to the bell-curve -RRB- based on the limits of exploitability and market pressures . 4. The reserves of unconventional oil , however , are so massive that they dwarf the current reserves of conventional oil , the tar sands in Canada alone have estimated reserves of 1.7 trillion and possibly as much as 2.5 trillion barrels of oil equivalent , so that we can effectively postpone peak oil for decades , if not centuries -LRB- 2011 and 2011 -RRB- . 5. The effects of this will be devastating : oil prices will rise , global transport chains will fall silent and the use of many other oil-related products , like plastics , in our everyday life will be near impossible .","output":"The argument implied by these sentences revolves around the concept of peak oil, the point in time when the production of oil reaches its maximum and begins to decline, as well as the potential consequences and mitigations related to this phenomenon. The first sentence introduces the notion that a transition to other technologies and renewable energies can occur if enough time is provided, suggesting that society should shift its dependence from oil. The second sentence highlights that oil field discoveries peaked in 1965 and that global energy demands continue to rise, implying that we might reach the peak oil point in the coming decades, after which oil production will decline rapidly. The third sentence brings in the perspective of Shell geoscientist Marion King Hubbert, who postulates that the production rate of a limited resource, like oil, will follow a symmetrical logistic distribution curve influenced by exploitable limits and market pressures. This reinforces the idea that oil production will eventually decline as resources become depleted. However, the fourth sentence points out that reserves of unconventional oil sources, such as tar sands in Canada, are vast enough to dwarf current conventional oil reserves. These vast reserves have the potential to postpone the peak oil phenomenon for decades or even centuries. This introduces the possibility that the peak oil crisis might not be as imminent as suggested earlier in the argument. Finally, the fifth sentence describes the catastrophic consequences of reaching peak oil without taking adequate measures to transition away from oil dependency. As per the argument, oil prices would soar, leading to the disruption of global transportation chains, and the use of various oil-related products, like plastics, in everyday life would become nearly impossible. In summary, the argument centers around the predictions and consequences of peak oil, as well as the role of unconventional oil reserves in mitigating the issue. The implied argument emphasizes the need for society to transition to renewable energy sources and alternative technologies in order to evade the potentially devastating implications of reaching peak oil."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First, even though it states that it is 16\\"x20\\", the visible \\"window\\" is actually 1/4\\" bigger in both directions, which means if you have a 16\\" x 20\\" picture/poster, there is a 1/4\\" of VISIBLE cardboard backing in each direction. Second, there is only one nail/screw hole in each direction, which means if your picture is landscape, you have a 20\\"-wide picture hanging only by the center point (tilts too easily). There should be one in each corner. Finally, it arrived with a very small hairline crack in the glass. Doesn't seem like enough to mess with returning it, but makes a visible white line on the black border of my poster. Answer: Pick from: a). No b). Yes Answer:","output":"a).

Please answer the following question: Process: - Green is a color that gathers sunlight easily - Sunlight is gathered by the leaves of the plant - The sunlight is broken down into glucose through photosynthesis - The glucose travels the plant - The plant uses that glucose as energy to grow.  Question: suppose There is more sunlight available happens, how will it affect More glucose can be produced using the sunlight.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"If there is more sunlight available, it would indeed have an effect on the amount of glucose produced by the plant through photosynthesis. The process of photosynthesis relies heavily on sunlight, as it is the primary energy source used by plants to convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose.  This glucose is then used by the plant as a source of energy for growth and development. Therefore, an increase in sunlight availability will generally lead to more glucose being produced, assuming that other necessary conditions for photosynthesis, like water and carbon dioxide, are sufficiently available.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Complete silence is found only in laboratories called anechoic  rooms. The walls and ceilings, made of blocks of special sound-sucking materials, are more than three feet thick, while floor coverings are six-foot layers of feathers or cotton wool. Silence here can be as painful to the ears as the din(continuous loud noise) of a steelworks or a rocket blast-off, yet scientists get used to this and stay in these silent rooms for hours at a time, using microphones and electronic equipment to test the various materials being developed to make the world a less noisy place. Architects have used scientific discoveries to solve noise problem in a number of ways. Walls are hollowed (having empty space inside) and then filled with sound-sucking materials similar to cotton wool. Extra-thick carpets  cover the floors, and thick woolen curtains cover the windows. Air conditioning and heating channels are made less noisy by having the air passing through hundreds of tiny holes in baffles  made of sheets of soundsucking materials. Unfortunately, these techniques and others often work too well in some buildings. Noise-proof rooms become almost anechoic and people living in them are disturbed by the lack of sound.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Abstract: We have previously shown that YB-1 is the only protein of the HEK293 cell cytoplasmic (S100) extract that specifically interacts with RNA hairpins each containing one of the motifs ACCAGCCU (1), CAGUGAGC (2) and UAAUCCCA (3), which had been identified as often found in exosomal RNA and proposed as potential cis-acting elements targeting RNAs into exosomes. Here we explored the interactions of YB-1 with a fragment of the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of septin 14 mRNA (SEPT14 RNA), which contains all three motifs. We demonstrated the occurrence of YB-1 among proteins pulled down from the HEK293 S100 extract using biotinylated SEPT14 RNA. With recombinant YB-1, it was found that SEPT14 RNA can bind up to 5 moles of protein per mole of RNA in a cooperative manner, which was shown to be mainly facilitated by the presence of the above motifs. RNA hairpins with motifs 1 and 2 competed with SEPT14 RNA for binding to the protein, whereas that with motif 3 was less competitive, in accordance with the affinity of YB-1 for these RNA hairpins. With YB-1-bound RNA, nucleotides protected from attack by hydroxyl radicals were revealed in all three motifs, although hairpins with motif 2 and especially with motif 1 contained many protected nucleotides outside the motifs, suggesting that the specific environments of these motifs contribute significantly to the YB-1 binding. An analysis of the environments of motifs 1-3 in the HEK293 cell mRNA 3' UTRs gained from RNA-seq data led us to conclude that the primary binding sites of YB-1 in the 3' UTRs are hairpins containing some part of the motif along with its specific surroundings; the consensus sequences of these hairpins were derived. Thus, our findings provide a new understanding of the structural basis of the interactions between YB-1 and mRNAs carrying the aforementioned motifs.. Title: Structural features of the interaction of the 3'-untranslated region of mRNA containing exosomal RNA-specific motifs with YB-1, a potential mediator of mRNA sorting.

One of the most critical components of a printer are the rollers, as they are responsible for feeding the paper through the printing process. Over time, these rollers can accumulate dust, dirt, and other debris, which can lead to paper jams, poor print quality, or worse, complete printer failure. To maintain the performance of your printer and extend its lifespan, it is vital to clean the printer rollers at regular intervals. In this article, we will provide a detailed step-by-step guide on locating the printer rollers, how to clean them effectively with a lint-free cloth and water, and the importance of using a rubber rejuvenating product to ensure peak printer performance. Step 1: Locate the Printer Rollers The first step in cleaning the printer rollers is to locate them within the printer. The location of the rollers may vary depending on the make and model of your printer. Typically, you can find the rollers in the following areas: 1. The paper feed area: This is where the paper is fed into the printer. Rollers are generally visible and accessible when you open the paper tray or rear access door.  2. The output tray: Rollers can also be found in the output tray, where the printed paper is ejected. These might be located near the top or bottom of the tray, depending on your printer model. Step 2: Clean the Rollers with a Lint-Free Cloth and Water Once you have located the rollers, the next step is to clean them. Follow these steps to ensure a thorough cleaning: 1. Turn off and unplug your printer to avoid any possible electrical hazards during the cleaning process. 2. Remove any paper from the paper tray or output tray to prevent damage. 3. Prepare a lint-free cloth and dampen it with water. Avoid using harsh chemicals or solvents, as they can damage the rollers. Water is usually sufficient to remove most dirt and debris. 4. Gently press the damp cloth against the rollers and use a circular motion to clean the entire surface of each roller. Be sure to clean the rollers thoroughly, ensuring that no debris is left behind. 5. Allow the rollers to dry completely before reassembling the printer. This may take several minutes, depending on the humidity in your environment. Step 3: Use a Rubber Rejuvenating Product After cleaning the rollers, it is recommended to use a rubber rejuvenating product specifically designed for printer rollers. This product helps to maintain the flexibility, grip, and longevity of the rollers. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application and frequency of use. Conclusion: By following these simple steps, you can effectively clean your printer rollers and ensure the continued optimal performance of your printer. Regular maintenance not only prevents paper jams and print quality issues but also extends the life of your printer, saving you time, frustration, and money in the long run. So, make it a habit to clean your printer rollers and enjoy hassle-free printing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Review: Sorrow Creek has a number of legends attached to it that are explained in a very mundane fashion in the film. Kayla (Freya Ravensbergen) our token eye candy and her sister Jesse (Christina Caron) head off to a cabin near this area along with two male friends. Then weird things happen.The film quality was poor. It looked like it was 1970's VHS. The bright daylight scenes were out of focus. Stephen Walker who played Daniel Fields can't act, and that is putting it nicely. The end scene with Kayla was filmed similar to a found footage scene with the camera laying on the ground. Why? Who knows. The film has a few decent horror scenes, but needed to tie the story together better to make them meaningful. The lack of a good story made good scenes boring.Parental Guide: F-bomb.

Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Some futurologists have assumed that the vast upsurge  of women in the workforce may mean a rejection of marriage. Many women, according to this hypothesis, would rather work than marry. The converse  of this concern is that becoming a multi-paycheck household could encourage marriage. In the past, only the earnings and financial prospects of the man counted in the marriage decision. Now, however, the earning ability of a woman can make her more attractive as a marriage partner. Data show that economic downturns tend to put off marriage because the parties cannot afford to establish a family or are concerned about rainy days ahead. As the economy comes to life, the number of marriages also rises. The increase in divorce rates follows to the increase in women working outside the home. Yet, it may be wrong to jump to any simple cause-and-effect conclusions. The impact of a wife's work on divorce is no less cloudy than its impact on marriage decisions. The realization that she can be a good provider may increase the chances that a working wife will choose divorce over an unsatisfactory marriage. But the reverse is equally plausible . Tensions grounded in financial problems often play a key role in ending a marriage. By raising a family's standard of living, a working wife may strengthen her family's financial and emotional stability. Psychological factors also should be considered. For example, a wife blocked from a career outside the home may feel caged in the house. She may view her only choice as seeking a divorce. On the other hand, if she can find fulfillment through work outside the home, work and marriage can go together to create a stronger and more stable union. Also, a major part of women's inequality in marriage has been due to the fact that, in most cases, men have remained the main breadwinners. A working wife may rob a husband of being the master of the house. Depending upon how the couple reacts to these new conditions, it could create a stronger equal partnership or it could create new insecurities. Question: If women find fulfillment through work outside the home,  _  . - they are more likely to dominate their marriage partners - their husbands are expected to do more housework - their marriage ties can be strengthened - they tend to put their career before marriage Answer:","output":"If women find fulfillment through work outside the home, their marriage ties can be strengthened. This is because work and marriage can go together to create a stronger and more stable union, as the wife can find fulfillment outside the home and as a result, contribute positively to her marriage and family life. Additionally, a working wife may contribute to a more equal partnership in the marriage, as both partners are contributing financially and sharing the responsibility of being a breadwinner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

College student Charley, along with his new girlfriend, Alex Young, go to visit Peter Vincent, who is again a burnt-out vampire killer on Fright Night, much to the chagrin of Charley.

An upset Alex storms off, not realizing that something is following her. Another girl leaves the dorm as Alex enters, and she is followed and killed by one of Regine's vampires, Belle. Alex, meanwhile, is unaware that Louie, another of Regine's group, is scaling up the wall outside her window, but he is startled and falls when Alex inadvertently slams her window shut on his hands. Bozworth, a bug-eating servant of Regine, makes fun of Louie before consuming some bugs. Later that night, Charley dreams that Regine comes to visit him, only to turn into a vampire and bite him.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that told Galabert \\"In two years she will be my wife!\\" , can you please find it?   Not long after Fromental Halévy's death in 1862, Bizet had been approached on behalf of Mme. Halévy about completing his old tutor's unfinished opera Noé. Although no action was taken at that time, Bizet remained on friendly terms with the Halévy family. Fromental had left two daughters; the elder, Esther, died in 1864, an event which so traumatised Mme. Halévy that she could not tolerate the company of her younger daughter Geneviève, who from the age of 15 lived with other family members. It is unclear when Geneviève and Bizet became emotionally attached, but in October 1867, he informed Galabert: \\"I have met an adorable girl whom I love! In two years she will be my wife!\\" The pair became engaged, although the Halévy family initially disallowed the match. According to Bizet they considered him an unsuitable catch: \\"penniless, left-wing, anti-religious and Bohemian\\", which Dean observes are odd grounds of objection from \\"a family bristling with artists and eccentrics\\". By summer 1869, their objections had been overcome, and the wedding took place on 3 June 1869. Ludovic Halévy wrote in his journal: \\"Bizet has spirit and talent. He should succeed\\".As a belated homage to his late father-in-law, Bizet took up the Noé manuscript and completed it. Parts of his moribund Vasco da Gama and Ivan IV were incorporated into the score, but a projected production at the Théâtre Lyrique failed to materialise when Carvalho's company finally went bankrupt, and Noé remained unperformed until 1885. Bizet's marriage was initially happy, but was affected by Geneviève's nervous instability (inherited from both her parents), her difficult relations with her mother and by Mme. Halévy's interference in the couple's affairs. Despite this, Bizet kept on good terms with his mother-in-law and maintained an extensive correspondence with her. In the year following the marriage, he considered plans for at least half a dozen new operas and began to sketch the music for two of them: Clarissa Harlowe based on Samuel Richardson's novel... The answer to this question is:","output":"Georges Bizet is the name of the person who told Galabert, \\"In two years she will be my wife!\\", referring to Geneviève Halévy, Fromental Halévy's younger daughter. The couple eventually got married on 3 June 1869, overcoming the initial objections from the Halévy family."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: The Ocean Cleanup, the Dutch foundation developing advanced technologies to rid the oceans of plastic, today presented the initial findings of its Aerial Expedition -- a series of low-speed, low-altitude flights across the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, the plastic accumulation zone between Hawaii and California. Using a modified C-130 Hercules aircraft, expert spotters, and an experimental array of plastic scanning equipment, the expedition aims to accurately measure the biggest and most harmful debris in the ocean. This is an essential milestone in preparation for the cleanup of the patch, scheduled to begin before the end of the decade.      This first-ever aerial survey of floating ocean plastic provided confirmation of the abundance of plastic debris sized 0.5 m/1.5' and up. While the flight plan took us along the Northern boundary of the patch, more debris was recorded than what is expected to be found in the heart of the accumulation zone. Initial estimates of the experienced observer crew indicate that in a span of 2.5hours, over a thousand items were counted.      For the development of a cleanup technology, it is essential to understand the problem, specifically the dimensions of the individual objects and the plastic accumulation as a whole. The nature and amount of the debris determine the design of cleanup systems, the logistics of hauling plastic back to shore, the methods for recycling plastic, and the costs of the cleanup.      The quest to answer this question started in August 2015, when The Ocean Cleanup's fleet of about 30 vessels crossed the patch simultaneously in an operation named the Mega Expedition. On their crossing wide range of debris sizes were sampled, producing the first high-resolution map of the patch. By using sampling nets that were 80x larger than conventional scientific measurement tools, it was discovered that the amount of large debris was heavily underestimated.      The Mega Expedition successfully measured plastic up to 0.5m/1.5' in size, but there were signs of a significant mass of plastic even larger than that. This includes \\"ghost nets\\" -- discarded fishing nets many meters in diameter, which are notorious for ensnaring sea life and ship propellers. To accurately quantify those and other very large debris, a much larger area must be covered, which lead to the launch of the Aerial Expedition. For every 5 minutes of flight the same ocean surface area is scanned that was covered by the entire Mega Expedition in 2015. This increase in survey area enables the quantification of the largest pieces of trash in the ocean, resolving the last piece of this puzzle.      Once all exploration flights are finalized later this week, the results from the Aerial Expedition will be combined with the data collected during the 2015 Mega Expedition in a peer-reviewed scientific paper expected to be published early 2017.      Founded in 2013 by then 18-year-old Boyan Slat, The Ocean Cleanup now employs approximately 50 engineers and researchers. The foundation is headquartered in Delft, The Netherlands.      Instead of going after plastic debris with vessels and nets - which would take many thousands of years and billions of dollars to complete - The Ocean Cleanup is designing a network of extremely long floating barriers that will remain stationary in the water, enabling the ocean to concentrate the plastic using its own currents. ||||| Over five trillion pieces of plastic are floating in our oceans says most comprehensive study to date on plastic pollution around the world      More than five trillion pieces of plastic, collectively weighing nearly 269,000 tonnes, are floating in the world’s oceans, causing damage throughout the food chain, new research has found.      Data collected by scientists from the US, France, Chile, Australia and New Zealand suggests a minimum of 5.25tn plastic particles in the oceans, most of them “micro plastics” measuring less than 5mm.      The volume of plastic pieces, largely deriving from products such as food and drink packaging and clothing, was calculated from data taken from 24 expeditions over a six-year period to 2013. The research, published in the journal PLOS One, is the first study to look at plastics of all sizes in the world’s oceans.      Large pieces of plastic can strangle animals such as seals, while smaller pieces are ingested by fish and then fed up the food chain, all the way to humans.      This is problematic due to the chemicals contained within plastics, as well as the pollutants that plastic attract once they are in the marine environment.      “We saw turtles that ate plastic bags and fish that ingested fishing lines,” said Julia Reisser, a researcher based at the University of Western Australia. “But there are also chemical impacts. When plastic gets into the water it acts like a magnet for oily pollutants.      “Bigger fish eat the little fish and then they end up on our plates. It’s hard to tell how much pollution is being ingested but certainly plastics are providing some of it.”      The researchers collected small plastic fragments in nets, while larger pieces were observed from boats. The northern and southern sections of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans were surveyed, as well as the Indian ocean, the coast of Australia and the Bay of Bengal.      The vast amount of plastic, weighing 268,940 tonnes, includes everything from plastic bags to fishing gear debris.      While spread out around the globe, much of this rubbish accumulates in five large ocean gyres, which are circular currents that churn up plastics in a set area. Each of the major oceans have plastic-filled gyres, including the well-known ‘great Pacific garbage patch’ that covers an area roughly equivalent to Texas.      Reisser said traversing the large rubbish-strewn gyres in a boat was like sailing through “plastic soup.”      “You put a net through it for half an hour and there’s more plastic than marine life there,” she said. “It’s hard to visualise the sheer amount, but the weight of it is more than the entire biomass of humans. It’s quite an alarming problem that’s likely to get worse.”      The research found that the gyres themselves are likely to contribute to the problem, acting as “shredders” to the plastic before dispersing it.      “Our findings show that the garbage patches in the middle of the five subtropical gyres are not the final resting places for the world’s floating plastic trash,” said Marcus Eriksen, another of the report’s co-authors. “The endgame for micro-plastic is interactions with entire ocean ecosystems.”      The research, the first of its kind to pull together data on floating plastic from around the world, will be used to chart future trends in the amount of debris in the oceans.            But researchers predict the volume will increase due to rising production of throwaway plastic, with only 5% of the world’s plastic currently recycled.      “Lots of things are used once and then not recycled,” Reisser said. “We need to improve our use of plastic and also monitor plastics in the oceans so we get a better understanding of the issue.      “I’m optimistic but we need to get policy makers to understand the problem. Some are doing that – Germany has changed the policy so that manufacturers are responsible for the waste they produce. If we put more responsibility on to the producer then that would be part of the solution.”       ||||| The vast patch of garbage floating in the Pacific Ocean is far worse than previously thought, with an aerial survey finding a much larger mass of fishing nets, plastic containers and other discarded items than imagined.      A reconnaissance flight taken in a modified C-130 Hercules aircraft found a vast clump of mainly plastic waste at the northern edge of what is known as the “great Pacific garbage patch”, located between Hawaii and California.      The density of rubbish was several times higher than the Ocean Cleanup, a foundation part-funded by the Dutch government to rid the oceans of plastics, expected to find even at the heart of the patch, where most of the waste is concentrated.      “Normally when you do an aerial survey of dolphins or whales, you make a sighting and record it,” said Boyan Slat, the founder of the Ocean Cleanup.      “That was the plan for this survey. But then we opened the door and we saw the debris everywhere. Every half second you see something. So we had to take snapshots – it was impossible to record everything. It was bizarre to see that much garbage in what should be pristine ocean.”      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Boyan Slat, founder of the Ocean Cleanup. Photograph: The Ocean Cleanup      The heart of the garbage patch is thought to be around 1m sq km (386,000 sq miles), with the periphery spanning a further 3.5m sq km (1,351,000 sq miles). The dimensions of this morass of waste are continually morphing, caught in one of the ocean’s huge rotating currents. The north Pacific gyre has accumulated a soup of plastic waste, including large items and smaller broken-down micro plastics that can be eaten by fish and enter the food chain.      According to the UN environmental programme, the great Pacific garbage patch is growing so fast that it, like the Great Wall of China, is becoming visible from space.      Last year, the Ocean Cleanup sent 30 vessels to cross the patch to scoop up micro plastics in fine nets to estimate the extent of the problem. However, the new reconnaissance flights from California have found that large items of more than half a meter in size have been “heavily underestimated”.      Slat said: “Most of the debris was large stuff. It’s a ticking time bomb because the big stuff will crumble down to micro plastics over the next few decades if we don’t act.”      Following a further aerial survey through the heart of the patch on Sunday, the Ocean Cleanup aims to tackle the problem through a gigantic V-shaped boom, which would use sea currents to funnel floating rubbish into a cone. A prototype of the vulcanized rubber barrier will be tested next year, with a full-sized 100km (62-mile) barrier deployed by 2020 if trials go well.      The boom will not be able to suck up all of the strewn rubbish, however, with Slat warning that plastic is “quite persistent. We need to clean it up, but we also need to prevent so much entering the oceans. Better recycling, better product design and some legislation is all part of that. We need a combination of things.”      The full scale of plastic pollution was revealed in 2014, when a study found there were more than 5tn pieces of plastic floating in our oceans. In 2014, 311m tonnes of plastic were produced around the world, a 20-fold increase since 1964. It is expected to quadruple again by mid-century.      A report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation earlier this year predicted there would be more plastic than fish in the oceans by 2050 unless urgent action was taken. ||||| Julia has done her undergrad and masters in Oceanography at FURG in South Brazil.

Title: Family Plot Movie plot: A fake psychic, Blanche Tyler (Barbara Harris), and her boyfriend, George Lumley (Bruce Dern), attempt to locate the nephew of a wealthy and guilt-ridden elderly woman, Julia Rainbird (Cathleen Nesbitt). Julia's deceased sister gave the baby boy up for adoption, but Julia now wants to make him her heir, and will pay Blanche 10,000 if the man, Edward Shoebridge, can be found. George Lumley discovers that Shoebridge is thought to be dead, but he tracks down another criminal, Joseph Maloney (Ed Lauter), who paid for the tombstone over an empty grave. Shoebridge murdered his adoptive parents, faked his own death and is now a successful jeweler in San Francisco known as Arthur Adamson (William Devane). He and his live-in girlfriend, Fran (Karen Black), kidnap millionaires and dignitaries, returning them in exchange for ransoms in the form of valuable gemstones. Arthur conceals an enormous diamond in plain sight in their crystal chandelier. Arthur enlists Maloney, who had helped murder his adoptive parents, to kill Blanche and George. Maloney initially refuses to help, but then contacts Blanche and George, telling them to meet him at a cafÃ© atop a mountain. He cuts the brake line of Blanche's car, but the couple manage to survive a dangerous high-speed descent. Maloney then tries to run them over, but dies in a fiery explosion when he swerves to avoid an oncoming car and tumbles down the mountain. At Maloney's funeral, his mother (Katherine Helmond) tearfully confesses to George that Shoebridge's name is now Arthur Adamson. George has to go to work, so Blanche tracks down various A. Adamsons in San Francisco, eventually reaching the jewelry store as it closes for the day. Arthur's assistant Mrs. Clay (Edith Atwater) offers to let Blanche leave a note, but Blanche says she is Arthur's friend and asks for his address.

Popper claimed to have recognised already in the 1934 version of his Logic of Discovery a fact later stressed by Kuhn, \\"that scientists necessarily develop their ideas within a definite theoretical framework\\", and to that extent to have anticipated Kuhn's central point about \\"normal science\\". (But Popper criticised what he saw as Kuhn's relativism.) Also, in his collection Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge (Harper & Row, 1963), Popper writes, \\"Science must begin with myths, and with the criticism of myths; neither with the collection of observations, nor with the invention of experiments, but with the critical discussion of myths, and of magical techniques and practices. The scientific tradition is distinguished from the pre-scientific tradition in having two layers. Like the latter, it passes on its theories; but it also passes on a critical attitude towards them. The theories are passed on, not as dogmas, but rather with the challenge to discuss them and improve upon them.\\" Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What did Kuhn say must be the beginning phase of science?","output":"Thomas Kuhn's view on the beginning phase of science differs from that of Karl Popper. Kuhn believed that the beginning phase of science was not about criticizing myths, but rather about the establishment of a \\"paradigm,\\" which serves as a foundation for scientific inquiry. In Kuhn's seminal work, \\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\\" (1962), he introduced the concept of a paradigm—a set of widely accepted theories, methods, and assumptions that constitute a framework within which scientists work. According to Kuhn, the beginning phase of science is when a scientific community adopts a paradigm that provides a shared way of understanding and conducting research on a specific problem or set of problems. The establishment of a dominant paradigm leads to a period of \\"normal science,\\" characterized by the reinforcement of the paradigm through puzzle-solving within its framework. As researchers continue to work within a paradigm, they may eventually discover anomalies or contradictions that cannot be explained by the existing theories. Over time, these anomalies may lead to a crisis that necessitates a revolutionary shift in scientific understanding, resulting in the emergence of a new paradigm. In summary, whereas Popper emphasized the critical discussion of myths and the falsification of theories as the starting point of science, Kuhn argued that the beginning phase of science was characterized by the establishment of a shared paradigm that guides scientific inquiry. This contrast highlights the different perspectives of the two philosophers on the nature of scientific progress and the process by which scientific knowledge is developed and transformed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Census Bureau?, using the article: For at least 10,000 years, a variety of indigenous peoples populated the Willamette Valley. These included the Kalapuya, the Chinook, and the Clackamas. The territory of the Clackamas encompassed the northeastern portion of the basin, including the Clackamas River (with which their name is shared). Although it is unclear exactly when, the territory of the Chinook once extended across the northern part of the watershed, through the Columbia River valley. Indigenous peoples of the Willamette Valley were further divided into groups including the Kalapuyan-speaking Yamhill and Atfalati (Tualatin) (both Northern Kalapuya), Central Kalapuya like the Santiam, Muddy Creek (Chemapho), Long Tom (Chelamela), Calapooia (Tsankupi), Marys River (Chepenafa) and Luckiamute, and the Yoncalla or Southern Kalapuya, as well other tribes such as the Chuchsney-Tufti, Siuslaw and Molala. The name Willamette is of indigenous origin, deriving from the French pronunciation of the name of a Clackamas Native American village. However, Native American languages in Oregon were very similar, so the name may also be derived from Kalapuya dialects. Around the year 1850, the Kalapuya numbered between 2,000 and 3,000 and were distributed among several groups. These figures are only speculative; there may have been as few as eight subgroups or as many as 16. In that time period, the Clackamas' tribal population was roughly 1,800. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the Chinook population was nearly 5,000, though not all of the Chinook lived on the Willamette. The Chinook territory encompassed the lower Columbia River valley and significant stretches of the Pacific coast on both the north and the south side of the Columbia's mouth. At times, however, the Chinook territory extended even farther south in the Willamette Valley. The total native population was estimated at about 15,000.The indigenous peoples of the Willamette River practiced a variety of life ways. Those on the lower river, slightly closer to the coast, often relied on fishing as..., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","output":"The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the Chinook population was nearly 5,000.

Write an article with the title: \\"David French blasts FOX News for 'killing the conservative movement'\\"","output":"Title: David French blasts FOX News for 'killing the conservative movement' Subtitle: Renowned conservative voice, lawyer and author adds to growing criticism of the influential conservative news outlet for biased reporting and sowing division within the movement. Introduction: In recent times, the conservative movement in the United States has faced mounting splits and internal divisions. One prominent conservative voice, David French, has laid the blame squarely at the feet of a key media outlet - FOX News. In a scathing critique, French accuses FOX News of not only contributing to the disintegration of the conservative movement but also its role in facilitating an environment that fosters division and polarization &mdash; a far cry from the intentions of its founders. This article delves into the accusations leveled by French and the ramifications they may have on the future of conservatism in America. David French's condemnation of FOX News: David French, a respected conservative commentator, lawyer, and author, has lately expressed his disappointment and frustration towards the right-wing news outlet, FOX News. According to French, FOX News has morphed into a divisive force that prioritizes financial gain and ratings over authentic conservative values. In abandoning its journalistic integrity in pursuit of exclusives, access to power, and sensationalism, French believes that FOX has played a significant role in \\"killing the conservative movement.\\" In his critique, French highlights several areas where he contends FOX News has overstepped the boundaries of responsible journalism. These include: 1. The echo chamber effect: French asserts that FOX News has developed into an echo chamber where viewers are shown polarized perspectives, fueling a feedback loop of confirmation bias. This, in turn, solidifies entrenched positions and a perceived dogma, inhibiting productive discussion among conservatives and further fragmenting the movement. 2. Partisanship and bias: He believes that the channel's shows have veered towards blatant partisanship, which undermines the pursuit of truth and factual reporting. Such biased programming reinforces the \\"us versus them\\" mentality and fosters a culture of animosity and division within the conservative movement. 3. Amplification of conspiracy theories: French also accuses FOX News of irresponsibly giving airtime to conspiracy theories and fringe ideas, further muddying the waters of truth and fact. By doing this, the channel has not only incited chaos and confusion but also discredited the intellectual basis of conservatism. 4. Cozying up to power: Lastly, French alleges that FOX News has become entangled with political figures and power structures in the United States, thus losing sight of its original journalistic mission. He posits that this connection has led to a situation where the network no longer serves as a watchdog for democracy but as an enabler of dangerous political trends and rhetoric. The ramifications for the conservative movement: FOX News’ alleged straying from its founding principles and journalistic integrity has had a profound effect on those who identify as conservatives. French cites a fracturing of the conservative movement, with rifts appearing between groups and individuals. The breaking down of a unified front has made it harder to collaborate on shared goals and to tackle the big issues facing the United States and the movement itself. Additionally, the perceived distortion of conservative ideas and values propagated by FOX News has, as French argues, provoked a crisis of faith in the movement's intelligentsia. As a result, a growing number of conservatives have begun seeking alternative sources of information and new avenues of political thought, leading to a weakening of the once-dominant conservative base. Conclusion: In lamenting the ongoing damage to the conservative movement, David French's critique of FOX News raises serious concerns regarding media bias, responsible journalism, and the role of news networks in shaping political discourse. While it remains to be seen whether his criticisms will prompt any change in the network's behavior and policies, it is abundantly clear that its influence over conservatism in America cannot be understated. As French suggests, the future of the conservative movement will be profoundly affected if the news outlet persists on its present course, straying ever further from the ideals that initially inspired and united like-minded individuals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Harry doesn't really recognize him at first but there appears to be a contrast between the two of them with Milt boasting of how well he is doing in life while Harry tries to listen. Milt takes Harry to his house to meet Ellen Manville (Elaine May), Milt's long-suffering wife. She is complaining that their sex life is non-existent but Milt has a secret lover in the form of beautiful blonde Linda. Milt convinces a barely-there Harry to make a go of things with Ellen so that she is not left lonely when he will divorce her for Linda. It takes a while but Harry and Ellen eventually fall in love. They marry and go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon but this is when Ellen realizes that Harry is the world's worst roommate and childish at heart. In one example, Harry unexpectedly stomps on Ellen's toe in order to test her love for him.  As she hobbles in pain, she asks, \\"What did you do that for?,\\" and in response, he asks her if she still loves him, and she says she does. As Milt and Linda start to settle down as a couple, she quickly realizes that he has an addiction to selling household items and junk for a quick buck, something that she is strongly against. She immediately dumps him, which leads to Milt to want Ellen back when he realizes how much he loves her for real. She admits that she doesn't really love Harry as much as she thought, as his bizarre day-to-day activities get to her.

It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it.  Paragraph: Kathy and Jacob are two coworkers out having a drink at a bar after a day at the office. They both wear glasses and Kathy comments that she hates that she is so farsighted and wishes there was a surgery to fix it. Jacob says that he finds it amusing she is farsighted because he himself is nearsighted. They both laugh at the opposite nature of their eye condition, and then both look at the menu on the other side of the room to decide what drinks to order next.

The putrid odor filled the room.","output":"The sentence, \\"The putrid odor filled the room,\\" suggests several effects that could transpire during this particular situation. In a more detailed and comprehensive manner, the implications of this scenario are as follows: 1. Discomfort and Distress: A putrid odor usually results from decomposition, deterioration, or decay, which often causes uneasiness and distress in individuals who come across it. The strong smell's pervasiveness can lead to discomfort and perhaps even difficulty breathing, depending on the intensity of the odor. 2. Physical Reactions: The strong and repulsive nature of this odor might trigger several physical reactions in individuals who are present in the room. For instance, reflexes like coughing, gagging, or sneezing can be expected as the body attempts to clear the offensive aroma. In more severe cases, people exposed to putrid odors may develop headaches and nausea, leading to vomiting. 3. Evacuation of the Room: When faced with an overpowering putrid smell, the immediate reaction for most people would be to leave the room to escape the unpleasant experience. In this scenario, it's likely that any occupants in the room would promptly vacate the area in search of fresher, more breathable air.  4. Attempts to Eliminate or Mask the Odor: As the putrid odor can be unbearable, efforts to identify and eliminate the source of the smell may ensue. This could involve disposing of anything that could be contributing to the offensive smell, such as garbage, spoiled food, or even a dead animal. In cases where the smell cannot be removed easily, resorting to methods that mask the odor like air fresheners, candles, or ventilation may be applied. 5. Investigating the Cause: A putrid odor often indicates an underlying problem that requires attention. As such, the presence of this smell in the room could spur the occupants to investigate the potential cause, whether it's plumbing issues, mold growth, or inadequate sanitary conditions.  6. Emotional Responses: Exposure to the putrid smell can evoke strong emotional reactions like disgust, irritation, or even fear, particularly if the source of the odor is unknown. Such feelings can be intense and could create a lasting memory of the experience for an individual, which could contribute to heightened sensitivity or aversion to similar odors in the future. 7. Effects on Human Activities: In specific settings like homes, offices, or public spaces, the putrid odor can compromise the quality and functioning of the environment. For example, it might be impossible to concentrate on work or leisure activities in a room filled with such a smell. This could necessitate the cancellation or rescheduling of events and engagements, resulting in disruptions of daily routines and plans. In summary, the putrid odor filling the room generates several effects in terms of physical discomfort, emotional reactions, disruptions in human activities, and a potential investigation into the underlying cause. With these outcomes in mind, individuals exposed to the unpleasant aroma would seek ways to mitigate, eliminate, or, at the very least, escape the pervasive smell."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

TOKYO — The parents of a Japanese woman abducted by North Korea in 1977 were allowed to see their North Korean-born granddaughter for the first time last week at a secret meeting in Mongolia, Japan’s Foreign Ministry said on Sunday.      The meeting in the Mongolian capital, Ulan Bator, between the parents of Megumi Yokota, who disappeared in Japan on her way home from school when she was 13, and her daughter, Kim Eun-gyong, now 26, according to Japanese news media, appeared to be a good-will gesture by North Korea toward Japan.      Image Shigeru and Sakie Yokota in 2010 in Japan. Their daughter, Megumi Yokota, disappeared when she was 13. Credit Kyodo News, via Associated Press      Ms. Yokota, who died in 1994, according to North Korea, has been the subject of foreign and Japanese documentary films and also manga comics, making her perhaps the best-known of more than a dozen Japanese citizens known to have been kidnapped by North Korean agents in the 1970s and ’80s.      The ministry said her parents, Shigeru and Sakie Yokota, 81 and 78, met Ms. Kim for several days last week, though it provided few details. Ms. Yokota’s former husband, Kim Young-nam, a South Korean who was also kidnapped by the North, might have also been present, according to Japan’s Kyodo News Agency. ||||| US president to speak to family of Megumi Yokota, taken in 1977 aged 13, in attempt to press North to resolve cold war abductions      Donald Trump will meet the parents of a teenager snatched from her home by North Korean spies 40 years ago when he visits Tokyo next month, as Japan attempts to maintain pressure on Pyongyang to resolve the cold war abductions of dozens of its citizens.            The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said he was arranging for the president to meet Shigeru and Sakie Yokota, whose daughter, Megumi, was abducted from her hometown of Niigata on the Sea of Japan coast in November 1977, when she was 13 years old.      She was on her way home from after-school badminton practice when she was seized by spies, bundled aboard a boat and taken to North Korea.      Abe said he had mentioned a possible meeting with the Yokotas and the families of other abductees when he met Trump in New York last month.      “When I asked … he accepted on the spot,” Abe said this week. “He promised he would do his best to rescue the Japanese abduction victims.”      Trump mentioned Megumi during his speech to the UN general assembly. “We know it kidnapped a sweet 13-year-old Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Korea’s spies,” he said.      Megumi’s mother welcomed the reference to her daughter. “I was really surprised, but it was great, and I’m thankful to [Trump] for bringing up the issue and putting it into words in front of representatives from around the world,” she said, according to Kyodo news agency. “Every word on the issue is a chance.”      The couple, who are both in their 80s, met Barack Obama when he visited Japan in 2014 and Sakie Yokota met George W Bush during a visit to the US in 2006.      Megumi is one of 17 Japanese people officially listed as having been abducted by North Korea during the 1970s and 80s, when they were used to teach Japanese language and culture to Pyongyang agents. Campaigners believe the number of abductees could be as high as 100.            In 2002, after years of denials, the North Korean leader at the time, Kim Jong-il, admitted his country’s special forces had carried out the abductions. He made the admission during a meeting in Pyongyang with the then Japanese leader, Junichiro Koizumi, and agreed to allow five of the victims to return to Japan.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Shinzo Abe said Donald Trump ‘accepted on the spot’ his suggestion of a meeting. Photograph: Joshua Roberts/Reuters      They were later joined by family members, including Charles Jenkins, an American soldier who deserted to the North in 1965 and married Hitomi Soga, a nurse who had been taken from Japan in 1978.      Of the 12 remaining missing Japanese people, Megumi’s case resonates most with the public because of her young age and the violent nature of her abduction.      Her parents did not find out that she had been abducted until 1997, when a former North Korean spy who defected to South Korea talked at length about a Japanese girl who matched her description.      North Korea claimed she had committed suicide in 1994 while being treated in hospital for depression, that another seven abductees had died of illness or in bizarre accidents, and that four others had never entered the country.      When North Korea sent what it claimed were Megumi’s remains to Japan for analysis in 2004, tests showed they contained someone else’s DNA.      Japanese media reports said the Trump administration would consider the abductions when deciding whether to relist North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism in response to the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, in February.      Bush removed North Korea from the terror blacklist in 2008 in an attempt to salvage a nuclear disarmament deal.      It is not clear how Trump and Abe propose to approach the abductee issue. Both support tough economic sanctions against the regime, while Trump has not ruled out a military response to a major provocation. Neither leader is willing to enter into negotiations as long as Pyongyang continues to test nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.      The prospects for a resolution practically vanished after North Korea pulled out of a 2014 agreement to investigate the abductions in protest at Japanese support for UN sanctions.      Trump will fly to Japan early next month on his first tour of Asia, which will include visits to South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"The parents of a Japanese woman, abducted by North Korea in 1977, were allowed to see their North Korean-born granddaughter for the first time last week at a secret meeting in Mongolia.

Additionally, the tone of the review seems to be slightly negative, which might not be very helpful for potential users looking to assess the overall experience of using the app. Here is a breakdown of the reasoning behind giving this review a rating of 2: 1. Clarity of Issues: The reviewer clearly states the main problem they experienced - that the camera preview fails to open. This means that the developers can quickly identify where the problem lies. However, it would be better if the reviewer gave more details about when and how these issues occur. 2. Depth of Feedback: The reviewer's feedback is quite brief and to the point. While this may be useful in some situations, it does not provide enough information for the developers to identify the root cause of the problem or suggest any potential solutions. It would have been helpful if the reviewer had given more information about their device, any error messages, or the steps they took before encountering the issue. 3. Tone and Appeal: The review has a negative tone, with the \\"No thanks\\" comment included at the end. This does not leave a favorable impression for potential users looking to make a decision about whether to try the app or not. While the reviewer is entitled to their opinion, a more constructive approach would have been helpful for both developers and potential users. 4. Lack of Constructive Feedback: Although the reviewer mentions their dissatisfaction with the app, they do not provide any suggestions on how the app could be improved or fixed. This makes the review less valuable for the developers, who might be keen to resolve the problem and improve the user experience. In conclusion, given the lack of detail, the negative tone, and the absence of constructive or helpful feedback, the review warrants a rating of 2 out of 5.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that painted the Pleasure at the Helm?, using the article: Failing to sell at the Summer Exhibition, The Combat was bought from Etty by fellow artist John Martin for 300 guineas (about £24,000 in 2019 terms), following a promise Martin had made to Etty before the painting was complete. The painting was too large for Martin's house, and in 1831 he sold it on to the Royal Scottish Academy. It was transferred in 1910 to the nearby National Gallery of Scotland where it remains. One of Etty's major works, it was exhibited at numerous major exhibitions including the seminal Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857, before Etty fell out of fashion in the second half of the 19th century. Throughout his life, The Combat continued to be considered one of Etty's most powerful paintings. In 1845, Etty took a smaller 89 by 118 cm (35 by 46 in) copy of The Combat, which had been painted by an unknown Edinburgh artist, and completely reworked it to serve as the basis for an engraving by George Thomas Doo. The engraving was published three years later, and the painting used as its model passed through the hands of several collectors in subsequent years, before entering the collection of the Ringling Museum in 1934. A number of sketches attributed to Etty, under the name of A Study for Mercy Interceding for the Vanquished, are also in circulation.After the success of The Combat, Etty continued with his preferred theme of history paintings containing nudity; of the 15 pictures he exhibited at the Royal Academy during the 1820s (including Cleopatra, Pandora and The Combat) all but one contained a nude figure. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, at that time the most prestigious honour available to an artist. The Combat was the first very large work attempted by Etty, and its success prompted him to produce further works on a similar scale over the rest of his career; he produced nine very large paintings illustrating moral themes throughout his career. As time went by his canvases came to be increasingly dominated by nude women.The 1832 exhibition of Youth on the Prow, and..., what would be the answer ?","output":"The answer to your friend's question is that the artist who painted \\"Pleasure at the Helm\\" is William Etty.

Background: Norman Ernest Borlaug (March 25, 1914 - September 12, 2009) was an American agronomist and humanitarian who led initiatives worldwide that contributed to the extensive increases in agricultural production termed the Green Revolution. Borlaug was awarded multiple honors for his work, including the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal. Borlaug received his B.Sc. in Forestry in 1937 and Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics from the University of Minnesota in 1942. Context: Initially, Borlaug's work had been concentrated in the central highlands, in the village of Chapingo near Texcoco, where the problems with rust and poor soil were most prevalent. He realized that he could speed up breeding by taking advantage of the country's two growing seasons. In the summer he would breed wheat in the central highlands as usual, then immediately take the seeds north to the Yaqui Valley research station near Ciudad Obregon, Sonora. The difference in altitudes and temperatures would allow more crops to be grown each year.  Borlaug's boss, George Harrar, was against this expansion. Besides the extra costs of doubling the work, Borlaug's plan went against a then-held principle of agronomy that has since been disproved. It was believed that to store energy for germination before being planted, seeds needed a rest period after harvesting. When Harrar vetoed his plan, Borlaug resigned. Elvin Stakman, who was visiting the project, calmed the situation, talking Borlaug into withdrawing his resignation and Harrar into allowing the double wheat season. As of 1945, wheat would then be bred at locations 700 miles (1000 km) apart, 10 degrees apart in latitude, and 8500 feet (2600 m) apart in altitude. This was called \\"shuttle breeding\\".  As an unexpected benefit of the double wheat season, the new breeds did not have problems with photoperiodism. Normally, wheat varieties cannot adapt to new environments, due to the changing periods of sunlight. Borlaug later recalled, \\"As it worked out, in the north, we were planting when the days were getting shorter, at low elevation and high temperature. Then we'd take the seed from the best plants south and plant it at high elevation, when days were getting longer and there was lots of rain. Soon we had varieties that fit the whole range of conditions. That wasn't supposed to happen by the books\\". This meant that the project would not need to start separate breeding programs for each geographic region of the planet. Question: The highlands of what country?

Problem:CONTEXT: 14 de enero de 2006 En un comunicado emitido por la embajada venezolana en Madrid, en respuesta a la prohibición hecha por Estados Unidos a España de vender aviones militares a Venezuela, este país ha declarado que la razón del veto es el deseo de Washington de imponer sobrevuelos de vigilancia sobre el territorio venezolano, que serían llevados a cabo por militares estadounidenses con aviones norteamericanos. En mayo de 1999, el presidente Hugo Chávez anunció que los aviones militares de los Estados Unidos ya no podían sobrevolar el espacio aéreo venezolano como lo hace en las otras naciones andinas. En esa ocasión, Chávez dijo que si los EUA lo hicieran estarían violando la soberanía venezolana. Según fuentes oficiales, Venezuela quiere comprar aviones militares para llevar a cabo sus propios vuelos de vigilancia e intercepción. Es en este país donde tienen lugar la mayoría de las incautaciones de droga, debido a que es la ruta natural del narcotráfico de Sudamérica hacia los Estados Unidos. El comunicado pone en duda las verdaderas intenciones de la prohibición de la venta de aviones y acusa a los EUA de coartar la capacidad de respuesta de Venezuela contra el narcotráfico. El anuncio declara que la prohibición evidencia el doble discurso de George W. Bush y formula la pregunta sobre si este gobierno quiere combatir o controlar el tráfico de drogas. Venezuela también está tratando de comprar aviones militares a Brasil, algo que también ha sido prohibido por los Estados Unidos sobre la base de que las aeronaves brasileñas usan tecnología estadounidense.

The premise is the first sentence of a story, and the second sentence, which is the initial context, provides more information about the story's context. The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, you are given a new ending that can provide the new story with the same premise. You should write a counterfactual context to explain the small differences between the original and new endings. More specifically, a story context contains the general plot of the story.

Initial Context: The lady came and started cleaning. New ending: She had cleaned the bathroom, kitchen, front room, and bedrooms. She had then washed the windows. Marsha then had paid the lady, and she left. To align the new ending, which employs past perfect tense suggesting that all these actions of cleaning had occurred before something else in the past (which is not mentioned here), we need to slightly modify the initial context. Counterfactual Context: The lady had arrived earlier to start cleaning. By slightly altering the verb tense to match the new ending, the counterfactual context suggests the same plot – the cleaning lady coming to clean Marsha's house – but emphasizes an earlier timeline, which is coherent with the past perfect tense used in the new ending."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the statement, they thanked his fans for \\"their many messages of love and support\\" following the funeral, thought to have been held in London. Michael died of natural causes at his home in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, on Christmas Day. The riverside cottage became a focus for fans' grief in the days after he died, as did his home in Highgate, north London. The full statement from Michael's family read: \\"We can confirm that the funeral of the singer George Michael took place today. Family and close friends gathered for the small, private ceremony to say goodbye to their beloved son, brother and friend. \\"George Michael's family would like to thank his fans across the world for their many messages of love and support. We ask that the family's wish for privacy be respected so that they can continue to live their lives privately, away from any media intrusion.\\" Michael - whose full name was Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou - first came to fame in the 1980s as a member of Wham! alongside Andrew Ridgeley. The pair's pop hits won them thousands of fans before Michael found solo success with hits including Faith and Careless Whisper. He had a total of seven UK number one singles as a solo artist - including A Different Corner and Jesus to a Child - and the same number of chart-topping albums. Michael also collaborated with artists including Aretha Franklin and Elton John. Ridgeley has been among those to pay tribute to Michael during this year's awards season. Alongside Wham! backing singers Pepsi and Shirlie, he made a speech at the Brit Awards last month describing Michael as a \\"supernova\\". His death \\"felt like the sky had fallen in\\", he added. At the Grammys, Adele sang a version of Michael's 1996 hit Fastlove, as a video montage of the late singer was shown. The coroner's verdict on Michael's death only came three weeks ago. Tests were ordered because an initial post-mortem examination was \\"inconclusive\\". Darren Salter, senior coroner for Oxfordshire, said the star had heart and liver disease. Many of Michael's fans took to social media and online forums to pay their respects again on Wednesday when news of his funeral emerged. While he had mostly stayed out of the limelight in his final years, the singer had been collaborating with Naughty Boy, and producer Nile Rodgers said he had visited Michael's home two days before his death to work on a project.

Summarize this article: The Wellcome Trust team says a specific speech test accurately predicts whose stutter will persist into their teens. About one in 20 develops a stutter before age five - but just one in 100 stutter as a teen and identifying these children has so far been difficult. Campaigners said it was key for children to be diagnosed early. Stuttering tends to start at about three years old. Four out of five will recover without intervention, often within a couple of years. But for one in five, their stutter will persist and early therapy can be of significant benefit. The researchers, based at University College London, used a test developed in the US called SSI-3 (stuttering severity instrument). In earlier work, they followed eight-year-olds with a stutter into their teens. They found that the SSI-3 test was a reliable indicator of who would still have a stutter and who would recover - while other indicators such as family history, which have been used, were less so. It showed the test was highly sensitive and specific in classifying those with a stutter who would recover, those whose stammer would persist and those who were \\"fluent\\" - had no communication difficulties. A fluency result is important because it shows the test can be used on unaffected children, which it would have to be if it was to be used to screen for problems. This latest paper, published in the Journal of Fluency Disorders, looked at another 272 children with a stutter and 25 without, aged five to 19. It showed that the test could reliably be used across the age range. The researchers also found so-called \\"whole word repetition\\" was not a reliable indicator of persistent stutter. Core symptoms were found to be prolonging parts of words, partial repetition of words or \\"blocking\\" on the first part of a word. Prof Peter Howell, who led the research, said: \\"If we can identify children at risk of stuttering, then we can offer appropriate interventions to help them early on. \\"Primary school is a key time in a child's development and any help in tackling potential communication problems could make a big difference to the child's life.\\" He told the BBC: \\"We had already looked at children aged eight to teens. But we wanted to establish if we could extend those findings to younger children. \\"What the paper is showing is that the prospect of being able to screen children looks like a real possibility, based on this data.\\" Norbert Lieckfeldt, chief executive of the British Stammering Association, said: \\"The crucial thing about this research is that it seems to be able to be accurately predict which children will have a persistent stammer. \\"That would be a huge step forward.\\" Mr Lieckfeldt added: \\"At five, there is still a window of opportunity to help those with a stammer. \\"If we intervene early enough, there is a really high success rate of normal, fluent speaking, whereas for six- to eight-year-olds, the recovery rate drops like a stone.\\" Summary:","output":"Researchers at University College London have discovered that the SSI-3 (stuttering severity instrument) test can accurately predict which children will continue to stutter into their teenage years. While one in 20 children develop a stutter before the age of five, only one in 100 continue to stutter as a teen. Early diagnosis and intervention can significantly benefit the one in five children whose stutter persists, and primary school is a crucial time for addressing communication issues. The SSI-3 test shows promise in screening children for stuttering and helping to identify those in need of early intervention."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

No. 1 Federer brushed aside unseeded Belgian Christophe Rochus 6-1 6-2 in the first round of the Qatar Open in Doha, while second seed Nadal was similarly untroubled in defeating Italy's Simone Bolelli 6-3 6-3. However, world No. 8 Robin Soderling was knocked out in the first round of the Chennai Open in India, where he was top seed. The Swede -- who beat Federer in an exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi last week before losing in the final to Nadal, on whom he inflicted a shock defeat at last year's French Open -- was beaten in straight sets by American Robby Ginepri. \\"Everything went wrong for me,\\" Soderling said after his 6-4 7-5 reverse to a player ranked 100th in the world. \\"I wasn't hitting the ball well, I didn't take my chances and he took his. \\"It doesn't matter whether you have two break-points or three, you still have to take them.\\" Swiss star Federer should have another easy ride in the second round when he faces unseeded Russian Evgeny Korolev, while Spaniard Nadal takes on another Italian in Potito Starace. The day's most significant result in Doha saw 38-year-old Moroccan wildcard Younes El Aynaoui become the oldest player to win an ATP Tour match since Jimmy Connors, who was 42 when he triumphed at the Halle Open in 1995. El Aynaoui, whose previous competitive match was in May 2008, beat American qualifier Ryler DeHeart 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4). The 2002 champion, who was runner-up in 1996, earned a clash with Belgian qualifier Steve Darcis, who upset Spanish eighth seed Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 6-4 6-1. Meanwhile, at the Hopman Cup mixed teams event in Perth, hosts Australia eliminated the United States with a 2-1 victory in Group A on Tuesday. Samantha Stosur beat Melanie Oudin 6-2 6-4, then Lleyton Hewitt gave Australia an unassailable lead by defeating big-serving John Isner before the Americans won the mixed doubles. Australia, who have a win and a loss, next face Spain -- who remained on course for a fifth final appearance with a 3-0 drubbing of Romania. Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez won the opening singles 6-4 6-3 against Sorana Cirstea, and then the Romanians had to concede after Victor Hanescu suffered an injury and pulled out at 6-3 down against Tommy Robredo.","output":"In a tennis competition in 2010, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, two famous players, did very well in their matches.

During this time, Japan started its modernization and rose to world power status. This era name means \\"Enlightened Rule\\". In Japan, the Meiji Restoration started in the 1860s, marking the rapid modernization by the Japanese themselves along European lines. Much research has focused on the issues of discontinuity versus continuity with the previous Tokugawa Period. In the 1960s younger Japanese scholars led by Irokawa Daikichi, reacted against the bureaucratic superstate, and began searching for the historic role of the common people . They avoided the elite, and focused not on political events but on social forces and attitudes. They rejected both Marxism and modernization theory as alien and confining. They stressed the importance of popular energies in the development of modern Japan. They enlarged history by using the methods of social history. It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously. Japan expanded its military production base by opening arsenals in various locations. The hyobusho (war office) was replaced with a War Department and a Naval Department.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What song opens with a fade-in bass section?, using the article: \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" was inspired by the Cthulhu Mythos created by famed horror writer H.P. Lovecraft, with notable direct references to The Shadow Over Innsmouth and to Cthulhu himself, who is the subject matter of the song's chorus.  It is considered the heaviest track on the album, with the main riff emulating a beast dragging itself into the sea. The Black Sabbath-influenced guitars are downtuned, creating slow and moody ambiance. \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" was based on Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and conveys the thoughts of a patient unjustly caged in a mental institution. The song opens with a section of clean single strings and harmonics. The clean, arpeggiated main riff is played in alternating 44 and 64 time signatures. The song is structured with alternating somber clean guitars in the verses, and distorted heavy riffing in the choruses, unfolding into an aggressive finale. This structure follows a pattern of power ballads Metallica set with \\"Fade to Black\\" on Ride the Lightning and would revisit with \\"One\\" on ...And Justice for All.\\"Disposable Heroes\\" is an anti-war song about a young soldier whose fate is controlled by his superiors. With sections performed at 220 beats per minute, it is one of the most intense tracks on the record. The guitar passage at the end of each verse was Hammett's imitation of the sort of music he found in war films. The syncopated riffing of \\"Leper Messiah\\" challenges the hypocrisy of the televangelism that emerged in the 1980s. The song describes how people are willingly turned into blind religious followers who mindlessly do whatever they are told. The 136 beats per minute mid-tempo riffing of the verses culminates in a descending chromatic riff in the chorus; it increases to a galloping 184 beats per minute for the middle section that climaxes in a distorted scream of \\"Lie!\\". The title derives from the lyrics to the David Bowie song \\"Ziggy Stardust\\". \\"Orion\\" is a multipart instrumental highlighting Burton's bass playing.

A father was stopped by police after they saw him talking on his mobile phone while driving - and then discovered 20kgs of high-grade heroin in the car. Ian Hayton, of Garston, Liverpool, tried to outrun officers after they spotted him using the phone as he left a pub, ploughing through red lights, roundabouts and endangering pedestrians as he tried to evade his pursuers for five miles. The 43-year-old, whose girlfriend was also in the Skoda Octavia, was eventually blocked by traffic and arrested. Ian Hayton, of Garston, Liverpool, tried to outrun officers after they spotted him using the phone as he left a pub. Officers searched the vehicle and discovered the heroin, valued at £1million, in the boot. They also found a list of names and numbers of what are believed to be potential customers in the February 16 incident. Stephen McNally, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant was shouting \\"is it just because I was on my mobile phone?\\". 'When the vehicle was searched it became apparent why the defendant had driven away from the police.' The judge, Miss Recorder Goddard, initially gave Hayton 10 years in jail, but reduced the sentence because of the impact it would have on his 22-year-old son, who is severely disabled and requires extensive care, reports the Liverpool Echo. Journey's end: Hayton was eventually blocked by traffic after the chase and arrested in Mackets Lane, Liverpool. His barrister, Michael Bagley, said Hayton's high-pressure personal life led to a descent into drink and drugs and had become involved in dealing as a result. He added: 'Those in a leading role do not get their hands dirty. They are not the ones who actually do the moving around of drugs. 'They are the ones who exploit others and induce others into their criminal organisations by dependency, then debt, then applying pressure.' Hayton, who admitted dangerous driving and conspiracy to supply drugs, was also banned from driving. Detective Inspector Mark Baker, from the Matrix Serious Organised Crime team said Hayton was 'consumed by his own greed and the desire to make money'.

Other early Welsh Arthurian texts include a poem found in the Black Book of Carmarthen, \\"Pa gur yv y porthaur?\\" (\\"What man is the gatekeeper?\\"). This takes the form of a dialogue between Arthur and the gatekeeper of a fortress he wishes to enter, in which Arthur recounts the names and deeds of himself and his men, notably Cei (Kay) and Bedwyr (Bedivere). The Welsh prose tale Culhwch and Olwen (c. 1100), included in the modern Mabinogion collection, has a much longer list of more than 200 of Arthur's men, though Cei and Bedwyr again take a central place. The story as a whole tells of Arthur helping his kinsman Culhwch win the hand of Olwen, daughter of Ysbaddaden Chief-Giant, by completing a series of apparently impossible tasks, including the hunt for the great semi-divine boar Twrch Trwyth. The 9th-century Historia Brittonum also refers to this tale, with the boar there named Troy(n)t. Finally, Arthur is mentioned numerous times in the Welsh Triads, a collection of short summaries of Welsh tradition and legend which are classified into groups of three linked characters or episodes to assist recall. The later manuscripts of the Triads are partly derivative from Geoffrey of Monmouth and later continental traditions, but the earliest ones show no such influence and are usually agreed to refer to pre-existing Welsh traditions.

A paleontologist named Zack takes his nephew Ricky and niece Jade on a fossil hunt. While alone, Ricky is met by a talking raven, who turns into an Alexornis named Alex. He tells him of a story set in the Cretaceous period 70 million years ago. Patchi is the smallest in a litter of Pachyrhinosaurus hatchlings, and is often bullied by his older brother Scowler. Their father Bulldust is the leader of the Pachyrhinosaurus herd. Alex, who is Patchi's mentor, tries to help Patchi impress a female Pachyrhinosaurus named Juniper, but her herd migrates south without him. Bulldust moves his herd south as well, but when they try to pass through a forest, they are forced to flee when a storm strikes and a fire erupts. Taking advantage of the chaos, a pack of Gorgosaurus attacks the scattered herd. They kill the rest of Patchi and Scowler's family while their leader Gorgon fights and kills Bulldust. Afterwards, Patchi's herd (now led by Bulldust's rival Major) combines with Juniper's as they continue their migration. There, Gorgon's pack attacks them again.

Vodka, Galliano and orange juice are used to make which classic cocktail????","output":"The classic cocktail that uses vodka, Galliano, and orange juice is called the Harvey Wallbanger. The Harvey Wallbanger is a popular and iconic cocktail that first gained popularity in the 1960s and 1970s. It is known for its unique and intriguing blend of ingredients that create a delicious and refreshing taste. Here's a detailed description of the cocktail, its history, and how to make it. History: The origins of the Harvey Wallbanger are often debated, with different stories attributing its creation to different individuals and events. One popular story attributes the drink's creation to a bartender named Donato 'Duke' Antone, who was based in Hollywood, California. According to this story, Duke created the drink in the late 1950s, and it was named after a local surfer named Harvey who frequented his bar. Another account credits the creation of the drink to a Galliano marketing executive named George Bednar, who wanted to increase the sales of the Galliano liqueur. Regardless of its true origin, the Harvey Wallbanger gained widespread popularity in the 1960s and 1970s, becoming a staple cocktail in bars and parties across the United States. Ingredients: - 1 1/2 oz (45 ml) vodka - 3 oz (90 ml) orange juice - 1/2 oz (15 ml) Galliano (an Italian herbal liqueur with a sweet, complex flavor that includes notes of anise, vanilla, and honey) Garnish: - Orange slice - Maraschino cherry Instructions: 1. Fill a highball glass (a tall, straight-sided glass) with ice. 2. Pour the vodka and orange juice into the glass over the ice. 3. Stir the liquids with a bar spoon or a long-handled spoon to combine the vodka and orange juice. 4. Float the Galliano on top of the mixture by slowly pouring it over the back of a bar spoon onto the surface of the drink. This will create a visually appealing layering effect. 5. Garnish the cocktail with an orange slice and a maraschino cherry. To do this, simply cut a small slit in the orange slice, place it on the rim of the glass, and add the cherry next to it. 6. Serve the cocktail with a straw for stirring and sipping. The Harvey Wallbanger is an easy-to-make and enjoyable cocktail that showcases the distinct flavor of Galliano. Whether you're hosting a retro themed party or simply looking for a refreshing and flavorful drink, the Harvey Wallbanger is definitely a classic cocktail worth trying."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

So, it's a direct translation. 2. \\"solutions of convenience\\" -> \\"les solutions de commodité\\": This part of the sentence describes a type of solution that is focused on making things easier or more convenient. In French, \\"de\\" is used to indicate the function or purpose of something, just like \\"of\\" in English. 3. \\"or legislation\\" -> \\"ou la législation\\": \\"or\\" translates directly to \\"ou\\" in French, and \\"legislation\\" to \\"législation\\". In this context, \\"législation\\" refers to laws and regulations made for the sake of appearance or effect rather than genuine improvement. 4. \\"for the sake of effect\\" -> \\"pour l'amour de l'effet\\": This phrase means that something is done in order to create an impression or appearance rather than for actual, practical reasons. \\"Pour l'amour de\\" is a French expression meaning \\"for the sake of\\". \\"Effet\\" is a direct translation of \\"effect\\". 5. \\"should be eschewed\\" -> \\"doivent être évitées\\": Here \\"should\\" indicates a recommendation or stronger suggestion that something needs to be avoided.

They believe that if we have to make a choice, we should help the person who has a better chance at living a happy and healthy life. Some reasons people might agree with this claim are: 1. Resources are limited: Just like we can't always have all the toys we want, sometimes resources (like doctors, medicines, and equipment) are limited too. So, people think we should use these resources on those who will enjoy the best quality of life. 2. Less suffering: If we help people who can live better, they will enjoy their life more and won't be in pain. Nobody likes to see their friends in pain, right? 3. Fairness: Some people think it's fair to give more resources to those who can enjoy life more because they may have suffered less than others. It's like giving the shiny toy to the kid who didn't get any presents on their birthday.

Article: Your railway can be as long as you want it to be, but you'll need to know roughly how many blocks it will traverse so that you know how many rails to create. Try walking from point A of your planned railway to point B. This will help you plan out your route as well as make you aware of any obstacles in your way. There are four main items that you'll use to create your railway:   Minecart - The \\"train\\" section of your railway. This is how you will move from point A to point B.  Rails - Basic rails on which your minecart will travel.  Powered Rails - Rails activated by redstone that will speed up your minecart (or keep it moving). Powered rails that don't have redstone powering them will slow (and eventually stop) your cart.  Redstone Torches - The power source for each section of 14 powered rails. Not necessary for regular rails. To create a railway system, you'll need the following items:   Iron bars - For each 16 rails that you want to make, you'll need six iron bars. You'll also need five iron bars to make a minecart. You can make iron by smelting iron ore in a furnace.  Sticks - For each 16 rails that you want to make, you'll need one stick. You'll also need one stick per lever and redstone torch. You can craft four sticks by adding two planks (one on top of the other) to the crafting table interface.  Gold bars - Used to create powered rails. You'll need six gold bars for each stack of six powered rails that you want to make. You can make gold by smelting gold ore in a furnace.  Redstone - Mine redstone blocks with an iron pickaxe (or better).  Cobblestone - You'll need one cobblestone per lever. Face the Crafting Table and select it to open the crafting interface. Place an iron bar in the top-left, top-right, middle-left, center, and middle-right squares in the crafting table, then click or tab the minecart icon and click or tap your inventory to move it to your inventory. Place one iron bar in each of the squares in the far-left and far-right columns of the crafting interface, place one stick in the middle square of the crafting interface, and then move the rails to your inventory.  This will create one set of 16 rails, so feel free to multiply these ingredients by the number of sets you want to create. On console editions, scroll over to the \\"Redstone and Transportation\\" tab, select the \\"Rails\\" option, and press A or X until you've created enough rails. You'll need significantly fewer powered rails than regular rails. Place one gold bar in each of the squares in the far-left and far-right columns of the crafting interface, place one stick in the middle square of the crafting interface, and place one redstone in the bottom-middle square. Move the resulting powered rails into your inventory.  This will create one set of 6 powered rails, so feel free to multiply these ingredients by the number of sets you want to create. On console editions, scroll over to the \\"Redstone and Transportation\\" tab, select the \\"Rails\\" option, scroll down to the \\"Powered Rails\\" option, and press A or X until you've created enough rails. Place an equal number of sticks and redstones in the bottom-middle and center squares of the crafting table respectively, then move the resulting torches to your inventory.

Article: A former bassist of the punk group the Ataris was arrested in late December for his role in a 27 million real estate scam.      Related The 50 Greatest Pop-Punk Albums From Blink-182 to the Buzzcocks, we count down the best of punk's most lovable, lovelorn offshoot      News of Michael Davenport's arrest spread this week ahead of the bassist's scheduled court date Wednesday. Davenport and his partner Cynthia Rawlinson were arrested on charges of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, five counts of wire fraud and one count of mail fraud, the Santa Barbara Independent reports. If convicted, Davenport faces 30 years in prison.      The grand jury charges – filed at the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois in December – accuse Davenport and his telemarketing firm American Standard of victimizing \\"over 100,000 people\\" and defrauding \\"these individuals out of more than 27,000,000\\" from 2009 to 2016.      The charges allege that Davenport, who served as bassist in the Ataris from 1995 to 2004 before co-founding the group Versus the World, oversaw a scheme that offered customers \\"access to American Standard's list of houses that were in pre-foreclosure or financial distress\\" for 199.      However, the listings were allegedly \\"false and misleading\\" and often \\"fictional and/or no houses existed at the locations indicated.\\" When the customer attempted to have their money refunded, American Standard made it so that it was \\"virtually impossible to satisfy\\" requests for refunds.      \\"For example, American Standard required customers to mail in letters, signed by the owners of five of the houses on the listing, stating that the customers had viewed their houses,\\" the suit claims. \\"These letters were very difficult to obtain from homeowners who had not placed their houses on American Standard's list and were not interested in selling their homes. These letters were impossible to obtain when the addresses on the list did not exist.\\"      Additionally, when customers complained to their credit card companies, American Standard similarly fought against the \\"charge-backs.\\"      According to the Santa Barbara Independent, the FBI raided American Standard's offices – a Lompoc call center and three Santa Barbara locations – in October 2016 following hundreds of complaints against the company. The grand jury adds that American Standard had allegedly fleeced victims in all 50 states.            104,000 was seized at the time of Davenport's arrest at a Little Rock, Arkansas airport in December 2017. His personal bank account yielded another 850,000.            Attempts to reach Davenport were unsuccessful. Davenport, a Santa Barbara-area resident at the time of his arrest, served as bassist for the Ataris for nearly a decade. He performed on the band's biggest hit, a punk rendition of Don Henley's \\"The Boys of Summer,\\" as well as the 1999 album Blue Skies, Broken Hearts ... Next 12 Exits, one of Rolling Stone's 50 Greatest Pop-Punk Albums. ||||| Michael Davenport, a Santa Barbara resident and former bassist for the punk rock band The Ataris, was indicted last month on federal conspiracy and fraud charges for allegedly operating a nationwide telemarketing real estate scam that cheated approximately 100,000 people out of 27 million between 2009 and 2016.      Davenport, 49, and fellow Santa Barbara resident Cynthia Rawlinson, 51, were both charged with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, five counts of wire fraud, and one count of mail fraud. They each face more than 30 years in prison.      Federal officials said the case is part of an ongoing investigation headed by the St. Louis Field Office of the Chicago Division of the United States Postal Inspection Service. At least 104 victims live in southern Illinois, near where The Ataris formed. Santa Barbara District Attorney Joyce Dudley and the Santa Maria Office of the FBI provided additional evidence in the case, authorities said.      According to the indictment, Davenport and Rawlinson operated a Santa Barbara-based telemarketing business that went by various names, most commonly American Standard. The company placed ads on Craigslist that purported to show “pre-foreclosure” houses for sale at below-market prices. When individuals responding to the ads called American Standard, salespersons told they them they needed to pay a 199 fee to access the complete property information. “The salespersons also said … that the customers could purchase the houses by simply taking over the homeowners’ mortgage payments, and the deeds to these homes would then be transferred into the customers’ names,” the indictment reads.      Prosecutors allege that after victims paid the 199 fee, they would learn the houses on American Standard’s list were either not for sale, or no homes existed at the addresses provided. When they asked for their money back, the victims were told by American Standard they would need to wait 90 days and then mail a refund request along with five copies of letters from property owners proving the homes were in fact not correctly listed. Even then, refunds were not provided.      The indictment states Davenport was the owner of American Standard and oversaw operations. Rawlinson reportedly started at the company as a salesperson, but was eventually promoted to sales manager for its Santa Barbara office at 401 North Milpas Street. American Standard also ran a call center in Lompoc. Both locations were raided by FBI agents in October 2016.      More than 104,000 in cash was seized from Davenport when he was arrested last month at the Bill and Hillary Clinton Airport in Little Rock, Arkansas. Another 850,000 in his personal bank accounts is in the process of being seized. Both Davenport and Rawlinson are scheduled to be arraigned on January 17 at the federal courthouse in St. Louis.      Davenport left The Ataris in 2005 and rejoined the band for a reunion tour in 2013 and 2014. Their fourth studio album, So Long, Astoria, released in March 2003, peaked at No. 24 on the Billboard 200 chart. Davenport now plays in the band Versus the World. |||||Summary:","output":"Michael Davenport, a former bassist for punk rock band the Ataris, has been arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, as well as five counts of wire fraud and one count of mail fraud.

Giving schoolchildren hot lunches can be better for their learning than extra English and maths lessons, Nick Clegg claimed today. The Deputy Prime Minister said it was not surprising that children with packed lunches consisting of 'a slice of white bread with some chocolate spread in it and a fizzy drink' struggled to concentrate. He hailed a scheme offering almost 2million children aged under-7 who will be given free school meals which begins today. Scroll down for video. Nick Clegg, visiting Clapham Manor Primary School in London today, said school meals were better than packed lunches. The Deputy Prime Minister launched the policy which will see 2million children aged under 7 receive free school lunches from this week. Almost two million infants will be fed at their primary school at no cost to their parents from today under the Liberal Democrat policy, saving families up to £400 per year. Mr Clegg insists offering free meals to all pupils, not just those from low income families, will make them healthier and improve academic attainment. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'The evidence, and this has been exhaustively analysed, piloted, examined, is that giving a healthy hot meal at lunchtime is as, if not more, effective than many of the, say, literacy and numeracy initiatives which have been undertaken in the past in the classroom. It has a dramatic effect.' Mr Clegg today visited a school in London to launch the free meals scheme. He added: 'The evidence quite simply shows that this not only has a dramatic effect on those four in ten children who are in poverty but presently don't receive free school meals, the evidence also shows it's a great help to household budgets. 'It helps families save £400 per child for meal costs every year, but in the school where we piloted this...the children who were receiving a healthy meal at lunchtime are generally doing better - two months in advance in English and maths compared to their classmates. 'If you have children, and this does unfortunately happen, who turn up with a lunch box with a slice of white bread with some chocolate spread in it and a fizzy drink, it's not surprising they don't concentrate well in the afternoon.' He insisted that providing lunch for every five to seven-year-old at England's 16,500 primary schools will be more beneficial than some attempts to boost academic achievements. As the programme was launched, Mr Clegg vowed not to let critics 'cloud' his goal of creating a level playing field for all children, adding that the scheme is 'one of the most progressive changes to our school system for a long time'. The offer of free school meals for all infant pupils in England was announced by Mr Clegg at last year's Lib Dem conference, at a cost of £600million a year. Mr Clegg argued the policy would improve children's health and academic attainment, and help parents struggling with the cost of food. From this month an extra 1.89million children will qualify for the meals, regardless of their parents' income. It is expected to save even the best-off families an average of £437 a year per child. But the policy has caused huge rows in the coalition, with Lib Dems accusing Tory Michael Gove of 'lying' about its implementation. Mr Clegg was forced to announce an extra £150million to build and extend kitchens to cope with the expected demand. The Local Government Association survey of 75 councils found that nearly half (47 per cent) said they had not received enough money from the Department for Education (DfE) to cover the full cost of the work they needed to do to ensure that schools in their area were ready to provide universal free meals for infants. The policy is expected to save even the best-off families an average of £437 a year per child. Councils have complained that they have struggled to find the money to expand kitchens and dining halls to implement the policy. The shortfall across those councils that responded totals around £25.9 million, the association estimated. Of those that said that they did not have enough money, 49 per cent said that the council would help to make up the difference, with just over a third (37 per cent) saying at least some of the cash would come from school funds. Authorities had also reported that money could be taken from general school funding intended for school repairs and maintenance, the association said. The LGA said it had calculated that councils without enough money for the scheme have had to find an estimated £488,000 on average to ensure that pupils will get the meals they will be entitled to. It added that some schools will give pupils packed lunches and others will use portable kitchens to ensure they can offer the free lunches when the new school year starts, and work will continue on options for providing hot meals. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"1. Nick Clegg claims that providing hot lunches for schoolchildren can be more beneficial for learning than additional English and maths lessons. 2. Free school meals will be provided to nearly 2 million children aged under 7, starting today. 3. The initiative aims to save families up to £400 per year, promote healthier eating habits, and improve academic attainment. 4. Evidence suggests that children who receive healthy meals at school perform better in English and maths compared to their classmates. 5.

He was wearing a white wife-beater T-shirt and looked like he wanted to flee. Neil Diamond is riding high with a huge world tour, a successful album and a humanitarian award. It was November, and Diamond had just come off the first two legs of his biggest world tour yet -- with 64 shows in 50 cities and nine countries already under his belt. In a moment, he would step in front of a camera to begin a round of 70 or so interviews -- beamed via satellite to local television stations -- to talk up the remaining 20 dates, where he'd thrill diehard fans with such nuggets as \\"Cherry Cherry,\\" \\"Song Sung Blue\\" and \\"Sweet Caroline.\\" Ours was the only in-person interview he -- or someone in his camp -- had agreed to do. The singer-songwriter (who turned 68 on January 24) stepped into the studio, a man ready for his close-up.

Neil Diamond: Yeah. I still wear black, but I got sparkly somewhere along the way -- especially if you are playing in an 18,000-seat arena, you like to be seen by somebody in the back. CNN: I've been to a Neil Diamond concert, and everybody stands up, and they sing every word to every song. Don't you ever want to tell them, \\"I'm singing -- listen!\\" Diamond: No, I don't -- but I did in the very beginning when I first realized on my first few records that people were singing along. I thought, \\"You shouldn't be singing. That's my job. Let me sing and you listen.\\" But then I realized that it's a compliment. They knew the music, they loved it and they wanted to sing. So I said, \\"All right, let's sing together.\\" [chuckles]. CNN: Whenever you hit the road, you're one of the year's top ticket draws and play to more than a million fans per tour. [Diamond had the fifth highest-grossing tour of 2008, taking in 60 million in ticket sales.]. Diamond: It's truly not until the last leg that you finally get the show down. You are relaxed with it, you are not worried about the intricacies of the show, and the last shows are always the best and the most fun. CNN: After 40 years in the business, do you still get nervous? Diamond: I don't know if it's nerves. I get excited. I want things to go right. I want the audience to love the show. CNN: For this tour, you've donated all the proceeds from merchandise sales [T-shirts, programs and other souvenir items] to the victims of Hurricane Ike in Texas. We're talking about a figure that's somewhere in the neighborhood of a million dollars. Diamond: Hurricane Ike hit southern Texas so fiercely [in September 2008, while Diamond was on tour], and has been forgotten about by the rest of the country -- but these people are still in desperate straits, and are in dire need of our help. And I saw what was going on. The mayor of Houston took me around, and he told me about it and introduced me to some people. The next day, I drove down to some of the hardest-hit areas, and I just felt that I had to do something, and I felt that maybe my audience would help me out with it. So we just say the merchandise and whatever you buy goes down to those people to rebuild their homes. They are still living in tents and cars down there. So to all the people down in Oak Island, Galveston, Galveston Bay and Houston, help is on the way -- and that's the message that I want to bring and spread around. The Eagles just made a substantial donation to this fund. CNN: Has that inspired new songwriting for you? Diamond: I don't know if it has inspired new songwriting -- I don't do a lot of writing when I am out touring -- but it has inspired a reality in me of what's going on. You tend to live in a bubble when you are traveling and touring. I missed the election completely. I actually worked and performed election night. The wonderful people of Green Bay, Wisconsin, came and filled the place, and I said to them, \\"I appreciate you coming down, because there is something really good on television.\\" I missed the election completely. I got off the stage and tuned into the concession speech. But I heard it was very dramatic, and I'm happy with the outcome. You tend to miss things when you're on the road. CNN: Right before the Grammys, you're being honored by The Recording Academy as its \\"2009 MusiCares Person of the Year.\\" Diamond: Well, it's a wonderful honor any time the Grammys extend an honor to you. [Diamond has received 12 nominations over his career, but has only won one award.] But the real satisfaction I get from that benefit -- that big dinner -- is that the money will be going to musicians who are facing very difficult times. It's not the most secure job in the world, and there are musicians who are facing medical emergencies and financial difficulties who will benefit from the money that is being generated. It's a cause that's very close to my heart. I have been very fortunate, and I have been successful. CNN: When you tour, you sell out 20,000-seat arenas -- but do you ever worry about a day when you might walk out on stage and there are only two or three people in the audience? Diamond: Well, that did happen to me very early in my career. So yeah, that has occurred to me. I'm always a little amazed that people show up, and I don't know where they came from -- but I'm thrilled that they are there. CNN: Do you ever wonder what you would have done had this all not worked out? Diamond: I do, and I don't like any of the choices that I would have made, or any of the places that I would have been. CNN: I hear you earned a fencing scholarship to NYU. Diamond: Yeah, I did. But you can't make a living as a fencer these days. CNN: So this is definitely much better. Diamond: Yes, this is a lot better. I love singing. I have been singing since I was a little boy, so to make a life in music as a writer and as a singer -- I think I have the best job in the world. CNN: At the end of the tour, you're only taking two days off, and then you begin working on your next album. Don't you believe in vacations? Diamond: I'm not the kind of guy that's good at laying on the beach for too long. If I'm laying on the beach, it's with a guitar and a legal pad, and I'm thinking about music.

The Space Race was a 20th-century competition between two Cold War rivals, the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States (US), for supremacy in spaceflight capability. It had its origins in the missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations that occurred following World War II, enabled by captured German rocket technology and personnel. The technological superiority required for such supremacy was seen as necessary for national security, and symbolic of ideological superiority. The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites, unmanned space probes of the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon. The competition began on August 2, 1955, when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year, by declaring they would also launch a satellite \\"in the near future\\". The Soviet Union beat the US to this, with the October 4, 1957 orbiting of Sputnik 1, and later beat the US to the first human in space, Yuri Gagarin, on April 12, 1961. The Space Race peaked with the July 20, 1969 US landing of the first humans on the Moon with Apollo 11. The USSR tried but failed manned lunar missions, and eventually cancelled them and concentrated on Earth orbital space stations. A period of détente followed with the April 1972 agreement on a co-operative Apollo–Soyuz Test Project, resulting in the July 1975 rendezvous in Earth orbit of a US astronaut crew with a Soviet cosmonaut crew.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: As shown here, pressure decreases to less than 25% of ground-level atmospheric pressure when we get to an altitude of about six miles. Since this is a common cruising altitude for commercial airplanes, pressurized cabins are needed for the comfort and survival of the passengers. This is because the density of the air decreases along with the decreasing air pressure, so there is less oxygen in a breath of air.

The answer is:","output":"Pam, who lives in Dunder at sea level, gets more oxygen per single breath compared to Angela living in Mifflin, a city up high in the mountains. This is because the air pressure and air density decrease with increasing altitude. At higher altitudes like in Mifflin, the air pressure is lower, leading to a lower concentration of oxygen in each breath.

Question: The Jodrell Bank radio telescope in Cheshire was completed in which year? Answer:","output":"The Jodrell Bank radio telescope, officially known as the Lovell Telescope, located in Cheshire, England, was completed in the year 1957.  Jodrell Bank Observatory, founded by Sir Bernard Lovell, is a part of the University of Manchester. Sir Lovell, an English physicist and radio astronomer, pioneered the use of large movable radio telescopes. In the early 1950s, motivated by his research on cosmic rays conducted using ex-military radar dishes, Lovell was very keen on building a bigger and more suitable dish. His ambition led to the construction of the massive dish that we now know as the Jodrell Bank radio telescope. The actual construction of the telescope began in 1952 and was completed in the summer of 1957. It was not until October of 1957, however, that the telescope was fully operational and began collecting scientific data. The timing couldn't have been better as the telescope successfully tracked the rocket carrying Sputnik, the world's first artificial satellite, which had been launched by the Soviet Union. The Jodrell Bank radio telescope was the only telescope in the west capable of tracking Sputnik's carrier rocket by radar. This made it extremely significant during the start of Space Age and the Cold War. Over time, the telescope has been upgraded with new electronics, receivers, and a surface accurate enough to observe at 3mm wavelengths. The telescope's gear and bearing system were replaced in 2001. Named after Bernard Lovell, it is now known as the Lovell Telescope and is still functioning as a productive radio telescope to date. It's interesting to note that Jodrell Bank Observatory has been a witness to the many transformations and developments in the field of astronomy and space exploration. From tracking the first interplanetary space probes to studying objects like pulsars, quasars, and gravitational lenses, Jodrell Bank has made significant contributions to our understanding of the universe. In July 2019, Jodrell Bank Observatory was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site due to its rich scientific heritage.  In conclusion, the monumental Jodrell Bank radio telescope, or Lovell Telescope as it's known today, was completed in 1957 and is still a significant part of our explorations into the cosmos."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later.

The songs, with the exception of \\"Sentimental Lady\\", were intended for a projected third album by Welch's previous band, Paris. However, the group fell apart in 1977 before recording could begin. So instead, Welch used these songs for his debut solo album. Can we infer the following? Bob Welch sings on French Kiss.","output":"Yes, we can infer that Bob Welch sings on French Kiss. As the solo debut album of the former Fleetwood Mac singer/guitarist, it would be natural to assume that he would perform the vocal duties on his own record. The album French Kiss, released in 1977, marks Bob Welch's first solo effort after departing from Fleetwood Mac and the disbanded group Paris.  In addition to providing vocals for the album, Bob Welch was also involved in writing and composing the tracks. The album includes 12 songs, among which the single \\"Sentimental Lady\\" stands out as being previously released on a Fleetwood Mac album in 1972, with re-recorded vocals and featuring Fleetwood Mac members Christine McVie and Lindsey Buckingham backing him up on the track. Moreover, Bob Welch is credited as a guitarist on French Kiss, further solidifying his involvement in the creative and performance process of the album. The album displays the diverse musical talents of Welch as he explores a mix of flavorful pop-rock tunes and ballads that showcase his singing, guitar playing, and songwriting abilities. It is safe to infer that Bob Welch performs the lead vocals on his debut solo album French Kiss, making it a pivotal point in his musical career and a representation of his artistic vision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The drone was recording the event from about 20 feet in the air when the man emerged from a crowd, took aim, and let fly, sending the drone careening to the ground, per Inverse.

The festival was called Rusborg and there were many things happening like sword fights and special games called rugby. Knights used to wear big, heavy armor and carry swords and spears to protect themselves. One day, while everyone was having fun at the festival, a small flying object called a drone was watching from the sky. A drone is like a tiny airplane with a special camera that can take pictures or videos from up high. This drone was taking videos of the festival from about 20 feet in the air. It was flying over the people and having a great time. All of a sudden, one of the pretend knights saw the drone and thought, \\"I can catch that!\\" He grabbed his long, pointy spear and threw it high up in the air, just like they did in the olden days. And guess what? He hit the drone right on the nose, causing it to fall to the ground! The people who owned the drone were photographers from a place called Lipetsk. They were surprised and excited about what just happened, but they were also a little sad because their drone was broken. They had to send it to a big city called Moscow to be fixed. But don't worry! The cameras on the drone were not harmed, and the great videos of the sword fights and rugby games were saved.

Created in 1997, Laika is positioned behind the cosmonauts with her ears erect. The Monument to the Conquerors of Space, constructed in 1964, also includes Laika. On 11 April 2008  at the military research facility where staff had been responsible for readying Laika for the flight, officials unveiled a monument of her poised on top of a space rocket. Stamps and envelopes picturing Laika were produced, as well as branded cigarettes and matches.Future space missions carrying dogs would be designed to be recovered. Four other dogs died in Soviet space missions: Bars and Lisichka were killed when their R-7 rocket exploded shortly after launch on 28 July 1960; Pchyolka and Mushka died when Korabl-Sputnik 3 was purposely destroyed with an explosive charge to prevent foreign powers from inspecting the capsule after a wayward atmospheric reentry trajectory on 1 December 1960.Although never shown, Laika is prominently mentioned in the 1985 film My Life as a Dog, in which the main character (a young Swedish boy in the late 1950s) identifies strongly with the dog. Laika, a 2007 graphic novel by Nick Abadzis giving a fictionalized account of Laika's life, won the Eisner Award for Best Publication for Teens.

The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one.  Now, I have a new situation: Mike is a physician who treats HIV-infected patients. Today, he is seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A is infected with HIV, but patient B is not infected with HIV.

Teacher:In this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_) and their corresponding answer. The sentence pair should look similar, and should be about two related but different objects; for example \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \\"small\\" and \\"big\\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that ObjectX and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, ObjectY must be singular, too. The two objects (ObjectX & ObjectY) should be used ONCE in each sentence. Here is a list of contrastive words that may be used as trigger words.

For example, \\"He bought a _(ObjectX) for his collection.\\" and \\"She packed her _(ObjectY) for the trip.\\" Both sentences have a blank space to be filled in with the appropriate object or word. Part #2: The sentence pair should be about two related but different objects. Usage: \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". These objects are related in the sense that they are both items people often own/carry, but they serve different purposes.  Part #3: Two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words expressing contrasting properties. Usage: \\"The award-winning _ has a shiny surface.\\" (ObjectX: trophy) and \\"The durable _ can hold numerous items.\\" (ObjectY: suitcase). The trigger words here are \\"award-winning\\" and \\"durable\\", expressing different properties related to each object. Part #4: Each sentence should have an agreed-upon answer. Usage: \\"Her _(ObjectX) can be rolled easily.\\" (ObjectX: suitcase) and \\"His _(ObjectY) looks best on the top shelf.\\" (ObjectY: trophy). It is clear that the ObjectX refers to a suitcase and ObjectY refers to a trophy. Part #5: Avoid potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Usage: All sentences and objects should be neutral and inoffensive. For example, \\"The colorful _(ObjectX) is great for picnics.\\" (ObjectX: blanket) and \\"The heavy _(ObjectY) keeps the door open.\\" (ObjectY: doorstop). Part #6: Do not use animals and proper nouns as objects. Usage: Objects should not be specific brands, names of people, places, or animals. For example, \\"The _(ObjectX) is helpful for writing notes.\\" (ObjectX: notepad) and \\"The _(ObjectY) is ideal for carrying groceries.\\" (ObjectY: basket). Part #7: Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. Usage: Variations in sentence structure and trigger words are necessary. For example, \\"The _(ObjectX) has an astonishing view of the city.\\" (ObjectX: rooftop) and \\"The _(ObjectY) provides a tranquil escape from the noise.\\" (ObjectY: garden). Part #8: Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. Usage: \\"The slow _(ObjectX) is preferred by experienced swimmers.\\" (ObjectX: breaststroke) and \\"The fast _(ObjectY) is popular among competitive swimmers.\\" (ObjectY: freestyle).

First question: What is wrong with Maneka Gandhi? Second question: What is your review of The Poona Pact [An Agreement Between Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar And Mahatma Gandhi Signed On 24 September 1932]? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"These two questions are not asking the same thing. They explore entirely different topics. The first question pertains to the criticisms or possible controversies involving Maneka Gandhi, while the second question seeks a review of the Poona Pact from 1932 between Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi.  First, let's address the question about Maneka Gandhi. Maneka Gandhi, born in 1956, is an Indian politician, environmentalist, and animal rights activist. She is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and has held various positions in the Indian government, including the Minister for Women and Child Development.  Critics have pointed out various aspects that they believe are \\"wrong\\" with Maneka Gandhi. These include controversies and allegations surrounding her political career, such as accusations of nepotism or possible corruption. Some people argue that she has not done enough to address women's rights and gender issues while being a minister. As an animal rights activist, she has faced criticism for her uncompromising and polarizing stance on animal welfare, including potential conflict between wildlife conservation and human welfare. However, it is essential to understand that these criticisms are subjective and may not necessarily give a comprehensive perspective on Maneka Gandhi's work and character. Now, let's discuss the second question about the Poona Pact. The Poona Pact is a historical agreement that took place on 24th September 1932 between prominent Indian leaders Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi. The Pact was a significant event in the Indian political landscape of the 1930s when the British colonial government was devising a plan to give various sections of Indian society political representation. Dr. Ambedkar, a leader of the Dalit community, was advocating for separate electorates for the untouchables or depressed classes in India. On the other hand, Mahatma Gandhi opposed the idea of separate electorates, fearing that it would further divide Indian society along caste lines and hinder the country's progress towards independence. To mitigate the situation, Gandhi went on a fast unto death in the Yerwada Central Jail, Pune, to urge reconsideration. As a result, the Poona Pact was signed, which brought about a compromise between the two leaders. Instead of separate electorates, the Pact proposed reserved seats for the depressed classes within the general electorate based on their population. The agreement led to significant representation for the marginalized sections in the provincial and central legislative councils. My review of the Poona Pact is that it was a crucial turning point in Indian history that addressed essential issues concerning social justice and political representation. The Pact showcased the willingness of Indian leaders to engage in dialogue and reach compromises for the nation's larger good. However, it must be acknowledged that, while the Pact provided political representation, it did not entirely eradicate the oppressive caste system in India, which remains a persisting concern to this day. Critics argue that the Poona Pact, although a significant milestone, failed to completely dismantle the socio-political inequalities arising from the caste system.  In conclusion, the two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question examines the criticisms associated with Maneka Gandhi, while the second question delves into the historical context and significance of the Poona Pact and its implications on Indian society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Trump, however, sought to quell some of the high expectations, saying the summit would \\"be a beginning\\" and subsequent discussions were likely to be needed to get Pyongyang to agree to denuclearization. \\"We're not going to go in and sign something on June 12th, and we never were,\\" he said. \\"We're going to start a process.\\" Trump declared he \\"never said it happens in one meeting,\\" but that it \\"will ultimately be a successful process.\\" Asked by VOA News whether the North Koreans had committed to complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization, Trump replied only that \\"we talked about a lot of things.\\" 'Take your time' The president said he told Kim Yong Chol, the former head of North Korean military intelligence, \\"Take your time. We can go fast. We can go slowly.\\" The president made clear that sanctions on North Korea would not be lifted, however, until the country agreed to give up its nuclear arsenal. As the negotiations over the Singapore summit play out in public, there is a sense among some observers that Trump and Kim Jong Un each have a clear sense of the deal they ultimately want to strike. Less clear is whether the U.S. and North Korean visions can match up in any meaningful way. \\"Singapore might be the first time people will have to put their cards on the table,\\" a U.S. official said on the condition of anonymity. Upon his arrival Friday at the White House, Kim Yong Chol, who is under U.S. sanctions for links to cyberattacks against American companies, delivered a letter from Kim Jong Un. While Trump did not reveal the contents, he described the gesture as \\"very nice.\\" How long did Trump meet with the second most powerful man in North Korea?  A. they met a long time  B. not enough information  C. 80 minutes  D. they met for over an hour","output":"C. 80 minutes. U.S. President Donald Trump met with a general he described as the second most powerful man in North Korea, Kim Yong Chol, for 80 minutes in the Oval Office."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This post came to me at 10pm last night, on Day 16 of this challenge, after a day of holidaying in London and with my head (and feet) too weary to put finger to touchscreen. Mrs Mc and I had just watched another live instalment of Broadchurch, murder mystery extraordinaire, particularly since in the second series there is no actual fresh murder to investigate. The verdict is about to be given on the accused killer from Series 1 when the inevitable happens... Cue title music. This moment has even gained a moniker in British homes, based on the theme tune to the real masters of the four-times-a-week cliffhanger, London-based soap opera Eastenders. It's call a \\"ba...ba...ba...ba, ba, ba-ba-ba-ba\\" (YouTube will provide overseas readers with auditory explanation). Eastenders is such a master of writing in the perfect pace that every 28 minute episode ends with a tantalising screen freeze on the latest shocked face / smirking baddy / confused victim. For really big stories the cliffhanger can last significantly longer.

Movie title: The Hound of the Baskervilles Context: Several centuries later, the death of Sir Charles Baskerville is being reported by his best friend, Dr. Richard Mortimer (Francis de Wolff), to Sherlock Holmes (Peter Cushing) and Dr. Watson (AndrÃ© Morell), who are willing to meet the new owner of Baskerville Hall, Sir Henry (Christopher Lee). After meeting Sir Henry, Holmes remembers that he is going to be away on another case when Sir Henry returns to Baskerville Hall. Holmes puts Watson in charge of watching over Sir Henry. A tarantula attacks Sir Henry briefly in London; Holmes suspects foul play. Before he leaves, Holmes reminds Watson not to let Sir Henry go out onto the moor after dark. On the way to Baskerville Hall, the coach driver, Perkins (Sam Kydd), warns that a convict named Selden (Michael Mulcaster) has escaped from nearby Dartmoor Prison two days ago. Watson remembers the case: Selden was convicted of murdering a number of street women; due to his being found insane, he was sentenced to life imprisonment instead of hanging. At Baskerville Hall, Watson and Sir Henry learn from the butler, Barrymore (John Le Mesurier), that one of the two paintings of Sir Hugo was stolen several months ago. Watson then inquires Barrymore about further details of Sir Charles's death since Barrymore was the first to discover the body. Barrymore explains that he was on his way to warn Dr. Mortimer of Sir Charles's disappearance and then found the body by chance. The next day, Sir Henry and Watson meet the friendly local pastor, Bishop Frankland (Miles Malleson), who is also a keen entomologist. After leaving instructions at the post office in town, Watson meets a man named Stapleton (Ewen Solon) and his daughter Cecille (Marla Landi), who save him from sinking into quicksand in the Grimpen Mire.

She is unable to forgive him for abandoning the family and leaving her mother to a hard life and early death. This situation changes when Pesh-Chidin and a dozen of his followers (who have left the reservation) pass through the area, ritualistically killing settlers and taking their daughters to be sold into sex slavery in Mexico. Among those captured is Maggie's eldest daughter, Lilly. Maggie's rancher boyfriend Brake Baldwin was among the settlers killed.  The U.S. Cavalry refuses to help retrieve the captive women as its resources are tied up conducting forced relocation of captive Native Americans. This leaves Maggie, her father, and her younger daughter Dot alone in tracking the attackers. The group unexpectedly meets up with Kayitah, a Chiricahua, and an old friend of Jones, who also happens to be tracking the attackers with his son Honesco, because among the captives is a young Chiricahua woman who is engaged to Honesco. After the two agree to join the group, and Maggie treats Honesco's injuries, Kayitah informs Maggie that Jones had been a member of their Chiricahua band where he gained the name Chaa-duu-ba-its-iidan (\\"shit for luck\\") during his wanderings. It is finally with the combined efforts of the two families that they are able to free the women, at the cost of Kayitah's life, and immediately flee to the mountains with the kidnappers behind them. Knowing they have no other choice but to stand their ground, the group fights off the remaining kidnappers. During the battle, Jones fights El Brujo, the one responsible for kidnapping his granddaughter. When Brujo attempts to kill Maggie with a shotgun, Jones sacrifices his life to save his daughter as both he and Brujo fall off a cliff to their deaths.

Problem:This paper presents machine learning solutions to a practical problem of Natural Language Generation (NLG), particularly the word formation in agglutinative languages like Tamil, in a supervised manner. The morphological generator is an important component of Natural Language Processing in Artificial Intelligence. It generates word forms given a root and affixes. The morphophonemic changes like addition, deletion, alternation etc., occur when two or more morphemes or words joined together. The Sandhi rules should be explicitly specified in the rule based morphological analyzers and generators. In machine learning framework, these rules can be learned automatically by the system from the training samples and subsequently be applied for new inputs. In this paper we proposed the machine learning models which learn the morphophonemic rules for noun declensions from the given training data. These models are trained to learn sandhi rules using various learning algorithms and the performance of those algorithms are presented. From this we conclude that machine learning of morphological processing such as word form generation can be successfully learned in a supervised manner, without explicit description of rules. The performance of Decision trees and Bayesian machine learning algorithms on noun declensions are discussed.

He also gives motivational speeches, using the analogy \\"What's In Your Backpack?\\" to extol the virtues of a life free of burdensome relationships with people as well as things. A frequent flyer, Ryan relishes his travels, and desires to become the seventh and youngest person to earn ten million frequent flyer miles with American Airlines. During his travels, he meets another frequent flyer named Alex, and they begin a casual relationship. Ryan is called back to his company's offices in Omaha, Nebraska. Natalie Keener, a young and ambitious new hire, promotes a program designed to cut costs by conducting layoffs via videoconferencing. Ryan raises concerns that the program could be seen as detached and apathetic, arguing that Natalie knows nothing about the reality of the firing process or how to handle upset people. He then plays the role of a fired employee to demonstrate her inexperience. Ryan's boss assigns him to bring Natalie on his next round of terminations to show her the ropes. As they travel together, Natalie questions Ryan's philosophies on life, particularly on relationships and love, but Ryan is adamant that he is more than happy with his lifestyle. During the trip, Natalie is shattered when her boyfriend unceremoniously dumps her by text message, and Ryan and Alex try to comfort her.

Movie title: The Talented Mr. Ripley Context: Tom Ripley is a young man struggling to make a living in 1950s New York City. While playing piano at a cocktail party in New York City, he is approached by wealthy shipbuilder Herbert Greenleaf, who mistakenly believes that Ripley went to Princeton University with his son, Dickie, because Ripley is wearing a borrowed Princeton blazer. Greenleaf recruits Ripley to travel to Italy and persuade Dickie to return to the United States, for which he will pay Ripley 1,000 (equivalent to 8,834 in 2015). Ripley accepts the proposal, even though he did not attend Princeton and has never met Dickie. Upon arriving by ship in Europe, Ripley meets a wealthy textile heiress named Meredith Logue. During their brief conversation, he impulsively pretends to be Dickie, later commenting in voice-over that \\"it is better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.\\" Shortly after his arrival in Italy, Ripley fakes a chance encounter on the beach with Dickie and his fiancÃ©e, Marge Sherwood. Ripley later discloses to Dickie and Marge that Mr. Greenleaf paid him to travel to Europe and persuade Dickie to return home. This revelation infuriates Dickie; he declines the invitation and suggests Ripley go back to America and inform his father that he has no intention of ever returning. Ripley instead ingratiates himself into Dickie's life under the pretext of being a fellow jazz lover. The two concoct a scheme for Ripley to wring additional funds from Greenleaf by regularly mailing letters suggesting Dickie is wavering and will likely return to America if Ripley can remain in Italy and continue applying pressure. On a jaunt to Rome, Ripley meets Dickie's friend Freddie Miles, who treats Ripley with barely concealed contempt. A local girl, pregnant by Dickie, drowns herself after he refuses to help her financially; this sends Dickie into a downward spiral.

And you won't have to wander far from home to enjoy one of these national treasures, with Michigan's Isle Royale National Park nearby. Located 56 miles from Copper Harbor on Michigan's Upper Peninsula, the park remains _ that can only be reached by tour boat. With the exception of the Rock Harbor Lodge, which offers both rooms with private baths and accommodations in the form of small cottages, the 572,000 acres that make up the 45-mile-long park are rough, threaded with hiking paths that lead to tents-only campsites. You are likely to see a deer crossing mist-covered ponds in search of breakfast, gaze bald eagles flying overhead, or hear a beaver  clapping its tail on the water. If you are especially lucky, you might even glimpse a grey wolf, nearly dying out from hunting on the mainland. Plenty of hiking paths open the area to exploration. The 4-mile Stroll Path winds through various trees and offers a tour of the island's history, including prehistoric Indian mines. The Jungle Path leads to Scoville Point----a perfect picnic spot surrounded on three sides by the shining waters of Lake Superior. You can also rent a boat at the park's service center and row down the shore to the Rock Harbor Lighthouse. Here park's service employees use nets to show how lake fishes used to be caught by the original local people. Their catch ends up on the dinner menu at the Rock Harbor Lodge.

In the New York Times, he lays out two possibilities of what Trump might offer. One is \\"incremental\\" assistance and the lifting of sanctions if Kim agrees to freeze and eventually dismantle his nuclear and long-range ballistic missile programs. But Cha thinks Trump might be more tempted by a \\"big bang\\" idea—denuclearization in exchange for a peace treaty and diplomatic normalization of relations. Cha lays out both scenarios and warns that a disastrous meeting could actually \\"take us closer to war.\\" Other views and developments: Like he planned it? The meeting is \\"a stunning vindication of the president’s strategy,\\" writes Robert Charles at Fox News. He credits Trump's \\"engaged, creative and blunt approach\\" for securing the meeting.

Expand this summary.","output":"The surprise announcement of a meeting between President Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un in May has sparked widespread speculation on the potential outcomes. Victor Cha, a former National Security Council director, presented two possibilities for what Trump might propose in a New York Times article.  The first option is an incremental approach, where Trump could offer assistance and a lifting of sanctions if the North Korean leader agrees to freeze and eventually dismantle his nuclear and long-range ballistic missile programs. This method would require a series of phased agreements, verifications, and actions taken by both nations to reduce tension over time. It offers a cautious but steady path toward reducing the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear capabilities. However, Cha believes that Trump might be more inclined to go for a \\"big bang\\" idea, which would involve denuclearization in exchange for a peace treaty and full diplomatic normalization of relations. This would be a bold move and require a significant leap of faith on both sides, as well as a substantial shift in the geopolitical landscape. While the potential benefits of such a deal are vast, so are the risks.  The Trump administration's unorthodox handling of foreign policy has caught the attention of global leaders and brought the US President face-to-face with North Korea's Kim Jong Un. A denuclearized Korean peninsula may seem like a long shot, but if Trump achieves it, he could garner the same global stature as Ronald Reagan. Robert Charles, writing for Fox News, praised Trump for his \\"engaged, creative and blunt approach,\\" which he says secured the meeting with Kim and is a vindication of the President's strategy. The meeting has also sparked a review of past interactions between the two leaders that involved derogatory remarks about each other. President Trump called Kim \\"little rocket man\\" and \\"short and fat,\\" while Kim referred to Trump as a \\"mentally deranged US dotard.\\" This history of animosity adds an element of unpredictability to the upcoming meeting and highlights the potential for disagreements and escalated tension. In conclusion, the upcoming summit between President Trump and Kim Jong Un presents a historic opportunity for diplomacy and a potential resolution to the longstanding tension on the Korean peninsula. Victor Cha's analysis of the possible outcomes highlights the high stakes and risk involved in the negotiations, as well as the complex balance between pursuing cautious, incremental progress versus a more dramatic, all-or-nothing approach. While a successful meeting could significantly alter global politics and bring about unprecedented peace and cooperation, a disastrous outcome could heighten tensions and bring the United States and North Korea closer to war. The world will be watching closely as these two unpredictable leaders meet in May to discuss the future of the Korean peninsula."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Can you tell me the answer to where are the majority of cases heard in the united states??","output":"To find the answer to where the majority of cases are heard in the United States, I will follow these steps: 1. Identify the tiers of the U.S. courts system. 2. Determine the court tier that hears the majority of cases. 3. Provide an explanation and statistics to support the answer. Step 1: In the U.S., the court system is divided into three tiers: federal courts, state courts, and local courts. Federal courts mainly handle cases that involve federal laws, state courts handle cases involving state laws, and local courts handle cases related to city or county ordinances. Step 2: The majority of cases in the United States are heard in state courts. This is because most legal matters fall under state authority, and as such, state courts have jurisdiction over a wide variety of cases, including criminal, civil, family, and probate cases. Step 3: To support this answer, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), in 2018 there were over 76.6 million cases handled by the state courts in the United States, with over 50 percent of those cases being traffic or ordinance violations. In contrast, federal courts handle a significantly smaller number of cases. In 2020, according to the United States Courts, there were approximately 361,000 filings in the federal courts, with most of them being either civil or criminal cases. In conclusion, the majority of cases in the United States are heard in state courts, as they handle a wider variety of cases and a significantly higher number of cases compared to federal courts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Her parents, Jerry and Phyllis, fly to Italy to meet her fiancé and his parents. Jerry happens to hear Giancarlos (Michelangelo's father) beautiful operatic voice while the latter sings in the shower. As a former admittedly avant-garde and critically reviled opera director, Jerry feels inspired to bring Giancarlos gift to the public. Although Giancarlo protests that he sings for himself and doesnt want to go professional, Jerry pushes the issue until Giancarlo agrees to audition in front of a room of opera bigwigs. Outside the safety of his shower, Giancarlos confidence abandons him. He makes faces and he is humiliated. Michelangelo, who attended the audition too, accuses Jerry of using his father to achieve some level of fame for himself. It occurs to Jerry that Giancarlo, like most people, sings the most confidently when he has some measure of privacy. In Giancarlos case, he performs best in his shower. Giancarlo, naked but for a towel, premieres at the Teatro dellOpera di Roma. Jerry has built him a shower onstage, and Giancarlo sings as he washes. The opera attendees love his strange performance, so Jerry and Giancarlo decide to stage Pagliacci, shower and all. Again, Giancarlos rich voice mesmerizes the crowd, and he receives rave reviews though Jerry's direction is once again utterly reviled, a fact he is not aware of since he doesn't understand Italian.

There is no official definition of its area but its characteristics are understood to include a high density built environment, high land values, an elevated daytime population and a concentration of regionally, nationally and internationally significant organisations and facilities. Over time a number of definitions have been used to define the scope of central London for statistics, urban planning and local government.   - London Wall was the defensive wall first built by the Romans around Londinium, their strategically important port town on the River Thames in what is now London, England, and subsequently maintained until the 18th century.  - Whitechapel is a district in the East End of London, England, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.  - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster).   - Norton Folgate is a short length of street in London, connecting Bishopsgate with Shoreditch High Street, on the northern edge of the City of London.   - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery.

Here is a question about this article: It is still possible for two sounds of indefinite pitch to clearly be higher or lower than one another. For instance, a snare drum sounds higher pitched than a bass drum though both have indefinite pitch, because its sound contains higher frequencies. In other words, it is possible and often easy to roughly discern the relative pitches of two sounds of indefinite pitch, but sounds of indefinite pitch do not neatly correspond to any specific pitch. A special type of pitch often occurs in free nature when sound reaches the ear of an observer directly from the source, and also after reflecting off a sound-reflecting surface. This phenomenon is called repetition pitch, because the addition of a true repetition of the original sound to itself is the basic prerequisite. What is the answer to this question: Repetition pitch is caused by what phenomenon?","output":"Repetition pitch is caused by the phenomenon wherein a sound reaches the listener's ear directly from the source and also after reflecting off a sound-reflecting surface. This creates an effect where the original sound is combined with its true repetition, leading to the perception of a distinct pitch. The addition of the original sound to its reflection is the fundamental prerequisite for the occurrence of repetition pitch. In real-world settings, this can happen when sound waves produced by a source, such as a musical instrument or a speaker, travel directly towards the listener and, simultaneously, reflect off nearby surfaces like walls, ceilings, or floors. As the reflected sound waves take a slightly longer path to reach the listener compared to the direct sound waves, they arrive with a small delay. This delay causes the direct and reflected waves to overlap and interact with each other, forming a new, combined waveform. The temporal repetition pattern within the combined waveform results in the perception of repetition pitch. The specific pitch heard by the listener in such cases depends on the delay between the direct and reflected sounds, the frequencies present in the original signal, and the listener's auditory processing abilities. Repetition pitch can have several practical implications, such as improving the listener's ability to detect patterns or changes in sounds, leading to a richer auditory experience. In some cases, however, it may cause interference or confusion if the repetition pitch clashes with other pitches present in the acoustic environment, such as in cases of echoes or reverberations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is because the question is asking for a specific number that represents the total count of horses that died during the civil war. To provide a detailed answer, we must explore the role of horses in the civil war and the factors that contributed to their demise. During the American Civil War (1861-1865), horses were essential for transportation, communication, and combat. They were used for carrying soldiers, moving artillery, carrying messages, and scouting enemy positions. The Civil War saw thousands of mounted soldiers – from both Union and Confederacy – on either side. Horses were crucial to many military strategies and could often be the deciding factor in battles. Several factors contributed to the high mortality rate among horses during the Civil War. Horses were subjected to harsh working conditions, malnutrition, and diseases that could rapidly spread in tightly packed camps. War horses also faced the risk of injury or death from enemy fire, as well as from the chaos and panic of battle. Unfortunately, many of the horses used in the war were unprepared for the harsh realities of combat, and their lack of training and conditioning made them prone to injuries and illnesses. Estimates of the total number of horses that died during the American Civil War vary. It is difficult to determine an exact number due in part to the chaos of war and the lack of detailed records. However, it is generally believed that around 1 million to 1.5 million horses and mules died during the conflict. In conclusion, the answer to the question \\"How many horses died during the civil war?\\" would be a numeric value. The horses played a significant role in the American Civil War, and their high mortality rate was due to several factors such as harsh working conditions, malnutrition, diseases, and the perils of warfare."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

During the ensuing Battle of Chaeronea, Philip commanded the right wing and Alexander the left, accompanied by a group of Philip's trusted generals. According to the ancient sources, the two sides fought bitterly for some time. Philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat, counting on the untested Athenian hoplites to follow, thus breaking their line. Alexander was the first to break the Theban lines, followed by Philip's generals. Having damaged the enemy's cohesion, Philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed them. With the Athenians lost, the Thebans were surrounded. Left to fight alone, they were defeated. After the victory at Chaeronea, Philip and Alexander marched unopposed into the Peloponnese, welcomed by all cities; however, when they reached Sparta, they were refused, but did not resort to war.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The three germ layers are the endoderm, the ectoderm, and the mesoderm. Cells in each germ layer differentiate into tissues and embryonic organs. The ectoderm gives rise to the nervous system and the epidermis, among other tissues. The mesoderm gives rise to the muscle cells and connective tissue in the body. The endoderm gives rise to the gut and many internal organs. Organogenesis Gastrulation leads to the formation of the three germ layers that give rise during further development to the different organs in the animal body. This process is called organogenesis. Organs develop from the germ layers through the process of differentiation. During differentiation, the embryonic stem cells express specific sets of genes that will determine their ultimate cell type. For example, some cells in the ectoderm will express the genes specific to skin cells. As a result, these cells will take on the shape and characteristics of epidermal cells. The process of differentiation is regulated by location-specific chemical signals from the cell’s embryonic environment that sets in play a cascade of events that regulates gene expression.   Q: Which germ layers are essential for animal embryos to grow and develop into a body?

Process:  - A conducting metal, like copper, is wrapped around a piece of metal - An electrical source, like a battery, produces an electrical current - The electrical current flows through the wire - The electrical current creates a magnetic field around the wire, magnetizing the metal - The magnetic field can be turned on and off by starting or stopping the electricity source -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more electric current flows happens, how will it affect a STRONGER electromagnet.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"Step 1: Increase the electrical current in the circuit To analyze the perturbation hypothesis, let's assume we increase the electrical current flowing through the conducting metal (copper) by using a higher capacity battery or any other suitable method. Step 2: Observe the effect of increased electrical current on the magnetic field As the electrical current increases, according to Ampere's law, the magnetic field generated around the wire also increases. This means that, with more electric current, a stronger magnetic field is produced around the wire. Step 3: Determine the effect of a stronger magnetic field on the magnetization of the metal As the magnetic field becomes stronger, the metal wrapped around the copper wire will experience increased magnetization. A higher amount of magnetic domains within the metal will align with the magnetic field, thereby creating a stronger electromagnet overall. Step 4: Evaluate the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis states that if more electric current flows, it will lead to the creation of a stronger electromagnet. Based on the analysis in Steps 1-3, we can conclude that the perturbation hypothesis is correct. More electrical current flowing through the wire does have a direct effect on the magnetic field strength, which in turn affects the strength of the electromagnet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Available choices: I. No; II. Yes;","output":"I. No The answer \\"It is also known to reduce aggression and violent behavior.\\" does not appropriately address the question about the rarity of cardiac issues with amitriptyline. Instead, a more detailed and fitting response to the question should focus on the potential for cardiovascular side effects of the drug. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) used to treat a range of conditions such as depression, anxiety, and neuropathic pain. While it has therapeutic benefits, its use may be associated with various side effects. Among these, cardiac issues are a possibility, albeit relatively rare. Cardiovascular side effects associated with amitriptyline may include: - Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats): TCAs such as amitriptyline can cause changes in the electrical activity of the heart, leading to arrhythmias. However, this risk typically exists for individuals with existing cardiovascular issues or heart disorders. - Hypotension/postural hypotension (low blood pressure): Amitriptyline may cause a drop in blood pressure, especially in the elderly. This can lead to dizziness and fainting, especially upon standing up too quickly. - Tachycardia (fast heart rate): Amitriptyline can sometimes cause an increase in heart rate as a side effect. - QT interval prolongation (a type of heart rhythm disturbance): In rare cases, amitriptyline may lead to QT interval prolongation, which can increase the risk of developing a life-threatening arrhythmia called torsades de pointes. The incidence of cardiovascular side effects with amitriptyline depends on various factors, such as dosage, duration of use, individual susceptibility, and presence of pre-existing health conditions. It is important to note that the majority of people taking amitriptyline do not experience serious cardiac issues. In summary, while cardiac problems with amitriptyline are relatively uncommon, they can occur in susceptible individuals or those with pre-existing heart conditions. It is crucial to closely monitor patients taking amitriptyline for any signs of cardiovascular side effects. Healthcare providers should take the potential risks and benefits into account when prescribing amitriptyline to ensure optimal safety and efficacy of treatment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's my step-by-step thinking and justification: 1. Assess the options: We are given two choices - molding something on a counter and on a napkin. 2. Identify the purpose: Since we are trying to mold something, we need a sturdy surface and enough space to work with the material. 3. Evaluate the surface stability: A counter is usually a stable, flat surface, designed to support various tasks. On the other hand, a napkin is a thin, flexible piece of material, primarily used to clean up or protect surfaces. 4. Evaluate available space: Counters typically provide more space to work on, while the space on a napkin is limited. 5. Evaluate ease of cleaning: While both surfaces can be wiped clean, doing so on a counter is generally more straightforward, as a napkin can easily become saturated or torn.

Hempstead, New York (CNN) -- President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney face off Tuesday in the second of their three debates, this one in a town hall-style setting in which they'll take questions from likely voters.  The stakes couldn't be higher: Obama must get his campaign back on track after a poor performance in the first debate that left Democrats demoralized and Obama's lead evaporating both in national polls and those in key battleground states.

Tens of thousands packed Penn State's football stadium Saturday, cheering the Nittany Lions for the first time since graphic child sexual abuse allegations rocked the university and led to the ouster of its president and iconic football coach. The Nittany Lions lost the game -- the first in 46 years without Joe Paterno as head coach -- 17-14 to Nebraska. But the man who replaced Paterno said that the actions of fans and players Saturday sent a message against sexual abuse and helped them personally come to grips after an emotional week. \\"It was a day of solidarity for the children, for the victims -- it was a touching moment,\\" interim coach Tom Bradley said of the crowd's demeanor and emotional pre-game ceremonies focused on child abuse. \\"I felt that today, just maybe, the healing process started to begin.\\" A moment of silence was held before the game in honor of the alleged victims. Current and former players from Penn State and Nebraska locked arms amid thunderous applause from more than 100,000 fans -- many of them wearing blue, to focus attention on child abuse -- in attendance. Interim Penn State President Rodney Erickson said Saturday that it was important for the Penn State community, led by the team's players, to \\"show unity\\" for one another and in opposition to child sex abuse. Doing so, he said, is particularly important in the wake of the flood of emotions, including on-campus rioting, that followed Paterno's firing. \\"We ... want to demonstrate not just to the Penn State community, but to the rest of the world, that Penn State is a caring community, that Penn State is moving forward with a sense of purpose, and that hopefully there are elements of good that can come out of this situation,\\" Erickson told reporters after the game. Sports Illustrated: Despite defeat, healing process begins. Paterno's son Jay Paterno, a current Penn State assistant coach, told ESPN on Saturday that \\"the world ... turned upside down\\" exactly one week earlier with the arrest of former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky. A 23-page grand jury report described crimes that Sandusky allegedly committed against young boys between 1994 and 2009 -- some of them on campus, both during and after his tenure at at Penn State. Sandusky's attorney, Joseph Amendola, has said that his client disputes the report. In addition to Sandusky, Penn State Athletic Director Timothy Curley and Senior Vice President for Finance and Business Gary Schultz were charged for failing to report the abuse to authorities and misleading authorities. Joe Paterno, the winningest coach in top-level college football history, was not criminally charged. Still, he was dismissed Wednesday by Penn State's board of trustees for failing to do more when a then-graduate assistant told him in 2002 that he had seen Sandusky allegedly rape a boy in the showers of a campus athletics facility. Paterno alerted Curley, his immediate boss, but it was years before law enforcement first learned about the allegation. The graduate assistant, Mike McQueary, who was later promoted to a full-time assistant coach, eventually described the alleged incident in graphic detail to a grand jury. McQueary was placed on administrative leave Friday. Scores of people gathered outside Paterno's home early Saturday evening to show their support. The former coach wasn't home during the game -- later pulling up in a minivan -- but his wife, Sue, did come out briefly to thank those who \\"propped me up\\" after the turbulent week. Jay Paterno said Saturday that he had a simple message for his father before the Nittany Lions took to the field Saturday. \\"Dad, I wish you were here (and) we love you,\\" the younger Paterno recalled to ESPN, breaking into tears. Many questions remain unanswered in the case, with several investigations launched by the school and the state to probe further possible wrongdoing by team, athletic department and administrative officials. Whatever those investigations find, Erickson has said it is imperative to promote dialogue about sexual abuse and change the \\"culture\\" at Penn State so that witnesses don't hesitate to come forward. \\"Never again should anyone at Penn State -- regardless of their position -- feel scared to do the right thing,\\" Erickson said earlier this week following his appointment as interim president after trustees on Wednesday ousted Graham Spanier. Spanier initially voiced support for Curley and Schultz following the release of the grand jury report Saturday. CNN's Sarah Hoye contributed to this report. Write highlights for this article.","output":"Many people gathered at Penn State's football stadium to cheer for the Nittany Lions in their first game since some bad things happened at the university. Some people who worked there did things that hurt children, and it made a lot of people very sad. Joe Paterno, a very famous football coach, was not there anymore because he didn't do enough to stop the bad things. The new coach, Tom Bradley, said that everyone coming together at the game was a way to show support for the children who were hurt and to help everyone start healing. They had a moment of silence for the victims before the game began, and everyone wore blue to show they cared about stopping child abuse. The game was an important step for the Penn State community to show that they care and want to make sure nothing like this ever happens again."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Nach Schätzungen im Weißbuch der Kommission werden die Kohlendioxidemissionen zwischen 1990 und 2010 um 50 % zunehmen, wobei Hauptverursacher der Emissionen der Straßenverkehr ist, sein Anteil am CO2-Ausstoß beträgt 84 %. Translate to English","output":"According to estimates in the Commission's White Paper, carbon dioxide emissions are expected to increase by 50% between 1990 and 2010, with road traffic being the main cause of these emissions, accounting for 84% of CO2 emissions. Below, I will provide a more detailed explanation of this statement: 1. The Commission's White Paper refers to a document published by a governing body or organization, which outlines their plans, policies, and strategies to address a particular issue. In this context, the paper addresses the increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their impact on climate change, which is a topic of high importance for governments and organizations across the world. 2. The 50% increase in CO2 emissions between 1990 and 2010 shows that there has been a significant and concerning growth in the emission levels over the span of two decades. This highlights the fact that if immediate and effective steps are not taken to reduce the emissions, the consequences will likely be disastrous, leading to aggravated climate change and its numerous detrimental effects on the planet. 3. Road traffic, as per the statement, is the major contributor to these emissions, accounting for a noteworthy 84% of the total CO2 emissions. This detail emphasizes the fact that the transport sector, particularly road transport, plays a major role in the issue of climate change. 4. Linking the problem to its potential solutions, it can be inferred that actions must be taken to address the heavy dependence on road transportation. This may involve promoting and improving public transportation, implementing stricter regulations on vehicle emissions standards, encouraging the use of low-emission or electric vehicles, investing in the development of more sustainable infrastructure, and raising public awareness about the implications of their choices and actions on carbon emissions. In conclusion, the statement highlights the critical issue of escalating carbon dioxide emissions between 1990 and 2010, mainly caused by road traffic, which is responsible for 84% of the CO2 emissions. With the severe consequences of climate change already being felt around the world, it becomes essential for governments, organizations, and individuals to take this information into account and adopt suitable measures to reduce the emissions from road transportation and thus, mitigate the effects of climate change."},{"instruction":"Short general knowledge question: who does avril lavigne play in over the hedge?","output":"In the animated movie \\"Over the Hedge,\\" Avril Lavigne voices the character of Heather, a young opossum."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Here's a question: What covers the bones in a human body?  Here are possible answers to this question: - matter - muscle - flesh - skin and - cartilage  I believe the correct choice is \\"flesh\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"While \\"flesh\\" is a term that can be used to describe the substance covering the bones in a human body, it is not the most precise or comprehensive answer to the question. To fully answer the question, let's take a closer look at the structure and composition of the human body, particularly focusing on the following options provided: muscle, skin, cartilage, and matter. 1. Muscle: Muscles form a large part of the body's flesh and play a vital role in movement, stability, and overall functioning. Our bodies contain over 600 muscles, which help us move, maintain posture, and carry out daily activities. Muscles attach to bones through tendons and are essential for covering the bones and providing structure to the human body. 2. Skin: The skin is the body's largest organ and serves as the protective outer layer of the body. It not only covers the bones but also the muscles, organs, and other internal structures. The skin acts as a barrier against external factors such as microbes, chemicals, and UV radiation and plays a crucial part in regulating body temperature. 3. Cartilage: Cartilage is a type of connective tissue found throughout the body in various structures. In some areas, cartilage serves as a cushion between bones, such as in joints, where it reduces friction and helps with shock absorption. In other areas, cartilage provides shape and support to structures such as the ears, nose, and windpipe. While cartilage does not directly cover the bones in the majority of the body, it does play a vital role in the body's overall function and structure. 4. Matter: The term \\"matter\\" is quite general and refers to any substance that occupies space and has mass. It can include solid, liquid, and gaseous substances. Therefore, while it is true that matter surrounds the bones in some form, this term is not as specific or accurate as the other options provided. Taking into account the provided choices, the most accurate and comprehensive response to the question of what covers the bones in the human body would be a combination of muscle, skin, and—to some extent—cartilage. These components work together to protect, support, and enable the function of the skeletal system and the body as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Some guys think that sniper is not good because of the action part of it was not good enough. Well, if you regard it as an action movie, this view point could be quite true as the action part of this movive is not actually exciting. However, I think this is a psychological drama rather than an action one. The movie mainly told us about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences. Tomas Beccket , who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills, looked as if he was cold-hearted. However, after Beccket showed his day dream of Montana, we can clearly see his softness inside. It was the cruel war and his partners' sacrifice that made Beccket become so called cold-hearted. Millar, on the contrary, was a new comer, a green hand, and was even not qualified as a sniper. Billy Zane did quite well to show millar's hesitation and fear when he first tried to \\"put a bullet through one's heart\\"(as what Beccket said). What he thought about the actuall suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely get back and receive the award. These two guys were quite different in their personalities and I think that the movie had successfully showed the difference and the impact they had to each other due to the difference in their personalities. These two snipers quarreled, suspected each other and finally come to an understanding by the communication and by what they had done to help even to save the other.

Tide pool: A tide pool is a small pool of water that is formed when seawater gets trapped in rocky crevices as the tide goes out. While anemones can be found in tide pools, this option refers to a specific marine environmental feature rather than a source of information to learn about anemones. 3. South Pacific: The South Pacific is a region of the Pacific Ocean. While it is true that anemones can be discovered in this area, it doesn't serve as a practical information source for someone seeking a definition or clarification of what an anemone is. 4. Dictionary: A dictionary is a reference book containing an alphabetical list of words, along with their meanings, usage, and sometimes pronunciation. It's a reliable and precise source to look up the definition of a word like \\"anemone.\\" As a result, it would be the best choice to find out what an anemone is. 5. Sea water: Sea water is the water found in oceans and seas. While anemones reside in this environment, the term \\"sea water\\" does not provide any information about the specific organisms living within it. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"dictionary\\" to answer the question above because dictionaries are designed to provide the definitions and meanings of words in a detailed and straightforward manner. Looking up \\"anemone\\" in a dictionary would yield the most accurate and direct answer, unlike the other options, which are related to the natural environment of the anemone but do not offer a clear explanation of what it is."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In chapters 3 and 4 we described how the U.S. government adjusted its existing agencies and capacities to address the emerging threat from Usama  Bin Laden and his associates. After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting  Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of  Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about  Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on  Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about  Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing  Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of  Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training.  Do you have any questions?","output":"Alright, let's talk about this like you're five years old! A long time ago, there was a bad man named Usama Bin Laden. He had a group of friends that did very mean things, like blowing up buildings. The big boss of the United States, President Bill Clinton, wanted to find Bin Laden and stop his mean friends from doing more bad things. Sometimes, Clinton and his helper named Sandy would get secret messages that told them where Bin Laden might be hiding. They didn't want everyone to know they were looking for him, so they didn't talk about it a lot in public. As a really big date called the \\"millennium\\" was coming up, people were worried that computers would stop working, and some thought maybe Bin Laden's group would use that to do more bad things. One day, the people from a country called Jordan heard a phone call between two bad guys, Abu Zubaydah and Khadr Abu Hoshar. They thought something big was about to happen, so Jordan arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 other sneaky guys. One of those bad guys, Raed Hijazi, was actually born in America but later got involved with the bad man Bin Laden and his friends. With the help of those sneaky guys from different countries, Abu Hoshar and Raed were planning to do some mean things to Jewish and American people in Jordan.

Test sentence: \\"It was tomorrow that I promised that he would be there.\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence?","output":"The test sentence, \\"It was tomorrow that I promised that he would be there,\\" is grammatically correct in English, but it might sound slightly unusual, which can make it confusing for some readers or listeners. To better understand its structure and meaning, let's break it down into its constituent parts and analyze the intended message. 1. \\"It was tomorrow that...\\": This phrase uses an expletive construction, also known as \\"it-cleft\\" construction. The dummy pronoun \\"it\\" is used to shift emphasis in a sentence, often to highlight a specific time, place, or action. Here, the emphasis is placed on \\"tomorrow\\" as the time when the speaker made a promise. Expletive constructions are common and acceptable in English, although they can sometimes lead to ambiguity or make sentences sound more complex than they need to be. 2. \\"...I promised that...\\": This part of the sentence introduces the speaker into the situation and indicates that they made a promise. It sets up the context for the rest of the sentence, by making it clear that the speaker takes responsibility for the action or statement to come. 3. \\"...he would be there\\": This final clause is a dependent clause that states the content of the speaker's promise. It refers to the presence of a person (indicated by the pronoun \\"he\\") at a specific location. Putting these three parts together, the sentence can be rephrased as, \\"I promised that he would be there tomorrow.\\" Simplifying the structure in this way retains the intended meaning and makes it easier to understand. In conclusion, the test sentence is grammatically correct, but it might be considered stylistically odd or confusing due to the expletive construction and the order in which pieces of information are presented. Reordering and rephrasing the sentence can help to make it clearer and more easily understood."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What happens next in this paragraph? How to roll sushi  Place a sheet of nori on your sushi mat.  Sheets of nori have a rough side and a smooth side. Place the nori so that the rough side is facing up.","output":"After placing the nori sheet with the rough side facing up on the sushi mat, the next steps to roll sushi are as follows: 1. Prepare sushi rice: Before putting anything on the nori sheet, it is essential to have sushi rice prepared. Sushi rice is made by mixing cooked, short-grain Japanese rice with sushi vinegar (which is a mixture of rice vinegar, sugar, and salt). Once the rice is cooked and seasoned, let it cool down to room temperature. 2. Wet your hands: Sushi rice is sticky, which can make it difficult to spread evenly on the nori sheet. To prevent the rice from sticking to your hands, wet them with water or a mixture of water and vinegar. Keep a small bowl of water nearby while you work. 3. Spread the rice: Take a small amount of sushi rice (around a handful) and gently spread it over the rough side of the nori sheet, leaving about 1-2 cm of space at the top edge. The rice layer should be thin and even, roughly 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. Be careful not to press the rice too hard, as this can make the sushi roll dense and less enjoyable to eat. 4. Add ingredients: It's now time to add your desired filling ingredients. These can include a variety of options such as fish (salmon, tuna), cooked shrimp, avocado, cucumber, or any other preferred vegetables and proteins. Place the ingredients in a horizontal line, about 1/3 of the way up from the bottom edge of the nori sheet. 5. Begin rolling: Using the bamboo mat as a guide, lift the edge of the mat nearest to you and begin to roll the sushi away from you, applying gentle yet even pressure to tuck the sushi roll into a cylinder shape. Make sure that the rolled sushi stays in contact with the mat throughout the process. Stop rolling when you reach the part without the rice. 6. Seal the roll: To seal the sushi roll, lightly dampen the top edge of the nori sheet with water or the water and vinegar mixture. Finish rolling, and press the moistened edge gently to the roll to ensure it's sealed properly. 7. Shape the roll: Using the bamboo mat, gently press and shape the roll into a more uniform, cylindrical shape. Be careful not to press too hard, as this could lead to the rice and filling being squished. 8. Cut and serve: Once the roll is properly shaped and sealed, it's time to cut it into bite-sized pieces. Using a sharp, wet knife, cut the roll in half first, and then cut each half into three or four equal pieces, depending on your preference. Periodically wipe your knife with a damp cloth to prevent rice buildup and ensure clean cuts. Serve your sushi rolls immediately with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger on the side.

What is the answer??","output":"Alright, little buddy. We have a math problem to solve! It looks like this: 0 = -1013*v - 5801 - 22563 Our goal is to find the value of 'v.' Here's how we do it: 1. First, let's add the numbers that do not have a v next to them. These numbers are -5801 and -22563. When we add them together, it looks like this: -5801 + (-22563) = -28364 Now, our problem will look like this: 0 = -1013 * v - 28364 2. Next, we want to get rid of the -28364 so we can have v all by itself. To do that, we will add 28364 to both sides of the equation. It looks like this: 0 + 28364 = -1013 * v - 28364 + 28364 Now, 28364 is on both sides, so on the right side, it will cancel out. We will have: 28364 = -1013 * v 3. Lastly, we need to find the value of 'v'. Because we have -1013 times v or -1013*v, we will divide both sides by -1013 like this: 28364 ÷ -1013 = (-1013 * v) ÷ -1013 When we do the division, we get: v ≈ -28 So, the value of 'v' is about -28!

You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Passage: He was however forced to fall back across the Danube, and the Ottomans in turn led a massive counter-offensive  which aimed to not only take back their recently captured possessions but also conquer Wallachia once and for all. The push was initially successful, managing to capture not only Giurgiu but also Bucharest and Târgovişte, in spite of meeting fierce opposition at Călugăreni . At this point the Ottoman command grew complacent and stopped pursuing the retreating Wallachian army, focusing instead on fortifying Târgovişte and Bucharest and considering their task all but done. Michael had to wait almost two months for aid from his allies to arrive, but when it did his counter-offensive took the Ottomans by surprise, managing to sweep through the Ottoman defences on three successive battlefields, at Târgovişte , Bucharest , and Giurgiu . The Battle of Giurgiu in particular was devastating for the Ottoman forces, which had to retreat across the Danube in disarray. The war between Wallachia and the Ottomans continued until late 1599, when Michael was unable to continue the war due to poor support from his allies. The turning point of the war was the Battle of Mezőkeresztes, which took place in the territory of Hungary on October 24-26, 1596. The combined Habsburg-Transylvanian force of 45-50,000 troops was defeated by the Ottoman army. The battle turned when Christian soldiers, thinking they had won the battle, stopped fighting in order to plunder the Ottoman camp. Despite this victory, the Ottomans realized for the first time the superiority of Western military equipment over Ottoman weapons. This battle was the first significant military encounter in Central-Europe between a large Christian army and the Ottoman Turkish Army after the Battle of Mohács.

Garry rides into an Indian reservation and finds himself in the middle of a conflict between a cattle owner and some homesteaders. He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend. Riling tells Garry that he and Indian agent Jake Pindalest have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their best interests. With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd at an inflated price. Garry would get 10,000 for his part in the swindle. Lufton manages to outsmart Riling and move his herd unimpeded, but Riling and his men stampede and scatter the cattle back onto the reservation. It would take several days to gather the herd, more time than Lufton has before the deadline. Garry becomes disgusted when a man is killed in the stampede, and he switches sides.

For those of the Cardinal, Melanchthon, and Durer's final major work, a drawn portrait of the Nuremberg patrician Ulrich Starck, Durer depicted the sitters in profile, perhaps reflecting a more mathematical approach. Despite complaining of his lack of a formal classical education, Durer was greatly interested in intellectual matters and learned much from his boyhood friend Willibald Pirckheimer, whom he no doubt consulted on the content of many of his images. He also derived great satisfaction from his friendships and correspondence with Erasmus and other scholars. Durer succeeded in producing two books during his lifetime. \\"The Four Books on Measurement\\" were published at Nuremberg in 1525 and was the first book for adults on mathematics in German, as well as being cited later by Galileo and Kepler. The other, a work on city fortifications, was published in 1527. \\"The Four Books on Human Proportion\\" were published posthumously, shortly after his death in 1528.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Willibald Pirckheimer and Erasmus\\" correctly answer the question \\"What two scholars did Durer correspond frequently with?\\"?","output":"Yes, based on the paragraph, the response \\"Willibald Pirckheimer and Erasmus\\" correctly answers the question \\"What two scholars did Durer correspond frequently with?\\" as it mentions that Durer derived great satisfaction from his friendships and correspondence with Erasmus and other scholars, and also learned much from his boyhood friend Willibald Pirckheimer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame, she won three singles championships in Grand Slam tournaments, was the gold medalist at the 1992 Summer Olympics, reached the World No. 1 ranking, and is considered one of the greatest tennis players of all time. Capriati set a number of youngest-ever records at the start of her career. She made her professional debut in 1990 at the age of 13 years 11 months, reaching the final of the hard-court tournament in Boca Raton, Florida. 1999 was Capriati's best season in several years. She won her first title in six years at Strasbourg, defeating ninth ranked Nathalie Tauziat in a quarterfinal for her first win over a top 10 player in two years. She defeated Russian Elena Likhovtseva in the final. She won her second title of the year at Quebec City, defeating American Chanda Rubin in the final. She also reached the round of 16 at both Roland Garros and US Open. She finished the year at No. 23.  At the 2000 Australian Open, Capriati reached her first Grand Slam semifinal in nine years before losing to eventual champion Lindsay Davenport in straight sets.  At the Miami Masters, Capriati defeated World No. 6 Serena Williams for her first win over a player ranked in the top six in four years en route to a quarterfinal finish. Shortly after, Capriati was sidelined with right Achilles tendonitis in April and an elbow injury in June.  Capriati had a strong fall season, winning her ninth career title at Luxembourg, defeating Magdalena Maleeva. She also finished runner up in Quebec City to Chanda Rubin and was a semifinalist in Zurich. These results propelled Capriati back into the top 20 for the first time since April 1994. She qualified for the season-ending championships for the first time in seven years. Her year-end ranking was 14, her highest in seven years. Capriati was also a member of the US Fed Cup Team, winning a singles and doubles rubber in the US's victory over Spain in the final.

Earths magnetic field helps protect Earth and its organisms. It protects us from harmful particles given off by the sun. Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest. This is also where relatively few organisms live. Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earths magnetic north pole. Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations. Recent research suggests that warblers and other migrating birds have structures in their eyes. These structures let them see Earths magnetic field as a visual pattern.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the name of the album released in 1994 by the band from Athens, Georgia? ?  R.E.M. was an American rock band from Athens, Georgia, formed in 1980 by drummer Bill Berry, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist/backing vocalist Mike Mills, and lead vocalist Michael Stipe. One of the first alternative rock bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality and obscure lyrics, Mills' melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical style of drumming. R.E.M. released its first single—\\"Radio Free Europe\\"—in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single \\"The One I Love\\". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide. By the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre. The band then released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound and catapulted it to international fame. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound, but still continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. Its 1996 release, New Adventures in Hi-Fi, though critically acclaimed, fared worse commercially than its predecessors. The following year, Bill...

Given the question: Russian research spent most of their time in Antarctica to study the loss of ozone in the atmosphere. The Canadian team went north of the Polar Circle, close to the North Pole to do the same thing. They spent several months there. The Canadian team didn't find any ozone holes at the North Pole.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which team was more exposed to skin cancers?  Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. The answer is:","output":"The Russian team was more exposed to skin cancers. Justification: From the provided paragraphs, we understand that loss of ozone creates an \\"ozone hole,\\" resulting in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. This increased exposure to UV radiation raises the risk of skin cancer. Given that the Russian team was conducting research in Antarctica, where an ozone hole is specifically mentioned to exist, they would naturally be more exposed to UV radiation and, by extension, have a higher risk of skin cancers.  On the other hand, no mention of an \\"ozone hole\\" at the North Pole was stated; in fact, it was mentioned that the Canadian team \\"didn't find any ozone holes at the North Pole.\\" This implies that the Canadian team, stationed in the North, would have been under lesser exposure to UV radiation and hence at a lower risk of skin cancer compared to the Russian team."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Institute of technology (also: university of technology, polytechnic university, technikon, and technical college) is a designation employed for a wide range of learning institutions awarding different types of degrees and operating often at variable levels of the educational system. It may be an institution of higher education and advanced engineering and scientific research or professional vocational education, specializing in science, engineering, and technology or different sorts of technical subjects. It may also refer to a secondary education school focused in vocational training.[citation needed] The term institute of technology is often abbreviated IT and is not to be confused with information technology.  The English term polytechnic appeared in the early 19th century, from the French École Polytechnique, an engineering school founded in 1794 in Paris.

As best I could tell, he had been dead when he landed there. The mud and ooze around him were as serene and smooth as he was. The cop who was assisting me swam over and made a palms up gesture. I shrugged back at him and began to work the body loose. The corpse had only one leg, and as I worked I wondered what he had been doing in the lake. I got the arm free and kicked toward the quicksilver surface above me. The body turned bloated and heavy when I broke water with it, and it took three of us to load it into the police launch. I dried off and got a coke out of the cooler. It was getting to be another Texas scorcher, and the sunlight bouncing off the surface of the lake felt like it had needles in it.

Following her death, and with both George and Mary Watts increasingly out of fashion, the memorial was abandoned half-finished, with only 52 of the intended 120 spaces filled. In the years following Mary Watts's death there were occasional proposals to add new names to complete the memorial, but the Watts Gallery was hostile to the plans, considering the monument in its unfinished state to be a symbol of the Watts's values and beliefs, and that its status as a historic record of its time is what makes it of value in the present day.The nave of Christ Church Greyfriars was destroyed by bombing on 29 December 1940. By then the decline in the population of the City of London had reduced the congregation to less than 80, and the parishes of St Leonard, Foster Lane and Christ Church Greyfriars were merged with nearby St Sepulchre-without-Newgate. Although parts of the ruins were cleared during a widening of King Edward Street after the Second World War, the remains of the nave of Christ Church Greyfriars became a public memorial in 1989; the tower is now office space.St Botolph's Aldersgate remains open as a functioning church.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? a riveting profile of law enforcement , and a visceral , nasty journey into an urban hades .","output":"The review presented here expresses a positive opinion about the movie. Although the choice of words might seem negative at first glance, a close examination reveals that they're used to convey the thrilling intensity of the film.  The comment mentions 'a riveting profile of law enforcement', which suggests that the movie presents an engaging, compelling portrayal of the police or similar bodies. The term 'riveting' generally indicates something thrilling that captures interest or attention entirely. As such, it's quite likely that the reviewer was impressed by the film's interpretation of law enforcement officers' roles, leading to a positive assessment. The phrase 'a visceral, nasty journey into an urban hades' implies that the film powerfully and viscerally delves into the grim realities of urban life, presenting them very vividly to the point it could be conceived 'nasty'. Here, the word 'nasty' doesn't necessarily denote something awful or low-quality, but rather suggest the graphic or unfiltered portrayal of a harsh field. 'Urban hades' alludes to the challenges and harsh environments associated with urbanity, once again implying the movie's profound and vivid depiction of these realities. All summed up, rather than showing displeasure or criticism, the reviewer seems to appreciate the film's gritty and intense graphical depiction of the subject matter. They seem to laud the film's realism and ability to draw the audience into its world. So, while the language used may seem harsh, it seems to be used emblematically to partake in the reviewer's admiration for the movie's dramatic and robust representation of its themes. Thus, overall, the review expresses a positive understanding and perception about the movie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Nobuo Uematsu (Zhi Song  Shen Fu , Uematsu Nobuo, born March 21, 1959) is a Japanese video game composer, best known for scoring most of the titles in the Final Fantasy series by Square Enix. He is considered to be one of the most well known composers in the video game industry. Sometimes referred to as the \\"Beethoven of video games music\\", he appeared five times in the top 20 of the annual Classic FM Hall of Fame. Uematsu, a self-taught musician, began playing the piano at the age of twelve, with English singer-songwriter Elton John as his biggest influence. Uematsu left Square Enix in 2004 and formed his own production company, Smile Please. He later founded the music production company and record label Dog Ear Records in 2006. The reason for Uematsu's departure was that the company moved their office from Meguro to Shinjuku, Tokyo, and he was not comfortable with the new location. Also, he cites the fact that he had reached an age where he should gradually take his life into his own hands. He does, however, continue to compose music as a freelancer for Square Enix. In 2005, Uematsu and several members of The Black Mages created the score for the CGI film Final Fantasy VII Advent Children. Uematsu composed only the main theme for Final Fantasy XII (2006); he was originally offered the job of creating the full score, but Sakimoto was eventually assigned as the main composer instead. Uematsu was also initially going to create the theme song for Final Fantasy XIII (2010). However, after being assigned the task of creating the entire score of Final Fantasy XIV, Uematsu decided to hand the job over to the main Final Fantasy XIII composer, Hamauzu.  Uematsu also works closely with Sakaguchi's development studio Mistwalker, and has composed for Blue Dragon (2006), Lost Odyssey (2007), Away: Shuffle Dungeon (2008); The Last Story (2011); and Terra Battle (2014). He also wrote music for the cancelled game Cry On.  Uematsu created the main theme for the multi-composer game Super Smash Bros. Brawl in 2008. He then composed the music for the 2009 anime Guin Saga; this marked the first time he provided a full score for an animated series. Uematsu recently contributed music and storyline to an e-book titled called \\"Blik-0 1946\\". He is currently working on soundtracks for multiple games, including Project Phoenix.  Uematsu appeared five times in the top 20 of the annual Classic FM Hall of Fame. In 2012, \\"Aerith's Theme\\", written by Uematsu for Final Fantasy VII, was voted into the number 16 position in the annual Classic FM (UK) \\"Hall of Fame\\" top 300 chart. It was the first time that a piece of music written for a video game had appeared in the chart. In 2013, music from the Final Fantasy series received even greater support and was voted into the third position on the Classic FM Hall of Fame. Uematsu and his Final Fantasy music subsequently appeared at number seven in 2014, number nine in 2015, and number 17 in 2016. Did he create anything else?","output":"Yes, apart from his work with Square Enix and the Final Fantasy series, Nobuo Uematsu has created music for various other projects. He co-founded the music production company and record label Dog Ear Records in 2006. He has also worked closely with Hironobu Sakaguchi's development studio Mistwalker, composing music for video games such as Blue Dragon (2006), Lost Odyssey (2007), Away: Shuffle Dungeon (2008), The Last Story (2011), and Terra Battle (2014).

It specializes in a range of business sectors, including customer management, human resources, business process outsourcing, IT services, and consulting. Capita Plc is one of the largest companies of its kind in the United Kingdom, providing services to both public and private sector organizations. Capita was fully listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) on 23 April 1991. At that time, it was known as Capita Group Plc. The decision to go public not only marked a significant milestone for the company but also provided it with the opportunity to raise capital for expanding operations and pursuing acquisitions. Over the years, Capita has experienced substantial growth, due, in part, to being listed on the LSE. This has allowed the company to increase its visibility among investors and attract more diversified sources of funding. Upon listing on the LSE, Capita went through a series of organizational changes and acquisitions, including the rebranding as Capita Plc in 2010. These changes have allowed Capita to evolve and adapt to the fluctuating business environment continuously. Today, Capita Plc is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index, which represents the 101st to the 350th largest companies listed on the LSE in terms of market capitalization. The fact that Capita has managed to maintain and expand its presence on the London Stock Exchange for three decades is a testament to its continued success as a leading player in the outsourcing and professional services industry.

Write a title for this article: Andy Carey, an underappreciated cog in the powerful Yankees machine of the 1950s that won four consecutive American League pennants and two World Series, died on Dec. 15 at his home in Costa Mesa, Calif. He was 80. The cause was Lewy body dementia, his daughter Elizabeth Carey said. A third baseman, Carey was an above-average fielder — he once turned four double plays in a game — and a solid bottom-third-of-the-order hitter on teams that had sluggers like Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Bill Skowron, Elston Howard and Hank Bauer hitting ahead of him. He played eight seasons with the Yankees, from 1952 to 1959 (and four games in 1960, before he was traded), and was the regular third baseman for much of that time in a decade when New York City dominated the baseball world. In 1954, his best year as a hitter, he batted .302 in 122 games, with 65 runs batted in, as the Yankees won 103 games but finished second to the Cleveland Indians. The next year, Carey led the American League in triples with 11, and the Yankees began a string of four consecutive pennants. In 1956 and 1958, they won the World Series, each time exacting revenge — defeating first the Brooklyn Dodgers, who had beaten them in 1955, and then the Milwaukee Braves, who had triumphed over them in 1957. Carey played a key role in one of baseball’s landmark games. He twice helped preserve the only perfect World Series game, pitched by Don Larsen against the Dodgers on Oct. 8, 1956. In the second inning, the Dodgers’ Jackie Robinson smacked a shot between third and short that Carey knocked down, allowing Yankees shortstop Gil McDougald to pick up the ball and nip Robinson at first. In the eighth, he robbed Gil Hodges by snaring a low line drive that seemed headed for left field. Andy Carey was born Andrew Arthur Hexem in Oakland, Calif., on Oct. 18, 1931, and grew up in nearby Alameda. His parents divorced when he was very young, and his mother, Nola, married Kenneth Carey, a lawyer. He played baseball as a freshman at St. Mary’s College of California, and then played a summer of semiprofessional ball in Idaho. He was preparing to follow his stepfather into the law but left college when the Yankees offered him a 60,000 bonus, an eye-opening figure at the time. He played for Yankees farm teams in Kansas City Mo., and Syracuse, and when he was elevated to the big leagues in 1952, there was speculation that he would be converted to shortstop and eventually succeed Phil Rizzuto at that position. That did not happen, and by 1954, he was the Yankees’ regular third baseman. The emergence of Clete Boyer, who became the Yankees’ third baseman in the 1960s, eventually made Carey expendable, and he was sent to Kansas City (by then a big-league franchise). He also played for the Chicago White Sox and the Los Angeles Dodgers before retiring in 1962. His career average, over 11 seasons, was .260, with 64 home runs and 350 R.B.I. Carey was married four times and divorced three. In addition to his daughter Elizabeth, he is survived by his wife, Susie; a sister, Sandy Carey; another daughter, Jennifer James; a son, Christopher; and three granddaughters.","output":"\\"Remembering Andy Carey: The Underappreciated Force in the Yankees' Dominant 1950s Era and His Impact on Iconic Baseball Moments\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Queen had appealed for voters to exercise caution in Scottish independence referendum. Many have interpreted words as clear support for keeping Scotland in UK. First Minister Alex Salmond has insisted Queen was 'absolutely impartial'","output":"Title: \\"Her Majesty's Wisdom: Queen Astute's Carefully Calculated Words on Scottish Independence Referendum\\" Introduction The recent events surrounding the Scottish independence referendum have garnered significant attention both domestically and internationally. Central to the debate is the Queen's recent remarks that led to her being dubbed \\"Queen Astute.\\" Many have interpreted her carefully calculated words as a quiet yet clear support for maintaining the unity of the United Kingdom by keeping Scotland within it. However, First Minister Alex Salmond has maintained that Her Majesty's stance on the topic remains absolutely impartial. Careful Calculations: Queen Astute's Role in the Referendum In the lead-up to the critical vote, Queen Elizabeth II appealed to the people, urging them to exercise caution in their decision-making process. Given her reputation as a prudent and wise leader, many viewed her guidance as an indication of her own inclinations on the subject. These carefully selected words by the Queen struck a chord with many voters - most importantly, the undecided ones. Some argue that Her Majesty's underlined call for caution played a pivotal role in swaying public sentiment, ultimately shaping the outcome of the referendum. An Emphasis on Caution Considering the delicate political implications surrounding the Scottish independence referendum, the Queen's call for prudence is notable. It demonstrates a subtle understanding that a hasty decision without due consideration of the wider implications and possible fallout could lead to significant consequences within the United Kingdom. As the head of state, the Queen's ability to recognize the importance of a level-headed approach—one marked by cautious deliberation and sober reflection—positions her as not only shrewd but also wise. Her title \\"Queen Astute\\" only serves to enhance this reputation. First Minister Alex Salmond's Response Although many have interpreted the Queen's words as expressing her personal support for keeping Scotland in the United Kingdom, First Minister Alex Salmond insists that she remains absolutely impartial on the matter. Such a stance is essential for a constitutional monarch, whose role is to remain politically neutral. In defending the Queen's position, Mr. Salmond underscores the need to separate personal feelings from official duties. Ultimately, what should be remembered about the Queen's involvement in this matter is that her main role was to encourage a thoughtful and educated electorate, who would make decisions that best serve their nation. Conclusion As \\"Queen Astute,\\" Her Majesty has demonstrated her ability to navigate the complex political landscape while maintaining a neutral position. Although many may argue that her carefully calculated words on the Scottish independence referendum were indicative of her own preferences, the central message of caution and contemplation is universally applicable. The Queen's call for thoughtful deliberation, regardless of an individual's stance on the matter, serves as a valuable reminder for citizens in any democracy - emphasizing the importance of making informed decisions that best serve the nation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: If maximum concentrations are reached , there may be a delay of one or two days before toxic toxicity occurs . Sentence 2: When toxic concentrations are reached , there may be a delay of one or two days before maximum toxicity occurs . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","output":"While these two sentences may seem similar at first glance, they actually convey slightly different information. The key difference lies in the order of events regarding the concentrations and the onset of toxicity. Let's analyze each sentence separately: Sentence 1: If maximum concentrations are reached, there may be a delay of one or two days before toxic toxicity occurs. This sentence describes a situation where, once maximum concentrations of a substance are achieved, it takes one or two days for the toxic effects to manifest. In other words, it suggests that reaching the highest levels of a substance doesn't immediately result in toxicity. Instead, there is a window of one or two days before toxic toxicity happens. Sentence 2: When toxic concentrations are reached, there may be a delay of one or two days before maximum toxicity occurs. This sentence, on the other hand, explains that when concentrations of a substance become toxic, it might take an additional one or two days for the maximum level of toxicity to occur. In this case, the sentence implies that toxic levels of the substance are already present, but the most severe toxic effects aren't immediate; they will develop after one or two days. In summary, the main difference between these two sentences is the point at which toxicity is considered. Sentence 1 suggests that toxicity happens after maximum concentrations are reached and after a delay of one or two days. Sentence 2 assumes that toxicity is already present when toxic concentrations are reached, but maximum toxicity is delayed by one or two days. Thus, while they both discuss delayed toxicity, they convey slightly different information regarding the onset of toxic effects and the relationship to substance concentration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is some data: The Waterman food Chinese; The Waterman priceRange moderate; The Waterman customer rating 3 out of 5; The Waterman area city centre; The Waterman familyFriendly no. Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"The given data presents various aspects of a Chinese restaurant called \\"The Waterman.\\" This comprehensive description will cover the cuisine, pricing, customer rating, location, and family-friendly status of the establishment. Cuisine: The Waterman specializes in Chinese cuisine, offering a wide variety of dishes that represent the vast culinary traditions of China. Patrons can expect to savor dishes made with flavors and techniques characteristic of regions like Sichuan, Canton, and Beijing, among others. The menu is likely to include popular delicacies such as Kung Pao Chicken, Peking Duck, and Dim Sum, catering to the diverse taste preferences of its customers. Pricing: The Waterman boasts a moderate price range, ensuring affordability while maintaining a balance between the quality and the cost of the dishes. This indicates that while the restaurant may not be a fine-dining establishment, it aims to provide good value with an enjoyable dining experience that won't break the bank. Customers can expect fair pricing for the quality and portions of the dishes they choose. Customer Rating: The Waterman has a customer rating of 3 out of 5. This indicates that the overall experience for the diners has been average. While some patrons might have enjoyed their meals and the restaurant's ambiance, others may have encountered some areas that require improvement, such as service, food quality, ambiance, or value for money. Potential customers should tread carefully, setting their expectations accordingly and checking more reviews before visiting the restaurant. Location: The Waterman is situated in the city center, making it easily accessible to a wider audience. Its central location implies that the restaurant is surrounded by a busy urban landscape, with a bustling atmosphere and a diverse demographic of potential customers. This prime location also indicates that the establishment is conveniently located near various attractions, shopping complexes, and entertainment centers, making it an ideal option for a meal after a day spent exploring the city or for a quick bite in the middle of a busy workday. Family-Friendly Status: It is important to note that The Waterman does not cater specifically to families with children, as it is mentioned to be not family-friendly. The ambiance is probably more suited for groups of adults, couples, or coworkers. Potential customers planning to visit with young kids should consider other dining options that cater explicitly to the needs of a family, such as offering a children's menu or a designated play area. However, this family-unfriendly label doesn't mean it's off-limits for families, but it highlights that it might not be specifically tailored to cater to families' needs and preferences. In conclusion, The Waterman is a moderately priced Chinese restaurant situated in the city center, with an average customer rating of 3 out of 5, offering a variety of Chinese delicacies. It may not be the best option for families with young children, but it could be worth considering for those interested in Chinese cuisine and are looking for a dining experience in the heart of the city."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the magnet in the phone is more faulty happens, how will it affect the forest is infected with dead trees.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The process you described outlines the development and continuation of a forest ecosystem through the interplay between tree growth, tree death, and the influx of nutrients from dead material. The emergence of a thriving ecosystem is a result of these interconnected processes and the subsequent shelter and habitat provided to other organisms. Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis – the possibility of a faulty magnet in a phone impacting a forest that is dealing with a high amount of dead trees. In order to assess whether this perturbation has an effect on the process, direct or indirect, it is crucial to explore the pathways by which the faulty magnet could interact with or influence the forest ecosystem's processes. The inner workings of a mobile phone and its various components are not directly related to the systems that support and maintain the forest ecosystem. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the faulty magnet would have a direct effect on the process. A direct effect would require the magnet to influence the tree growth, tree death, or nutrient cycling directly, and there is no known connection between the magnetic field generated by a faulty magnet and the life processes of trees or the organisms that thrive in a forest. Considering indirect effects, one possible scenario would be that the faulty magnet affects the phone's operation or performance, leading to misinformation or miscommunication between people who are responsible for managing or monitoring the forest ecosystem. For example, if a forest ranger's phone is not functioning correctly, they may not receive important data or updates regarding the situation in the forest. This could result in delayed or misinformed actions that may inadvertently bring harm to the ecosystem. However, even in this case, the impact on the forest is not directly attributable to the faulty magnet but rather depends on the actions or inactions of the people who rely on the phone for information. This situation could be mitigated by increased awareness, improved communication networks, and ensuring that critical information is properly relayed through other means. In conclusion, it is highly unlikely that a faulty magnet in a phone would have a direct effect on a forest ecosystem dealing with dead trees. While there is potential for indirect effects through human activities and decision-making processes, these issues are better addressed through increased awareness and adaptive management strategies that do not rely solely on technology. The forest ecosystem processes continue to be largely shaped by the interactions between tree growth, tree death, and the recycling of nutrients through decomposition, resulting in a dynamic and resilient environment for the countless organisms that call it home."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They enable multiple devices to connect to a single internet connection and establish a seamless flow of data. However, configuring a Wi-Fi router might seem daunting to most users, especially those not well versed in the technology.  This article will guide you through the process of accessing your router's admin interface using a web browser, which will allow you to configure settings and monitor connected devices. To help you get started, let's first understand the basic structure of a router and its interface. Understanding Your Router ------------------------- Every digital device connected to the internet requires an IP address to identify itself. Typically, routers control and distribute IP addresses to devices on your home network. Your router's admin interface serves as a centralized control panel that allows you to tweak settings, manage user access, and control internet usage.  Accessing the router's admin interface is an essential process as it helps you monitor your network and change settings as required. Here's a step-by-step guide to access your router's admin interface. Step 1: Open a Web Browser -------------------------- To access your router's admin interface, you need to open a web browser on your computer. Most web browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, are suitable for this process. Step 2: Access the Router's IP Address -------------------------------------- After opening your web browser, place your cursor in the address bar and enter your router's IP address. The router IP address usually looks like \\"192.168.0.1\\" or \\"192.168.1.1\\"; however, it could also vary by manufacturers. You can find your router's IP address in the user manual or printed on a sticker on your router. Alternatively, you can identify your router's IP address using your computer's command prompt. On Windows, open the command prompt and type \\"ipconfig.\\" Look for the 'Default Gateway' line to find your router's IP address. On macOS, open Terminal and type \\"netstat -nr | grep default,\\" and your router's IP address will be displayed. Step 3: Enter the Admin Credentials ------------------------------------ Once you have entered the router's IP address, a login window will appear. The window will prompt you to enter the admin username and password.  For most routers, the default username is \\"admin,\\" and the password field is left blank. However, some routers might have a different username and password or require a unique combination. If you have changed the default credentials in the past or have a router with unique login details, enter the appropriate username and password. If you cannot remember this information, you can reset your router to restore its default settings.  Conclusion ---------- Accessing your router's admin interface is crucial for managing your home network. With the help of this guide, you can quickly gain access to your router's settings and make necessary changes to enhance network performance and security. Remember to secure your router using a strong password and regularly update its firmware to ensure optimal performance and protection against potential threats."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is an article: Mr Cable suggested that the Government could take tougher steps – including an increase in the banking levy imposed on the larger banks in the budget, which is due to raise £8bn over the next five years. Asked at a fringe meeting at the Liberal Democrat conference what he could do to boost lending rates, Mr Cable said: “We spelt out that there were what we called sticks and carrots. One of the sticks is in relation to tax measures. It remains an option, particularly if the banks decide to spray out lots of money on bonuses and dividends at a time when small businesses are being starved, then the case for taking action is a compelling one.” The warning comes as it emerged that lending to Britain's businesses fell for a fifth consecutive month in July, with small companies at the heart of the struggle to access credit. A report by the Bank of England showed a £2.5bn fall in net lending to businesses, compared with a £3.2bn fall in June. It brought the annual rate of decline in business lending down to 5.7pc in July from 7.9pc in June. \\"Contacts of the Bank's network of agents noted that while credit conditions were easing for larger businesses, they remained tight for smaller firms,\\" the Bank said in its monthly Trends in Lending report. The Bank said that most major UK lenders reported subdued demand for credit. However, Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said that even so, tight credit conditions were posing a significant obstacle for businesses. \\"The Report reveals ongoing very tight credit conditions, thereby maintaining concerns that this poses a serious handicap to economic activity,\\" he said. Mr Archer said that a lack of credit for smaller businesses, faltering money supply growth, and signs of a slowing recovery would increase pressure on the Bank to loosen monetary policy further by extending its £200bn quantitative easing programme. The Bank also said that mortgage approvals for house purchases by the UK's major lenders fell to a 16-month low of 45,000 in August from 47,000 in July, a bigger-than-expected fall. The Council of Mortgage Lenders also pointed to a slowing housing market after gross mortgage lending fell to £11.4bn in August, from £13.3bn in July – the lowest level for the month of August in a decade. Separate figures from the Bank showed the broad money supply fell by 0.2pc month-on-month in August, reducing the annual growth rate to 1.8pc – the lowest level since the series began in 1983.

Help as much as you can. Here's an amazing way to get a hard-boiled egg into a bottle, even though the mouth of the boiled is smaller than the egg! What's more, you don't even need to touch the egg to get it to go in! For this experiment you will need: *a hard-boiled egg *a glass bottle with a mouth just slightly smaller than the egg (a fruit-drink bottle works well) *a 8-cm by 8-cm(3-inch by 3-inch)piece of newspaper *a match Remove the shell from the egg. Set the egg on the mouth of the bottle to see that the egg does not fit through the mouth. Light the paper. Remove the egg from the mouth of the bottle and drop the burning paper into the bottle. Before the fire goes out, set the egg back onto the mouth of the bottle. Within a few seconds the egg will squeeze  through the mouth and into the bottle. As it entered the bottle, the egg may have broken into pieces. This happens when the diameter  of the egg is more than about 0.5 cm(about 3/16 inch) larger than the diameter of the bottle's opening. Why does the egg slide into the bottle, even though no one is pushing it? Because the pressure of the air is pushing it. Before the burning paper is put into the bottle, the pressure of the air inside is the same as outside. The burning paper, however, heats the air inside. This causes the air inside to expand. When the egg is placed on top of the bottle, it seals  the bottle. When the fire goes out, the air inside cools. As it cools, the air contracts , and the pressure of the air inside becomes less than the pressure outside. Then, the higher outside pressure pushes the egg into the bottle! Why will the egg break into pieces while entering the bottle? A) Because of the burning paper. B) Because the diameter of the egg is too larger than that of the bottles opening. C) Because it is cool inside the bottle. D) Because the pressure of the air inside is larger. Answer:","output":"B) Because the diameter of the egg is too larger than that of the bottle's opening."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What kind of performer is an ecdysiast?","output":"An ecdysiast is a performer who specializes in the art of striptease, a form of entertainment that usually involves a gradual and sensual removal of clothing by the performer to reveal their body to the audience. This type of performance has been a part of the entertainment industry for several centuries, with varying degrees of public acceptance and has evolved over time to encompass various styles and artistic expressions. The term \\"ecdysiast\\" was popularized by the American novelist, journalist, and critic H. L. Mencken in the 1940s and stems from the Greek word \\"ekdysis,\\" which refers to the process of shedding or molting in certain animals, such as the shedding of a snake's skin. Striptease performances have long been a staple of the adult entertainment world and cabaret scene, although the modern incarnation of striptease can trace its roots to the early 20th century in Western societies, particularly in the United States and Europe. Performances by ecdysiasts often take place in various venues such as burlesque shows, nightclubs, bars, private parties, and specialized strip clubs. They may be a part of a larger entertainment lineup or the main focus of the event. An ecdysiast's performance typically involves a combination of dancing and striptease elements. Performers often choreograph their routines to specific music pieces and use a variety of props, such as poles, chairs, or feather boas, to enhance the visual and sensual appeal. Costumes and clothing play a crucial role in the performance, as the gradual unveiling of the body is a key component of the show. For this reason, ecdysiasts often wear elaborate, themed costumes and outfits that are designed to captivate the audience and accentuate their physical attributes. Makeup and hairstyling are also an essential aspect of the ecdysiast's appearance, often with a focus on glamour and sophistication. The art of striptease is, at its core, a form of self-expression and empowerment for the ecdysiast. Much of the performance relies on the performer's ability to communicate through body language and movement, using their skills in dance, acting, and seduction to captivate and engage the viewer. As a result, ecdysiasts often develop strong stage presence, self-confidence, and an awareness of their physicality. While striptease performances have historically been seen as a form of entertainment primarily catered to male audiences, there has been a shift in recent years towards a more inclusive, empowering approach. This is evident in the growing popularity of neo-burlesque shows that embrace various body types, gender identities, and performance styles, often with elements of humor, satire, and social commentary. Burlesque performers like Dita Von Teese and shows like The Slipper Room in New York City have helped to redefine the boundaries and perceptions of the ecdysiast tradition, pushing the art form into a more mainstream and respected sphere. In conclusion, an ecdysiast is a performer who engages in the art of striptease. These performers use a mix of dance, seduction, and creative costuming to offer a unique and titillating form of entertainment. The evolution of striptease and the re-emergence of the burlesque scene in the 21st century have opened up new opportunities for ecdysiasts to showcase their talents to a wider and more diverse audience, breaking away from traditional stereotypes and providing a platform for self-expression and empowerment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
