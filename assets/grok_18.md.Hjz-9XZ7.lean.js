I selected to purchase 100 blades for 18.95. The title above said 50ct. If I had received 50 I would have been ok with it (cost a bit higher than local, but saved me a trip to the store); however, I received 10 blades for 14.54.

Ablene Cooper says the book's character \\"Aibeleen\\"—who, like her, is a middle-aged black nanny with a gold tooth whose son died before she started working for her employers—is based on her and she finds the portrayal humiliating, ABC News reports.

The novel, set in Jackson, Mississippi, during the early '60s, has been made into a movie that will be released this summer. (Click for more on the 'dirty secrets' of The Help.)","output":"Title: Author Kathryn Stockett Faces Lawsuit Over Alleged Real-Life Inspiration for 'The Help' Character Kathryn Stockett, the author of the best-selling novel The Help, has been accused of borrowing too heavily from real life, specifically from the life of a nanny named Ablene Cooper. Cooper claims that the character Aibeleen, a middle-aged black nanny with a gold tooth and a deceased son, is based on her life, and she finds the portrayal humiliating. The case gains more interest as Ablene Cooper is currently employed by Stockett's brother, who supports Cooper's claims. To understand the similarities between Cooper and Aibeleen, one must break down their shared characteristics. Both are middle-aged black nannies with gold teeth and have experienced the tragic loss of their sons before they began working for their respective employers. Cooper claims that these similarities are not a coincidence and that Stockett has used her identity in crafting the character Aibeleen. \\"Ain’t too many Ablenes,\\" said Cooper. In the lawsuit, Cooper is seeking 75,000 in damages from Stockett, for the alleged unauthorized use of her name and likeness. It is worth noting that the lawsuit does not request punitive damages or attorneys’ fees. Cooper’s lawyer stated that the author ignored Cooper's request to refrain from using her name or likeness, despite knowing that doing so would be \\"emotionally upsetting and highly offensive to Ablene.\\" The Help, which is set during the early 1960s in Jackson, Mississippi, has been adapted into a movie slated for release this summer. As the lawsuit unfolds, the question remains: is the character of Aibeleen too close to the real-life Ablene Cooper, and if so, did Stockett cross a line in her quest for an authentic portrayal of this period in American history?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"Phagocytosis, pinocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis are three types of endocytosis, a subcategory of cellular transportation.  Endocytosis is a cellular process by which substances are brought into a cell. These substances can include nutrients the cell needs to survive or foreign bodies, such as viruses or bacteria, that are harmful and need to be neutralized. The substances are engulfed by the cell membrane, creating a vesicle and are transported into the cell.  1. Phagocytosis: It involves the ingestion of solid particles, such as bacteria, dead cells, or bits of matter. The term \\"phagocytosis\\" comes from the Greek words \\"phagein,\\" which means to eat and \\"kytos,\\" meaning cell. When phagocytosis occurs, the cell changes shape by extending pseudopodia (cellular 'arms') to surround the material and then packages it into a food vacuole. The vacuole fuses with a lysosome, an organelle containing digestive enzymes, which destroys the material. 2. Pinocytosis: This is also commonly referred to as \\"cell drinking.\\" In pinocytosis, the cell ingests extracellular fluid and its dissolved solutes. The cell membrane invaginates, forming a small pocket filled with extracellular fluid. The pocket pinches off, resulting in the formation of an intracellular vesicle. 3. Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis: This is a more specialised process and allows cells to take in bulk quantities of specific substances, even when these substances may not be very concentrated in the extracellular fluid. The substances first bind to specific receptors on the cell surface before being engulfed. This process is highly specific as it uses receptors to attract and bind to specific substances. Each mode offers a specific way to take in extracellular substances, depending on the given circumstances. They are crucial for the survival of a cell as it enables the cell to interact with its environment in a controlled manner. Importantly, these are not mutually exclusive categories but rather reflect different techniques cells have to manage their internal environments. Endocytosis is a complex process that involves carefully controlled reshaping of the cell membrane."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Here's a new warning from health experts: sitting is deadly. Scientists are increasingly warning that sitting for long periods, even if you exercise regularly, could be bad for your health. And it doesn't matter where the sitting takes place--in the office, at school, in the car or before a computer or TV. Just the overall number of hours it takes matters. Several studies suggest people who spend most of their days sitting are more likely to be fat, have a heart attack or even die. While health officials have issued  guidelines advising on the least amounts of physical activities, they haven't suggested people try to limit how much time they spend in a seated position. \\"After four hours of sitting, the body starts to send harmful signals,\\" said Ekblom-Bak of the Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences. She explained that genes controlling the amount of glucose  and fat in the body start to shut down. Even for people who exercise, spending long periods of time sitting at a desk is still harmful. Tim Armstrong, a physical activity expert at the World Health Organization, said people who exercise every day but still spend a lot of time sitting might get more benefits if that exercise were spread across the day, rather than in a single hour. Still in a study that tracked more than 17,000 Canadians for about a dozen years, researchers found people who sat more had a higher death risk, whether they exercised or not. Experts said more research is needed to figure out just how much sitting is dangerous, and what might be possible to _ those effects. People should keep exercising because that has a lot of benefits,\\" Ekblom-Bak said. \\"And when they're in the office, they should try to interrupt sitting as often as possible.\\" Which of the following might be the best title for the passage?

What are the most important words in the following sentence: Giraffes leaning low to eat from the ground","output":"In the sentence \\"Giraffes leaning low to eat from the ground,\\" the most important words associated with conveying meaning and understanding are \\"giraffes,\\" \\"leaning,\\" \\"low,\\" \\"eat,\\" and \\"ground.\\" 1. \\"Giraffes\\" – This word is crucial because it identifies the subject of the sentence. It tells us which animal we are discussing, and as the sentence's primary focus, knowing that it is about giraffes establishes the context for understanding the rest of the sentence. 2. \\"Leaning\\" – This verb defines the action or movement the giraffes are performing. Without this word, we would not know what they are doing. \\"Leaning\\" implies that the giraffes are bending or tilting their bodies or heads in a certain direction, which helps paint a mental image of the scene. 3. \\"Low\\" – This adjective describes the extent or manner of the leaning action. Without \\"low,\\" we would not have a clear idea of how these giraffes are leaning. We might wonder if they were leaning just a little or much more. By specifying that they are leaning low, this word adds depth to the mental imagery of the scene, helping us picture the giraffes in this specific posture. 4. \\"Eat\\" – This word reveals the purpose or reason for the giraffes' leaning action. It is essential for understanding the context and intention behind their movement. By knowing they are eating, we get a complete picture of the scene—giraffes bending low to consume something. Without \\"eat,\\" the sentence would not have a clear purpose. 5. \\"Ground\\" – This word denotes the location or source from which the giraffes are eating. It is essential for understanding the scene because it clarifies what the giraffes are eating from and why they need to lean low. Without the mention of \\"ground,\\" we could be left wondering if the giraffes were eating from a tree or another source. Knowing they are eating from the ground helps create a precise mental image and understanding of the action taking place. In conclusion, the words \\"giraffes,\\" \\"leaning,\\" \\"low,\\" \\"eat,\\" and \\"ground\\" are the most important words in the sentence \\"Giraffes leaning low to eat from the ground.\\" Each of these words plays a significant role in developing the primary context, action, purpose, extent, and location of the sentence, providing a clear and detailed understanding of the situation being described."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Clinton Foundation include amounts of 10 million to 25 million from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and real estate mogul Stephen Bing, a personal friend of Clinton's. The Clintons came under intense pressure during Hillary Clinton's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination to release the names of donors to both the foundation and to the Clinton presidential library in Arkansas. Bill Clinton agreed to the release the list after President-elect Barack Obama nominated Hillary Clinton to become secretary of state. The governments of Kuwait and Qatar are also on the list, as is Saudi businessman Nasser Al-Rashid, who has close ties to the Saudi royal family. Saudi Sheikh Mohammed H. Al-Amoudi, reputed to be one of the richest men in the world, is among the donors as well. Both Saudis contributed in the 1 million to 5 million range. A group called Friends of Saudi Arabia and the Dubai Foundation appear in the same category. Indian businessman Lakshmi Mittal also donated between 1 million and 5 million, as did the Elton John AIDS Foundation, the Princess Diana Memorial Fund and the Open Society Institute, which George Soros founded. Israeli-born television mogul Haim Saban, owner of the Spanish-language TV station Univision, donated between 5 million and 10 million personally or through his foundation. The two biggest donors are UNITAID, a new international organization that purchases drugs for the world's poorest people, and the Children's Investment Fund Foundation, both of which donated more than 25 million.

However, YouTube itself has not confirmed the deal.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"In May 2014, the Worldwide Independent Network (WIN), an independent music trade organization, accused YouTube of offering non-negotiable contracts to independent labels that were undervalued compared to other streaming services. The allegation arose prior to the launch of YouTube's subscription-based Music Key service. WIN further claimed that YouTube would block all music content from labels that did not agree to be included in the paid service.  In response to these accusations, Robert Kyncl, YouTube's Chief Business Officer, confirmed in a June 2014 statement to the Financial Times that YouTube would indeed block the content of labels who did not negotiate deals to be included in the paid service. Kyncl justified this decision by stating that it was necessary to ensure all content on the platform adhered to YouTube's new contractual terms. He also revealed that 90% of labels had already secured deals with YouTube, and while a 100% success rate would be ideal, it was not an achievable goal. Kyncl emphasized that launching the enhanced music experience was their responsibility to users and the industry. Later, the Financial Times published a report stating that YouTube had reached an aggregate deal with Merlin Network, a trade group representing over 20,000 independent labels, facilitating their inclusion in the Music Key service. However, YouTube has not officially confirmed this deal. In summary, the information published for the public to read about regarding YouTube's deal includes allegations made by the Worldwide Independent Network about undervalued and non-negotiable contracts offered to independent labels, Robert Kyncl's statement confirming the blocking of content from non-compliant labels, and an unconfirmed report about a deal with Merlin Network for the inclusion of over 20,000 independent labels in YouTube's subscription-based Music Key service."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A kaleidoscope of vibrant colors and fresh smells greets the patrons as they make their way through the entrance. This lively scene is a far cry from the quiet, empty space that characterizes the market on weekends. As shoppers meander through the narrow pathways lined with stalls, they are drawn to the variety of products on offer. Artisans peddle their handcrafted wares, eager to showcase the care and skill that has been poured into creating them. Jewelry, clothing, pottery, and home décor are just a few of the items featured, satisfying the diverse tastes and interests of the visitors that peruse the market. The fresh produce section is a crowd favorite. Farmers from the surrounding areas bring their freshest fruits, vegetables, and flowers to sell, attracting health-conscious shoppers aiming to incorporate locally grown ingredients into their meals. Seasonal items are a major highlight and are in high demand; it's not uncommon for lines to form with eager guests waiting to fill their shopping baskets. Street food vendors set up shop throughout the market, serving up hot dishes and sweet treats from their rustic carts. A diverse array of cuisine is available, with mouthwatering aromas drifting through the air and beckoning hungry patrons to indulge in the local delicacies. The tantalizing smells of freshly baked goods, sizzling meats, and aromatic spices intermingle and tempt even those with the strongest of willpower. The ambiance of the market is amplified by the street performers adding an element of culture and entertainment. As visitors traverse the market, the sounds of musicians strumming guitars, singing, or playing other instruments fill the air. Additionally, artists create live paintings, magicians dazzle the crowds with their tricks, and dancers move to the rhythm of their surroundings. These performances captivate visitors, elevating the overall atmosphere of the market and making it more than just a shopping destination. Shoppers are not only drawn to the market to support local businesses but also to engage in a time-honored tradition. The culture and history of the market are deeply ingrained in the local community, and spending Wednesdays shopping amongst friends and family has become a valued custom. Many people look forward to the market each week for both the opportunity to engage in lively conversations with fellow patrons and acquaint themselves with the faces behind the products they purchase. As the day winds down and the sun begins to set, the energy of the market slowly dissipates. Vendors start packing up their stalls, and the sounds of laughter and friendly chatter begin to fade. The once crowded pathways become desolate as the last shoppers make their purchases and leave this enlivened place with their newfound treasures. Once again, the market will transform into a quiet, vacant area on the weekend, but the memories created and the sense of community fostered persist long after the guests have gone home. And as another Wednesday approaches, locals and tourists alike will anticipate the return of the market's vibrancy, eager to bask in its diverse offerings and invigorating atmosphere once more."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: Onionhead Movie plot: In the spring of 1941, Al Woods quits an Oklahoma college to join the armed forces after a quarrel with his co-ed sweetheart, Jo. He joins the Coast Guard, partly by chance due to the flip of a coin. After boot training, Al is assigned to a buoy tender in Boston, the Periwinkle, as a ship's cook although he has no cooking experience. He encounters immediate hostility from the chief of the galley, Red Wildoe, from new crew mates and cooks' helpers Gutsell and Poznicki, and from his arrogant department head, Lieutenant (junior grade) Higgins. In a Boston bar, Al picks up Stella, who appears to do this kind of thing with some regularity. They develop a strong attraction, but she seems to be holding out for something more.[3] He befriends Gutsell by fixing him up with a girlfriend of Stella's and learns from Wildoe how to be a ship's cook, making a number of embarrassing mistakes. Al, frustrated after Stella won't spend a night in a hotel room with him, stops seeing her, whereupon he and the alcoholic Wildoe get drunk together and bond. Wildoe begins seeing Stella with Al's blessing. Pearl Harbor is attacked and war declared. Wildoe abruptly proposes to Stella and they marry. A free-for-all breaks out at their wedding celebration, with a jealous Al instigating a fight with soldiers who are clearly familiar with Stella already. Wildoe is assigned to another vessel performing convoy duty at sea. During this time, Stella begins seeing other men. Al tries to prevent this on Wildoe's behalf, but can't resist Stella himself. Aboard the Periwinkle, Al becomes the new chief cook. Higgins, promoted to executive officer, is discovered entering lesser amounts than they pay for the cost of officers' meals into the ledger of the ship's mess and pocketing the difference. He purchases substandard food for the crew in order to keep the mess budget from showing a deficit. Higgins also objects to finding Al's hair in his food, so Al shaves his scalp bald, earning the nickname \\"Onionhead.\\" Assuming erroneously that all the officers...","output":"Based on the provided information about the movie plot and characters, Al Woods' new job title is \\"Chief Cook\\" on the buoy tender named Periwinkle. Throughout the story, we see several interactions and events that lead to Al's growth and development in this role. Initially, not having any cooking experience, he faces opposition from the crew and other cooks on board. But as the story unfolds, Al learns the skills needed for this position and even earns the nickname \\"Onionhead\\" from the officers after shaving his scalp bald. The movie title \\"Onionhead\\" comes directly from Al's nickname in the story, possibly referencing both his bald appearance and his newly acquired cooking skills. The plot revolves around Al Woods' life, his experiences on the ship, and his relationships with both his service colleagues and the women he encounters. Throughout the movie, Al's personal and professional life goes through a series of ups and downs, which eventually lead to his new job title. We see that through his close relationships with other characters, such as Wildoe and Stella, Al gains life experiences and learns valuable lessons. He experiences heartbreak, friendship, professional growth, and even becomes involved in exposing a malpractice by Lieutenant Higgins, thus playing a crucial role in keeping the integrity of the ship's crew. In deciding whether to invest in this film proposal, not only evaluate the plot and content, but also consider the movie's potential target audience, genre, and possible actors for the roles. Primarily, the film appears to cater to an audience interested in drama, period pieces (from the 1940s), and romance, exploring themes such as personal growth, friendship, overcoming adversity, and the reality of life during wartime. Additionally, the movie appears to present a mix of light-hearted and serious moments, which could appeal to audiences looking for a balanced cinematic experience. Another crucial aspect of investing in a film proposal is analyzing the team behind the project - the director, screenwriter, and producers - as well as any attached actors or funding in place. Make sure to research box-office performance and critical reception of similar movies to gauge potential success. Finally, consider your personal affinity for the story and its themes, as this investment could potentially be a matter of personal satisfaction in addition to financial returns. In summary, Al Woods' new job title is \\"Chief Cook\\" in the movie \\"Onionhead.\\" His story, set amid the backdrop of war and interspersed with elements of romance, friendship, and personal growth, seems to cater to audiences interested in drama and period pieces. When evaluating the film proposal, assess target audience, themes, attached talent, potential competitors, among other factors, to make an informed investment decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - mexico - ocean - japan - texas - new york The answer to this question is:","output":"Japan. The steakhouse, unfamiliar to Western palettes, most likely follows the cooking style originating from Japan. This Asian country has a unique steak preparation technique that is different from the traditional steakhouses commonly found in Western countries. Japanese-style steakhouses, most notably teppanyaki-style restaurants, are well-known for their distinctive method of preparing steaks. The concept of teppanyaki was introduced after World War II as Western-style dishes became more popular in Japan. The term “teppanyaki” refers to the method of cooking using an iron griddle, called a 'teppan.' Foods such as steak, shrimp, chicken and various vegetables are cooked on the griddle, and the experience often includes the theatrical flair of the chef's knife and spatula skills, becoming part of the dining entertainment. The preparation of steak in these types of Japanese restaurants is distinct. Typically, the steaks are seasoned with salt and pepper, seared on the hot griddle, then sliced into bite-sized pieces and served with a variety of sauces. Often, the highlight of this cooking style is Kobe beef or Wagyu steak, which is globally renowned for its extreme tenderness and fatty, well-marbled texture.  In addition, the Japanese also place a substantial emphasis on the quality of ingredients used, the presentation of the dish, and the overall eating experience. Incorporating elements of the traditional Japanese 'omotenashi' hospitality, these steakhouses often offer an intimate, high-quality dining experience. So, while Mexican, Texan, and New York styles have had their influences on steakhouse culture, if the steakhouse is of an uncommon, distinctive style to Western palettes, it is likely to be of Japanese origin."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: How many inches tall is Monument 10?

Passage:With the ascendance of Simeon I to the throne in 893, the long-lasting peace with the Byzantine Empire established by his father was about to end. A conflict arose when Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise, acting under pressure from his wife Zoe Zaoutzaina and her father, Stylianos Zaoutzes, moved the marketplace for Bulgarian goods from Constantinople to Thessaloniki, where Bulgarian merchants were heavily taxed. Forced to take action, in the autumn of 894 Simeon invaded the Byzantine Empire from the north, meeting little opposition due to the concentration of most Byzantine forces in eastern Anatolia to counter Arab invasions. Informed of the Bulgarian offensive, the surprised Leo sent an army consisting of guardsmen and other military units from the capital to halt Simeon, but his troops were routed somewhere in the theme of Macedonia.The Magyars managed to defeat Simeon's army twice, but in 896 they were routed in the Battle of Southern Buh. The war ended in 896 with a great Bulgarian victory near Bulgarophygon in Eastern Thrace. The market was returned to Constantinople, and the Byzantine Emperor had to pay annual tribute to Bulgaria.

The answer to the question: What was the last name of the person who was a founder of the Group of Seven? is inside the article: In October, MacDonald introduced Thomson to Dr. James MacCallum. A frequent visitor to the Ontario Society of Artists' (OSA) exhibitions, MacCallum was admitted to the Arts and Letters Club in January 1912. There, he met artists such as John William Beatty, Arthur Heming, MacDonald and Harris. MacCallum eventually persuaded Thomson to leave Rous and Mann and start a painting career. In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to A. Y. Jackson, later a founder of the Group of Seven. MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to \\"take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising. He was sensitive and independent, and feared he might become an object of patronage.\\" MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their \\"truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland ... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places.\\" He described Thomson's paintings as \\"dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects\\". After Thomson's death, MacCallum helped preserve and advocate for his work.Thomson accepted MacCallum's offer under the same terms offered to Jackson.

Question: A miniature gumball machine contains 4 blue, 4 green, and 2 red gumballs, which are identical except for their colors. If the machine dispenses three gumballs at random, what is the probability that it dispenses one gumball of each color?  Option A: 2/15  Option B: 4/15  Option C: 5/30  Option D: 7/30  Option E: 11/60","output":"To solve this problem, we will use the concepts of probability and combinatorics. We need to find the probability of the event that the machine dispenses one gumball of each color (blue, green, and red). Step 1: Total Gumballs There are a total of 4 blue + 4 green + 2 red = 10 gumballs in the machine. Step 2: Combinations Let's now compute the number of ways we can pick the 3 gumballs, which is a combination since the order doesn't matter. The total number of ways to pick 3 gumballs from 10 is given by the combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!) = C(10, 3). Step 3: Calculate C(10, 3) Using the formula above, we find that C(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * (10-3)!) = 10! / (3! * 7!) = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 120. Step 4: Desired Combinations We want to find the probability of getting one gumball of each color (blue, green, and red). To find this, we compute the number of ways to pick one blue, one green, and one red gumball: C(4, 1) * C(4, 1) * C(2, 1) = (4 * 4 * 2) = 32 possible combinations to get one gumball of each color. Step 5: Probability Now, we can find the probability of the event \\"dispenses one gumball of each color\\" by dividing the desired combinations (32) by the total number of ways to pick 3 gumballs from 10 (120). Probability = Desired Combinations / Total Combinations = 32 / 120 = 8 / 30 = 4 / 15. Therefore, the probability of the machine dispensing one gumball of each color is 4/15, which is Option B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sadly, the weather has been pretty gray and rainy so far – in fact the forecast has it cloudy and rainy every day until after we leave.

Our group all agreed that we should take advantage of the nice weather and head to the old city walls and St. Lawrence Fort (Lovrijenac). We spent several hours walking the walls and climbing up and down stairs. The sun sparkled off the Adriatic Sea and cast a warm glow on the orange and red tiled roofs in old city. It was such a change from the gray and foggy gloom of the last couple of days and it created a completely different mood, at least for me. From foreboding and dark to welcoming and bright. The clouds eventually rolled back in again, but the sunshine was nice while it lasted. We walked over to the fort and I took these shots of the city wall and from across the small cove between them.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the union that included many states such as Nabha, Faridkot, and Malerkotla? , can you please find it?   The bulk of the larger states, and some groups of small states, were integrated through a different, four-step process. The first step in this process was to convince groups of large states to combine to form a \\"princely union\\" through the execution by their rulers of Covenants of Merger. Under the Covenants of Merger, all rulers lost their ruling powers, save one who became the Rajpramukh of the new union. The other rulers were associated with two bodies—the council of rulers, whose members were the rulers of salute states, and a presidium, one or more of whose members were elected by the rulers of non-salute states, with the rest elected by the council. The Rajpramukh and his deputy Uprajpramukh were chosen by the council from among the members of the presidium. The Covenants made provision for the creation of a constituent assembly for the new union which would be charged with framing its constitution. In return for agreeing to the extinction of their states as discrete entities, the rulers were given a privy purse and guarantees similar to those provided under the Merger Agreements.Through this process, Patel obtained the unification of 222 states in the Kathiawar peninsula of his native Gujarat into the princely union of Saurashtra in January 1948, with six more states joining the union the following year. Madhya Bharat emerged on 28 May 1948 from a union of Gwalior, Indore and eighteen smaller states. In Punjab, the Patiala and East Punjab States Union was formed on 15 July 1948 from Patiala, Kapurthala, Jind, Nabha, Faridkot, Malerkotla, Nalargarh, and Kalsia. The United State of Rajasthan was formed as the result of a series of mergers, the last of which was completed on 15 May 1949. Travancore and Cochin were merged in the middle of 1949 to form the princely union of Travancore-Cochin.

In the months following Pink Moon's release, Drake became increasingly asocial and distant.

At one point he could not afford a new pair of shoes. He would disappear for days, sometimes arriving unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: \\"He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: George Gershwin, born in 1998, was one of America's greatest composers. He published his first song when he was eighteen years old. During the next twenty years he wrote more than five hundred songs. Many of Gershwin's songs were first written for musical plays performed in theatres in New York City. These plays were a popular form of entertainment in the 1920s and 1930s. Many of his songs have remained popular as ever. Over the years they have been sung and played in every possible way -- from jazz to country. In the 1920s there was a debate in the United States about jazz music. Could jazz, some people asked, be considered serious music? In 1924 jazz musician and orchestra leader Paul Whiteman decided to organize a special concert to show that jazz was serious music. Gershwin agreed to compose something for the concert before he realized he had just a few weeks to do it. And in that short time, he composed a piece for piano and orchestra which he called Rhapsody in Blue. Gershwin himself played the piano at the concert. The audience were thrilled when they heard his music. It made him world-famous and showed that jazz music could be both serious and popular. In 1928, Gershwin went to Paris. He applied to study composition  with the well-known musician Nadia Boulanger, but she rejected him. She was afraid that classical study would ruin his jazz-influenced style. While there, Gershwin wrote An American in Paris. When it was first performed, critics  were divided over the music. Some called it happy and full of life, to others it was silly and boring. But it quickly became popular in Europe and the United States. It still remains one of his most famous works. George Gershwin died in 1937, just days after doctors learned he had brain cancer. He was only thirty-nine years old. Newspapers all over the world reported his death on their front pages. People mourned the loss of the man and all the music he might have still written.

If the immune system is a defense against harmful particles from entering the body, then the what is a defense against harmful particles from entering the body?  Answer choices: - lungs  - It remains dormant  - A virus  - immune system  - exoskeleton  - pancreas  - chickenpox  - liver The answer to this question is:","output":"Immune System. The immune system is the body's primary defense mechanism against harmful particles, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, and toxins, which can cause infections, diseases, and other health problems. The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, organs, and molecules that work together to identify and eliminate foreign invaders while preserving the body's own healthy cells and tissues. There are two main divisions of the immune system: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. The innate immune system is the body's first line of defense, providing immediate and nonspecific protection against harmful particles. It includes physical barriers, such as the skin and mucous membranes, as well as cellular components, such as macrophages and neutrophils, which engulf and destroy pathogens. The innate immune system also produces various antimicrobial substances, like lysozyme and defensins, which help neutralize pathogens. The adaptive immune system, on the other hand, is a more specialized and targeted defense that arises in response to specific infections. It consists of two major components: B cells and T cells. B cells produce and secrete antibodies, which bind to specific antigens (foreign molecules) on the surface of pathogens, marking them for destruction or neutralization. T cells, particularly cytotoxic T cells, directly eliminate infected cells and help coordinate the overall immune response. The adaptive immune system also has the ability to form immunological memory, which allows it to mount a faster and more effective response against repeated infections from the same pathogen. Some of the other answer choices listed may contribute to the overall protection and health of the body, but they are not the primary defense against harmful particles entering the body. For example: - Lungs: The lungs function in respiration and help to filter out some harmful particles from the air we breathe, but their primary function is not immune defense. - Exoskeleton: An exoskeleton is a protective outer covering found in some organisms, like insects and crustaceans, but it is not involved in immune defense in humans. - Pancreas: The pancreas is involved in digestion and regulation of blood sugar levels but does not serve as a defense against harmful particles entering the body. - Liver: The liver plays a role in detoxification and the production of important proteins, but its primary role is not immune defense. Therefore, the immune system is the correct answer as it is the most pivotal and specialized defense mechanism against harmful particles entering the human body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: The government's annual budget outlined a 1% increase in personal income tax and spending cuts of 25bn rand (Â£1.4bn; 2.2bn) over the next two years Projected economic growth for 2015 is 2%, down from 2.5% forecast last year. Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene warned the economy would suffer from another three years of power disruptions. Economic growth could even halve again down to just 1% this year if power constraints worsened. He said state-owned power group Eskom faced a 200bn rand funding gap up to 2017. Eskom will receive a capital injection of 23bn rand this year, to be raised through the sale of non-strategic government shareholdings in some state-owned companies. Electricity prices will rise to finance Eskom's rebuilding of the country's power infrastructure. Mr Nene said he would also introduce a temporary increase in the electricity levy, to 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) from 3.5 cents/kWh. \\"The most important challenges facing the economy are unemployment and the security and reliability of the energy supply,\\" he said. \\"Today's budget is constrained by the need to consolidate our public finances, in the context of slower growth and rising debt.\\" Economic growth in 2014 was 1.5%, dragged down by prolonged labour strikes in the key mining sector as well as energy shortages. Mr Nene called for moderation in wage increases to spur faster growth and create more jobs. The unemployment rate stands close to 25%. Public sector union Nehawu is in talks relating to demands for pay increases way above inflation. The Treasury forecasts inflation will be 4.3% in 2015, and rise to 5.6% in 2016. The budget also included spending cuts of 25bn rand over the next two years, while maintaining core social and economic programmes. Some analysts have called his plans a \\"Robin Hood\\" budget, because of the tax increases for the rich, in a country were welfare recipients outnumber tax payers. But Mr Nene admitted himself he had little scope for what he described as a \\"challenging\\" budget to prepare. South Africa's economy has been having a hard time. Last year, industrial action, including a prolonged strike on the country's platinum mines, severely reduced growth. This year, rolling blackouts (better known as load-shedding here) are pushing some small businesses to the brink of bankruptcy. But there was nothing in the budget speech that was new - Mr Nene is not a big one for surprises. What everyone will be watching now is the next few months. Wage negotiations on the country's gold mines are due by the middle of the year, with the accompanying threat of strikes. Meanwhile, unemployment, particularly among young people, remains stubbornly high, despite efforts to reduce it. However, the real test will be how fast the power situation can be solved. Some analysts say while the lights stay on, there's hope. Once they go out, it spells dark times ahead. South Africa's deficit has risen to 3.9% of the economy this year rather than the 3.6% forecast. The ratings agency Moody's has downgraded South Africa's sovereign debt rating in November, following similar downgrades from rival agencies Fitch and Standard & Poor's. Moody's said its decision was based on \\"poor medium-term growth prospects due to structural weaknesses, including ongoing energy shortages as well as rising interest rates\\". Net debt has doubled since the start of the financial crisis as the country increased borrowing to try to repair the economy. Mr Nene said debt was expected to stabilise at less than 45% of GDP in three years' time.","output":"The South African government's annual budget includes a 1% increase in personal income tax and spending cuts of 25 billion rand over the next two years.

It depicts the last 14 months of George Jackson's existence under the subjective and objective conditions of captivity. Sentenced to one year-to-life at age 18, for a 70 gas station robbery in 1960, George Jackson would spend the next 11 years in California's industrial prison complex, 7 years of which were in solitary confinement. The movie encompasses the infamous Soledad Brothers case in which George Jackson, Fleeta Drumgo, and John Clucheette are accused of murdering a Soledad prison guard, in retaliation for the killing of three Black inmates involved in a fight with White inmates on an exercise yard in Soledad State Prison, Soledad, California. The movie also reflects on the general prison movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the role the Black Panther Party would play in organizing both the outside communities in America as well as their influence on prisoners across the country. George Jackson would be moved and inspired as a result of the Panther Party activities. As a prison organizer, George was recruited by Black Panther Party founder Huey P. Newton to head the Peoples Army, a euphemism which would become synonymous with the name Black Guerrilla Family. The film points out the conspiratorial nature of occurrences, which surrounded the events of August 7, 1970, where Jackson's 17-year-old younger brother, Jonathan Jackson, would be killed at the Marin County Courthouse, at San Raphael, California, during an alleged hostage takeover attempt to leverage against the release of the elder Jackson, and the other Soledad Brothers. The younger Jackson and thre others would be killed, including Superior Judge, Harold Haley. and August 21, 1971, where George Jackson himself, and five others would be killed at San Quentin State Prison, California, during what is discribed as a prison break attempt.

We have the problem: 8*q - 8 = -16 1. First, we want to find out what number (q) we need to multiply by 8 and then subtract 8 to get the answer -16. 2. We can start by adding 8 to both sides of the equation to remove the -8 from the left side. So, it'll look like this: 8*q - 8 + 8 = -16 + 8 3. Now, after adding the 8's, our problem becomes: 8*q = -8 4. The next step is to find out what number (q) we need to multiply by 8 to get -8. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 8. It'll look like this: (8*q) / 8 = -8 / 8 5. After dividing, our problem becomes: q = -1 6. So, the answer is: q = -1.

Q: Article: A rainforest is an area covered by tall trees with the total high rainfall spreading quite equally through the year and the temperature rarely dipping below l6degC. Rainforests have a great effect on the world environment because they can take in heat from the sun and adjust the climate. Without the forest cover,these areas would reflect more heat into the atmosphere, warming the rest of the world. Losing the rainforests may also influence wind and rainfall patterns,potentially causing certain natural disasters all over the world. In the past hundred years,humans have begun destroying rainforests in search of three major resources : land for crops,wood for paper and other products,land for raising farm animals. This action affects the environment as a whole. For example,a lot of carbon dioxide in the air comes from burning the rainforests. People obviously have a need for the resources we gain from cutting trees but we will suffer much more than we will benefit. There are two main reasons for _ . Firstly,when people cut down trees,generally they can only use the land for a year or two. Secondly,cutting large sections of rainforests may provide a good supply of wood right now,but in the long run it actually reduces the world's wood supply. Rainforests are often called the world's drug store. More than 25% of the medicines we use today come from plants in rainforests. However,fewer than l%of rainforest plants have been examined for their medical value. It is extremely likely that our best chance to cure diseases lies somewhere in the world's shrinking   rainforests.   Question: Rainforests can help to adjust the climate because they  _  .

Write an article based on this summary: A new political party leader in New Zealand has reacted angrily to repeated questions about whether she plans to have children. Article:","output":"Title: New Zealand's Newest Political Party Leader Confronts The Issue of Female Politicians And Motherhood  Introduction:  The appointment of a new political party leader in New Zealand has been met with significant media attention, particularly in relation to questions around whether she plans to have children. This unexpected and somewhat controversial focus has stirred discussions on the persistent double standards applied to female political figures in relation to motherhood and professional success. The leader's response:  The new party leader, whose name and party affiliation are kept confidential at the moment, has expressed her dissatisfaction with the line of questioning raised during her interviews. The questions about her plans to have children have been deemed by many as an unfair inquiry into her personal life and privacy. This invasive line of questioning has struck a chord with female politicians around the globe who have been scrutinized in a similar manner. The new party leader has shared her concerns that the focus on her potential motherhood could divert attention from the important policies she plans to enforce and reform within New Zealand. She argues that her abilities should be judged upon her professional experience and political agenda, rather than whether she has or plans to have children. The double standard issue:  This recent line of questioning aimed at the female party leader raises concern about the double standards that persist within the political sphere when it comes to personal matters. Male politicians are often not subjected to such invasive questioning related to their personal lives, which begs the question: why should a woman’s reproductive choices be deemed significant enough to influence her professional capacity? Moreover, it is essential to draw attention to the fact that male politicians who are fathers are rarely questioned about how their duties as a parent will affect their ability to perform in their professional roles. This insinuation that a woman's professional performance might be hindered by her ability to become a mother propagates the deeply ingrained sexism that exists within society. Implication on society and workplace:  The example set by the media and public in focusing heavily on female politicians' reproductive choices highlights the struggles that women face not only in politics but also in workplaces and families around the world. It is important to address and challenge such attitudes towards professional women in order to foster a more equitable society. One solution that could help alleviate some of the discrimination might be the normalization of men taking equal responsibility for childcare and household chores. By breaking the traditional mold of gender expectations and roles, a more level playing field can be created for women where such questions are no longer deemed relevant. Conclusion: In conclusion, the angry response of New Zealand’s newest political party leader to questions about her plans to have children is a stark reminder of the double standards that persist within the political sphere. Female politicians continue to be subjected to invasive questions on their personal lives that their male counterparts rarely face. It is crucial to recognize and challenge these biases and to work collectively towards creating more equitable environments for women in politics and the workplace. The responsibility lies not only with the media but also with the wider public in choosing to place focus on policy and experience rather than personal matters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.

The translator's role as a bridge for \\"carrying across\\" values between cultures has been discussed at least since Terence, the 2nd-century-BCE Roman adapter of Greek comedies. The translator's role is, however, by no means a passive, mechanical one, and so has also been compared to that of an artist. The main ground seems to be the concept of parallel creation found in critics such as Cicero. Dryden observed that \\"Translation is a type of drawing after life...\\" Comparison of the translator with a musician or actor goes back at least to Samuel Johnson’s remark about Alexander Pope playing Homer on a flageolet, while Homer himself used a bassoon. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Where was the concept of parallel creation lost?","output":"The concept of parallel creation in translation has not been truly \\"lost\\" but has rather evolved over time, adapting to cultural, social, and technological changes. This evolution has diversified the translator's role and highlighted the artistic and interpretative aspects instead of merely considering them as passive and mechanical. In many ways, the concept of parallel creation remains integral to the art of translation, as it acknowledges the creative input and decisions that translators must make to convey meaning across different languages and cultures. It is important to consider that translation is not a mere word-for-word transposition from one language to another but rather an act of interpretation, adaptation, and sometimes even recreation. The evolution of the translator's role, from the time of Terence and continuing through the works of Cicero, Dryden, and Johnson, has put more emphasis on the importance of equivalence, transfer of cultural nuances, idiomatic expressions, and various aspects of language that need to be considered when translating a text. With the rise of translation studies as an academic discipline in the 20th century, the intricacies of translation have come under more scrutiny. Additionally, contemporary translation theories have expanded upon the idea of parallel creation, recognizing that translation can involve varying degrees of recreation, adaptation, and cultural transplantation. The branches of translation theory such as dynamic equivalence, Skopos theory, and cultural translation have reinforced the importance of a translator's role as more than just a mechanical conveyer of meaning. Each approach emphasizes different aspects of the translation process, acknowledging that translators must sometimes be creative and adaptive in order to faithfully reproduce the intended message and impact of source material. In recent years, the growing interest in postcolonial studies and cultural studies has expanded discussions on translation in new directions. Translation is now seen as a tool through which values, ideologies, and power dynamics are reshaped and negotiated, further highlighting the active role of translators and revisiting the concept of parallel creation from a more critical and dynamic perspective. In conclusion, the concept of parallel creation in translation has not been entirely lost but has evolved and intertwined with various translation theories and approaches that emphasize the artistic, interpretative, and culturally-sensitive aspects of the translator’s role. As society and culture continue to change and as academic inquiries continue to diversify and expand, parallel creation remains as a valuable concept to understand the multifaceted art of translation."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Read over what each kit contains and compare prices to determine the best choice for you. Expect to spend around 80-100 for a kit with everything included. Explanation: Option A is incorrect because it is too specific about the contents of the kit and suggests going to a local store instead of continuing the story.  Option B is incorrect because it talks about the cost and not about choosing a kit based on their contents or purpose. Also, there's a typo in the price range.  Option D is incorrect because it is too general and talks about finding what's best for your needs without giving guidance on how to make that decision.

A 72-year-old New York woman has described for the first time how she was held prisoner in the early 1960s as a young bride in an Afghanistan harem. In a new book, 'An American Bride in Kabul' released early next month, Phyllis Chesler writes about five months she spent in the Muslim country, and how she almost died before she managed to escape and annul her ill-fated marriage. Chesler was 18 when she fell in love with a handsome older Afghan man who she met when the pair were studying together at Bard college. After dating for two years, Chesler told Adul-Kareem she wanted to travel but her boyfriend insisted they must be married before they could embark on their adventures. And when I finally land on","output":"Afghan soil, my life takes a drastic turn that I had never anticipated. As soon as we arrive, my then-husband Adul-Kareem's true colors begin to show. He reveals to me that our time in Afghanistan would be far different from what he had initially promised. No longer the progressive Western student, Adul-Kareem embraces his conservative Afghan roots and the patriarchal society, insisting that our wedding celebrations must follow traditional Afghan customs. During the wedding preparations, I am told that I will be required to wear a burqa, a head-to-toe covering garment that I had never worn in my life. Despite my hesitations and protests, I am told it is expected of me as his newlywed wife. As the celebrations unfold, I find myself questioning my decision to marry Adul-Kareem, as the life I had envisioned for myself seems to be fading away. In my new life as an Afghan bride, I am taken to Adul-Kareem's family compound where I meet my mother-in-law for the first time. It soon becomes apparent that I will have very little freedom, as my mother-in-law maintains an oppressive control over the household. She expects me to abide by the strict rules and regulations of Afghan society, insisting that I must learn the local language, wear the traditional heavy attire, and adjust to the role of an obedient, subservient wife. My smooth-talking, liberal husband suddenly morphs into an oppressive dictator, expecting me to adhere to these stringent customs. Over the next five months, I experience immense feelings of isolation, as my world becomes increasingly confined within the walls of my new home. My conversations become limited, as Adul-Kareem discourages me from asking questions or discussing topics that do not align with the conservative beliefs of his family. I spend most of my days with the other women in the harem, who share their own tales of oppression and resilience. We are all prisoners in our own ways, caged by the rigid expectations of Afghan society. As my health begins to deteriorate from the lack of basic necessities, such as clean water, medicine, and proper nutrition, I become desperate to escape. Life in the harem is unbearable, with no end in sight. I decide that I need to find a way to return to America before it's too late. In a stroke of luck, a sympathetic member of Adul-Kareem's family aids my escape and ensures that I am ushered onto a plane back to the United States. Upon my return to America, I am met with relief and disbelief from friends and family. After recounting the traumatic details of my time in Afghanistan, I decide to seek an annulment of my marriage to Adul-Kareem. It is a long and painful process, but ultimately successful. Years later, I write \\"An American Bride in Kabul\\" as a testament to my harrowing experience in Afghanistan and as a warning for others who may be navigating cross-cultural relationships. The book serves as a powerful reminder that, while love can temporarily blind us to cultural differences, understanding, mutual respect, and compassion for one another are essential for a healthy and successful union."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But beneath her lustrous surface, Stacy hides a dark secret. Act 1: The movie starts with the protagonist, 16-year-old Alex Thompson, transferring to Jefferson High School and immediately getting a crash course on the social hierarchy from her newfound friends, which includes an introduction to Stacy Lockwood, the school's reigning queen bee. As Alex assimilates into high school life, she witnesses Stacy's manipulative tactics firsthand when Stacy befriends a new student, Holly, only to publicly humiliate her for petty reasons.

Their curiosity piqued, they follow Stacy and discover that she has a secret life: She volunteers at a local children's hospital, performing uplifting dance routines for the patients. Stacy has a younger brother who battled leukemia and passed away, inspiring her philanthropy but also contributing to her guarded, tough-girl exterior. Act 3: Empathizing with Stacy's pain, The Misfits become torn: Should they expose her secret to humanize her and teach her a lesson in humility, or should they keep her secret safe lest they compromise her fragile world? During the climactic homecoming weekend, Holly reveals that she's chosen to accept a scholarship at another school. Before leaving, she implores the group not to reveal Stacy's secret. The Misfits heed her wishes and decide to help Stacy grow through a supportive rather than antagonistic approach.

Stacy gradually lets her true colors show and becomes more open and compassionate toward others, retaining her title as queen bee but now with an emphasis on kindness. Alex, The Misfits, and Holly all reconcile with Stacy, and they all share a heartfelt dance at the homecoming gala.

However, it does not explicitly state or imply that Mineola is within the boundaries of Garden City. Mineola and Garden City are both villages in Nassau County, each with their own geographic boundaries. The fact that Garden City is within the Mineola 11501 zip code does not imply that Mineola is within the boundaries of Garden City. The 11501 zip code is most likely a larger geographic region that contains both Garden City and parts of Mineola, among other areas.  ZIP codes are postal codes used in the United States by the United States Postal Service (USPS). They are often based on administrative boundaries (such as city or county boundaries) but may also cross such boundaries, depending on how the USPS organizes its delivery routes.  In this case, the USPS has chosen to designate the 11501 ZIP code as covering an area that includes the Village of Garden City, which is the county seat of Nassau County. This means that mail sent to addresses in the Village of Garden City would be sorted and delivered as part of the route for the Mineola 11501 ZIP code.  In conclusion, the statement that \\"Garden City is within the boundaries of the Mineola 11501 zip code\\" simply means that these two villages share the same postal zone for mail delivery.

Here is a news article: \\"If you’re going to play [tackle] football, put it off until the body matures completely, until the body size has caught up with head size, until the muscles are coordinated,\\" McKee said.      Cassandra Keck took some comfort in hearing the diagnosis. The man she met and married had been smart, kind and industrious. But then he started to change; his memory deteriorated and he became violent and abusive.      Keck had maintained a 3.8 GPA at Harrisonville High in Missouri and was able to keep his grades high in his freshman year at the University of Missouri. That all changed after he transferred to Missouri State University and sustained his second college concussion playing linebacker.      Michael took a year off football to recover. When he tried to start working out with the team again, his headaches would flare and his vision would fade to black. Though his vision would return eventually, it was frightening and Keck told his coaches he couldn’t come back.      “He couldn’t read his books,\\" Cassandra said. \\"The words would get all scrambled. He’d get angry and punch the book and throw it across the room. He couldn’t read, so he couldn’t study. He felt like he was failing. He just wanted to graduate from college.”      About a year before he died, he had to stop working. “Having to be somewhere on time was very stressful,” Cassandra said. “I’d have to put his shoes and socks and hat by the door so he knew where everything was. I’d have to get his shirt and pants ready.”      Head hits and later symptoms      There still isn’t enough evidence to suggest that youngsters need to give up tackle football, experts told NBC News. It's unknown how many people end up with permanent debilitating symptoms as a result of hits on the field, said David Hovda, a professor of neurosurgery and director of the Brain Injury Research Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, who is unaffiliated with the new study.      Even if it’s a small percentage, “we still need to do something about it,” Hovda said. “Every person is important. But we have to be cautious about changes that affect everybody.”      If the percentage is much larger, say one-third of players, then “we have a real problem that needs to be fixed,\\" Hovda said.      Another question is whether head hits among some youngsters can be linked to CTE symptoms later in life.      “Certainly we have known that CTE changes in the brain can be found in younger players,\\" said Dr. Julian Bailes, medical director of Pop Warner football, who is unaffiliated with the new study. “But I don’t think that any research, and not the [new] case report, necessarily correlates with football participation at a young age. In my opinion, it is more likely that the exposure that he got in high school or college, or even doing other activities, led to the accrual of CTE changes.”      Related: Will Soccer's New Header Rules Make Kids Safer      Bailes, clinical professor of neurosurgery at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine and the chairman of the department of neurosurgery at the NorthShore University HealthSystem reported on the 2009 death of Chris Henry, the only active NFL player to die and have CTE at age 26, with forensic pathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu.      Watch: Bengals mourn the death of receiver Chris Henry      The hits little kids sustain playing tackle football rarely lead to concussions, Bailes said.      “For instance, in Pop Warner football, we think that currently the concussion rate is only 1 percent annually for players, while they are receiving about 100 cranial impacts per season, almost all of low velocity,” he added. “However, high school players hit at high velocity (high g-forces) and at about 600-800/year, and college approximately 1000/year. “      Taught to play through pain      For her part, Cassandra hopes that in telling Michael’s story, people will better understand the dangers of concussions. ||||| Also Meets CME requirements for:      Accreditation Information      The American Medical Association is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians.

The article highlights experts' concerns that youngsters might develop neurological issues from playing tackle football due to the increased risk of head hits. Some experts argue that tackle football should be postponed until a person's body has fully matured. However, others argue there isn't enough evidence to suggest that young players need to give up tackle football. Michael Keck, the central focus of the article, was diagnosed with CTE after he had started to display cognitive and emotional issues after sustaining concussions playing football. The article mentions Dr. Ann McKee's comments that if a person wants to play tackle football, it should be put off until the body matures completely. David Hovda, a professor of neurosurgery and the director of the Brain Injury Research Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, believes there's still not enough evidence to justify asking young players to give up tackle football. He mentions that it's important to investigate the percentage of players who develop permanent debilitating symptoms as a result of head hits on the field. If the percentage is high, then necessary measures should be taken to address the problem. Ultimately, the issue of whether head hits from playing tackle football among youngsters can be linked to CTE symptoms later in life is still unclear.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What singer was going to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman?  During a Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert with other Neighbours cast members, Minogue performed \\"I Got You Babe\\" as a duet with actor John Waters, and \\"The Loco-Motion\\" as an encore. She was subsequently signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records in 1987. Her first single, \\"The Locomotion\\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles charts and became the country's highest-selling single in the 1980s. She received the ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single. Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to England with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" while she waited outside the studio. The song reached number one in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Israel and Hong Kong. Minogue won her second consecutive ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single, and received a \\"Special Achievement Award\\". Minogue's debut album, Kylie was released in July 1988. The album was a collection of dance-oriented pop tunes and spent more than a year on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one. The album went gold in the United States, and the single, \\"The Locomotion\\", reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number one on the Canadian Singles Chart. The single \\"Got to Be Certain\\" became her third consecutive number one single on the Australian music charts. Later in the year, she left Neighbours to focus on her music career. Minogue also collaborated with Jason Donovan for the song \\"Especially for You\\", which peaked at number-one in the United Kingdom and in December 2014 sold its one millionth copy in the UK. Minogue was sometimes referred to as \\"the Singing Budgie\\" by her detractors over the coming years.

Given the following context:  There are two Campfire Circles which are used extensively during the peak camping season. The Large Campfire Circle has a Maori Gatewat which was presented by the Scouts New Zealand in 1951. The Lime Walk, constructed by previous estate owner Margaret Chinnery, surrounds the Training Ground which was the original main lawn area of the White House. Few of the Lime trees survive to this day. On this path sits the Jim Green Gate, a 1930 tribute to Jim Green, an editor of The Scouter magazine. The Buffalo Lawn is so called because of the replica of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Silver Buffalo Award that was presented by the Boy Scouts of America in 1926. This was to honour the Unknown Scout that helped William D. Boyce bring Scouting to the United States. Located there is a signpost with the directions and distances to all the World Scout Jamborees from Gilwell Park. Surrounding the Buffalo Lawn is part of the original balustrade of London Bridge which was re-built in 1820. The sections were moved to Gilwell Park after being purchased at auction in 1826. Considered by many to be the most important Scouting site, The Training Ground is where Wood Badge training was historically held and where the Gilwell oak tree is located. Contrary to popular belief, the Wood Badge beads have never been made of Gilwell Oak. On the Training Ground sits the Gidney Cabin, a memorial to the first Camp Chief, Francis Gidney, in 1929. Across from the Gidney Cabin is the Thurman Memorial, in memory of Camp Chief John Thurman. The caravan trailer, presented to Chief Scout Sir Robert Baden-Powell, along with a new Rolls-Royce car, during the 3rd World Scout Jamboree in 1929 is on display during the summer months. The caravan was nicknamed Eccles. The car, nicknamed Jam Roll, was sold after his death by Olave Baden-Powell in 1945.

She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher. She and her sister moved to Saratoga, California, with their mother in 1919 when her parents separated. Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942.

Please answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about United States presidential election, 1968. Yes or no? Answer: It was a wrenching national experience, conducted during a year of violence that included the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. , and subsequent race riots across the nation, the assasination of Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy , widespread opposition to the Vietnam War across university campuses, and violent confrontations between police and anti-war protesters at the 1968 Democratic National Convention as the Democratic party split again and again. Question: what where the most important factors that led to the defeat of the democrates in 1968? A:","output":"Yes, the factors you mentioned played significant roles in the defeat of the Democrats in the 1968 United States presidential election. The key factors included: 1. Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and subsequent race riots: These events exacerbated racial tensions and further divided the nation. The Democratic Party's support for civil rights legislation and racial equality led some white voters to align themselves with the Republican candidate, Richard Nixon. 2. Assassination of Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy: This tragic event left the Democratic Party in disarray and without a clear frontrunner, ultimately leading to the nomination of Hubert Humphrey, who was perceived by some as a weaker candidate. 3. Opposition to the Vietnam War: The Johnson administration's handling of the Vietnam War was deeply unpopular, particularly among younger voters. Many Democrats were unhappy with their party's stance on the war and sought change through alternative candidates like Eugene McCarthy or the eventual independent candidate George Wallace. 4. The 1968 Democratic National Convention: The convention was marked by chaos and violence, as anti-war protesters clashed with police outside the event, while factions within the Democratic Party argued over the party's platform. This created a negative image of the party in the public eye. 5. The resurgence of the Republican Party under Richard Nixon: Nixon ran a strong campaign that capitalized on the dissatisfaction with the state of the nation under Democratic leadership. He highlighted law and order and promised to bring an end to the turmoil associated with the Vietnam War and civil unrest. These factors combined led to a fractured Democratic Party, and the ultimate victory of Republican nominee Richard Nixon in the 1968 United States presidential election."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: In Etan Patz Trial, Closing Arguments Are Expected to Focus on Confession Lawyers will sum up 10 weeks of testimony on Monday in the trial of the former store clerk accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz, with each side expected to marshal arguments designed to sway the jury on a simple question: Did the defendant, Pedro Hernandez, tell the truth when he confessed to strangling the boy? Both sides face hurdles. Mr. Hernandez’s lead lawyer, Harvey Fishbein, must persuade jurors that his client has such a weak and troubled mind that he convinced himself under pressure from the police that he committed a murder he did not commit, then calmly repeated a fictional confession to the crime several times. The prosecutor, Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, must not only convince the jury that Mr. Hernandez’s mind is sound and his confessions are reliable, but must also overcome evidence pointing to another possible culprit: Jose A. Ramos, a convicted child molester who for years was the prime suspect in Etan’s disappearance. Etan vanished in 1979 while walking from his parents’ loft on Prince Street in SoHo to a school bus stop two blocks away. His mother, Julie Patz, testified in the murder trial, in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, that her son was last seen heading to a bodega near the bus stop and that he had a dollar in his hand to buy a soda. The disappearance of Etan Patz, a 6-year-old boy, gripped New York City in 1979 and the years that followed. Mr. Hernandez, a high school dropout from New Jersey, worked at the bodega as a stock clerk at the time. In his videotaped statements, he recounts luring Etan into the store’s basement, strangling him, placing his body in a plastic bag and a box, then carrying the box to a subterranean passageway a block away and leaving it there. From the start, prosecutors have acknowledged they have no physical evidence to corroborate Mr. Hernandez’s account. Etan’s body was never found, nor did police find the boy’s clothes or his small blue tote bag, crammed with toy cars and pencils, which Mr. Hernandez said he threw behind a freezer in the basement of the bodega. But a series of prosecution witnesses testified that Mr. Hernandez, 54, of Maple Shade, N.J., made similar admissions to them. Three members of a prayer group, for example, said that during a religious retreat in the summer of 1979, Mr. Hernandez confessed to having killed a child at a bodega in New York. Mr. Hernandez’s ex-wife, Daisy Rivera, said he told her during their courtship in 1982 that he had killed a boy who made a sexual pass at him. A childhood friend, Mark Pike, recalled that Mr. Hernandez once boasted of having murdered a boy who threw a ball at him. Ms. Illuzzi-Orbon can be expected to argue that Mr. Hernandez made those statements voluntarily long before the police interviewed him in 2012, countering the defense’s argument that he invented his confessions to investigators under duress. For his part, Mr. Fishbein will most likely stress that the details of each of the stories Mr. Hernandez told more than 30 years ago were slightly different. (He told Mr. Pike, for instance, that he had killed a black child; Etan was white.) Mr. Fishbein could also question the memory and credibility of the prosecution witnesses after so long, and ask why they never told the police what they had heard. He is likely to point to aspects of Mr. Hernandez’s account that do not add up, including: the police’s failure to find Etan’s book bag despite records showing that detectives visited the bodega and presumably searched the basement; how Mr. Hernandez, who weighed 110 pounds, could have carried the body of a 6-year-old boy for a block and a half in a box; and why no witnesses interviewed at the time had seen the boy at either the bodega or bus stop. But the biggest challenge for the defense will most likely be convincing the jury that Mr. Hernandez gave a false confession because he is mentally disabled. A defense psychiatrist, Dr. Michael B. First, testified that Mr. Hernandez has schizotypal personality disorder, and sometimes had difficulty distinguishing reality from fantasy. Dr. First’s testimony was buttressed by Mr. Hernandez’s daughter, Becky Hernandez, who said her father had frequently talked about seeing a lady in white, menacing shadow figures and ancient elders that no one else could see. A psychologist who testified for the defense, Dr. Bruce Frumkin, said Mr. Hernandez’s low intelligence, coupled with his personality disorder, made him extremely vulnerable to confessing to a crime to please the detectives. The prosecution’s psychiatrist, Dr. Michael Welner, disagreed, saying Mr. Hernandez did not have a serious mental illness. Dr. Welner also testified that the defendant had a solid grasp of reality and, despite his low I.Q., was not intellectually disabled. He noted that Mr. Hernandez had little trouble living on his own, working on his car and house or holding menial jobs. He also suggested Mr. Hernandez had exaggerated his symptoms of mental illness to qualify for disability benefits. Ms. Illuzzi-Orbon can be relied on to portray Mr. Hernandez as a competent and canny man who, limited intelligence notwithstanding, hid his crime for years and has exaggerated his mental illness since being arrested. She is likely to highlight testimony from friends and employers who said they saw no obvious signs that Mr. Hernandez was delusional or mentally disabled. She can also be expected to cite Mr. Hernandez’s cocaine use in the 1990s and early 2000s as a possible cause of his reported hallucinations. Though Mr. Hernandez has never formally retracted his confession, and did not testify, Mr. Fishbein can point the jury to moments in his interviews with forensic psychiatrists in which he seemed unsure about whether his memories were real. “He’s a terrible historian,” Mr. Fishbein has said more than once during the trial. Beyond raising doubts about Mr. Hernandez’s mental competence, the defense was allowed to present evidence potentially implicating Mr. Ramos in Etan’s death, and Mr. Fishbein will almost certainly argue to jurors that he is the more likely killer. A parade of law enforcement officials testified for the defense, including the former Bronx prosecutor who first linked Mr. Ramos to the Patz family; a senior Federal Bureau of Investigation agent who investigated Mr. Ramos; and a former assistant U.S. attorney, Stuart GraBois, who pursued Mr. Ramos for two decades. Mr. Ramos, a drifter who was convicted of raping two young boys in Pennsylvania, told Mr. GraBois in 1988 that he had picked up a boy he believed was Etan in Washington Square Park the day Etan disappeared. He said he had molested the child in his apartment on East Fourth Street before letting him go. Mr. Fishbein can also be expected to highlight the testimony of Jeffrey Rothschild, a federal informer who testified that Mr. Ramos told him in prison that he had raped Etan. Asked if the boy was dead, Mr. Ramos told Mr. Rothschild, “Of course he’s dead, but there’s no proof and the kidnapping statutes are over,” referring to the statute of limitations. “The jury is going to have to exclude Ramos,” Mr. Fishbein said last week. In terms of Mr. Ramos, the prosecution’s challenge will be to persuade jurors that the evidence against him was never strong enough to warrant a prosecution, much less a conviction. Ms. Illuzzi-Orbon will most likely try to hammer away at Mr. Rothschild’s credibility by highlighting that he is a convicted con artist seeking better treatment in prison. Ms. Illuzzi-Orbon will also most likely point out, as she did in her heated cross-examination of Mr. GraBois, that, unlike the man now on trial, Mr. Ramos never confessed to killing Etan in 1988, and later retracted his claim that he had met him. A version of this news analysis appears in print on April 13, 2015, on page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: In Patz Trial, Closing Arguments Are Expected to Focus on Confession. Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe","output":"In the Etan Patz trial, lawyers are expected to focus on whether the defendant, Pedro Hernandez, told the truth when he confessed to strangling Etan. The defense must persuade jurors that Hernandez, who allegedly has a weak and troubled mind, convinced himself under pressure from the police that he committed a murder he did not commit. Meanwhile, the prosecution must convince the jury that Hernandez's mind is sound, and his confessions are reliable. Furthermore, they must overcome evidence pointing to another possible culprit, Jose A. Ramos, a convicted child molester who was the prime suspect in Etan's disappearance. Etan vanished in 1979 while walking to his school bus stop, and his case remains unsolved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.  Two brothers Syd and Dan went to college.

Available options: (1). no (2). yes","output":"To determine whether these questions have the same meaning, I will analyze the structure and key terms in each question. Question 1:  \\"What is the best book for research in Cloud computing?\\" Key terms: best book, research, Cloud computing Question 2: \\"What is the Best book for cloud computing?\\" Key terms: Best book, cloud computing The first question specifically mentions \\"research in Cloud computing,\\" while the second question simply asks for the \\"best book for cloud computing\\" without specifying the purpose of the book. Step 1: Identify the differences between the questions The main difference between these two questions is the mention of \\"research\\" in the first one, which gives it a more specific context. Step 2: Analyze the impact of the differences The inclusion of \\"research\\" in the first question implies that the best book should provide comprehensive, in-depth information about cloud computing that can be useful for conducting research.

She had few glasses wine - then decided throw caution wind make first move . Why did John not   reach out to Jennifer first ?","output":"There could be several reasons why John Mayer did not reach out to Jennifer Aniston first to rekindle their relationship. While we cannot know for certain as we are not privy to their personal lives, we can infer some potential explanations based on common factors that may arise in relationships. Here are a few possibilities: 1. Fear of Rejection: John Mayer might have feared being rejected by Jennifer Aniston if he reached out to her first. In any relationship, the possibility of rejection can be a significant barrier to initiating contact, as it can result in emotional pain and embarrassment. John might not have wanted to put himself in such a vulnerable position. 2. Emotional Healing: Following a breakup, it's natural for both partners to need time to heal emotionally. John may have believed that attempting to rekindle their relationship too soon would have been detrimental to their healing process. By not reaching out to Jennifer first, he might have been trying to prioritize and respect the need for emotional healing for both of them. 3. Uncertainty about Jennifer's Feelings: John might not have been sure about Jennifer's feelings towards him. In such cases, it can be challenging to take the first step towards reconciliation. He may have wanted to wait and gauge Jennifer's emotions and actions before deciding whether or not to reconnect. 4. Believing the Breakup was Final: It's possible that John viewed their breakup as a final decision and could not envision a future together. When individuals believe a relationship has permanently ended, they may be less inclined to reach out and attempt to rekindle a romance, as they believe it would be futile. 5. Pride: In some cases, pride can prevent people from reaching out to an ex-partner, as they may feel the need to \\"save face\\" and avoid appearing desperate. John might have struggled with the idea of being the one to pursue Jennifer in this scenario, as it could potentially make him feel vulnerable or appear weak. 6. Reflecting on Personal Issues: Breakups can often lead to self-reflection and personal growth. John might have taken time to evaluate his life and relationships, perhaps realizing that he needs to work on his own personal issues before trying to rekindle a romance with Jennifer. 7. Changes in Priorities: People's priorities change over time, and John's focus might have shifted from romantic relationships to other aspects of his life, such as his career, family, or friendships. This change could have affected his decision not to initiate contact with Jennifer, as he might have felt that a relationship with her was no longer his primary concern. Ultimately, all of these factors are speculative since we cannot know the exact reasons behind John Mayer's decision not to reach out to Jennifer Aniston first. Personal circumstances, emotions, and individual perspectives greatly influence the complex dynamics of relationships, making it difficult to definitively pinpoint why specific actions are or are not taken."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

Write an article based on this summary: Breathe from your diaphragm to control your voice. Vary your vocal pitch. Speak slowly to keep people engaged. Use a softer voice to avoid sounding aggressive. Avoid mumbling to keep your listener from getting confused. Record yourself to practice your changes.","output":"Title: The Art of Voice Control: Techniques for Enhancing Your Vocal Skills Introduction It's no secret that the voice is a powerful tool in communication. A well-controlled voice can effectively convey your message and keep your audience engaged. Many people, however, are unaware of the techniques they can use to improve their voice control. In this article, we will discuss some simple yet effective tips to help you develop better vocal skills, ensuring that your message is both engaging and effectively communicated. 1. Breathe from the diaphragm Breathing from your diaphragm is the foundation of good voice control. This technique allows you to efficiently use your breath, which in turn provides you with more sustained vocal power. To breathe from your diaphragm, focus on engaging your abdominal muscles and filling your lung capacity without raising your shoulders. Practicing this deep-breathing technique will not only improve your voice quality, but also assist in reducing any feelings of nervousness or anxiety that may be affecting your speech. 2. Vary your vocal pitch Speaking in a monotone voice can be dull and will quickly disengage your audience. To keep their attention, it's essential to vary your vocal pitch. This does not mean you should dramatically fluctuate for no reason, but rather include a natural rise and fall to create vocal variety and make your speech captivating. Changes in pitch can add emphasis, convey emotion and demonstrate authority when used effectively. 3. Speak slowly Speaking too quickly is a common mistake that can alienate listeners and leave them struggling to keep up with your message. To maintain their interest, practice speaking more slowly, clearly, and deliberately. When speaking more slowly, it's crucial to maintain the natural rhythm and cadence of your speech. This allows your listeners to follow your thoughts comfortably and helps you maintain a strong connection with them. 4. Use a softer voice to avoid sounding aggressive While it's important to be confident and assertive, projecting your voice with excessive force can be perceived as aggressive or domineering, which could detract from your message. Instead, practice speaking with a softer voice, which not only sounds more pleasant, but also invites openness and collaboration. Balancing your tone with appropriate volume will help you sound composed and approachable. 5. Avoid mumbling Mumbling makes it difficult for your listeners to understand and follow your thoughts, leading to confusion and disengagement. To avoid this common pitfall, practice enunciating your words clearly and concisely. Focusing on proper diction and pacing will dramatically improve your speech quality and make it easier for your audience to engage with your message. 6. Record yourself to practice your changes One of the most effective ways to identify areas of improvement and monitor your progress is by recording yourself. Listening to recordings of your speech can provide valuable insights into your vocal strengths and weaknesses. Use these recordings to make targeted improvements and adjustments to your vocal techniques. Over time, this self-evaluation will result in a notable enhancement of your voice control. Conclusion Voice control is an invaluable skill in communication, and mastering these techniques can dramatically improve your effectiveness as a speaker. Implementing these tips and practicing regularly will help you develop a compelling, engaging voice that successfully conveys your message and captivates your audience. Don't underestimate the power of a well-controlled voice – it might just be the key to unlocking your full communication potential."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"More pollution in the environment may have a negative effect on the metamorphosis process of butterflies. This is because pollution can lead to a decrease in the availability and quality of resources needed for the butterfly's development, such as appropriate host plants for caterpillars to feed on. Additionally, pollution can disrupt the habitat and have toxic effects on the insects themselves, potentially leading to developmental issues or even mortality during the metamorphosis process. In this context, the supposed perturbation of increased pollution would likely have a more significant negative effect on the second stage (caterpillar growth and molting) of metamorphosis."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Apple and Samsung have settled their seven-year patent dispute over Apple’s allegations that Samsung copied the iPhone’s design and software, reports CNN. Terms were not available, but according to the Wall Street Journal, the companies filed a notice in California federal court that they had agreed to settle the case. Apple was awarded 539 million in May by a US jury; prior to the award, Samsung had already paid Apple 399 million, so Samsung had an outstanding payment of 140 million, according to Reuters. It was unclear how this week’s ruling would affect that settlement. The battle between the world’s two largest smartphone makers has already cost both companies hundreds of millions in legal fees. In 2012, Samsung was ordered to pay Apple more than 1 billion for iPhone and iPad patent infringement, but that penalty was later reduced to 450 million by a federal judge. Apple declined to comment on the agreement, but an Apple rep referred CNN to a company statement released last month that said, \\"Apple ignited the smartphone revolution with iPhone and it is a fact that Samsung blatantly copied our design.

The exact terms of the settlement remain undisclosed. However, it is known that Apple was awarded 539 million by a US jury in May – prior to this award, Samsung had already paid Apple 399 million, which meant Samsung had an outstanding payment of 140 million, according to Reuters. It is still unclear how the recent ruling will affect that settlement.  The lawsuit, which has already cost both companies hundreds of millions in legal fees, began in 2011 when Apple accused Samsung of copying its iPhone design. In spite of the ongoing legal dispute, both companies managed to maintain strong financial results and increased market share throughout the years.  In 2012, Samsung was initially ordered to pay Apple over 1 billion for iPhone and iPad patent infringement. However, a federal judge later reduced the penalty to 450 million. Apple has not commented directly on the recent agreement, but referred CNN to a company statement from last month, which emphasized how the iPhone ignited the smartphone revolution and that Samsung \\"blatantly copied\\" Apple's design. Apple views the protection of its innovation and design as a priority. This settlement marks the end of a prolonged legal conflict between two titans of the smartphone industry, both of whom invested a significant amount of resources into the battle. The resolution of this case is expected to provide some clarity in the world of intellectual property law and emphasize the significance of patent protection. While the details of the settlement may remain unknown, its conclusion demonstrates the importance of safeguarding companies' innovations and designs in the ever-evolving technology sector."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Maurice Robert \\"Mike\\" Gravel (; born May 13, 1930) is an American politician who was a Democratic United States Senator from Alaska from 1969 to 1981 and a candidate in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Born and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, by French-Canadian immigrant parents, Gravel served in the U.S. Army in West Germany, and he later graduated from the Columbia University School of General Studies. He moved to Alaska in the late 1950s, becoming a real estate developer and entering politics. He served in the Alaska House of Representatives from 1963 to 1966 and also became Speaker of the Alaska House. Gravel \\"decided to become a pioneer in a faraway place,\\" and moved to pre-statehood Alaska in August 1956, without funds or a job, looking for a place where someone without social or political connections could be a viable candidate for public office. Alaska's voting age of 19, less than most other states' 21, played a role in his decision, as did its newness and cooler climate. Broke when he arrived, he immediately found work in real estate sales until winter arrived. Gravel then was employed as a brakeman for the Alaska Railroad, working the snow-clearing train on the Anchorage-Fairbanks run. Subsequently, he opened a small real estate brokerage in Anchorage (the Territory of Alaska not requiring a license) and saved enough so as not to have to work the railroad again. Gravel joined the Anchorage Unitarian Universalist Fellowship, and continued a sporadic relationship with the movement throughout his life.  Gravel married Rita Jeannette Martin, who had been Anchorage's \\"Miss Fur Rendezvous\\" of 1958, on April 29, 1959. They had two children, Martin Anthony Gravel and Lynne Denise Gravel, born c. 1960 and 1962 respectively.  Meanwhile, he went to Washington, D.C. in 1957 to campaign for Alaskan statehood via the \\"Tennessee Plan\\": dressed as Paul Revere, he rode with a petition to the steps of the U.S. Capitol. Seeing Alaska as a wide-open place with no political establishment or entrenched interests, and using the slogan \\"Gravel, the Roadbed to Prosperity\\", he ran for the territorial legislature in 1958 but lost. He went on a national speaking tour concerning tax reform in 1959, sponsored by the Jaycees. He ran without avail for the City Council in Anchorage in 1960. During this time, he had become a successful real estate agent; after the 1960 election, he became a property developer in a mobile home park on the outskirts of Anchorage. A partner ran into financial difficulty, however, and the project went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy and Gravel was forced out in 1962.

Q:Question: how many canals in mandibular first molar I found the following answer on Google: The Palmer notation uses a number in conjunction with a symbol designating in which quadrant the tooth is found. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"No, the answer provided does not directly address the question of how many canals are in the mandibular first molar. Instead, it focuses on the Palmer notation system, which is used for identifying the position of a tooth in the mouth. Palmer notation combines a number and a symbol to indicate the location of a tooth in a specific quadrant. For example, the number '1' refers to a central incisor, '2' refers to a lateral incisor, '3' to a canine, '4' to a first premolar, '5' to a second premolar, '6' to a first molar, '7' to a second molar, and '8' to a third molar. Concerning the original question, the mandibular first molar typically has two roots: a mesial root and a distal root. The mesial root usually contains two separate canals, known as the mesiobuccal and mesiolingual canals. The distal root most often contains one canal, referred to as the distal canal. Therefore, the mandibular first molar typically has three root canals in total. However, it is essential to note that variations can occur in the number of canals present within a tooth. In some cases, the first mandibular molar might have an additional canal, known as a middle mesial canal, resulting in four total canals. Consequently, while the standard number of canals in a mandibular first molar is three, the complexity of the root canal system may vary depending on individual anatomical differences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: It's really important to meet with your potential property appraiser before you enter into any sort of working relationship.This is a way to make sure they have the qualifications you are looking for, but also that you are on the right page as far as expectations go. It is also important to have a level of comfort that will make your working relationship go more smoothly.  Things like personality and the vibe of your interactions with them can really help build trust. Make sure they are personable and are willing to answer your questions and explain their process. Their ability to deal with people and communicate smoothly can affect their ability to find out information about the property and thus how accurate their appraisal is. A good appraiser should be able to answer important questions that give insight into their strategies, philosophies and experiences. However, this also means that you will need to know the right questions to ask. Some good questions to ask include:  Will you receive a preliminary report? You should require every appraiser to give you a preliminary report so you can ensure the appraiser has access to all the information you consider important. Additionally, it will give you the opportunity to end the appraisal process before a final report is issued if you are not happy with the process. What qualifies you to appraise my specific property? Do you belong to an appraiser society that tests? There are a number of certificates and training programs for appraisers, but only some have standardized teaching and testing methods. If they are part of an organization that requires testing to be accredited, you can be sure that they meet the required expectations. How will you handle issues outside your specialty? There are over 220 areas of specialty knowledge in appraising and no one person can master them all. It is likely that they will come up against issues that they are not fully qualified to understand. Their ability to consult other colleagues and experts can assure that they have the problem solving skills needed to successfully do the job. What will your report look like? You should receive formal and organized documentation of how they came to their conclusions. Ask for examples of their previous work so that you can see how they organize and present their information so you can make sure you understand their work. Once you decide that the appraiser you've met is one that you want to move forward with, you'll want to make sure you know all the details of the working relationship you are about to enter. The fee you'll pay depends on the complexity of the property, type, size, and market.  For residential appraisals you can expect to pay anywhere from 250-1000 USD, with averages in the 300-500 USD range.

The region covers 35% (3,891 km) of Kosovo's total area. According to the 2011 census, the population of the region is 700,577.  - Albania (; ), officially the Republic of Albania, is a sovereign state in Southeastern Europe. It has a population of 3.03 million as of 2016. Tirana is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Durrës and Vlorë. Albania is located in the south-western part of the Balkan peninsula, bordered by Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast, the Republic of Macedonia to the east, and Greece to the south and southeast. The country has a coastline on the northern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, the Adriatic Sea to the west and the Ionian Sea to the southwest where the Albanian Riviera begins. Albania is less than from Italy, across the Strait of Otranto which connects the Adriatic Sea to the Ionian Sea.  - Serbia, officially the Republic of Serbia, is a sovereign state situated at the crossroads of Central and Southeast Europe, covering the southern part of the Pannonian Plain and the central Balkans. Relative to its small territory, it is a diverse country distinguished by a \\"transitional\\" character, situated along cultural, geographic, climatic and other boundaries. Serbia is landlocked and borders Hungary to the north; Romania and Bulgaria to the east; Macedonia to the south; and Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Montenegro to the southwest; it also claims a border with Albania through the disputed territory of Kosovo. Serbia numbers around 7 million residents, and its capital, Belgrade, ranks among the largest cities in Southeast Europe.  - Montenegro (or or ; Montenegrin: \\"Crna Gora\\" /   , meaning \\"Black Mountain\\") is a sovereign state in Southeastern Europe. It has a coast on the Adriatic Sea to the south-west and is bordered by Croatia to the west, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the northwest, Serbia to the northeast, Kosovo to the east, and Albania to the south-east. Its capital and largest city is Podgorica, while Cetinje is designated as the Old Royal Capital (\\"prijestonica\\").  - Kosovo  is a disputed territory and partially recognised state in Southeast Europe that declared independence from Serbia in February 2008 as the Republic of Kosovo. Kosovo is landlocked in the central Balkan Peninsula. Its capital and largest city is Pristina. It is bordered by the Republic of Macedonia and Albania to the south, Montenegro to the west, and the uncontested territory of Serbia to the north and east. While Serbia recognises administration of the territory by Kosovo's elected government, it still continues to claim it as its own Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija.  - Albanians are an ethnic group native to Albania and neighboring countries. The term is also used to refer to the citizens of the Republic of Albania. Ethnic Albanians speak the Albanian language and more than half of ethnic Albanians live in Albania and Kosovo. A large Albanian population lives in the Republic of Macedonia, with smaller Albanian populations located in Serbia and Montenegro. The majority of Albanians are nominally Muslim (mainly Sunni, with a smaller Shia, Sufi and Bektashi component), and a minority are nominally Christian (Catholic and Orthodox). Albanians produced many prominent figures such as Skanderbeg, leader of the medieval Albanian resistance to the Ottoman conquest and others during the Albanian National Awakening seeking self-determination. During the 17th and 18th century Albanians in large numbers converted to Islam, often to escape higher taxes levied on Christian subjects. As Muslims, some Albanians attained important political and military positions within the Ottoman Empire and culturally contributed to the wider Muslim world. Albania gained its independence in 1912 and between 1945-1992, Albanians lived under a repressive communist regime. Albanians within Yugoslavia underwent periods of discrimination and eventual self-determination that concluded with the breakup of that state in the early 1990s culminating with Albanians living in new countries and Kosovo. Outside the southwestern Balkans of where Albanians have traditionally been located, Albanian populations through the course of history have formed new communities contributing to the cultural, economic, social and political life of their host populations and countries while also at times assimilating too.  - Southeast Europe or Southeastern Europe is a geographical region of Europe, consisting primarily of the Balkan peninsula. Sovereign states that are, at least partially, included in the region are, in alphabetical order, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Kosovo, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia and Turkey.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Albanians in Serbia are an officially recognized ethnic minority.

When fishing occurs in a forest fire-impacted area, it adds another level of pressure to the already struggling ecosystem. Although the fishing itself doesn't directly cause any of the steps described (forest fires, animals losing hiding places, predators finding prey easier, birds flying away, or water warming up), it does exacerbate the existing problems.

Is \\"Confusion about his height also results from the difference between the French pouce and British inch—2.71 cm and 2.54 cm, respectively.\\" the correct answer? Choices: [1]. yes; [2]. no;","output":"To find Napoleon's actual height in feet and inches, I will follow these steps: 1. Research credible sources for Napoleon's height. 2. Address the confusion caused by the difference between the French pouce and the British inch. 3. Convert Napoleon's height to feet and inches. Step 1: Research credible sources for Napoleon's height According to the International Napoleonic Society and other sources, Napoleon's height was 5 feet 2 inches in French units, which was equal to 1.69 meters. Step 2: Address the confusion caused by the difference between the French pouce and the British inch The French unit, pouce, is equal to 2.71 cm, while the British unit, inch, is equal to 2.54 cm. Since Napoleon's height was measured in French units (pouces), it is essential to correct for the difference when converting his height to feet and inches. Step 3: Convert Napoleon's height to feet and inches As previously mentioned, Napoleon's height was 5 feet 2 inches in French units. Converting this to centimeters: 5 (French) feet * 12 inches = 62 (French) inches. 62 * 2.71 cm = 167.82 centimeters (approx). Now, to convert this to British feet and inches: 167.82 cm / 2.54 cm = 66.08 inches. 66.08 inches / 12 inches = 5.51 feet. Thus, Napoleon's actual height was approximately 5 feet 6 inches in British units.

That is, such field equations are written without matter interaction (i.e.- set to zero).  - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.   - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - Particle physics (also high energy physics) is the branch of physics that studies the nature of the particles that constitute \\"matter\\" (particles with mass) and \\"radiation\\" (massless particles). Although the word \\"particle\\" can refer to various types of very small objects (e.g. protons, gas particles, or even household dust), \\"particle physics\\" usually investigates the irreducibly smallest detectable particles and the irreducibly fundamental force fields necessary to explain them. By our current understanding, these elementary particles are excitations of the quantum fields that also govern their interactions. The currently dominant theory explaining these fundamental particles and fields, along with their dynamics, is called the Standard Model. Thus, modern particle physics generally investigates the Standard Model and its various possible extensions, e.g. to the newest \\"known\\" particle, the Higgs boson, or even to the oldest known force field, gravity.  - In theoretical physics, quantum field theory (QFT) is the theoretical framework for constructing quantum mechanical models of subatomic particles in particle physics and quasiparticles in condensed matter physics. QFT treats particles as excited states of the underlying physical field, so these are called field quanta.  - Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a spontaneous process of symmetry breaking, by which a physical system in a symmetrical state ends up in an asymmetrical state. In particular, it can describe systems where the equations of motion or the Lagrangian obey symmetries, but the lowest-energy vacuum solutions do not exhibit that same symmetry.  - The Sapienza University of Rome, (Italian: Sapienza  Università di Roma), also called simply Sapienza or the \\"University of Rome\\", is a collegiate research university located in Rome, Italy. Formally known as Università degli Studi di Roma \\"La Sapienza\\", it is the largest European university by enrollments (the third if considering also the distance learning schools) and one of the oldest in history, founded in 1303. The University is also the most prestigious Italian university and also the best ranked in Southern Europe.  - In physics, symmetry breaking is a phenomenon in which (infinitesimally) small fluctuations acting on a system crossing a critical point decide the system's fate, by determining which branch of a bifurcation is taken. To an outside observer unaware of the fluctuations (or \\"noise\\"), the choice will appear arbitrary. This process is called symmetry \\"breaking\\", because such transitions usually bring the system from a symmetric but disorderly state into one or more definite states. Symmetry breaking is supposed to play a major role in pattern formation.  - In quantum mechanics, an excited state of a system (such as an atom, molecule or nucleus) is any quantum state of the system that has a higher energy than the ground state (that is, more energy than the absolute minimum). Excitation is an elevation in energy level above an arbitrary baseline energy state. In physics there is a specific technical definition for energy level which is often associated with an atom being raised to an excited state. The temperature of a group of particles is indicative of the level of excitation (with the notable exception of systems that exhibit negative temperature).  - Southern Europe is the southern region of the European continent. Most definitions of Southern Europe, also known as Mediterranean Europe, include the countries of the Iberian peninsula (Spain and Portugal), the Italian peninsula, Southern France, Greece and Malta. Other definitions sometimes include the Balkan countries of Southeast Europe, which are geographically technically in the southern part of Europe, but which have different historical, political, economic, and cultural backgrounds that commonly places them in the category of Eastern Europe.  - Condensed matter physics is a branch of physics that deals with the physical properties of condensed phases of matter, where particles adhere to each other. Condensed matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by using physical laws. In particular, they include the laws of quantum mechanics, electromagnetism and statistical mechanics.  - The Accademia dei Lincei (literally the \\"Academy of the Lynx-Eyed\\", but anglicised as the Lincean Academy) is an Italian science academy, located at the Palazzo Corsini on the Via della Lungara in Rome, Italy.  - In physics, quasiparticles and collective excitations (which are closely related) are emergent phenomena that occur when a microscopically complicated system such as a solid behaves \\"as if\\" it contained different weakly interacting particles in free space. For example, as an electron travels through a semiconductor, its motion is disturbed in a complex way by its interactions with all of the other electrons and nuclei; however it \\"approximately\\" behaves like an electron with a \\"different mass\\" (effective mass) traveling unperturbed through free space. This \\"electron\\" with a different mass is called an \\"electron quasiparticle\\". In another example, the aggregate motion of electrons in the valence band of a semiconductor is the same as if the semiconductor instead contained positively charged quasiparticles called holes. Other quasiparticles or collective excitations include phonons (particles derived from the vibrations of atoms in a solid), plasmons (particles derived from plasma oscillations), and many others.  - Giovanni Jona - Lasinio ( born 1932 ) , sometimes called Gianni Jona , is an Italian theoretical physicist , best known for his works on quantum field theory and statistical mechanics .

Write an article based on this summary: – The family of a 24-year-old woman from Dubai is being called \\"courageous\\" and \\"pioneers\\" because they had the foresight to freeze one of her ovaries when she was just 9 years old, the Washington Post reports. According to the BBC, Moaza al Matrooshi was born with a potentially fatal blood disorder and needed chemotherapy, which can permanently damage ovaries. Before chemo, her family made the bold decision to remove Matrooshi's right ovary and freeze it—three years before frozen ovarian tissue would be successfully used in a birth. But on Tuesday Matrooshi gave birth to a healthy baby boy. She's believed to be the first person in the world to give birth using ovarian tissue frozen before puberty. Last year, doctors attached four pieces of Matrooshi's frozen right ovary to her nonworking left ovary and another piece to her uterus. Within three months, Matrooshi—who had been going through menopause—was having regular periods. Her fertility returned, as well. She describes the birth of her son as \\"like a miracle.\\" \\"I always believed that I would be a mum,\\" she says. \\"I didn't stop hoping.\\" Her doctor, Sara Matthews, says the birth is a \\"huge step forward\\" that will give girls facing cancer or other disorders hope that they'll still be able to start a family. \\"We've never known if we could take tissue from a child, freeze it, and make it work again,\\" Matthews says.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a new situation: Keith is a zoologist. He studies large predators. Last year, he was studying different species of lions. First, he visited the Gir forest in India. There he found the Asiatic Lions. Unfortunately, only few Asiatic Lions are left in the wild, and they have to mate with their close relatives. He then visited the Serengeti reserve in Tanzania. There he found that the African Lions were not forced to mate with close relatives due to their large number.  But I can use this background: During sexual reproduction, mating with a close relative (inbreeding) often leads to inbreeding depression. Inbreeding depression is considered to be largely due to expression of deleterious recessive mutations. The effects of inbreeding have been studied in many vertebrate species.  What is an answer for this question: Which lion species would be less prone to inbreeding, Asiatic or African? Answer:","output":"The African lion species would be less prone to inbreeding compared to the Asiatic lion species. This is mainly due to the differences in population sizes and habitat distribution of the two species. Let's explore these factors in more detail to understand how they contribute to the susceptibility of these lion species to inbreeding. 1. Population size: The population size of a species plays a critical role in determining its vulnerability to inbreeding. A larger population size increases the chances of finding genetically diverse mates, thus reducing the risk of inbreeding depression. The African lion (Panthera leo) is more abundant, with an estimated population of 23,000 to 39,000 individuals across Africa. On the other hand, the Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) has a much smaller population of around 674 individuals (as of the 2020 census) confined to the Gir Forest in India. Consequently, African lions are less susceptible to inbreeding due to their larger population size. 2. Habitat distribution: The distribution of a species across different habitats is another factor influencing its likelihood of inbreeding. African lions have a relatively wider habitat range, spanning across various parts of Africa, including the savannas, grasslands, and forests. This geographic distribution allows for greater genetic diversity within the species as they can potentially mate with individuals from different populations. Contrastingly, the Asiatic lions' habitat is limited to the Gir Forest National Park in India, which restricts their opportunity to interbreed with other populations. This limited habitat range forces them to mate with close relatives, leading to higher chances of inbreeding depression. 3. Conservation efforts: While both African and Asiatic lions face the threat of habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict, conservation efforts have been more successful in maintaining stable populations of African lions. In Tanzania's Serengeti National Park, for example, various protection measures, including anti-poaching patrols, have been implemented to ensure the survival of the African lion species. However, the Asiatic lion's highly restricted habitat and urgent need for conservation initiatives make them more prone to inbreeding. To summarize, the African lion species is less prone to inbreeding compared to the Asiatic lion species due to their larger population size, wide habitat distribution, and more successful conservation measures. In order to mitigate the risks of inbreeding depression in the Asiatic lion population, increased conservation efforts, habitat expansion, and even the possibility of translocation to establish new populations should be considered."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And I was wondering What does Aubrey need to do before this? Answer:","output":"Before sending text messages to remind the group about the meeting this afternoon, Aubrey likely needed to complete the following tasks: 1. Schedule the meeting: Aubrey had to either set up the meeting himself/herself or receive information about the meeting from someone else. This could involve choosing the date, time, location, and purpose of the meeting. 2. Determine the participants: Aubrey needed to decide or receive a list of the people who are expected to attend the meeting. This may include team members, colleagues, managers, or clients.  3. Create a contact list: In order to send text messages, Aubrey needed to have access to the contact information (e.g., phone numbers) of the participants. This could be done by collecting the contact details from previous communications or company records. 4. Draft the message content: Aubrey had to decide on the content of the reminder text messages. This would typically include the meeting's purpose, date, time, location, and any other relevant details or instructions. 5. Set up a texting platform: If Aubrey planned on sending the reminder messages to a large group simultaneously, he/she might have needed to set up a texting platform or use a mass texting service. There are various tools available for this purpose that can send SMS messages to multiple recipients at once. It's important to check the platform's compatibility with local carriers or any restrictions on recipients' locations to ensure proper delivery. 6. Plan when to send the reminders: Aubrey had to decide when the text reminders would be sent out based on the meeting schedule and participants' availability. Ideally, sending reminders should be timed so that they are delivered at a convenient moment for the recipients, while also giving them enough time to prepare for the meeting. Once these steps were completed, Aubrey could send out the text messages reminding the group about the afternoon meeting."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The condition in which people lose their power to understand or use words due to brain damage are called aphasia . A study conducted in Massachusetts, U.S., has clearly proved that aphasics make good lie detectors .  In the last 100 years, many doctors studying the brain have mentioned examples of this amazing power of patients suffering from aphasia. Recently, scientists conducted tests to see if all that was said about aphasics was true. They studied the powers of a mixed group of people. Some were normal; others were aphasic. And it was proved clearly that the normal volunteers still got fooled by words. The aphasics were far ahead of them in recognizing false speech. The results of the study were reported in the magazine Nature.  \`Fourteen years ago, famous American doctor, Dr. Oliver Sacks, wrote about his experiences with aphasic patients in a book.

Possible answers: worn out, bored, outgoing Answer:","output":"Quinn would likely feel worn out after playing badminton at the park with his friends. The primary reason for this conclusion is that badminton is a physically demanding sport that involves a great deal of running, jumping, and rapid changes of direction. The intensity of the game, coupled with the fact that he was playing alongside his friends, makes it even more likely that Quinn exerted a significant amount of physical effort during the activity. Playing sports with friends can add an element of friendly competition and excitement, which could lead Quinn to push himself a bit harder than he might during a solo workout. As a result, it seems reasonable to assume that the combination of physical exertion and social interaction would leave him feeling worn out and in need of a rest. Moreover, engaging in physical activity results in the release of endorphins, which can cause feelings of pleasure and satisfaction. Even though he might be physically tired, there is also a good chance that Quinn would feel happy and fulfilled after the match. It is less likely that Quinn would feel bored after playing badminton with his friends, as the sport itself requires focus, concentration, and quick-thinking to predict the opponent's next move. Additionally, the social aspect of playing with friends tends to make the experience more enjoyable and less monotonous. If Quinn found the activity boring, it is doubtful he would choose to participate in it with his friends in the first place. Regarding the possibility of Quinn feeling outgoing, we can assume that engaging in a social activity such as badminton with friends might contribute to a more outgoing demeanor. However, this would be more of a contextual characteristic, as an introverted individual may still participate in and enjoy group activities. It could potentially provide Quinn with a sense of camaraderie and shared purpose with his friends. Nevertheless, considering the specific context and circumstances provided, feeling worn out seems to be the more accurate and fitting description of how Quinn would feel after playing badminton at the park with his friends."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

He is generally remembered as a weak character dominated by his mother, Empress Dowager Lü, personally kind and generous but unable to escape the impact of her viciousness. He tried to protect Ruyi, Prince Yin of Zhao, his younger half-brother, from being murdered by Empress Dowager Lü, but failed. After that he indulged himself in drinking and women and died at a relatively young age. Empress Dowager Lü installed two of his sons, Liu Gong and Liu Hong (known collectively as Emperors Shao of Han), the sons of the Emperor's concubine(s) after he died without a designated heir. Emperor Hui's wife was Empress Zhang Yan, a niece of his by his sister Princess Yuan of Lu; their marriage was the result of insistence by Empress Dowager Lü and was a childless one.  - Lü Zhi (241180 BC), courtesy name Exu, commonly known as Empress Lü and Empress Dowager Lü, or formally Empress Gao of Han, was the empress consort of Emperor Gaozu, the founder and first ruler of the Han Dynasty. They had two known children, Liu Ying (later Emperor Hui of Han) and Princess Yuan of Lu. Lü Zhi was the first woman to assume the title Empress of China. After Emperor Gaozu's death, she was honoured as Empress Dowager and later as Grand Empress Dowager () during the short reigns of Emperor Hui and his successors Liu Gong (Emperor Qianshao) and Liu Hong (Emperor Houshao).  - Liu Ruyi ( simplified Chinese :  ; traditional Chinese :  ; pinyin : Li Rúyì , 208 BC -- 194 BC ) , also known as Prince Yin of Zhao (  , created 198 BC ) was the third son of Emperor Gao of Han and only son of Concubine Qi . In 200 BC , he was made Prince of Dai after Liu Xi was demoted for fleeing his Dai province from Xiongnu forces . In 198 BC , Ruyi replaced Zhang Ao as Prince of Zhao after Ao was falsely accused of conspiring rebellion . After Emperor Gao of Han fallen ill early in 195 BC , he discovered Empress Lü Zhi 's plot to kill Ruyi , and appointed Zhou Chang as prime minister for Zhao province to protect him from Lü . Emperor Gao died later the year and Emperor Hui of Han continued Prince of Zhao 's protection by halting multiple attempts from Empress Dowager Lü on Ruyi 's life . When Emperor Hui left for a winter hunting trip in 194 BC , Empress Dowager Lü had Ruyi killed .  - Zhang Yan (died 163 BC), known formally as Empress Xiaohui () was an empress during the Han Dynasty.

It also affects other living things that may rely on these fish for food. The image below shows a picture of a mine. Mining changes the Earths surface. This area may once have been a forest or a prairie. Think about how many plants and animals may once have lived here. Now it is a giant hole in the ground. Pollution is also a major factor in habitat loss and change.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? You will create a three column table in Excel, with the same three headings as above.  In cell A1, type in the heading “Value.” In cell B1, enter the heading “Deviation.\\" In cell C1, enter the heading “Deviation squared.” In the first column, you need to type in the values of your measurements. If the set is small, you can simply type them in by hand. If you have a large data set, you may need to copy and paste the data into the column. Excel has a function that will calculate the mean for you. In some vacant cell underneath your data table (it really doesn’t matter what cell you choose), enter the following:  =Average(A2:___) Do not actually type a blank space. Fill in that blank with the cell name of your last data point. For example, if you have 100 points of data, you will use the function:  =Average(A2:A101) This function includes data from A2 through A101 because the top row contains the headings of the columns.   When you press Enter or when you click away to any other cell on the table, the mean of your data values will automatically fill the cell that you just programmed. In the first empty cell in the “Deviation” column, you need to enter a function to calculate the difference between each data point and the mean. To do this, you need to use the cell name where the mean resides. Let’s assume for now that you used cell A104. The function for the error calculation, which you enter into cell B2, will be: =A2-A104.  The dollar signs are necessary to make sure that you lock in cell A104 for each calculation. In the third column, you can direct Excel to calculate the square that you need. In cell C2, enter the function =B2^2 After you have entered the functions in the top cell of each column, B2 and C2 respectively, you need to fill in the full table. You could retype the function in every line of the table, but this would take far too long. Use your mouse, highlight cells B2 and C2 together, and without letting go of the mouse button, drag down to the bottom cell of each column.  If we are assuming that you have 100 data points in your table, you will drag your mouse down to cells B101 and C101. When you then release the mouse button, the formulas will be copied into all the cells of the table. The table should be automatically populated with the calculated values. Column C of your table contains all the square-error values. The final step is to have Excel calculate the sum of these values.  In a cell below the table, probably C102 for this example, enter the function: =Sum(C2:C101)  When you click Enter or click away into any other cell of the table, you should have the SSE value for your data.

Summarize the following: \\" That person behind you in line at the ATM or the supermarket may just be another shopper, or they could be paying close attention to you in hopes of seeing your account balance or PIN. Shade the monitor area with your hand when typing in your PIN and block others’ view of the screen. Do this even when no one is around. Some thieves use binoculars or install cameras so they can watch you from far away. There typically is a lot of identifying information in your wallet or purse. If stolen, the person can use that information to steal your identity. For your protection and to help prevent identity theft, leave anything at home that you aren't planning on using.  Don't keep all your credit cards in your wallet. Keep them in a safe or other secure location in your home, and only take with you the card you're going to use. Write \\"SEE ID\\" in your signature block on the back of the card rather than signing it. You also can secure credit cards by changing them to a PIN-only option, if possible. Avoid carrying blank checks, or any identification other than what you need. For example, you should carry your driver's license if you're driving, but you won't need your passport if you're in your home country. Thieves can access your social security number if you have your social security card in your purse or bag. Consider leaving it stored in a locked storage location and only bring it on trips where it will be needed. Even in relatively safe areas, pickpockets or purse snatchers look for easy opportunities. You can keep what information you are carrying secure by always keeping your wallet or purse close to your person and within your line of sight.  Go for a cross-body bag, rather than one you merely dangle from one shoulder. Avoid allowing the bag to hang behind you, as someone could reach in without you even knowing. If you carry a wallet, consider attaching it to your body with a chain or bungee cord. Don't just stick it into your back pocket as someone could easily pull it out. Never leave your wallet or purse unattended, such as at a restaurant or grocery store. If you're out and about, it can be convenient to take advantage of the free public Wi-Fi available at many cafés, libraries, and public parks. However, if these networks are open to all, they come with risks.  Even if the network requires a password, you should still consider that network open if the password is available to anyone. Avoid doing any banking or transmitting any sensitive personal information when using these networks. Doing so provides an opportunity for hackers to access whatever information you have stored on your hard drive. Ideally, if you want to get cash with your debit card, you should use an ATM located inside a bank branch – even if you have to go a little out of your way. Private ATM machines, particularly those outdoors, present a tremendous risk.  Look for security cameras, and inspect the machine carefully for signs of tampering before you use it. Avoid ATMs located in out-of-the-way places.Stay away from poorly-lit ATMs at night. These not only put you at risk of identity theft, but also put you at risk of being assaulted or mugged. ATM skimming occurs when thieves put a device over top of an ATM card reader that steals the information from the card when you swipe. These skimming devices also can be found on unattended point-of-service card readers, such as those on gas pumps. Look carefully for signs of tampering. Many gas pumps, for example, have a tampering seal. Do not use the card reader if the seal has been broken, and alert store staff immediately. Summary:","output":"Be cautious of your surroundings when using ATMs or in public spaces, as thieves may be watching you or using technology to obtain your information. Protect your PIN and account balance by blocking the view of screens, and avoid carrying unnecessary personal items that could be used for identity theft. Store credit cards and sensitive documents securely at home and only carry essential identification. Use cross-body bags for better security and avoid leaving belongings unattended. Be cautious when using public Wi-Fi networks, as they pose risks to your personal information. Choose secure, well-lit ATMs, preferably within bank branches, and be vigilant for signs of tampering on card readers to minimize the risk of identity theft and physical harm."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is an article: New homes being built in California. Spending on building houses has helped boost the US economy. Photograph: Ruaridh Stewart/ZUMA Press/Corbis A surge in activity across the US services sector in July fuelled by spending on new homes put the economy on track for a strong second half of 2014, according to a business survey. Businesses recorded growth rates only slightly below the previous month's record as the US continued to rebound from freezing weather in the spring that sent the economy's recovery into reverse. But the Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) contained warning signs that the 4% annualised GDP growth in the second quarter was unlikely to be maintained after service sector businesses reported a fall in confidence and a slowdown in job creation. Meanwhile analysts also said a fall in service sector activity growth in China last month to a record low would dent confidence in the global economy's growth prospects and its ability to maintain recent rises in output during the second half of this year. Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist said the summer months could represent a peak in the rate of growth. \\"The surveys indicate that the rate of job creation has waned, as have inflows of new business. Business confidence has also fallen to the lowest since late 2012 as companies have noted greater economic uncertainty and mounting risk aversion.\\" The US economy suffered in the spring after the country was blanketed in freezing snow, closing factories and cutting transport links. The bounce was rapid and revealed all major sectors recovered most of the lost output. Policymakers at the Federal Reserve have hinted at an early rate rise should the momentum continue into the latter half of the year, but appear to be vindicated in their warnings that it is unlikely while the recovery remains bumpy. China, the world's second largest economy, saw its services sector slow sharply in July to its lowest level in nearly nine years. The HSBC/Markit China services PMI fell to 50 in July, the lowest reading since data collection began in November 2005, indicating a recovery in the broader economy is still fragile and may need further government support. A reading above 50 indicates growth while a fall to 50 shows the sector stagnated in July. Services, which account for about 46% of GDP and roughly half of all jobs in the country, have been one of the few bright spots in China's economy this year. Analysts said the sudden signs of weakness raised the question of whether Beijing will need to do more to shore up growth as well as consumer and business confidence. Qu Hongbin, HSBC's chief economist in China, said: \\"The weakness in the headline number likely reflects the impact of the ongoing property slowdown in many cities as property related activity such as agencies and residential services see less business.\\" He added: \\"Today's data points to the need of continued policy support to offset the drag from the property correction and consolidate the economic recovery.\\" China's main stock markets fell on the news. The Shanghai Composite Index ended down 0.2% at 2,220. The CSI300 of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings lost 0.3%. Some economists blamed a slowdown in the housing market for the weak reading, as property-related activities saw less business. China Vanke, the country's biggest residential property developer, lost 2.1% of its value after posting July sales which showed a big drop from June. Poly Real Estate also slid 1.7%. China's manufacturing sector has continued to expand after contracting last year, but with government support that has yet to reach the services sector.

Ed Miliband tried to end Labour’s disastrous ‘elitism’ row yesterday by insisting he admires the working classes.

The reference to feeling 'respect' on seeing a white van is a nod to the many laborers and tradespeople who use such vehicles for their work. As such, the van is an emblem of the working class – people who work hard, but may not fit into the more polished image often associated with the middle and upper classes. In the context of Emily Thornberry's resignation, it can be inferred that Mr. Miliband was attempting to signal that her tweet was not an accurate reflection of Labour's stance or attitude. By supporting her resignation, he was demonstrating that the party does not condone or support such insensitivity towards the values of the working-class. Ukip's poll victory over the Tories laid bare the growing disaffection among a slice of the population that felt ignored or undervalued by the major political parties. Labour, traditionally the party of the working class, appeared to be losing ground to Ukip among these voters. Being 'furious' over Miss Thornberry's tweet can be viewed as a manifestation of his concern over the potential damage such incidents can do to Labour's relationship with the working class. The scandal reinforced the 'elitism' stereotype the party was battling against - the perception that Labour no longer understood or represented working-class values. In this light, Mr. Miliband's public assertion of admiration for the working class was an essential part of his strategy to reconnect Labour with its traditional voter base. This incidence underscored the need for the party to demonstrate its commitment to the principles of fair representation and equal respect for all layers of society, regardless of class, race, or profession. Leaving his house on Gospel Oak, North London with a grin, perhaps demonstrated his determination to weather this storm, not be bogged down by such setbacks and present an image of resilience that is so needed in political leadership. Meanwhile, it may also have been aimed at diminishing the gravity of the incident in public perception – an attempt to show business as usual despite the controversy clouding his party. In summary, Mr. Miliband’s actions and statements following the debacle aimed to re-establish Labour's reputation as a party that understands, respects, and seeks to represent the interests of the working class, thereby damage controlling the 'elitism' row that threatened to alienate a significant sector of their electorate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Stooges are wannabe detectives who inadvertently get their chance to crack a case in Scotland. They manage to stumble on a lead concerning the priceless Punjab diamond being stolen by a crook named Dapper. With dreams of becoming genuine detectives, the trio head for Squid McGuffy's cafe asking for the whereabouts of Dapper. They manage to convince everyone at the restaurant that they are actually police.

Under 100 words is a good title length. Input: The concept of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) was first reported in 1985. Since then, MALDI MS technologies have been evolving, and successfully used in genome, proteome, metabolome, and clinical diagnostic research. These technologies are highthroughput and sensitive. Emerging evidence has shown that they are not only useful in qualitative and quantitative analyses of proteins, but also of other types of biomolecules, such as DNA, glycans, and metabolites. Recently, parallel fragmentation monitoring (PFM), which is a method comparable to selected reaction monitoring, has been reported. This highlights the potentials of MALDI-TOF/ TOF tandem MS in quantification of metabolites. Here we critically review the applications of the major MALDI MS technologies, including MALDI-TOF MS, MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, SALDI-TOF MS, MALDI-QqQ MS, and SELDI-TOF MS, to the discovery and quantification of disease biomarkers in biological specimens, especially those in plasma/serum specimens. Using SELDI-TOF MS as an example, the presence of systemic bias in biomarker discovery studies employing MALDI-TOF MS and its possible solutions are also discussed in this chapter. The concepts of MALDI, SALDI, SELDI, and PFM are complementary to each other. Theoretically, all these technologies can be combined, leading to the next generation of the MALDI MS technologies. Real applications of MALDI MS technologies in clinical diagnostics should be forthcoming.

Climatologist Michael Mann has sued two organizations that have accused him of improperly manipulating data      Michael Mann, an influential climatologist who has spent years in the center of the debate over climate science, has sued two organizations that have accused him of academic fraud and of improperly manipulating data.      Mann, director of Pennsylvania State University's Earth System Science Center, on Monday sued the National Review and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, along with two of their authors, Rand Simberg and Mark Steyn.      The lawsuit, Mann's lawyer said in a statement, was based upon their \\"false and defamatory statements\\" accusing him of academic fraud and comparing him to a convicted child molester, former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky.      Neither Mann nor his lawyer, John B. Williams of the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Cozen O'Connor, were available for comment Tuesday afternoon. But on Facebook, where news of the lawsuit was initially posted Tuesday, Mann said the lawsuit was part of \\"a battle\\" to assist climate scientists in the fight against those who attack their work.      \\"There is a larger context for this latest development,\\" he wrote, \\"namely the onslaught of dishonest and libelous attacks that climate scientists have endured for years by dishonest front groups seeking to discredit the case for concern over climate change.\\"      But he faces a high bar: Mann has played a key role in climate science for decades, and the law generally requires a much higher burden of proof from public figures, said CEI general counsel Sam Kazman.      \\"I don't think he's got a shot at reaching it,\\" Kazman said in an interview. \\"Our stuff may have been debatable, but it was solidly based and we had a perfect right to say what we did.\\"      \\"We plan to defend the suit vigorously but we think it is a totally unfounded lawsuit.\\"      In 1999 Mann published a timeline of global temperatures stretching back almost 1,000 years. The graph showed a fairly stable trend until 1900, when temperatures spiked sharply upward. That so-called \\"hockey stick\\" diagram became a lightning rod in the debate on whether humans were influencing the climate.      In 2007 he shared the Nobel Peace Prize with former Vice President Al Gore and authors of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report for work connecting human activities to global warming.      500,000 and two years      Two years later a cache of emails illegally obtained from University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom purported to show climate scientists manipulating data. Many of the emails were to or from Michael Mann.      Upwards of seven organizations, from the National Science Foundation to Penn State, conducted investigations into Mann's work. All declared baseless allegations of academic fraud.      Yet the attacks persisted: Virginia Attorney General spent 500,000 and two years unsuccessfully suing to obtain email correspondence from the University of Virginia, where Mann worked from 1999 to 2005. ||||| Michael Mann, a scientist at the centre of the \\"climate wars\\", has sued a rightwing thinktank and a magazine for comparing him to the convicted sex offender and disgraced football coach Jerry Sandusky and accusing him of academic fraud.      Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, announced the defamation lawsuit against the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) and the National Review in a posting on his Facebook page on Tuesday.      The 37-page complaint arises from blog posts published last July, and accuses National Review and CEI of recycling \\"false and defamatory statements\\" about Mann's research.      Mann, the author of the iconic hockey stick graph showing a sharp uptick in global temperatures after 1900, has come under repeated attack from climate contrarians.      He has been cleared of academic wrongdoing by seven separate investigations, but the attacks have persisted – culminating in last July's blogs which likened Mann to Sandusky.      A post on the CEI blog referred to Mann as \\"the other scandal\\" at Penn State and accused the scientist of \\"molesting data\\" about climate change. The sentences likening Mann to Sandusky were later removed.      National Review later picked up the post, although the writer added a minor caveat.      \\"Despite their knowledge of the results of these many investigations, the defendants have nevertheless accused Dr Mann of academic fraud and have maliciously attacked his personal reputation with the knowingly false comparison to a child molester. The conduct of the defendants is outrageous, and Dr Mann will be seeking judgement for both compensatory and punitive damages,\\" Mann's Facebook page said.      Mann said the lawsuit was part of a larger effort by scientists to push back against the attacks on climate science.      Another new front was opened up in that broader fight, with the release of a report by climate contrarians intended to undermine an authoritative US government study on the effects of climate change.      The Daily Climate reported that another rightwing thinktank in Washington, the Cato Institute, planned to put out its own version of a landmark US government climate science report – aimed at discrediting mainstream climate science.      The Cato report appears almost identical to a 2009 study detailing the effects of climate change on the US. The Cato version, however, was assembled by climate contrarians and concludes that the impacts of climate change would have \\"little national significance\\" in the US. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Michael Mann, a climate scientist, has sued two organizations, the National Review and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, and their authors, Rand Simberg and Mark Steyn, for making false and defamatory statements about him.

San Francisco photographer Helena Price has become an overnight viral sensation among Brazilian Twitter users - and all thanks to her name. Since Monday, Price, 26, has been inundated with thousands of tweets from fans of the new Brazilian soap opera Em Familia, which features a character named Helena. In the series premiere Monday, the troubled Helena nearly drowned, undressed in front of her uncle and fell in love with her cousin. It girl: San Francisco photographer Helena Price, 26, landed on the cover of a Brazilian magazine after she was mistakenly associated with a character from a new soap opera also named Helena. Early adopters of the new show immediately took to Twitter to share their thoughts of Em Familia, and that is how many of them stumbled upon Price’s handle, @Helena, San Francisco Chronicle reported. Price, who is blonde and has Nordic feautres, is not an actress and looks nothing like her fiery brunette namesake on the show, but that did not stop thousands of strangers from tweeting at her. The photographer, a North Carolina native, was initially blindsided by all this unsolicited attention, but quickly embraced it and decided to enjoy her 15 minutes of cyber-fame. To set things straight, the 26-year-old Bay Area resident clarified on her Twitter page exactly who she was, writing: 'Tall, pale, and half-Norwegian. Full-time photographer who occasionally dabbles in tech. Not the actress, DJ, Brazilian soap opera star, or state capital.' But the tweets kept pouring in and Price, who does not speak Portuguese, began responding to the best of her ability. No resemblance: The blonde, part-Norwegian Price looks nothing like either Bruna Marquezine (left), who plays the young Helena, or Julia Lemmertz (right), who portrays the character later in life. Fifteen minutes of fame: Brazilian news media breathlessly wrote about the American woman who has won over the hearts of local soap opera fans. When one soap opera fan wrote to her that in the first episode Helena made a blood pact with her boyfriend (who is also her cousin), and then nearly drowned while swimming, Miss Price wrote a dead-pan response: 'I do not remember this.' Before long, the full-time photographer, who only last year ditched her previous career in Silicon Valley, turned into an Internet phenomenon. 'Omg i think I've become a meme,' a stunned Price shared with her skyrocketing number of followers. In one picture, Price’s head was digitally inserted into the opening credits of Em Familia. In another, the blonde beauty was Photoshopped into an image of a scantily clad Samba dancer. In an email to MailOnline Thursday, Miss Price said she does not expect the hullabaloo over Helena to die down in the near future. 'A few thousand Brazilians have let me know that the show is continuing for the next 8 months or so, so I don't think this will be over anytime soon,' Price wrote. Carrer change: Price worked in Silicon Valley's technology industry until last year, when she quit and reinvented herself as a professional photographer. New opportunity: Price hopes she would be able to travel to Brazil for a photo-shoot. Brazilian news media quickly caught on, breathlessly reporting about the American mystery woman who has won over the hearts of local soap opera fans, many of whom took to Twitter to profess their love for the real-life Helena. ‘I'm officially in Brazilian news for becoming a meme,’ Price wrote two days ago. ‘Life is funny.’ One. user inquired whom Helena would choose as a love interest in the show,. Virgilio or Laerte, while another begged her to pose naked for Brazilian. Playboy. Thereza Chammas gushed: 'Please come to Brazil for Carnival! You are our queen.' The photographer told MailOnline that her friends and family are baffled as to why she is getting all this attention online. 'It is still pretty hard to explain, but we all think it's pretty funny,' she wrote. Born to dance: The blonde beauty had her face digitally inserted into this picture of a Brazilian Samba dancer. Protagonist: With the help of Photoshop, Price made it into the opening credits of Em Familia. Adored: Soap opera fans on Twitter professed their love to Price, and some urged her to visit Brazil, where she has never been. ‘Still getting thousands and thousands and thousands of tweets. Brazil you are funny,’ Price tweeted. The San Francisco woman now boasts more than 21,000 followers on Twitter, many of them Brazilian. She said that she hopes one day to visit the country that has shown her so much love. 'Maybe all of this will translate into some photo work there someday,' Price said.

Reardon, a military man who hates the senior Wilder, wants to make the younger Wilder's life miserable. He can not force him out because his dad is rich and has ties to the school, so he tries to make Van's life a living hell. Van turns a one bedroom dorm into a two bedroom (by breaking down a wall). His roommate is Farley (Nestor Aaron Absera), a pothead from Jamaica. The boys decide to throw a party on campus, which is not allowed, along with kissing, drugs, alcohol, sex, or anything else that is 'fun'. The only person to show up to the party is Yu Dum Fok (Jerry Shea). The boys try to find the girls, but they just find some religious, prudish girls led by Eve (Meredith Giangrande). After she throws sacramental wine on them, Van pulls a prank on them during church. Reardon knows Van is behind the prank, so he commands his ROTC students, Dirk (Steve Talley) and his closeted sidekick Corporal Benedict (Nick Nicotera), on Van, trying to make him crack. Van falls for Dirk's girlfriend, Kaitlin (Kristin Cavallari), causing Dirk to get even more upset. Kaitlin thinks, lives, and breathes the military, and believes in chastity before marriage. Of course, Van has to shake things up. After playing a military game with Reardon that results in him stepping down as dean and being tasered, Van and Kaitlin end up together and Van decides to finish college. The film ends as Van leaves Dirk and Benedict tied to each other in their underwear. A:","output":"Van is initially supposed to be accompanied by his dad (Linden Ashby) on the trip to Amsterdam.

The trade-off theory of capital structure is the idea that a company chooses how much debt finance and how much equity finance to use by balancing the costs and benefits. The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger[1] who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt. Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal.[2]  An important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing.  Company X stopped taking on more debt, and decided to file for bankruptcy, while company Y, kept benefiting from the tax benefits of debt, having a lower debt level.  Which company fired more people, company X or company Y? The answer to this question is:","output":"It is not possible to definitively answer this question without more specific information about the financial situations and decisions of Company X and Company Y. However, based on the information provided, we can make some general observations. Company X has stopped taking on more debt and has decided to file for bankruptcy. This suggests that Company X has reached a point of financial distress, where the costs of taking on more debt outweigh the tax benefits. As a result of filing for bankruptcy, the company may undergo restructuring, cost-cutting measures, or even be liquidated. In these scenarios, it is highly likely that Company X will have to lay off some employees to reduce costs or because the company is no longer able to operate at its previous scale. On the other hand, Company Y continues to benefit from the tax advantages of debt without facing significant financial distress. This indicates that Company Y likely has a lower debt level and a more manageable debt-to-equity ratio. As a result, Company Y may not need to lay off as many employees as Company X, or it may not need to lay off any employees at all, depending on its overall financial health and performance. Although we cannot provide a specific number or percentage in terms of employee layoffs, it is reasonable to assume that Company X, which filed for bankruptcy, would likely have to let go of more employees than Company Y, which continues to experience the benefits of debt financing without extreme financial distress."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information:  - Techno is a form of electronic dance music that emerged in Detroit, Michigan, in the United States during the mid-to-late 1980s. The first recorded use of the word \\"techno\\" in reference to a specific genre of music was in 1988. Many styles of techno now exist, but Detroit techno is seen as the foundation upon which a number of subgenres have been built.  - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:  European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.  - Tech house is a subgenre of house music that mixes elements of techno with house. The term \\"tech house\\" developed as a shorthand record store name for a category of electronic dance music that combined musical aspects of techno, such as \\"rugged basslines\\" and \\"steely beats,\\" with the harmonies and grooves of progressive house. The music originally had a clean and minimal production style that was associated with techno from Detroit and the UK. In the mid to late 1990s a scene developed in England around club nights such as The Drop run by Mr.C & Plink Plonk, Heart & Soul, and Wiggle run by Terry Francis and Nathan Coles. Other DJs and artists associated with the sound at that time included Charles Webster, Bushwacka!, Cuartero, Dave Angel, Herbert, Funk D'Void, Ian O'Brien, Derrick Carter, and Stacey Pullen. By the late 90's London nightclub The End, owned by the former Shamen rapper Richard West (Mr C) and Layo Paskin, was considered the home of tech house in the UK. Tech house tracks are typically between 610 minutes in length.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - Trance is a genre of electronic music that developed during the 1990s in Germany. It is characterized by a tempo lying between 125 and 150 beats per minute (BPM), repeating melodic phrases, and a musical form that distinctly builds tension and elements throughout a track often culminating in 1 to 2 \\"peaks\\" or \\"drops.\\" Although trance is a genre of its own, it liberally incorporates influences from other musical styles such as techno, house, pop, chill-out, classical music, tech house, ambient, and film music.  - Matthias Paul, better known by his stage name Paul van Dyk (born 16 December 1971 in Eisenhüttenstadt, East Germany) is a German Grammy Award-winning DJ, record producer and musician. One of the first true superstar DJs, Paul van Dyk was the first artist to receive a Grammy Award nomination in the newly added category of Best Dance/Electronic album for his 2003 release \\"Reflections\\". He was named the World's number one DJ in both 2005 and 2006, something only few DJs have ever achieved. He was the first ever DJ to be named number one by \\"Mixmag\\" in 2005. By 2008, he had sold over 3 million albums worldwide.  - The Politics of Dancing 2 is an album of trance music mixed by Paul van Dyk as a sequel to his The Politics of Dancing .  - Mixmag is a British electronic dance and clubbing magazine, published in London, England. Launched in 1982, the magazine covers dance events, and reviews music and club nights.  - East Germany, formally the German Democratic Republic or GDR, was an Eastern Bloc state during the Cold War period. From 1949 to 1990, it administered the region of Germany that was occupied by Soviet forces at the end of World War IIthe Soviet Occupation Zone of the Potsdam Agreement, bounded on the east by the OderNeisse line. The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin, but did not include it; as a result, West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR. The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet Zone, while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones. East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948, and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949. Soviet forces, however, remained in the country throughout the Cold War. Until 1989, the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party (SED), though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation, the National Front of Democratic Germany.   - Eisenhüttenstadt (literally \\"ironworks city\\" in German) is a town in the Oder-Spree district of the state of Brandenburg, Germany, on the border with Poland.

Today, we're going to have a super fun time learning how to decorate a box all by ourselves. Decorating a box can be a great way to store our treasures or even to give a special gift to someone we care about. So, let's get started and get creative! First, we need to find or make a box that we want to decorate. A box can be a simple cardboard box, like the one our toys came in, or we can use a wooden box from a craft store. We can even reuse an old shoebox! Remember to ask a grown-up for help if we need to make a box or find one that's just perfect for decorating. Next, if our box has a lid, we need to take it off. This will make it easier for us to decorate our box and make it look really pretty. Just put the lid to the side so we don't lose it, because we'll need it later when we're all done decorating! Now, it's time to think about what color we want our box to be. If we want to paint the box as the background, we can use primer or paint. Primer is something that helps the paint stick to the box better, so our beautiful decorations will last a long time. But if we don't want to use paint, that's okay too! It's all about what we like and what makes us happy. To paint our box, we can use any color we want. Maybe we love pink and want a pink box, or maybe we want to use all the colors of the rainbow! Let's pick our favorite color and gently paint our box, making sure to cover all the sides. We should also ask a grown-up for help with this part if we need it. Don't forget to let the paint dry before moving on to the next step. With our box all painted and dry, we can finally start the best part - decorating! There are so many things we can do to make our box unique. We can draw, glue, or stick pictures and stickers on our box to give it a personal touch. We can also use glitter, ribbons, buttons, or any other fun things we find to make our box truly special. When we're finished decorating, all we need to do is put the lid back on our box and show off our amazing creation to our friends and family. They'll surely be impressed by the beautiful box we made all by ourselves! So now that we know how to decorate a box, we can create as many as we want and have lots of fun with our imagination! Remember, the most important part of this whole process is to enjoy ourselves and be proud of the masterpiece we created!

Article: NEW DELHI -- Two Muslim mothers in a northern Indian town have been arrested on accusations they killed their daughters for dishonoring the family by eloping with Hindu men, police said Sunday.      Newlyweds Zahida, 19, and Husna, 26, were strangled when they returned home after getting married to men of their choice, said Anil Kumar Kusan, a police officer.      Marriages between Hindus and Muslims are not common in India and are frowned upon by both communities, although there are more instances of inter-religious marriages among the educated urban population.      Across India, many marriages are still arranged by families. But with the booming economy and more women entering the work force, such traditions are slowly giving way to love marriages.      However, centuries-old caste and community barriers still come into play, and there has been a spurt in \\"honor killings\\" in recent years across northern India.      Zahida and Husna were neighbors in Baghpat, a town in India's Uttar Pradesh state, when they fell in love with two construction workers. They eloped and got married last week before returning home to make peace with their families, Kusan said.      The women belonged to Muslim families and their mothers, both widows, were furious, Kusan said.      Initial investigations showed that the mothers helped each other to strangle their daughters.      \\"We killed them because they brought shame to our community. How could they elope with Hindus? They deserved to die. We have no remorse,\\" Khatun, one of the mothers, was quoted as saying by the Indian Express newspaper after her arrest Friday. Khatun uses only one name.      Earlier this week, India's Supreme Court recommended the death penalty for honor killings, calling the practice barbaric and feudal.      Most victims of such killings are young adults who fall in love or marry against their families' wishes. In some cases, village councils order couples killed who marry outside their caste or religion.      While there are no official figures, an independent study found around 900 people are killed each year in India for defying their elders. ||||| Zahida and Husna sought police protection but SDM sent them home      Two Muslim women in an Uttar Pradesh town, 40 km east of Delhi, allegedly killed their daughters because they had eloped and married migrant Bihari Hindu labourers, police said.      The victims had sought police protection after they returned to their homes in Baghpat earlier this week, but the subdivisional magistrate sent them home to reconcile with their mothers.      On Wednesday night, Khatun and Subrato, both of whom are widows, allegedly tied their daughters, 19-year-old Zahida and 26-year-old Husna, to cots and threw a rope around their necks. They then held the girls down and tightened the noose until the victims suffocated to death, police said.      Khatun and Subrato have been arrested. A third woman called Momina, their neighbour in Baghpat’s Muslim-dominated Mughalpura area, who allegedly helped them commit the murders, is on the run. |||||Summary:","output":"In a northern Indian town, two Muslim mothers were arrested for allegedly killing their daughters after they eloped with Hindu men and returned home after getting married. The incident highlights the deep-rooted caste and community barriers that still persist in India, where inter-religious marriages, particularly between Hindus and Muslims, are not common and often frowned upon. Zahida, 19, and Husna, 26, residents of Baghpat, a town in Uttar Pradesh, fell in love with two construction workers and eloped with them, getting married last week. Upon returning home in an attempt to reconcile with their families, the women were reportedly strangled by their mothers, who believed that their daughters had brought shame upon the community.

The loss of these promising young individuals has sent shock waves around the world, prompting reflection on the importance of air travel safety and the need to prevent such disastrous incidents from occurring in the future. This article provides an in-depth analysis of the accident, its aftermath, and the impact it has had on the lives of all those affected. The Three Victims The three Chinese victims, Liu Yipeng, Ye Mengyuan, and Wang Linjia, all attended the same school in Zhejiang province, China. Liu Yipeng, 15, was taken to the intensive care unit (ICU) after sustaining severe head injuries but unfortunately passed away on Friday. His classmates, Ye Mengyuan and Wang Linjia, both 16, died on the day of the crash. The Accident and Its Aftermath While the cause of the accident is still under investigation, the emotional impact on the families and friends of the victims cannot be understated. The families of these young students have experienced unimaginable grief, and their loss has been felt by their entire school and the broader community. These students were undoubtedly individuals with promising futures, and the sudden end to their lives serves as a somber reminder of the importance of air travel safety. The tragedy also illustrates the need for the international community to work together to prevent such accidents from continuing to claim innocent lives. The School's Response and Impact on the Community The administration of the school in Zhejiang province has made it a priority to support the families and friends of Liu Yipeng, Ye Mengyuan, and Wang Linjia as they navigate through this challenging time. While nothing can replace the loss of these three brilliant young lives, the school has taken steps to ensure all those affected receive the emotional and mental support they need to heal and move forward. The school has organized memorial services for the students, providing an opportunity for the community to come together and honor their lives. These events have helped the community process their grief collectively and provided them with a platform to share their fondest memories of the students. Furthermore, the school has implemented support mechanisms such as counseling services for anyone affected by the tragedy, acknowledging that healing is a process that requires time and support. The Global Impact and Reaction The news of the tragic accident involving Liu Yipeng, Ye Mengyuan, and Wang Linjia has garnered attention from people worldwide, illustrating that the impact of such tragic events reaches far beyond the immediate community. Many individuals and organizations have taken to social media to express their condolences and share their grief. Vigils have also been held in multiple countries to honor their memory. In a broader context, the tragedy has served as a reminder to countries around the world of the importance of air travel safety. Many nations have renewed their commitment to ensuring that all safety measures are in place to prevent a similar tragedy from occurring again. This serves as a fitting tribute to the lives of these three young individuals, whose untimely demise should never be forgotten. Conclusion The loss of Liu Yipeng, Ye Mengyuan, and Wang Linjia has left a profound emotional impact on their families, friends, school, and the international community. While it is impossible to replace these bright young lives, it is essential to honor their memory by working together to prevent such tragic accidents from reoccurring.

The tone appears to be neutral or slightly positive, as the person shows interest in trying the suggested item or activity. Step 3: Identify any emotional indicators. There are no strong emotional words in the tweet, but the user does use the letter \\"x\\" at the end, which could be interpreted as a friendly and positive gesture. Step 4: Determine the sentiment. Based on the analysis, the sentiment of the tweet can be described as \\"neutral\\" with a slight lean towards \\"positive\\" due to the presence of the \\"x\\" symbol and the user expressing interest in trying the recommended item/activity."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer. Q: Combine the given two facts to write a concluding fact. Note that there should be some parts of the first and second facts that are not mentioned in this conclusion fact. Your combined fact should be the result of a chain between the two facts. Chains form when two facts connect together to produce a concluding fact. An example of a chain is: \\"pesticides cause pollution\\" (fact1) + \\"pollution can harm animals\\" (fact2) → \\"pesticides can harm animals\\" (conclusion fact). Parts of the concluding fact overlap with the first and the second fact. To construct such a  concluding fact, a useful way is to borrow the subject from one fact and the ending conclusions from another fact. Fact 1: when metal conducts heat , that metal expands.  Fact 2: Steel is a solution of metals. A:","output":"When steel conducts heat, it expands. In this conclusion, I used the subject \\"steel\\" from Fact 2 and the action \\"conducts heat\\" and the ending conclusion \\"expands\\" from Fact 1. Since steel is a solution of metals, it exhibits the properties of metals, such as conducting heat and expanding.

Write some highlights for the following article: Leisure time: Shaun Clemens-Cooney, who was behind a £300,000 cannabis factory in Blackburn. A builder converted a newly-built house into a £300,000 cannabis factory - after council planners told him he could only use it as a 'leisure facility.' Shaun Clemens-Cooney, 43, wanted to build the three-bedroomed detached home at the back of his own £200,000 semi-detached house in Blackburn - but had been refused planning permission three times. Finally, inspectors agreed he could build the property - but only after he promised he would only use the upper floors for 'leisure purposes', including a playroom for a billiard table and another for a model railway. Yet after construction boss Clemens-Cooney finished his project, police received a tip-off about the nature of the property's 'leisure facilities.' During a raid in May last year officers opened the roller shutters of the double garage - and were faced with a plaster board wall behind which they could hear fans whirring away. They then discovered 600 marijuana plant, being grown in 3,000 pots across all the three floors of the property. They also found a sophisticated hydroponic irrigation system complete with extraction ducts and discovered Clemens-Cooney had also rigged the electricity supply at his own home to steal £20,000 worth of power to supply light, water and air filtration. Today Clemens-Cooney, from Blackburn, Lancashire, is starting three years in jail after he was convicted of producing cannabis following a 12-day trial. Boarded up: Clemens-Cooney blacked out the windows and boarded up the doors to keep his facilities secret. One of his tenants Morgan Redmayne, 44, of Darwen was jailed for two and a half years for cannabis production. After the case a neighbour, who asked not be named, said: 'Council planners may have told Shaun he could only use the property for leisure purposes but obviously his idea of leisure purposes was far from their minds when they let him build it. Also jailed: Tenant Morgan Redmayne must serve two and a half years. 'The reality was Shaun was pretty cross with the council when it refused him permission and we wouldn't be surprised if he finished the building off with a view to using it as a custom-built cannabis farm. 'He had already started building the house when he was found out, and ordered to submit planning permission but the dispute went on for years and must have cost him a considerable a fortune. 'Maybe he thought growing cannabis was a way of getting back some of his money.' Clemens-Cooney who is company secretary of Millbrooke Construction in Darwen and owns up to seven properties hit trouble in February 2007, when he was caught trying to build an eighth house on half an acre of land behind his family home without the right permissions. Over a two year period officials at Blackburn with Darwen Council repeatedly refused planning permission for the property saying it would have a 'dominant, overbearing impact to neighbouring dwellings, to the detriment of residential amenity.' A report said the proposal would be 'out of character with adjacent properties and the surrounding area in general.' But in January 2010 Clemens-Cooney. applied again this time saying the detached property would now be a. double garage and games room and offered drawings showing a 'playroom' and 'model railway room' as well as office space and a utility room. The. following the March officials said they would only grant permission for. the property to be completed on condition it would not be used as. 'habitable accommodation.' He later completed the house and even showed. it off on his company website. Another neighbour said: 'The property was built about three years ago, and it is quite an eyesore and nobody likes it. 'But. we had no indication that it was a cannabis farm, we never smelt. anything and you couldn't tell it was lit up because the windows were. whitewashed.' Out of character: The 'cannabis house' was hidden behind Clemens-Cooney's own house. What officers might have expected to find: Clemens-Cooney told planning officers the upstairs would be used for projects such as a model railway. The neighbour added: 'There was nothing suspicious about it either, no suspicion coming and goings and I kept a pretty good eye on it. I wouldn't say I was shocked when I found out what was going on - more surprised I'd say - but not surprised when I found out it was him. 'There were two fake garage doors at the front and behind that was a breeze block. The windows on the front were all white washed so you could never see in. It took about two days for the police to bring out all the plants. 'We were told there were 600 cannabis plants but there must have been about 3,000 plant pots which in the end were given to the local garden centre. 'The plants were between 6ft and 9ft high and had been being cropped. He must have had a lot of heaters in there too. 'He must have put ducts in there that took out the smell so we could never smell anything because it went out the other way. Even when we were sat out in summer we couldn't smell anything. 'Mr Clemens-Cooney is a well known man around here because of his building background and he owns a lot of houses. 'I always saw him in his overalls and driving a van. He's a real Del Boy.' Clemens-Cooney's Millbrooke Construction company showcased the house as a residential new build. Last September Clemens-Cooney was caught in a row after claims electricity powering seven houses he built were illegally connected. He and Redmayne both denied drugs charges at Preston Crown Court. A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: 'In his back garden, Clemens-Cooney had built a three-bedroom property, albeit the planning permission was limited to a storage structure. 'When the police conducted a raid at the property, they found that it was being used as a cannabis factory, with lights and fans and extraction ducting. 'The electricity for the property was being abstracted from Clemens-Cooney's own house, with a cable running from his house and underground to the property in the rear garden.' Det Insp Mark Winstanley from Lancashire Police said: 'This was a very large and significant cannabis set-up and I hope this result will reduce the supply of drugs in the local area. 'Cannabis brings upset and misery to our communities and we are determined to work with local residents to tackle the issue. I urge local residents to contact us with any information or concerns about cannabis in their community.' Highlights:","output":"1.

An annual footrace named the Gate River Run accepts 18,000 participants who travel a course along and over the river twice. The largest kingfishing tournament in the U.S. is held on a St. Johns tributary, where sport fishers concentrate on king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla), cobia (Rachycentron canadum), dolphin (Coryphaena hippurus) and Wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri). The home stadium for the Jacksonville Jaguars faces the river, as does most of the commercial center of downtown. Seven bridges span the St. Johns at Jacksonville; all of them allow tall ships to pass, although some restrict passing times when train or automobile traffic is heavy.Tides cause seawater to enter the mouth of the St. Johns River and can affect the river's level into the middle basin. As a result, much of the river in Jacksonville is part seawater, making it an estuarine ecosystem. The animals and plants in these systems can tolerate both fresh and salt water, and the fluctuations in saline content and temperatures associated with tidal surges and heavy rainfall discharge. Marine animals such as dolphins and sharks can be spotted at times in the St. Johns at Jacksonville as can manatees. Fish such as mullet (Mullidae), flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma), shad (Alosa sapidissima), and blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) migrate from the ocean to freshwater springs upriver to spawn.Although freshwater invertebrates inhabiting and comprising algae and periphyton make the foundation of food webs in the middle and lower basin, zooplankton and phytoplankton take that role in the estuarine habitat. Mollusks gather at the St. Johns estuary in large numbers, feeding on the bottom of the river and ocean floors. The abundance and importance of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) is apparent in the many middens left by the Timucua in mounds many feet high.

They were the first pictures of the former South African president since he left hospital on 6 April after more than a week of treatment for pneumonia. Looking dazed, he is seen surrounded by ANC leaders and well-wishers. An ANC spokesman said the party was happy to share the 94 year old with \\"the world, even in his frail state\\". The rare video footage of Mr Mandela, popularly known by his clan name \\"Madiba\\", was broadcast by South African public broadcaster, SABC. The vast majority of Twitter reaction to the footage of Nelson Mandela has been hostile. \\"After everything the man has done for us this is how we treat him. Like an animal at the zoo. Shame on us. #mandela,\\" wrote Marius van der Walt. Nosipho Dhladhla tweeted: \\"Part of #ANC campaign for next elections. Using an old man as a puppet.

He is 94 for goodness sake.\\" The response from Simmi Areff was more tongue-in-cheek: \\"Everybody needs to calm down about the #Mandela photo shoot. The ANC needed a new Facebook Cover Photo.\\" A minority of Twitter users defended the footage. \\"Dear whites plz chill..#Mandela is supposed to look like that..He is 94 ,U are the ones that wasted his time by jailing him for 27 years,\\" said Shibe Serakalala. Lwazi Mlaba also disagreed with much of Twitter outrage: \\"The #Zuma #Mandela visit is the least distasteful recording I've seen in 10 years... The media is angry they didn't get the scoop!\\" Compiled by BBC Monitoring The BBC's Milton Nkosi in Johannesburg says there has been an outcry on social media - especially Twitter, where the topic is trending - about the broadcast of the video. Many see it as exploitative and an invasion of the former president's privacy, our correspondent adds. In the images, Mr Mandela is seen unsmiling, seated upright on a sofa with his legs covered in a blanket as people take photographs of him using flashes. Patrick Conroy, the head of news at South Africa's privately owned television channel eNCA, accused the ANC of applying double standards. \\"The media has been repeatedly lectured by the #ANC and SA govt about respecting #Madiba's privacy and dignity. Now we know how they treat him,\\" he wrote on Twitter. President Jacob Zuma and ANC Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa were among the senior ANC officials who called in on Mr Mandela at his home in Johannesburg on Monday and were given an update by his medical team. The president said Mr Mandela \\"shook hands and even smiled\\". \\"Those who are complaining that Madiba's latest images was a publicity stunt by the [ANC] are eating sour grapes,\\" the South African news agency, Sapa, quoted ANC spokesman Jackson Mthembu as saying. \\"Our people have not seen Madiba in many years. Now they have seen him open and close his eyes... We are happy with his health. He is no longer a young man,\\" he added. By Milton NkosiBBC News, Johannesburg Nelson Mandela appeared frail but better than many feared. From what I could see from SABC's exclusive video, I noticed that Mr Mandela flinched as one of his grandsons took a photograph and a bright flash went off. It has been many years now since photographers were requested not to use flashes when taking pictures of the 94 year old. Mr Mandela's eyes were damaged when he worked in a lime quarry while a political prisoner on Robben Island. There are probably two reasons why President Zuma paid his old comrade and mentor a home visit.  He wanted to prove the sceptics wrong. He was dispelling the myth that the former president was in bed on a life support machine, as many had speculated on social media. Some cynics say it was pure electioneering. They say that President Zuma posed for pictures next to Mr Mandela and that he went to seek blessings from the governing ANC's most famous member with an eye on next year's crucial elections. Mr Mandela's health has been a continuing cause for concern recently. The veteran leader's lung problems date from his 27 years as a political prisoner. Eighteen years were spent on the windswept Robben Island, where he contracted tuberculosis. In December, he spent more than two weeks in hospital undergoing treatment for his lung ailment and gallstones. In February, doctors dealt with a stomach condition. Mr Mandela, who stepped down as president in 1999, is revered in South Africa for his role in ending the system of apartheid, or white minority rule. He retired from public life in 2004 after acting as a high-profile ambassador for the country. Mr Mandela became South Africa's first black president in the 1990s and is seen by many as father of the nation. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 jointly with former President FW de Klerk for ending apartheid and bringing democracy to South Africa.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Would you stay in a chic and well design hostel if it is a little far away from popular area? Should I stay away from her? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. They address different topics and have distinct implications. Let's analyze each question separately. The first question asks: \\"Would you stay in a chic and well-designed hostel if it is a little far away from the popular area?\\" This inquiry is about making a decision in the context of travel and accommodation. It raises consideration for the trade-off between the quality of the lodging (a chic and well-designed hostel) and its location (being somewhat distant from popular areas). In providing a detailed answer, numerous factors would need to be considered when deciding whether to stay in such a hostel.  For instance, the traveler's personal preferences, budget, and priorities would play a significant role. Some individuals may prioritize a comfortable and stylish environment, making the chic, well-designed hostel an excellent choice despite its distance from popular areas. Others may be more concerned with convenience in terms of accessing popular attractions, restaurants, or public transportation, and would therefore potentially forgo the attractive hostel in search of a more centrally located option. Additionally, the frequency of public transportation, taxi or ride-sharing availability, and the general safety of the neighborhood would also be factors to consider. If the hostel is easily accessible and the area is considered safe, it may be worth staying in the chic, well-designed hostel. Prioritizing personal desires, such as accommodation quality, convenience, and cost would, in the end, dictate whether or not to stay at the hostel. The second question asks: \\"Should I stay away from her?\\" In contrast, this question isn't related to travel or accommodation. It pertains to interpersonal relationships and emotional matters. A variety of potential reasons could exist for staying away from someone – personal conflicts, differences in values or opinions, emotional distress, or other factors threatening the well-being of the individuals involved.  To provide a detailed answer, it would be essential to understand the context and underlying reasons for such a question. If the relationship is causing stress, unhappiness, or other negative emotions, evaluating whether that person is beneficial to one's mental and emotional well-being would be critical.  It is important to communicate concerns and feelings in any relationship to make informed decisions and promote personal growth. An open dialogue can sometimes help resolve misunderstandings or lead to a mutual understanding about the need for space or even the end of the relationship. However, if engaging in communication and healthy conflict resolution doesn't yield positive results, it may be in the best interest for one's well-being to stay away from the person in question. In summary, these questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they consider completely different scenarios and factors. The first question examines the pros and cons of staying in a chic, well-designed hostel that is not conveniently located, while the second question touches on interpersonal relationships and emotional decision-making."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Logan had never fired a gun before, so Michael took him to a firing range;","output":"Logan had never fired a gun before, so Michael took him to a firing range, where he hoped to introduce his friend to the basics of firearm safety and proper shooting techniques in a controlled and secure environment. Michael, an experienced shooter and gun enthusiast, believed that it was important for everyone, even those who might not have a personal interest in guns, to gain a basic understanding of them. This stemmed from his belief that a lack of education and understanding could foster unnecessary fear or biased opinions. Furthermore, knowing how to handle a firearm safely could come in handy in unexpected situations. Upon arriving at the state-of-the-art indoor range, the pair was greeted by a friendly on-site staff member who helped them check in and navigate the facility's rules and regulations. As part of their introduction to the world of shooting sports, they were required to attend a first-time shooter safety briefing where they were provided with essential protective gear like headsets to muffle the sound of gunshot blasts and eye protection to shield their eyes from any stray debris. Once the briefing was completed and the proper gear was donned, Michael led Logan to the rental counter where they would select a firearm suited to a beginner. While Logan felt a mixture of excitement and uneasiness at the prospect of holding a gun, Michael reassured him by carefully selecting a smaller caliber pistol, recognized for its accuracy and minimal recoil. He explained that starting with a smaller caliber weapon would allow Logan to focus on accuracy and technique, whilst growing accustomed to the noise and sensation of firing a gun. With their protective gear and rental firearm in hand, the pair proceeded to their assigned lane in the spacious firing range. Michael took the time to explain different parts of the gun, the correct way to load the magazine, and the proper stance for shooting before they begin. Emphasizing the importance of safety, Michael reminded Logan to always treat firearms as if they were loaded and never to point the muzzle at anything he didn't intend to shoot. Stepping up to the firing line, Logan listened attentively as Michael guided him through the process of lining up the sights, slowly exhaling, and smoothly pulling the trigger. Though Logan's arms wobbled slightly with the weight of the pistol and his heart pounded in his chest, he felt a rush of adrenaline as he fired his first shot and watched the bullet pierce the paper target downrange. Throughout their time at the range, Logan gained confidence under Michael's patient tutelage. They practiced various shooting drills, focusing on improving grip, stance, and trigger control. By the end of their session, Logan's initial nervousness had subsided, and he felt a newfound appreciation for the skill and responsibility required to handle a firearm safely and proficiently. As they left the firing range, Logan thanked Michael for introducing him to this eye-opening experience which had changed his perspective on firearms and their role in modern society. While he might not become a gun enthusiast like Michael, he recognized the importance of firearm education and respected the dedication and skill it took to become a proficient shooter. The day at the firing range had not only been a bonding experience for the friends but also an educational moment that would stay with Logan for a lifetime."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

În concluzie consider că, prin adoptarea acestui regulament, vom contribui la sensibilizarea cu privire la bunăstarea animalelor şi la menţinerea unor standarde înalte în acest domeniu în Uniunea Europeană. Translate to English","output":"In conclusion, I believe that by adopting this regulation, we will contribute to raising awareness about animal welfare and maintaining high standards in this field in the European Union. Animal welfare refers to the well-being of animals, which can encompass both their physical and psychological state. Awareness in this regard is crucial. By adopting the proposed regulation, we will encourage greater understanding of the needs of animals, their care and treatment. This heightened public consciousness should stimulate ethical behaviors and actions towards animals, thus contributing to their welfare. High standards are key in any field and animal welfare is no exception. Setting stringent rules and regulations can have a profound impact on ensuring the well-being of animals. It can ensure that all animals receive the care and protection they require. These include specific regulations regarding housing, feeding, handling, health care and transportation. For instance, they dictate the space an animal should have, what they should be fed, how they should be handled and what medical treatment they should receive. These standards would be designed not merely for the prevention of cruelty, but also to ensure the provision of positive well-being for the animals. The European Union, given its legislative power and economic size, has a tremendous responsibility and capability in setting animal welfare standards that could highly influence the rest of the world. The EU has been at the forefront of establishing legislation aimed at protecting animals and has made significant strides in the promotion of animal welfare.  Adopting this regulation in such influential entity as the EU ensures that the high standards set are far-reaching. It sends a message to all member countries and their citizens about the importance the EU places on animal welfare. It will not only force businesses and individuals within the EU to comply, but also nudge non-EU countries trading with the bloc to raise their standards. In this way, the EU can truly act as a global standard bearer for animal welfare. Therefore, it stands to reason that the adoption of this regulation in the EU will indeed have a significant and positive impact on raising awareness about animal welfare and maintaining high standards in this field. It will play an integral role in highlighting the importance of animal welfare and ensuring that it is given the attention and priority it deserves. This, in turn, will promote healthier, happier lives for animals across the EU and potentially set a global example for effective animal welfare regulations and practices."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

This movie represents the worst of Hollywood. What is this? Is it based on a true story. Well, they do start with some basic news bites and facts that they read off USA today. But then the movie departs to some fantasy world and a 'cuban' refugee going to make it in the American drug subculture; kind of like Rocky on cocaine. Is it a movie about Cuba or Cubans? For the life of me I don't believe there is a single Cuban in this movie. The accents are totally fake, and scene with Antonio's mother looks like a poster for midwest American values. The whole scene looks like something out of the Dick Van Dyke show. Is this movie about Miami? It looks more like L.A. transposed in Florida. Afterall, a palm tree is a palm tree. Is this a romance novel. The relationship between Pacino and Pfeiffer is so obvious from the getgo, and there is not one shred of possibility that these two characters could ever care for each other. Is this a drug movie? Well, no issues of obsession or addiction are even mentioned. The behavior of the actors after a line of coke is nothing different than had they had a drink of water. Admittedly, the acting is terrible. Let's get to the rest. The music is disgusting and sounds like latin elevator music or something out of a Lawrence Welk show. I think I heard a polka? The camera work is shoddy with too much movement and far more cranes than could ever be effective. Clearly, the photography budget was excessive.

Article: FRIDAY, Aug. 3 (Health Day News) -- Middle school students who are physically fit are likely to score higher on standardized tests measuring reading and math abilities, a new study has found. And, the average scores went up in connection with levels of fitness, the findings showed. \\"The more physically fit kids were, the higher their scores,\\" said the study's lead author, Trent Petrie, director of the Center for Sport Psychology at the University of North Texas in Denton. \\"Parents should encourage their kids to be physically active. There are some real cognitive   and academic benefits that come from physical fitness\\", Petrie said. Results of the study are scheduled to be presented Friday at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association in Orlando, Fla. The study included more than 1,200 middle school students from five schools in a suburban area of Texas, with 561 boys and 650 girls. About 57 percent of the children were white, and nearly one-quarter were Mexican American. Nine percent were black and about 2 percent were of Asian descent. The school district provided the researchers with information on the children's race, age, grade level and whether they qualified for the free school lunch program, which was an indicator of the family's socioeconomic status. The schools also provided scores to the tests, which were given between one and four months after the researchers had assessed the children's levels of fitness. Fitness tests were administered during physical education classes to determine the youngsters' heart and lung health (cardiorespiratory fitness), as well as their body mass index (BMI), an indicator of how much body fat a person has. The children also filled out questionnaires that helped the researchers determine factors such as self-esteem and social support. After accounting for factors such as age, sex, family income and self-esteem, the researchers found that for both boys and girls, higher levels of heart and lung health predicted better scores on both the math and reading...

Question: Rob was in his chemistry lab, experimenting with different states of matter. He had a liquid substance that he labeled as state A. He then transformed half of the liquid substance to gaseous state. He labeled it as state B. Finally, he froze the remaining half of the liquid to solid state. He labeled it as state C.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which state has less possible arrangements, state A or state B?  Hint: There are many examples in the chemical world of changes in entropy. Phase transitions are one obvious example. When a substance makes a transition from the liquid state to the gaseous state, the particles have many more possible arrangements, because they are no longer confined to a specified volume in which they are close to each other; gas particles can move freely throughout their container. Vaporization represents an increase in entropy. In the opposite direction, a liquid loses entropy when it freezes to a solid. Because solids have very ordered structures, there are fewer possible arrangements of particles that would result in the properties associated with a solid. Answer:","output":"State A has less possible arrangements. Explanation: According to the provided information, when a substance transitions from the liquid state to the gaseous state, the particles have many more possible arrangements due to their increased freedom of movement. This means that state B (gaseous) has more possible arrangements than state A (liquid). Additionally, it's mentioned that a liquid loses entropy when it freezes to a solid, so state C (solid) has even fewer possible arrangements than state A (liquid).

Betty called Tanya over to fix the toilet because  Available choices: a). Betty had no experience with plumbing issues and toilets. b). Tanya had no experience with plumbing issues and toilets.","output":"Let's analyze the sentence and the available choices to determine the most appropriate ending. Sentence: \\"Betty called Tanya over to fix the toilet because\\" Here, the sentence implies that Betty asked for Tanya's help, especially to address an issue with the toilet. So, it can be inferred that Tanya is assumed to have appropriate experience or knowledge to resolve the problem.  Let's now consider the two available choices: a). Betty had no experience with plumbing issues and toilets. b). Tanya had no experience with plumbing issues and toilets. Choice (a) reveals that Betty was not familiar with handling plumbing issues, which might be the reason she sought Tanya's assistance. On the other hand, choice (b) says that Tanya also lacked the necessary experience to tackle the issue. Given that Betty called Tanya over to fix the toilet, it is contradictory to claim that Tanya also had no experience in doing so, as indicated by choice (b).  Thus, the most appropriate ending should be: Betty called Tanya over to fix the toilet because a). Betty had no experience with plumbing issues and toilets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly.  Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light. Yet, despite constant interrogations, just two meals of beans a day and a tiny cell with barely enough room to sleep, he says the worst part of prison was not knowing. Question: After what Abduraheem's story, how does he probably feel about being a Christian? Options: - He now feels that he can be proud and open to being a Christian - He now feels that his religion doesn't do him any good - He now still feels reserved and doesn't share openly that he is a Christian - not enough information Answer:","output":"He now feels that he can be proud and open to being a Christian"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"The American Prairie Reserve is buying land from cattle farmers, which, combined with public land, creates a vast open area of prairie.\\"","output":"Title: The American Prairie Reserve's Vision: A Bold Conservation Initiative to Restore an Ecosystem Introduction The American Prairie Reserve (APR), a non-profit organization established in 2001, has embarked on an ambitious project to create a vast open area of prairie in Northeastern Montana. This has been made possible through the acquisition of land from cattle farmers, combined with the careful use of public land. The idea behind this project is to restore and conserve the diminishing prairie ecosystem and support the native species that have called this habitat home for centuries. Here, we delve deeper into the workings of the APR, their conservation efforts, and the implications of their work for the prairie ecosystem and the various stakeholders involved. Step 1: Acquiring Land from Cattle Farmers The first and foremost step in achieving APR's vision is acquiring land from cattle farmers. This has been made possible through negotiations, where the organization has been able to secure properties for sale or long-term lease agreements. By focusing on purchasing land that offers the best potential for conservation, APR is not only ensuring the protection of native species but also creating a buffer between development and the pristine prairie landscape. Step 2: Combining Private Acquisitions with Public Land APR has managed to effectively combine the privately acquired lands with public land, creating a vast, contiguous habitat for flora and fauna. By consolidating these parcels of land, APR's conservation efforts become more impactful, creating interconnected corridors for wildlife migration and movement. This approach offers a better opportunity to preserve the genetic diversity of species and enhance the ecological resilience of the landscape in the face of climate change. Step 3: Collaboration with Key Stakeholders For the success of any project of this magnitude, collaboration with local communities, government agencies, and environmental organizations is crucial. The APR, recognizing this fact, has focused on creating mutually beneficial partnerships with various stakeholders. These partnerships involve working with local ranchers and cooperating on grazing management plans to promote better land stewardship and the conservation of the native prairie. By working closely with the local community, APR is fostering a collaborative environment and ensuring a widespread commitment to the preservation of this unique ecosystem. Step 4: Restoration & Ecological Management Once the land has been secured, restoration and ecological management are the next critical steps in the process. This involves the removal of invasive species and noxious weeds, along with the restoration of native prairie grasses and other flora. APR also employs various wildlife reintroduction programs, such as the establishment of bison herds, which play a crucial role in shaping the prairie ecosystem. Moreover, the organization conducts ongoing monitoring and research to continually improve land management practices and develop evidence-based strategies to ensure the long-term viability and health of the prairie. Conclusion The American Prairie Reserve has set an unprecedented benchmark for land conservation through their remarkable initiative in Montana. By acquiring land from cattle farmers and combining these efforts with the use of public lands, the organization has created a vast open area that benefits both the prairie ecosystem and the various stakeholders involved. As the reserve continues to expand and flourish, it serves as a shining example of the power of collective action toward a meaningful goal: the long-term preservation of an invaluable natural resource and its many inhabitants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The information provided in the sentence is related to the economic impact and development of the downtown area, the number of jobs it provides, its tax base, the presence of upscale restaurants, shops, and residential units. However, it does not mention the specific number of people living in downtown New Haven. To answer the question about the number of people living in downtown New Haven, more information about the population demographics would be required. Demographics may be found on government websites, statistical databases, or websites of organizations conducting population surveys. These resources may contain quantitative information on population figures or changes over certain periods to provide a better understanding of the number of residents in the downtown area. For example, if you were to look up the population data for downtown New Haven from a reliable source like the United States Census Bureau or a regional planning agency, you might find statistics on the total population size, the number of households, and the population density per square mile. By obtaining these figures, it would be possible to determine an estimate of how many people live in downtown New Haven. Once the relevant data has been collected, it is important to cross-reference the information and ensure consistency among the sources. Additionally, monitoring changes in population over time can help provide a more accurate context when examining how residential developments, employment opportunities, and other factors affect the number of people living in the downtown area of a city like New Haven."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In a mental facility The answer to this question is:","output":"Title: Fractured Spirits Genre: Psychological Thriller/Drama Plot: Act 1:  Meet Jerilee Evans, a 28-year-old aspiring writer struggling with the recent loss of her mother. Brilliant and introspective, Jerilee suffers in silence, refusing to accept help from her friends or family. Encouraged by her psychiatrist, Dr. Sarah Fields, Jerilee reluctantly makes the decision to check into the Serenity Hills Mental Health Facility. She believes it is a temporary stay for a few days, intended to help her overcome her crippling grief and anxiety. Act 2: Once at Serenity Hills, Jerilee encounters an array of unique patients: the enigmatic and spiritually inclined Luna, the deeply mistrusting and volatile Michael, and the warm-hearted but withdrawn Abigail. The therapist overseeing group therapy at the facility, Dr. Rebecca Shaw, helps Jerilee explore her grief and develop coping strategies. As Jerilee navigates her way through therapy sessions, she begins to unravel buried emotions and painful memories. Jerilee's introverted nature leads her to observe the other patients intently and keep a journal of their interactions. It isn't long before she starts noticing strange occurrences at the facility - patients going missing, inexplicable mood shifts, and whispered conversations between the staff. Driven by curiosity and an eerie sense of deja vu, Jerilee begins investigating the dark secrets that lie within Serenity Hills's seemingly peaceful walls. As she delves deeper into the facility's history and her fellow patients' lives, she discovers evidence of dangerous and unethical practices by the staff. Act 3: Jerilee becomes the target of the sinister facility administrator, Mr. Alexander Cross, who grows suspicious of her meddling. He uses his position of power to secretly manipulate the patients and staff, twisting their realities, causing confusion and mistrust between them. Jerilee's only allies are her fellow patients, but as suspicion grows and tensions rise, their loyalties are put to the test. Running out of time and desperately aware that Mr. Cross is closing in on her, Jerilee must prove her credibility to her fellow patients and unite them against the corruption within Serenity Hills. She uncovers a horrifying connection between Mr. Cross, Dr. Shaw, and their experimental treatments––a shocking revelation that throws Jerilee's own perceptions and memories into question, making her doubt her sanity. Climax: As Jerilee and her new friends confront the corrupt staff members, a thrilling and tense standoff ensues. Lives are on the line as patients turn against staff and chaos erupts in the facility. Resolution: In the aftermath, the police arrive to apprehend the corrupt staff members, and the uncovered truth sets in motion the facility's closure.

Article: In Yemen, you always see one type of vehicle on the road: the water truck.They travel mountain roads and cross deserts to bring Yemenis the goods more valuable than oil.It is one that only the rich can afford, with the supply regularly being cut off.Others must rely on scarce rain or charity to  fight thirst. Experts say Yemen is going to be the first country in the world to run out of water.The capital, Sanaa, will run out of drinking water as early as 2025,says a report by the World Bank. Hannan, an 18yearold from Lahej, said that only the rich could prepare for cuts in supply.\\"In a good week we'll have a water supply all week but then the following week there will be water only for a day or two, \\" she said. She and her husband, a factory worker, pay 3,000 riyals (99yuan) for a week's supply of water from a touring water truck when the taps run dry.With an income of only 20,000 riyals (660yuan) a month,this means the family often spend half their money on water. \\"There are a lot of people who can't afford it and they have to rely on their neighbors to help,\\" she said. The average person in Yemen survives on onefifth of what the World Health Organization considers to be enough water. In Taiz, in the south,tap water is available only once every 45 days.In the mountainous Malhan district in the north,women and children climb a 1,500m mountain to collect water from a spring, often in the small hours to avoid long queues. Yemen is located in Southwest Asia,bordering the Arabian and Red Sea.Yemeni people have lived on scarce water supplies for thousands of years but that problem has been made serious by conflict in the area,the fastgrowing population and the use of water to grow a drug called qat.With one of the world's highest rates of population growth--3.46 percent, Yemen is the poorest Arab country. The government is considering desalinating   seawater,but this would be expensive and it may now be too late.The only other solution is to cut down on farming, but that means importing even more food. Question: When Hannan said that only the rich could prepare for cuts in supply,she meant that  _  . Options: A: rich people drank more water than the poor B: rich people could buy water from the water trucks if there was a water supply cut C: she had a rich neighbor who often helped her during water supply cuts D: the rich were not affected by water supply cuts Answer:","output":"B: rich people could buy water from the water trucks if there was a water supply cut"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The Moon has a greater effect on the tides because, although it is much smaller than the Sun, it is much closer.  The Moon has more or less effect on the tides than Mars? A:","output":"The Moon has a greater effect on Earth's tides than Mars due to several factors, including distance, size, and gravitational forces. The tides on Earth are primarily influenced by the gravitational forces exerted by the Moon and the Sun. To fully understand this, it is crucial to dive deep into the dynamics of the tides and the gravitational interactions between celestial bodies. Tidal forces are caused by the gravitational attraction between two objects, such as the Earth and the Moon. Gravity pulls objects towards each other, and this pull is stronger for objects that are closer together and more massive. Since the force of gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects, the closer an object is, the stronger its gravitational force will be. The Moon is approximately 384,400 kilometers (238,855 miles) away from Earth, while Mars is on average about 225 million kilometers (140 million miles) away. The close proximity of the Moon to Earth makes its gravitational pull on our planet significantly stronger than that of Mars. Furthermore, the Moon has a mass of 7.34 x 10^22 kilograms, compared to Mars’ mass of 6.39 x 10^23 kilograms. Although Mars is more massive than the Moon, its greater distance from Earth means that its gravitational influence on our planet is much weaker. The Sun is an even more massive object, with a 1.989 × 10^30 kilogram mass. However, it is about 149.6 million kilometers (93 million miles) away from Earth. As a result, the Sun's gravitational pull on Earth is weaker than that of the Moon. This is why the Moon primarily controls the tides, even though the Sun plays a secondary role in moderating the tides' strength. Mars' effect on Earth's tides is minimal, if not negligible. The Moon's proximity to Earth means that its influence on our tides is significantly stronger than Mars despite being smaller. The much larger distance from Mars to the Earth results in a vastly reduced gravitational force by comparison. Additionally, tides are also influenced by factors such as Earth's rotation, shape, and weather patterns, further diluting any impact Mars might have on our planet's tides. In conclusion, the Moon has a much more significant effect on Earth's tides than Mars due to its closeness, gravitational force, and mass. The effects of Mars on the tides are nearly insignificant compared to the dominant roles played by the Moon and the Sun.Understanding these gravitational influences allows us to predict tidal patterns, supporting endeavors such as maritime navigation, coastal planning, and environmental conservation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The features describe aspects of articulation and perception, are from a universally fixed set, and have the binary values + or −. There are at least two levels of representation: underlying representation and surface phonetic representation. Ordered phonological rules govern how underlying representation is transformed into the actual pronunciation (the so-called surface form).

Answer the above question based on the context below:  As Opeth's primary songwriter and lyricist, vocalist/guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt heads the direction of Opeth's sound. He was influenced at a young age by the 1970s progressive rock bands King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Camel, P.F.M., Hawkwind, and Gracious, and by heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Slayer, Death, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Celtic Frost, King Diamond, Morbid Angel, Voivod, and, most importantly, Judas Priest. Åkerfeldt considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that there was a time when he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, Åkerfeldt frequently sings \\"Here Come the Tears\\" from Judas Priest's third album Sin After Sin (1977). Åkerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and folk music, both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band.Opeth's distinct sound mixes death metal with progressive rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic refers to Opeth's \\"epic, progressive death metal style\\". Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth described Opeth's sound as incorporating \\"the likes of folk, funk, blues, '70s rock, goth and a laundry list of other sonic oddities into their trademark progressive death style.\\" In his review of Opeth's 2001 album Blackwater Park, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote, \\"Tracks start and finish in seemingly arbitrary fashion, usually traversing ample musical terrain, including acoustic guitar and solo piano passages, ambient soundscapes, stoner rock grooves, and Eastern-tinged melodies—any of which are subject to savage punctuations of death metal fury at any given moment.\\" Åkerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth's music: I don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music.

After the publication of the L'Orfeo score in 1609, the same publisher (Ricciardo Amadino of Venice) brought it out again in 1615. Facsimiles of these editions were printed in 1927 and 1972 respectively. Since Eitner's first \\"modern\\" edition of L'Orfeo in 1884, and d'Indy's performing edition 20 years later—both of which were abridged and adapted versions of the 1609 score—there have been many attempts to edit and present the work, not all of them published. Most of the editions that followed d'Indy up to the time of the Second World War were arrangements, usually heavily truncated, that provided a basis for performances in the modern opera idiom. Many of these were the work of composers, including Carl Orff (1923 and 1939) and Ottorino Respighi in 1935. Orff's 1923 score, using a German text, included some period instrumentation, an experiment he abandoned when producing his later version.In the post-war period, editions have moved increasingly to reflect the performance conventions of Monteverdi's day. This tendency was initiated by two earlier editions, that of Jack Westrup used in the 1925 Oxford performances, and Gian Francesco Malipiero's 1930 complete edition which sticks closely to Monteverdi's 1609 original. After the war, Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of the work was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger that remained in use for many years. The next 30 years saw numerous editions, mostly prepared by scholar-performers rather than by composers, generally aiming towards authenticity if not always the complete re-creation of the original instrumentation. These included versions by Raymond Leppard (1965), Denis Stevens (1967), Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1969), Jane Glover (1975), Roger Norrington (1976) and John Eliot Gardiner. Only the composers Valentino Bucchi (1967), Bruno Maderna (1967) and Luciano Berio (1984) produced editions based on the convention of a large modern orchestra.

A handful of Norwegian fishing vessels armed and sailing the winter night arctic seas between a British Naval base in the Shetland Isles off Scotland and the German patrolled coast of Norway. Materials, refugees and trained underground fighters wer transported back and forth at great risk during the early 1940's. This was a little-known effort between these two countries that greatly stressed the people involved. These dangerous and difficult adventures did not mean a great deal in the big scheme of the war until the Norwegian underground played a key part in delaying Germanys efforts to produce atomic weapons. This German set-back helped end the war in Europe and allowed America to be the first nuclear power and to turn their attention to the war in the Pacific. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","output":"This review portrays the product, \\"The Shetland Bus,\\" in a largely flattering light.

The reviewer clearly admires the bravery and determination of the people involved in these dangerous and difficult adventures and recognizes the impact their actions had on ending the war in Europe. In the review, the reader is given a brief but detailed account of the key events and operations that took place, highlighting the perilous conditions the Norwegians faced while transporting materials, refugees, and trained underground fighters across the arctic seas. The reviewer also emphasizes that these efforts, though seemingly insignificant in the broader context of the war, played a crucial role in delaying Germany's progress in developing atomic weapons, ultimately contributing to the conclusion of the war in the European theatre. The description of the book as a chronicle implies that the author has meticulously researched and documented the events, adding credibility to the narrative and making it more engaging for the readers. It also suggests that the book might provide a fresh perspective on a lesser-known aspect of World War II, likely appealing to history enthusiasts and general readers alike. In conclusion, the review highlights the book's strengths, emphasizes the significance of the events it covers, and acknowledges the author's writing skills. Consequently, the review casts the product in a flattering light, advocating for the thoroughness, accuracy, and compelling nature of its storytelling.

Q:Information:  - The Elenium is a series of fantasy novels by David Eddings. The series consists of three volumes:  - David Eddings (July 7, 1931  June 2, 2009) was an American fantasy writer. With his wife Leigh, he authored several best-selling epic fantasy novel series, including \\"The Belgariad\\" (198284), \\"The Malloreon\\" (198791), \\"The Elenium\\" (198991), \\"The Tamuli\\" (199294) and \\"The Dreamers\\" (200306).  - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\")   - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.  - The Tamuli is a series of fantasy novels by David Eddings. The series consists of three volumes:  - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature.  - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\".  - The Malloreon is a five-part fantasy book series written by David Eddings, which follows \\"The Belgariad\\". The Malloreon is set in the same world as The Belgariad, but expands on several aspects of the setting, especially the eastern continent of Mallorea.  - The Belgariad is a five - book fantasy epic written by David Eddings , following the picaresque journey of protagonist ' Garion ' and his companions , first to recover a sacred stone , and later to use it against antagonist ' Kal Torak ' .  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.

Question: what is the source of geothermal energy I found the following answer on Google: Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"Yes, the provided answer is partially correct as it addresses the lower greenhouse gas emissions of geothermal energy compared to fossil fuels. However, it doesn't fully explain the source of geothermal energy. Geothermal energy is derived from the natural heat generated within the Earth's core. The source of this heat comes primarily from two processes: 1. Radioactive decay: The natural radioactive decay of isotopes, such as potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232, generates heat deep within the Earth's core. These isotopes release energy in the form of heat as they decay into more stable elements. 2. Primordial heat: This heat is a remnant from when the Earth initially formed around 4.6 billion years ago by accretion of dust and gas and subsequent differentiation of the planet into layers based on density. Gravitational forces and pressure created intense heat during this process, and the Earth has been gradually losing this heat over time. Geothermal energy is harnessed by tapping into the Earth's internal heat, usually by drilling wells to access hot water and steam stored in the Earth's crust. This resource is utilized through three primary methods: direct use, geothermal heat pumps, and geothermal power plants. Direct use applications exploit lower-temperature geothermal resources (20-150°C) to heat buildings, support industrial processes, and even provide therapeutic benefits in certain spas. Geothermal heat pumps efficiently heat and cool buildings by capitalizing on stable underground temperatures unaffected by weather changes to provide space heating or cooling. These systems work well in wide-ranging climates and function at far lower temperatures than required for geothermal power generation. Geothermal power plants convert the heat from hot water or steam reservoirs (150-370°C) into electricity. Different types of geothermal power plants include: 1. Dry steam plants: The oldest type of geothermal power plant, which directly use the steam produced from geothermal reservoirs to power turbines and generate electricity. 2. Flash steam plants: The most commonly used worldwide, they exploit high-pressure hot water from the ground, converting it into steam by decreasing the pressure, hence the term \\"flash.\\" This steam powers the turbines and generates electricity. 3. Binary cycle plants: These plants employ a secondary fluid with a lower boiling point than water. Heat from geothermal resources is used to convert the secondary fluid into vapor, which then drives the turbines and produces electricity. Although geothermal energy exploitation does release certain greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen sulfide, from the subsurface, the emission levels are significantly lower than those produced by fossil fuel combustion. As a result, geothermal energy is considered a more environmentally friendly and sustainable alternative to fossil fuels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Stephanie, the office manager, had been receiving complaints from employees about the poor lighting in the building, which made it difficult to focus on their work. She knew that something had to be done, so she began researching the most effective and cost-efficient lighting solutions for the workplace. Step 1: Research lighting solutions Stephanie wanted to make an informed decision, so she spent time researching various lighting options online. She read about different types of light bulbs, such as LEDs and fluorescents, as well as different ways to install and control lighting, like smart switches and motion detection. Step 2: Compare costs and effectiveness After gathering information on the available options, Stephanie compared costs and effectiveness of each solution. She considered factors such as energy consumption, lifespan, and light quality. Step 3: Consult with employees Before making a final decision, Stephanie wanted to get input from the employees who would be directly affected by the change. She scheduled a meeting to discuss the options, answer questions, and gauge preferences among the staff. Step 4: Make a decision and place an order After considering all the information and employee feedback, Stephanie decided to go with energy-efficient LED lamps and a smart lighting system that allowed for customization of brightness and color temperature. She placed an order through a reputable vendor and scheduled the installation. Step 5: Dispose of old lights responsibly As the new lamps were being installed, it was crucial to dispose of the old lights properly. Stephanie contacted a local recycling center and arranged for the old lights to be picked up and recycled, ensuring that harmful chemicals would not end up in a landfill. Step 6: Train employees on new lighting system With the new lamps and smart lighting system in place, Stephanie organized training sessions for all employees to learn how to use and adjust the settings to their personal preferences. This empowered everyone to create a comfortable and productive work environment. Step 7: Monitor and adjust as needed Over the next several weeks, Stephanie monitored the effectiveness of the new lighting system by observing employee satisfaction and gauging productivity. She remained open to feedback and made adjustments to the system as needed. The new lighting system was a great success, as both employees and management noted the improved atmosphere in the office space. Productivity increased, and complaints about headaches and eyestrain caused by poor lighting were significantly reduced. The investment in the new lamps and smart system turned out to be a wise decision – a brighter space led to brighter minds and happier employees."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: In the film Kongwon-do ui him it features a relatively intimate look into the meaningfulness (as well as general meaninglessness) into the lives of various Koreans; empty people seeking ways to fill themselves, enjoying the escapism of nature. From the beginning to the end of the film we observe the fallibility of the various characters; we learn of their shortcomings and their desires, the overall complexity captured within human life (and yet the overal simplicity of humanity).

The film ends as well and as suddenly as it begins, and one truly understands the meaning of aloneness, that love is often an act of selfishness, and the many mistakes that we make. It is a look into everyday life, very well and beautifully done. If you are looking for action or for intense drama, this is not the film for you.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - The carafe is filled with water - The water is poured into the machine at the back - Coffee beans are put into a grinder - The grinder is activated - A filter is put into the coffee maker - The ground coffee is put into the filter - Sometimes a bit of salt is added to the grounds to bring out flavor - The top of the machine is closed - The power is turned on - The water passes through the grounds and becomes coffee.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose an increase in the filter strength happens, how will it affect less coffee makes it through the filter.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Analyzing the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis suggests that an increase in the filter strength will affect the amount of coffee that makes it through the filter. To evaluate this hypothesis, we can examine the process step by step and determine if the perturbation has a direct or indirect effect on it. Step 2: Examining the process with the perturbation - The carafe is filled with water - The water is poured into the machine at the back - Coffee beans are put into a grinder - The grinder is activated - A filter is put into the coffee maker (the filter strength is increased) - The ground coffee is put into the filter - Sometimes a bit of salt is added to the grounds to bring out the flavor - The top of the machine is closed - The power is turned on - The water passes through the grounds and becomes coffee (less coffee makes it through the filter due to the increased filter strength) Step 3: Evaluating the effect of the perturbation Direct effect: The increase in filter strength directly affects the amount of coffee that makes it through the filter, resulting in less coffee being brewed. This means that the final output - the brewed coffee - will be of a lower volume than with a regular filter. Indirect effect: As less coffee makes it through the filter, this may result in a stronger or more concentrated coffee, depending on the amount of water used and the ratio of coffee grounds to water. This change in coffee strength could be considered an indirect effect of the perturbation. Conclusion: The supposed perturbation (an increase in filter strength) does have an effect on the process. The direct effect is that less coffee makes it through the filter, resulting in a lower volume of brewed coffee. The indirect effect is the potential change in the strength or concentration of the coffee, which may influence the overall flavor and experience of drinking the coffee."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: had to go to the principal's office  B: had to go to the nurse's  C: calm down A:","output":"Based on the context provided, Addison got into a big fistfight at school. The question being asked is: What does Addison need to do before this? We have three choices here: A) had to go to the principal's office, B) had to go to the nurse's, or C) calm down. Now let's evaluate each of these options: A) \\"Had to go to the principal's office\\": This option may make sense, as the principal's office is often a place where students are sent after committing a significant disciplinary offense, such as getting into a fight. It is possible that after the fistfight, Addison could face punishment, such as suspension, detention, or even expulsion depending on the severity of the incident. Therefore, this option could be an appropriate next step for Addison to face the consequences of the fight. B) \\"Had to go to the nurse's\\": In the context of the fistfight, if Addison was injured during the altercation, they may have needed to go to the nurse's office for medical attention, such as a dressing for a wound, ice for bruises, or an assessment of potential concussion symptoms. Additionally, the nurse's office could also serve as a \\"cool-down\\" area for Addison to reflect on the incident and its implications. This is a reasonable option considering the physical aspect of a fistfight. C) \\"Calm down\\": Since the question asks what Addison needs to \\"do before this,\\" it implies actions that should be taken before the fistfight occurred. In that sense, option C: \\"calm down,\\" could be the most appropriate answer. If Addison had been able to calm down and manage their emotions more effectively, they may have been able to avoid getting into the fistfight altogether. Strategies for calming down may include taking deep breaths, talking with a friend, teacher, or counselor, or engaging in a healthy coping mechanism like exercise or journaling. In summary, after evaluating the context and the possible choices, the best answer according to the context is: C) Calm down This answer takes into account the fact that the question asks about what Addison should have done before the fistfight happened. Calming down and addressing emotional issues would have most likely prevented the situation from escalating to a physical altercation. While options A and B are more relevant in the aftermath of a fight, C is the best answer for the given context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In front of a crowd that set the new record for highest decibel level at an NFL Game, the Chiefs dismanteled the Patriots 41-14 on Monday Night Football. The Patriots struggling offensive line combined with Brady's accuracy issues doomed them against Tamba Hali and Justin Houston while the Patriots had no answer for the Chiefs balanced offensive attack. The Chiefs had a strong opening possession, reaching the Patriots 46, but were forced to punt. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Chiefs struck with 11-play, 73-yard drive, with Jamaal Charles scoring on a 2-yard touchdown run. The Patriots managed to reach the Chiefs 42-yard line on their next drive but were once again forced to punt. On the Chiefs' next possession, Knile Davis powered his way for a 48-yard carry to the Patriots 38-yard line. Next, Alex Smith hit star tight-end Travis Kelce on a 33-yard catch-and-run to the Patriots 5-yard line. Finally, Smith hit Charles for a five-yard touchdown pass, extending the Chiefs lead to 14-0. The Patriots once again drove into Chiefs' territory on their next drive, but again punted away. Later, the Chiefs drove all the way to the Patriots 4-yard line, and Smith hit Dwayne Bowe at the Patriots 1-yard line, which should have ended the half, but Logan Ryan was called for a hands-to-the face on Donnie Avery, allowing one more play, and Cairo Santos booted a 22-yard chip-shot field goal for a 17-0 Chiefs lead at halftime. The Chiefs had gained 303 yards of offense in the first half, the most allowed in one half by the Patriots under Belichick. Both teams punted on their initial second-half possession, but on 2nd and 7 on the Patriots' next possession, Tamba Hali, almost completely untouched by left tackle Nate Solder, strip-sacked Brady and recovered for Kansas City at the Patriots 9. Two plays later, Smith threw a quick pass to Charles out of the backfield for a touchdown, Charles' third, increasing Kansas City's lead to 24-0. On the Patriots' second play of their next drive, a miscommunication between Brady and Edelman led to an interception by Sean Smith who returned the ball 34 yards to the New England 13 yard line. The Patriots defense managed to keep Kansas City out of the end zone, but Santos booted a 31-yard field goal, giving Kansas City a 27-0 lead. On the Patriots next drive, Vereen ran for 9 yards on 1st down. After being stuffed for no gain on the next play, Brady hit Vereen for a 28-yard gain to the Chiefs 44. On the very next play, Brady hit Brandon LaFell who broke through three defenders and raced off for a 44-yard touchdown, making the score 27-7. However, the Chiefs couldn't be stopped. Kansas City answered right back, marching 80 yards in 12 plays, converting two third-and-longs in the process, and scoring on Smith's two-yard touchdown strike to Kelce extending the lead to 34-7, and killing any hope of a Patriots comeback. On the ensuing Patriots drive, facing a 3rd-and-4 from their own 26, Husain Abdullah intercepted a Brady pass and returned it 39 yards for a touchdown, giving the Chiefs a 41-7 lead. Abdullah fell to his knees in a Muslim prayer, and was flagged for unnecessary roughness. This caused controversy as many thought it was for his praying. With the deficit an insurmountable 41-7, Brady was benched and rookie Jimmy Garoppolo stepped in. Garoppolo completed 3 passes on the drive: a 5-yard pass to Edelman, a 37-yard screen to LaFell, then a 13-yard touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowski, for a 41-14 score. After both teams punted, the Chiefs ran out the rest of the clock to end the game. Jamaal Charles was the main weapon of the Chiefs' offense, totaling 108 yards from scrimmage (92 rushing, 16 receiving) and three touchdowns. Knile Davis ran the ball 16 times for 107 yards. Alex Smith was 20/26 for 236 yards, 3 touchdowns, and no interceptions. The Chiefs forced three turnovers and converted them into 17 points while committing no turnovers themselves. Brady completed 14 of 23 passes for a pedestrian 159 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions while being sacked 3 times. Brandon LaFell was the sole offensive star for the Patriots, catching 6 passes for 119 yards and a touchdown.  The 27 point margin of defeat represented the second largest loss for the Patriots in the Bill Belichick era (the Patriots' worst loss was a 31-point loss (31-0) to the Bills in Week 1 of the 2003 season). With the loss, the Patriots' record dropped to 2-2. In his regular press conference the ensuing Wednesday, when asked about the loss (primarily by Albert Breer) he replied with his now famous line, \\"We're on to Cincinnati\\". The Patriots would proceed to win ten of their final twelve regular season games, clinch the #1 seed, win the AFC Championship, and win the Super Bowl, making that quote a piece of Patriots lore.

The Battle of Plassey in 1757, in which the British, led by Robert Clive, defeated the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies, left the Company in control of Bengal and as the major military and political power in India.

The British, led by Robert Clive, defeated the Nawab of Bengal and their French allies, establishing the Company as the major military and political power in India. Over time, the Company expanded its control over Indian territories either directly or through local rulers under threat of force from the British Indian Army."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Question: how much time can store on dvd dl I found the following answer on Google: Blank recordable DVD discs ( DVD-R and DVD+R ) can be recorded once using a DVD recorder and then function as a DVD-ROM.

Translate to English","output":"The authorities in these countries have proceeded with the arrest and trial of individuals who have connections to international terrorism. In recent years, several nations across the globe have witnessed a surge in terrorist activities. As a result, they have taken a more proactive approach in dealing with instances of international terrorism. Law enforcement agencies and intelligence organizations from these countries have been working together to identify, apprehend, and prosecute individuals suspected of having ties with terrorist groups. This collaborative effort has involved sharing information, conducting investigations, and expanding surveillance efforts to monitor activities of both known and potential terrorists. The authorities have also employed advanced technologies and adopted new preventive measures to counteract the threats posed by international terrorism. These efforts together have yielded success in unearthing numerous terrorist plots, as well as in bringing those responsible to justice. The arrest and trial of individuals connected to international terrorism often present legal and procedural challenges, as competent authorities must navigate complex international laws and regulations. The countries in question must also deal with the political and diplomatic implications that could arise from such actions. As a result, the governments involved must carefully balance their national security concerns with their obligations under international law. In terms of legal proceedings, the authorities must ensure that the judiciary processes adhere to international standards on human rights and due process. Subsequently, the arrest and trials must be transparent, impartial and, in certain cases, could involve the cooperation of international legal institutions. This collaboration ensures that the rights of the accused are protected, while still allowing for the effective prosecution of the suspects. The international community has increasingly recognized the need for a cohesive response to the growing threat of terrorism. As a result, various international agreements, conventions, and resolutions have been adopted to enable better cooperation among nations. This framework allows for a more streamlined process when it comes to the arrest, extradition, and prosecution of individuals connected to international terrorism. In conclusion, the authorities in these countries have made significant strides in the ongoing battle against international terrorism. The arrest and trial of individuals associated with such acts are critical to ensuring both national and global security. The collaboration between nations and adherence to international legal standards will continue to play a vital role in effectively addressing the challenges posed by terrorism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The expedition crossed the border on the night of April 21, 1919. The goals were to capture Lodeynoye Pole, Petrozavodsk and the Murmansk railroad. The troops were divided into three groups and were made up of 1000 volunteers. The southern group advanced to Lodeynoye Pole in just three days, but was pressed back behind River Tuulos by Bolshevik troops. The northern group captured Prääsä. At this time it became obvious that there weren't enough troops to complete the goals of the expedition. A new round of recruiting 2000 new volunteers was started and Mannerheim made Aarne Sihvo the new commander of the expedition. Major Paavo Talvela's regiment started an attack aimed at Petrozavodsk on June 20, but was beaten by Red Army and Finnish Red Guard forces just outside the town. The British troops that operated along the Murmansk railroad were quite close by, but did not participate. The Finns had hoped that the Karelian population would have joined the troops as volunteers but only a few did and their morale was never very high. The initiative now passed to the Bolsheviks. On June 26 over 600 Finns of the Red Officer School in Saint Petersburg made a landing at Vitele across Lake Ladoga behind the Finnish lines.

Matter is the third venue to open at The O in south-east London. Can we infer the following? Matter was a London music venue and nightclub that opened in September 20 BC","output":"No, we cannot infer that Matter was a London music venue and nightclub that opened in September 20 BC. The original statement explicitly mentions that Matter opened in September 2008, after three years of planning. Additionally, the infrastructure and concept of nightclubs and music venues in their modern context did not exist during 20 BC. The mention of its 2,600 capacity and that it was the second project for founders Cameron Leslie and Keith Reilly, further establishes the modern nature of this music venue and nightclub. Matter being the third venue to open at The O2 in south-east London also does not support the claim of its existence in 20 BC. The O2 itself is a modern entertainment district situated on the Greenwich Peninsula in London which opened in 2007, offering a range of options like music venues, night clubs, restaurants, bars, and cinemas. Precisely, the O2 being in existence merely a year prior to the opening of Matter reaffirms the timeline of Matter's establishment in 2008, rather than 20 BC. Furthermore, in 20 BC, the region we now know as London was populated by Celtic tribes, far before the Roman conquest and eventual transformation of the area into the city of Londinium, which marked the genesis of the modern city. In conclusion, based on the information provided, Matter was a London music venue and nightclub that opened in September 2008 and not in September 20 BC.

I read this background article the other day: Fish reproduce sexually. They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization.  I am facing a new situation today: Tim and Dan both studied reproduction in college. Dan studied plant reproduction while Tim studied fish reproduction.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person studied more about the ways fish eggs develop? The answer to this question is:","output":"Tim studied more about the ways fish eggs develop. This is because Tim specifically focused on fish reproduction during his time in college, which would include learning about the various stages of egg development and the processes involved in their fertilization and growth. On the other hand, Dan studied plant reproduction, which would involve learning about the reproductive processes unique to plants, such as pollination, fertilization, seed formation, and dispersal.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question: When frozen it showed solidity, but as it thawed and melted it showed what?  Here are possible answers to this question: - fluidity - hollowness - openness - weakness - instability  I believe the correct choice is \\"fluidity\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"fluidity\\". When a substance, such as water, is frozen, it becomes solid, forming a structure with rigid bonds. However, as it thaws and melts, the bonds weaken and the substance transitions from a solid to a liquid state. In its liquid form, the substance exhibits fluidity, which means it can flow and take the shape of its container.  Fluidity is a property of liquids and gases where the particles are in constant motion and can easily slide past one another, allowing for flow and changes in shape. This is in contrast to solids, where particles are closely packed and have limited movement, maintaining a definite shape and structure. So, when a solid substance like ice thaws and melts, it transitions from a state of rigidity and structural stability to a state of flow and fluidity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Thameslink and Great Northern are the brand names used by the Govia Thameslink Railway train operating company on the Thameslink and Great Northern routes of the Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise, previously operated by First Capital Connect. Can we infer the following? Both names are used","output":"Yes, we can infer that both Thameslink and Great Northern are brand names used by Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) train operating company. The reason for using these two distinct brand names is because they each represent different routes within a larger rail network under the Thameslink, Southern, and Great Northern (TSGN) franchise, which is overseen by GTR. A bit of background on the companies and the franchise will help clarify this further. Govia Thameslink Railway is a train operating company in the United Kingdom, which is a joint venture between the British transport company Go-Ahead Group and the French transport company Keolis. GTR was awarded the Thameslink, Southern, and Great Northern (TSGN) franchise in 2014 and started operating services under this franchise in September of the same year. Before GTR was awarded the franchise, First Capital Connect was responsible for operating the train services along these routes. The TSGN franchise is extensive and includes several services covering a vast area in the southeast of England served by a complex network of rail lines. The franchise encompasses around 20% of all passenger rail services in the United Kingdom. To make it clear to passengers which services are being operated in each area, different brand names have been maintained or introduced: 1. Thameslink: This brand name is used for services operating along the Thameslink route, a central rail artery that connects cities and towns north and south of London. Thameslink services run between Bedford in the north, Brighton in the south, and several other locations such as Luton, Sutton, and Orpington. The Thameslink route passes directly through the heart of London, with trains calling at key stations like St. Pancras International, Farringdon, and Blackfriars. 2. Great Northern: This brand name refers to the services operating along the Great Northern route, which serves destinations north of London and is mainly focused on commuter services into the capital. The route primarily consists of two lines—the East Coast Main Line (ECML) from London King's Cross to Peterborough and the Hertford Loop Line, which branches off the ECML towards Stevenage. The Great Northern route serves locations such as Cambridge, Ely, King's Lynn, and Hertford North. In conclusion, both Thameslink and Great Northern are distinct brand names used by Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) to represent train services and routes within the larger Thameslink, Southern, and Great Northern franchise. The use of these two brand names on their respective routes allows passengers to easily identify the services they are using and differentiates the services in the southeast region of England's rail network."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Four fixtures are to be staged in 2016, with more next year. Hereford was shut in 2012 after 241 years of racing - the first recorded meeting there was in August 1771. ARC director of external affairs Susannah Gill told BBC Sport the decision \\"shows our commitment to all racing\\". When it closed Hereford, the company said the venue was no longer viable, citing the recession and the rise of internet betting on other sports. It also said investing in the course was difficult because it only had a 17-year lease from Herefordshire Council. Despite closing the course, ARC kept hold of the lease but has so far not been able to reach an agreement with the authority over it. Gill said: \\"There's no deal over the lease with the local council yet, but we said to prove that we wanted to do business we are going to re-open the track. \\"There will be four fixtures moved to Hereford from within the ARC group from October, and then we plan 12 more in 2017. \\"Relations with the council were, as you can imagine, frosty for a while after Hereford closed, but we went to them last summer and said there's a new face at the top and we want to do business.\\" BBC racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght When ARC closed down Hereford and Folkestone, for which there are no re-opening plans, it was the first time any long-established track had been shut in over 30 years. The Hereford decision was especially controversial as it followed a confusing dispute with the local authority over the lease, which ARC then refused to release.

Generate a question that has the following answer:  Meinhof  for the following movie plot:  The film begins on a nude beach in Germany in the late 1960s, where we are introduced to Ulrike Meinhoff, a respected journalist, and her family. Meinhoff and her husband are then guests at a party, where Meinhoff reads off a periodical that she wrote about the injustice of the Iranian Government. With the Shah of Persia arriving into Berlin, there is a rally in the streets, where half the people are protesting the injustice and the other half are praising. As the protesting goes on, the Iranian people end up going into the crowd and fighting the innocent German protesters with the help of the German Police; leaving many injured and a man killed. The next scene is of Meinhoff at a television studio arguing why she favors the protesters side instead of the Governments side, and watching the live recording on her television is Gudrun Ensslin, another activist. She explains to her parents how American Imperialism is completely corrupt while Meinhoff walks in on her husband having sex with another woman. Next, we are introduced to Andreas Baader, the ringleader of these revolutionaries who decide to name themselves The Red Army Faction (RAF). Their first major rebellious occurrence takes place in a department store, where they decide to set home made bombs and light it on fire. On a television broadcast we are informed of the many student protests at universities across America and of protests in West Germany, being led by Rudi Dutschke. The film then cuts to a famous rally where Dutschke announced his views on the protest and wars occurring around the world, trying to spark everyone to join their resistance. Rudi Dutschke is then almost assassinated by a man who is accused to be from the Springer Group, which is tied to the German Government. In effect, many activists go to the Springer Group headquarters and riot. As we see there are many demonstrating protesters rioting around the world, Baader and Ensslin are in court confessing about the department store fires. As her parents discuss how they are surprised... The answer to this question is:","output":"In the film depicting the events of the late 1960s in Germany, which respected journalist and activist is introduced at a nude beach and later becomes involved in the revolutionary group known as The Red Army Faction (RAF)?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: Ingredients for candles may be purchased at arts and crafts store.  Quantities for each ingredient will vary, dependent on the size and amount of candles you plan to make. However, half a pound of wax equals to 10-12 small candles, and candles only require one wick each. You should check your mould tray for a point of reference if you're unsure about quantity.  Paraffin wax. Half a pound of wax should serve you well for a home set of candles. If you're feeling thrifty however, you can melt down old candles into fresh wax. Drops of essential oil. These are essential, and can be used if you want to give your candles a scent. Only a couple of drops per candle will be needed to get the scent. Baking tray mould. The size of your mould will determine how large the candles will be. Small muffin candles will burn for approximately one hour. Large muffin tray candles will go on for about three. Tart moulds and cookie cutters can be used as well for this, so long as there's a moulded slot for a candle to settle in. Pretabbed candle wicks. Making sure to get pretabbed wicks can take some of the hassle out of adding them into the wax. Dye chips. Dye chips are specifically made for use in homemade candles. They're small, but effective, so you'll probably only need around one per candle. You can eyeball the effects of the dye chips as you add them. Dye chips will give your candles a pleasant colour. One dye chip per pound of wax should be enough to ensure a bold colour. It's important to add your dye while the candles are heated. That way, they'll be able to disperse throughout the wax with stirring. Dye chips are designed specifically for use in DIY candle-making, so they tend to mix with wax very well.  Mix it in with a wooden spoon to ensure the dye is consistent in the candles. Essential oils are added for the sake of scent, and should be added to the pot as soon as you've turned off the heat. Paraffin wax needs to be 150 degrees Fahrenheit in order to be ready for pouring. If you have a thermometer at hand, place it in the wax and gauge the temperature. Check the consistency periodically. You can do this by placing a wooden spoon in the boiler pitcher and gently stirring the wax around. If you don't have a thermometer, wait until a thin film forms around the edges of your pitcher. If you don't coat your mould with cooking spray or petroleum jelly before hand, your candles will put up a hassle when you try to take them out. Because you'll ultimately be taking them up held by their fragile wick, you'll want to minimize that resistance early on. Excessive spray isn't necessary. Just make sure the bottom of each mould slot is evenly sprayed. Being thorough at this stage prevents hassle later down the road. Once the wicks have set, candles take up to two hours to harden completely. Set them aside, and occupy your time with something else while they settle.","output":"To make candles, you need to buy some ingredients like wax, wicks, essential oil, dye chips, and a baking tray mould from a craft store. You'll make candles by melting the wax, adding a little bit of color and scent, then pouring it into a mould with a wick in it. Make sure to spray the mould with cooking spray so the candles come out easily. When the wax has cooled for two hours, your candles are ready to use!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Jacqueline Woodson's big win at the National Book Awards on Wednesday was briefly eclipsed by a racially charged joke. After Woodson accepted an award for her memoir \\"Brown Girl Dreaming,\\" host Daniel Handler shared an anecdote he learned over the summer: that Woodson, who is black, is allergic to watermelon. \\"Just let that sink in your mind,\\" said Handler, who writes popular children's books under the pen name Lemony Snicket. The non sequitur elicited a few laughs and uncomfortable titters from the audience. Handler went on to say that he advised Woodson to write a book that featured a black girl with a watermelon allergy. Watermelon is historically evoked as a favorite food among black people in racist jokes, and it's considered by many to be an offensive reference. Handler said that Woodson, who won the National Book Award for Young People's Literature, told him he should write the book instead. \\"I'm only writing a book about a black girl who is allergic to watermelon if I get a blurb from you, Cornell West, Toni Morrison, and Barack Obama saying this guy's OK,\\" Handler said, with a laugh. After a clip from the awards ceremony was posed on C-SPAN, viewers and some prominent writers quickly took to Twitter to denounce Handler's comments as racist and a distraction from Woodson's accomplishment. Handler responded with several apologetic tweets, including: \\"My remarks on Wednesday night at #NBAwards were monstrously inappropriate and yes, racist.\\" Handler also pledged to donate 10,000 to the We Need Diverse Books campaign and match others' donations for 24 hours up to 100,000. Woodson's post-ceremony social media posts have expressed her happiness about the award and have not mentioned Handler's joke. The author did not respond to a request for comment on the incident.

But he gave up that dream and settled for building it inside the city limits.  Where might he have built it? Possible A: suburbs, in the pond, residential area, newspaper, surface of earth  Why is \\"residential area\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","output":"To determine why \\"residential area\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense, let's analyze each potential answer step by step: 1. Suburbs: While the suburbs can be considered as an area close to the city, it is usually positioned outside of the city limits, which contradicts Johnny's final decision of building the house inside the city limits. 2. In the pond: Building a house \\"in the pond\\" is not a suitable choice, as it does not align with human common sense to construct a house in a body of water. 3. Residential area: A residential area is a section within a city that is primarily intended for housing. This answer aligns with human common sense because Johnny decided to build his house inside the city limits, and a residential area within the city would be an appropriate place to do so. 4. Newspaper: A newspaper is not a physical location where someone could build a house; it is an information medium. Choosing the newspaper as the answer does not align with human common sense. 5. Surface of the earth: While this answer is technically correct since all houses are built on the surface of the earth, it is too broad and vague to address the specific details provided in the question (i.e., building inside the city limits). Considering these points, \\"residential area\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it satisfies the specific requirements of Johnny's decision to build a house inside the city limits while also being a suitable and functional location for housing."},{"instruction":"A funeral for Zbigniew Brzezinski, the national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and a noted foreign policy expert and thinker, will be held Friday at St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral in Washington, D.C. Brzezinski died May 26 in Virginia. He was 86. In a statement, Carter called Brzezinski “a superb public servant” as well as “brilliant, dedicated and loyal.” Along with Henry Kissinger, Brzezinski helped shape U.S. foreign policy with a lasting impact, while also serving as an adviser to Presidents Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy. One of his most well-known accomplishments came in 1978, when Brzezinski helped President Carter reach an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to secure the Camp David peace accords between the two countries. He also was involved in making other major U.S. foreign policy decisions during the Carter administration, including negotiating the Panama Canal Treaty, arming mujahedin in Afghanistan to fight the Soviet invaders and planning a failed mission to rescue 52 American hostages held in Iran. Alexander Vershbow, a former deputy secretary general of NATO and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, told VOA Brzezinski's wisdom also guided U.S. and NATO policy in the post-Cold War period. “On one hand, listening to the appeals of countries like Poland, like Czechoslovakia, like Hungary, to become part of the Western family, which they were denied 70 years ago ... but also reaching out to Russia, and trying to help Russia become an integral part of the European family, the common European house, as [former Soviet leader Mikhail] Gorbachev described it,” Vershbow said.

But the story of this singular artist, who was so unlucky and unwise in life, fell into the right hands after she died. What’s familiar in Mr. Kapadia’s film is only the framework for an enthralling study of why Amy Winehouse didn’t, and/or couldn’t, reconcile her blazing talent with her deepest yearnings. The nature of that talent soon comes clear in the home videos and assorted clips that the filmmaker has assembled like mosaic fragments in his own intricately detailed work of art. Amy, a smart, troubled girl from an unstable Jewish family in North London, was one of those blessed kids with a big, rich voice that soared forth seemingly on its own; all she had to do was open her mouth. She adored jazz, along with pop, listening to and learning from Dinah Washington, Sarah Vaughan, Thelonious Monk, and then, later, James Taylor and Carole King. As you watch her connect professionally, though—with record companies, would-be managers, other young musicians—it’s clear that her love of jazz won’t be able to compete with the seductions, and extravagant rewards, of pop celebrity. Onward and upward she goes, encouraged by success and fueled by booze and drugs. Cocaine makes an early appearance in those shaky home videos. Danger enters her life in the person of her boyfriend and later her husband, Blake Fielder, a soul mate in narcotic and other self-destructive urges. (“I cut my wrists when I was 9 years old,” he says by way of self-ingratiation.) The cast of unsupporting characters is chillingly large: Mr. Fielder was far from the only one who facilitated, catalyzed or accelerated Amy’s terrifying fall. (Her father, Mitch Winehouse, earns a special place in this group with his purblind eagerness to keep her working—and earning—in the face of ever more alarming evidence of her fragility.) But Amy was her own woman, in her own creative world, and one of Mr. Kapadia’s most inspired strokes in this valuable documentary is to put her lyrics on screen as she sings them, so we can see for ourselves the essential elements of her songs as they reflected, and intertwined with, her tumultuous life. That her lyrics are poetic goes without singing; that they resonated with her public is affirmed by her honors and revenue. Reading them on screen, though, one is also struck by how inward her gaze was, how repetitive her references—to love and lost love, to pain, to bleak fate. Those are familiar themes in pop culture, of course, but they became imprisoning themes as Amy grew more and more bewildered by the tumult of her life, and the menacing possibilities of her career. One of her friends, the hip-hop artist and performer Mos Def, recounts in the film that she once asked him, “What am I supposed to do in this space?” That’s a haunting thing for her to have said, and the film offers a haunting answer in a clip of Amy doing a duet with Tony Bennett. Of all people, Tony Bennett! He’s a paragon of modesty, clarity and longevity, and she knows it. She knows it so well she can barely pull herself together to sing with this man she reveres. More to the point of her question, he’s a pure spirit, and when their voices join, she is, however briefly, the pure spirit she once was, and the moment they share is about nothing but pure, sweet music. “Life teaches you how to live it if you live long enough,” Mr. Bennett says. She didn’t live long enough. This thrilling documentary, directed by Asif Kapadia, recounts the career of Ayrton Senna (1960-1994), a Formula 1 driver of legendary skill and courage and a national hero in his native Brazil. The film opens almost quaintly with a home-movie sequence of a very young Senna, in his first race abroad, steering a squat little go-kart around a European track. “It was pure driving, pure racing,” we hear him recall elegiacally. That sets the tone for what’s to come, a celebration of a singular spirit in an impure sport. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text focus on the review of \\"Amy,\\" a documentary film by Asif Kapadia about the life and untimely death of English singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse. The review highlights her extraordinary talent, unstable Jewish family in North London, and influences such as Dinah Washington, Sarah Vaughan, Thelonious Monk, James Taylor, and Carole King. It sheds light on her substance abuse, questionable relationships like the one with her husband Blake Fielder, and the enabling behavior of people around her, including her father Mitch Winehouse. The insightful method of showing her lyrics on screen to reveal her internal struggles in her art is mentioned as one of the strong points of the documentary. Additionally, the review discusses her poignant duet with Tony Bennett as an example of her pure musical spirit. The text also briefly mentions another documentary by Asif Kapadia that chronicles the life of Brazilian Formula 1 driver Ayrton Senna, describing it as a thrilling celebration of his skill and spirit in an impure sport."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: There was a boy named Chan who loved his parents, though they did not love him back; he was not even given a first name. He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

Information:  - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City.  - The Kentucky Supreme Court was created by a 1975 constitutional amendment and is the state supreme court of the U.S. state of Kentucky. Prior to that the Kentucky Court of Appeals was the only appellate court in Kentucky. The Kentucky Court of Appeals is now Kentucky's intermediate appellate court.  - The Kentucky House of Representatives is the lower house of the Kentucky General Assembly. It is composed of 100 Representatives elected from single-member districts throughout the Commonwealth. Not more than two counties can be joined to form a House district, except when necessary to preserve the principle of equal representation.

In most jurisdictions, the court system is divided into at least three levels: the trial court, which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case; at least one intermediate appellate court; and a supreme court (or court of last resort) which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts. A jurisdiction's supreme court is that jurisdiction's highest appellate court. Appellate courts nationwide can operate by varying rules.  - Kentucky, officially the Commonwealth of Kentucky, is a state located in the east south-central region of the United States.

An attempt by the legislature to remove him from office fell short of the needed two - thirds majority . The following year , the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld Clark 's ruling . In retaliation , the legislature attempted to abolish the court and create a new one more sympathetic to their views . This event and its aftermath became known as the Old Court - New Court controversy . In 1825 , Clark was chosen to fill the congressional seat vacated by Henry Clay 's elevation to Secretary of State . He served until 1831 , but did not seek re-election that year . He became active in organizing the Whig Party in Kentucky and was rewarded for his efforts by being chosen as the party 's nominee for governor in 1836 . He won the election and laid out an ambitious platform to the legislature , which acted on only part of it .

Here is an article: WADI RUM, Jordan — Hitched up in the sandy lot by the police station, next to the four-by-four trucks and the dune buggy, is some other important equipment for enforcing the law in this parched and forbidding desert valley: eight surly and perpetually masticating camels. Six of the towering beasts are saddled up regularly for patrol by the local police to reach rugged areas or to show off for tourists. The other two are thoroughbred racing camels, males, kept around to provide another kind of service. “Any resident who wants to bring his lady camel by can come,” said Kayed Nasser, a handler in the station’s camel unit. “It’s a free service that we provide to citizens.” This is the local station of Jordan’s Royal Desert Forces, a 4,000-man-strong branch of the national police force that is responsible for monitoring and patrolling the sparsely populated desert areas that cover four-fifths of this Middle Eastern monarchy. The force is descended from a camel corps founded in the 1920s, when Britain, which had a mandate to rule the area, separated the region of Transjordan from Palestine. The force evolved after Jordan’s independence in 1946, relying more heavily on trucks and surveillance technology. Today, the camel patrols are a small, but still important, part of the Royal Desert Forces’ efforts to catch smugglers, track down stolen cars and keep family feuds from turning murderous. The force’s officers hail from Jordan’s Bedouin tribes, meaning that they know how to operate in the desert and how to navigate the intricate social codes of the hundreds of thousands of Bedouin who live in those areas. “The child of the city does not know how to interact with the Bedouin who live in the desert,” said Capt. Enad al-Jazi, a Bedouin and the deputy chief of the Wadi Rum station. “We do,” he said, although he now spends more time in a four-by-four truck than on camelback. The makeup of the force also sheds light on one factor that has helped maintain relative stability in Jordan, a key Arab ally of the United States, despite the turmoil roiling its neighbors. Throughout its history, the monarchy of Jordan has not only maintained good relationships with the country’s tribes, it has also built them into the structure of the state by heavily recruiting their members into the army and security services, analysts say. This has to do with Jordan’s past, which has left its eight million citizens split between “East Bankers,” or native Jordanians, and “West Bankers,” or the descendants of Palestinians displaced by the creation of Israel and its subsequent wars with its Arab neighbors. Jordan’s rulers have long seen those descendants of Palestinians, who tend to care less about the monarchy, as a demographic threat to their rule, according to Ora Szekely, an associate professor of political science at Clark University in Massachusetts, who studies Jordan. This sentiment increased after Black September, the violent battle that began in 1970 between the Jordanian Army and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Thousands were killed, but the monarchy won and expelled the P.L.O. from the kingdom. “This cemented the decision and convinced the monarchy that the only people they could trust were the East Bankers,” Dr. Szekely said, “and especially the Bedouin.” Since then, the ruling family has heavily stocked the security services with East Bankers who get perks like pensions and education benefits for their children, ensuring that entire families remain invested in the monarchy’s survival, Dr. Szekely said. The importance of those ties between the tribes and the state has become more clear with the rise of the jihadists of the Islamic State in neighboring Iraq. Since the American invasion in 2003 ushered in a Shiite-led government in Baghdad, the relationship between the state and the Sunni tribes has been battered, and many blame the discriminatory policies of former Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki for enraging the country’s Sunnis. Some have outright joined the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL; others oppose its ideology but are happy to see it fight the government. Still others have taken up arms to fight it and accuse the state of giving them little help. The difference of the Jordanian approach is clear to many here. “In Iraq, Maliki oppressed the Sunnis, so they said, ‘Let ISIS come in and wreck their homes,' ” said Mr. Jazi, the deputy police chief. “Here in Jordan, the tribes are the nerves of the state.” Though some signs of support for ISIS have cropped up in Jordan, the group is not known to have an operational presence here. Analysts note that many other factors, too, have shaped the two countries’ fates. For one, Jordan, which is almost all Sunni, lacks the sectarian divisions that have proved explosive in Syria and Iraq. Jordan’s monarchs have also mostly opted for more moderate means of dealing with internal dissent, making small political concessions instead of resorting to the mass killings of President Saddam Hussein in Iraq or President Bashar al-Assad in Syria. The biggest proof that Jordan’s approach has succeeded — at least so far — is this: “Jordan is still there,” Dr. Szekely said. Elements of that durability were clear in the Wadi Rum station and in the career of Mr. Jazi, its deputy chief. Welcoming a guest to a desert campfire where his men served rounds of tea and baked flatbread on hot coals, Mr. Jazi, 44, said he had joined the Desert Forces at age 16 and served on all of Jordan’s borders. Most of his work had involved tracking men smuggling cigarettes, drugs, electronics and weapons between Jordan and its neighbors, an often hazardous job. His brother Atallah, who had also served in the force, was killed in 1991 in a shootout near the Iraqi border, Mr. Jazi said. On occasion, Mr. Jazi’s unit had joined the riot police to break up demonstrations in Jordan’s cities, work he considers part of serving King Abdullah II, the official head of the Desert Forces. Photos of the king, dressed in a traditional Bedouin police uniform with red bandoleers crossing his chest and a silver dagger protruding from his belt, hang prominently in the force’s stations. Much had changed, Mr. Jazi said, since the days when the deserts lacked roads and phone coverage and when officers did multiday camel patrols carrying only lentils, flour, ghee and powdered milk — sleeping with their camels around wood fires. Now, Jordan’s army staffs most of the borders, and Mr. Jazi and his men work in trucks, or by cellphone. One afternoon, a colleague called to tell him that four officers had been speeding in the desert when they got a flat fire and flipped their vehicle. All were unharmed, so Mr. Jazi dispatched a crew in another truck to retrieve them. Later, his officers caught some Bedouins hunting without a license. They confiscated the poachers’ rifle, wrote them a court summons and released a falcon they had trapped and a pigeon they were using for bait, Mr. Jazi said. He and his men spend little time in their boxy white police station, preferring to drink tea and gossip with the Bedouin who come by to visit in the red and black tent pitched on the lawn. The camels rest nearby. All have names as well as official government numbers branded into their necks, like license plates. One was captured laden with drugs near the border with Israel and turned over to the force after its owner was jailed. The station’s officers acknowledge that technology has largely made the camels unnecessary but say that the force of tradition keeps them there. “They are the heritage passed down from our grandparents,” said Mr. Nasser, one of the camel handlers. “And we love them.” An earlier version of this article misidentified one of the items that officers of Jordan’s Royal Desert Forces used to carry during multiday camel patrols. They carried ghee, not lard. Ranya Kadri contributed reporting from Amman, Jordan.

The Canadian team went north of the Polar Circle, close to the North Pole to do the same thing. They spent several months there. The Canadian team didn't find any ozone holes at the North Pole.  Which team didn't observe higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth?  Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life.

After the nuclear fusion occurs, tremendous amounts of energy in the form of photons (light particles) are produced. These photons carry the energy generated by the nuclear reactions from the core of the Sun. 2. These photons then travel through the Sun's radiative zone, a thick layer adjacent to the core. The energy transfer in this zone is predominantly by radiation, and the photons bounce around, gradually making their way outwards. 3. Once the photons reach the convective zone, they continue their journey through convection currents, which transport heat from the inner layers of the Sun to the surface layer (photosphere). This process involves the rising of hot plasma towards the surface and the sinking of cooler plasma back to the inner layers. 4. Upon reaching the photosphere, the photons are finally emitted as visible light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation, such as ultraviolet and infrared rays. This light and energy take roughly 8 minutes to travel from the Sun to the Earth, providing us with heat, light, and energy necessary for life on our planet."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Here is a news article: Apple lost its title as the most valuable company in the world on Friday.      Apple's market cap plummeted below 420 billion on Friday after a disappointing earnings report earlier in the week, allowing Exxon Mobil to regain its title as the most valuable company by market cap. Apple ended the day with a market cap of 413 billion, about 5 billion less than Exxon's market cap.      The Cupertino company first overtook Exxon in August, 2011, just a few weeks before Steve Jobs resigned as CEO and has held onto it firmly starting in January. Under the leadership of his successor Tim Cook, Apple's market cap continued to grow on the strength of the company's product lineup. At its peak after the iPhone 5 was released in September, Apple's market cap was 656 billion — about 240 billion more than Exxon at the time.      Since then, however, Apple's stock has been plagued by iPhone 5 sales concerns, a shakeup in the company's executive leadership and increasing competition in the smartphone and tablet markets, most notably from Samsung. On Wednesday, Apple reported generating record revenue in the December quarter, but it fell short of analysts' sales estimates for iPhone and iPad. Perhaps more importantly, the company's profits were effectively unchanged from the same quarter a year ago, adding to investors' concerns that the days of Apple's incredible profit growth are coming to an end.      Part of the reason Apple's stock and market cap soared as much as it did was the expectation that the company had more innovative products in the pipeline that would help it break into new markets. Now, according to Forrester analyst Charles Golvin, Wall Street appears to be settling into lower expectations for the company, with the stock's price dropping accordingly.      \\"It's a reality check on inflated expectations,\\" Golvin says, referring to the significance of Apple losing its top spot for market value. \\"I don't think it's a portent or a harbinger of diminished impact of Apple on the market.\\" Beyond that, Golvin says that the milestone may be indicative that Apple is no longer miles ahead of its competition. \\"While they are still an 800 pound gorilla and bringing tremendous innovation and new experiences to consumers, others are starting to catch up to them a little bit and having some influence where they didn't before.\\"      Apple may be fighting for its position as the most valuable company in the world, but it is still far and away the most valuable tech company. Google and Microsoft, the second and third most valuable tech companies, each have market values around 250 billion.      Even so, it's a sharp reversal for a company that some thought was on pace to become the world's first trillion-dollar business.

Exxon has once again surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable company after the iPhone and iPad maker saw its... (Associated Press)      Exxon has once again surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable company after the iPhone and iPad maker saw its stock price falter.      Apple Inc.'s stock has been on the decline since the company's quarterly earnings report Wednesday suggested that its fast growth phase, rare for a company of its size, may be coming to an end.      Apple's stock dropped 2.4 percent to 439.51 in midday trading Friday for a market capitalization of 412.7 billion. That followed a 12 percent drop on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the company since 2008.      Exxon Mobil Corp. gained 22 cents Friday to 91.57 for a market capitalization of 417.5 billion.      Apple first surpassed Exxon in the summer of 2011. The two companies traded places through that fall, until Apple surpassed Exxon for good in early 2012 _ at least until Friday.      Apple's stock price peaked in September at 705.07 on the day the iPhone 5 was released. Exxon, in the meantime, has been trading steady. Its business _ oil _ seems less prone to stock market ups and downs than the Cupertino, Calif.-based tech darling.      This year, investors seem unforgiving with Apple, looking for perfection and punishing the stock for anything less. The company's stock price slipped below 500 for the first time last week, as investors saw signs that the iPhone 5 was falling behind competition from phones running Google's Android software, especially those from Samsung Electronics Co.      The latest quarterly report added to the concerns. Apple warned that its revenue growth, which had been running at a speed more reminiscent of promising startups than multi-national corporations, is slowing down considerably.      A big reason: It has been nearly three years since a new product has come from a company still seen as the embodiment of innovation. That last product, the iPad, came in 2010, when its CEO Steve Jobs was still alive. Some analysts question whether Apple can keep growing by just releasing new versions of its old products. The long-rumored Apple TV, is still just that, a rumor. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Apple lost its title as the most valuable company in the world on Friday, as its market cap fell below 420 billion following a disappointing earnings report. Exxon Mobil regained its title as the most valuable company by market cap.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? Take Ionescu was a proponent of what attitude based on his more traditional beliefs? Answer:","output":"Take Ionescu was a proponent of an attitude that was deeply rooted in traditionalism and conservatism, informed by his strong beliefs in national unity, social order, and the preservation of cultural heritage. Born in Romania in 1858, Take Ionescu was a lawyer, diplomat, and politician who played an influential role in Romanian politics during the early 20th century. As a prominent figure in the Conservative Party and later, the National Liberal Party, his political ideologies were heavily influenced by conservative and traditional beliefs, which were characteristic of these parties. Ionescu's attitude was based on several key principles: 1. National unity: Ionescu emphasized the importance of bringing together all Romanians under a unified nation. He supported the concept of \\"Greater Romania\\" which aimed to unite all Romanian-speaking territories. This idea materialized with the creation of Greater Romania following World War I, when Romania gained substantial territories, doubling its size. 2. Social order: Ionescu advocated for a hierarchical society to maintain stability and order. He believed that each person played a designated role, and respecting these social hierarchies was essential for the smooth functioning of the nation. Like many conservatives of his time, Ionescu viewed political stability as a crucial aspect of a prosperous society. 3. Preservation of cultural heritage: Ionescu championed the preservation of Romanian culture and tradition. He was deeply concerned with the impact of rapid modernization and industrialization on traditional values and sought to protect and promote Romanian customs, history, and the national identity. 4. Religion: As a conservative, Ionescu held strong Christian Orthodox beliefs, which formed the foundation of his traditional values. He believed in the central role of the Orthodox Church in shaping and preserving Romania's national identity and spiritual well-being. 5. Constitutional monarchy: Ionescu was a firm supporter of the constitutional monarchy, believing that it provided the right balance between the authorities of the monarchy and the power of the elected parliament. This belief was rooted in his conviction that a strong, central authority was necessary to maintain national stability and protect Romanian interests. In conclusion, Take Ionescu was a proponent of an attitude grounded in traditionalism and conservatism, with national unity, social order, and preservation of cultural heritage at its core. This was complemented by his beliefs in the importance of religion and the constitutional monarchy as a means of achieving a stable, prosperous Romania. As a result, Ionescu's attitudes continue to be influential in discussions of Romanian politics and national identity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In der Literatur- und Kunstkritik wird der Klassizismus als korrelatives Motiv betrachtet. Ein Kanon aus etablierten Regeln und dazugehörigen berühmten Namen bildet hier die Basis, auf der sich der Kritiker stützen kann. In diesem Zusammenhang ist es entscheidend, dass der Kritiker das historisch bewährte Regelwerk und die damit verbundenen repräsentativen Namen kennt und anerkennt, um eine fundierte und qualifizierte Bewertung und Analyse abgeben zu können. Die Auseinandersetzung mit dem Klassizismus ermöglicht es dem Kritiker, zeitlose ästhetische Standards und grundlegende Prinzipien der Literatur und Kunst zu erfassen und in seinen Urteilen zu berücksichtigen. Dabei stehen insbesondere die Werke der Antike und der Renaissance als künstlerische und literarische Referenzpunkte im Mittelpunkt des klassizistischen Denkens. In der Auseinandersetzung mit der literarischen und philosophischen Tradition des Klassizismus sind verschiedene Aspekte zu berücksichtigen. Dazu zählen unter anderem die Nachahmung der Natur, die Wahrung der Einheit von Zeit, Ort und Handlung, die Betonung von Ordnung, Harmonie und Klarheit sowie die Orientierung an idealen Vorbildern und humanistischen Idealen. Der Kritiker, der sich auf den Klassizismus bezieht, sieht sich somit in der Verantwortung, den künstlerischen und literarischen Ausdruck sowie die ästhetischen Grundsätze, die in den Werken der klassischen Autoren und Künstler zum Ausdruck kommen, in der Bewertung des aktuellen Schaffens zu berücksichtigen und zu würdigen. Dabei geht es nicht nur darum, die konkreten Regeln und Vorgaben des klassizistischen Kanons anzuwenden und abzuwägen, sondern auch eine Verbindung zur übergeordneten künstlerischen Tradition und dem geistigen Erbe der klassischen Kultur zu ziehen. Insgesamt spielt der Klassizismus in der Literatur- und Kunstkritik eine wichtige Rolle, um die Qualität und Bedeutung von künstlerischen und literarischen Werken im Hinblick auf zeitlose ästhetische Prinzipien und sowohl materielle als auch immaterielle Werte zu bewerten und einzuordnen. Der Bezug auf den klassizistischen Kanon ermöglicht dem Kritiker, sich in einer lange etablierten künstlerischen und literarischen Tradition zu verorten und sich gleichzeitig auf ein breites Spektrum an wissenschaftlichen und philosophischen Diskursen zu stützen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the premise \\"A group of random pedestrians walking.\\" true if \\"A group of people are walking.\\"?","output":"To determine if the premise \\"A group of random pedestrians walking\\" is true when given \\"A group of people are walking,\\" I will follow these steps: Step 1: Identify the key components within each statement. In the first statement, the key components are:  a) group b) random pedestrians c) walking In the second statement, the key components are: a) group b) people c) walking Step 2: Compare the key components to find any differences or similarities. Both statements mention a \\"group\\" and \\"walking.\\" This shows that there is some correlation between these two statements. However, the first statement specifies \\"random pedestrians,\\" while the second statement simply states \\"people.\\" Step 3: Analyze the differences to determine if the premise holds. The difference lies in the description of who is walking. The first statement implies that these pedestrians are random, which might suggest they don't necessarily know each other or have any other particular connection. The second statement only specifies that it is a group of people walking, but it doesn't provide any context about their relationship or the nature of their walking. Conclusion: Given the information provided, we cannot definitively determine if the premise \\"A group of random pedestrians walking\\" is true when given \\"A group of people are walking.\\" The second statement has a broader scope and doesn't provide enough specific information about the relationship between the people or the context in which they are walking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Promised a slice if he cleans the yard, Mickey immediately jumps into raking up the fall leaves littering Minnie's lawn. While working in the yard, a small tornado as tall as Mickey comes along and makes his work more complicated: first the youngster hops into the basket and leaps over Mickey countless times before he pounds the basket in place, shaking it to check if it's snared.

Angered, Mickey pounces on the youngster, who spins him around and scoots away, leaving Mickey's hat on his head.

Sir Gus O’Donnell wrote in the Political Quarterly. He questioned free bus passes and prescriptions for the elderly. Lord O’Donnell served three prime ministers from 2005 to 2011. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Lord Gus O'Donnell Calls into Question Free Bus Passes and Prescriptions for the Elderly Introduction: In a recent article written in the Political Quarterly, Lord Gus O'Donnell, who served as Cabinet Secretary under three prime ministers from 2005 to 2011, raised questions about the sustainability and efficacy of providing free bus passes and prescriptions to the elderly. As a key advisor and government official, Lord O'Donnell's concerns carry significant weight and have the potential to incite debate on this policy matter. Step 1: Provide background on Lord Gus O'Donnell Before delving into O'Donnell's concerns, it is important to highlight his experience and credibility. Gus O'Donnell is a former British civil servant with an extensive political career, having served as Cabinet Secretary to Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, and David Cameron. As such, his position within the government grants him the ability to provide informed insight on policy matters. Step 2: Detail the existing policy of offering free bus passes and prescriptions to the elderly In the UK, certain senior citizens are currently entitled to free bus passes and prescriptions. This policy aims to support the well-being and mobility of elderly citizens while also alleviating some of the financial burdens common among older populations. Additionally, it encourages seniors to use public transportation, potentially reducing traffic and pollution. Step 3: Present Lord O'Donnell's criticisms of the policy In the Political Quarterly article, Lord O'Donnell questions the overall effectiveness of the current policy, citing concerns about the viability and financial sustainability of providing free services in the long term. He particularly mentions that the policy might need to undergo a reevaluation, especially given the rapidly aging population and the increasing pressure it places on public funds. Step 4: Explore possible policy changes and solutions Keeping Lord O'Donnell's observations in mind, one could explore potential adjustments to the policy. Suggestions include means testing for eligibility, raising the qualifying age for the benefits, or implementing a more targeted support system focusing on seniors in significant need. Step 5: Highlight the importance of continued dialogue and evaluation of public policies In concluding the article, emphasize the significance of having open discussions and reviews of public policies, even those that may seem well-intentioned or beneficial. As society progresses and demographic trends shift, regularly reevaluating government policies is essential to maintain the welfare of citizens and the long-term stability of public finances. Conclusion: Lord Gus O'Donnell's recent remarks on the policy of free bus passes and prescriptions for the elderly in the UK have the potential to open up meaningful discussions on the subject. By drawing on his experience in government, Lord O'Donnell is able to provide valuable insight into the challenges of an aging population and the need for policy adjustment. In addressing such concerns, the government and citizens must work together to ensure the well-being of all generations while also maintaining fiscal responsibility."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To do this, we subtract 21 years from 2006: 2006 - 21 = 1985 So, the losing streak began in the 1985 basketball season. Step 2: Determine if there was a 22-year losing streak in 2007 To infer if the losing streak continued through the 2007 basketball season, we must consider how the Caltech Beavers performed during that season. If they lost again, this would result in a 22-year losing streak. However, based on the information given, we don't know the outcome of the 2007 basketball season.

Answer the following question: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: when did talk radio begin in the U.S.? Suggested answer: While talk radio has historically been associated with AM/FM, starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of podcasts . Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"The suggested answer provided seems to focus more on the emergence of internet-based talk-radio shows in the form of podcasts, which began around 2005. However, it does not address the actual beginning of talk radio in the U.S., which dates back much earlier than the advent of podcasts. Therefore, you should not validate the answer in its current form. To provide a more accurate answer to the question, the history of talk radio in the United States dates back to the early days of radio broadcasting. It is difficult to pinpoint an exact year when talk radio began since it has evolved over time, but it is generally agreed that talk radio started becoming prominent in the U.S. during the 1940s and 1950s. This was a time when radio broadcasters and hosts would engage in conversation with their listeners, discuss current events, and take calls from listeners. One of the early pioneers in talk radio was Joe Pyne, who began his career in the late 1950s. His confrontational style of debate and focus on controversial issues helped shape the format that many talk radio shows adopt today. Through the years, talk radio has diversified and expanded in terms of its content, political viewpoints, and audience reach. While AM/FM radio has traditionally been the primary platform for talk radio, the emergence of digital technology, such as podcasts, in the early 2000s has allowed for a new form of talk radio consumption. Podcasts offer more flexibility and accessibility, allowing listeners to access the content on-demand through the internet. This has further propelled the popularity of talk radio and facilitated the creation of various niche programs. In conclusion, while the suggested answer does provide some valuable information about the role of podcasts in talk-radio, it fails to address the actual beginning of talk radio in the U.S. A more accurate answer would date the origins of talk radio back to the 1940s and 1950s, highlighting the development and evolution of the format over time. Thus, the answer should be revised before validating it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Being able to reach treats immediately is important for training, so the dog learns which behavior is being rewarded. Traditionally, dogs are taught to walk on the left side, so keep the treats in a left pocket or waist pouch. Put a few small treats in your closed fist and walk along with your hand in front of the dog's nose. Every few seconds, pop a treat into your dog's mouth as you continue walking. If the dog runs forward or hangs back, stop and call the dog to you. Continue to call the dog back patiently, until it returns. When it does, tell it to sit, feed it a treat, and praise it. Continue your walk as before, feeding it treats as you do. If the dog starts walking ahead but hasn't lunged to the end of the leash yet, say \\"Easy.\\" Say \\"Yes\\" and give a treat if it responds by turning around and coming back to you. If the dog pulls at the leash to eliminate or to sniff an object, stop and call it back. When it comes, praise it, say \\"Yes,\\" and let it go where it wants to go. Follow it so the leash stays slack. When you start out, you might just walk up and down the block, so the dog doesn't stop paying attention. Each day, walk a little further. After at least a week of this, straighten up and keep your hand near your pocket of treats, around waist level. Every other step or so, take a treat from your pocket and lower it to the dog. If the dog can walk for several minutes without pulling on the leash, you can slowly increase the number of steps between treats. Try to reach one treat per minute within a couple weeks. Dogs have trouble understanding the purpose of punishment, which makes it an ineffective motivation technique. You should only use these techniques sparingly to discourage unusually bad behavior, not on every walk:  Never use these techniques with a choke, pinch, or prong collar, or a head halter. If the dog ignores your commands to slow down and return to you, stop talking and turn back the way you came, tugging at the leash gently. Praise the dog when it catches up to you, then turn around and resume the walk.","output":"The article provides a step-by-step guide to train your dog to walk on a leash without pulling, focusing on positive reinforcement and gradually increasing the distance walked, while discouraging the use of punishment techniques."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So, just how long can fires burn? The blaze at the abandoned Good2Grow recycling centre started on 30 November last year and was put out on 21 June. But that is no match for the world record for the longest-burning fire which is believed to have started around 5,000 years ago at a coal seam beneath Mount Wingen in New South Wales, Australia, and is still smouldering. \\"Lightning struck the coal seam where it reached the Earth's surface,\\" said a spokesman for Guinness World Records. \\"Today, the fire is now burning around 30m (100ft) underground, as it has slowly eaten away at the seam.\\" In Hertfordshire, fire crews were on site for 15 days in Hemel Hempstead when a \\"deep-seated fire\\" burned in a large pile of recycled timber in November last year. \\"How long can fires burn? How long is a piece of string? \\"As long as there is a fuel supply and oxygen to supply it, a fire can burn indefinitely,\\" said Steve Tant, policy support officer for the Chief Fire Officers' Association operations directorate. He said the fire service would \\"never walk away\\" from a burning fire which is likely to endanger life, property or affect the economy. Underground fires tend to burn longest, he said. \\"They have the right conditions, particularly if they are on a coal seam where there is a constant fuel source. \\"The dangers involved in trying to extinguish these types of fires - the risk to life, the environment, not to mention the sheer cost due to the millions of tonnes of water you would need - it's the Devil's own job to get them to go out.\\" In the US, a fire set in 1884 by striking miners in New Straitsville, Ohio is still burning underground. \\"It's now a tourist feature,\\" said Laura Thrapp, president of New Straitsville History Group. \\"Visitors ask how they can find it - we tell them to look for the smoke billowing up from the fire holes.\\" In the 1930s, the government intervened as the fire was beginning to spread to parts of the town. Residents were evacuated and homes demolished. \\"A barricade was built around the town to try and stop it spreading - the old mine works were dug out and back-filled with clay,\\" said Ms Thrapp. \\"It should have worked but it did not, and in the 1970s one of the highways had to be moved because it kept sinking.\\" She said residents had been known to brew coffee straight from their wells because the soil was so warm, or even fry eggs over the fire holes. It is estimated the fire, which is currently smouldering under nearby Wayne National Forest and does not pose a threat to infrastructure, could burn for at least another 100 years. UK Coal said one of the biggest underground coal fires in the UK happened last year at Daw Mill Colliery near Coleshill in Warwickshire. Gordon Grant, of UK Coal, said: \\"It lasted for several weeks and is regarded as one of the biggest fires the industry has seen for at least 30 years. \\"It was described by the miners who tackled it as a 'raging inferno'.\\" He described the 50-year-old mining roadways underground as a \\"huge network\\". \\"The oxygen supply was turned off the night the fire broke out, which gives you some indication of just how long it took that oxygen to disperse,\\" he said. Mr Grant added: \\"The main thing is no-one was injured.\\" This article was about:","output":"This article talks about fires and how long they can burn. A fire can burn for a very long time if it has fuel and oxygen to keep it going. There is a fire in Australia that has been burning for about 5,000 years! It started when lightning struck coal in the ground. Fires can also burn underground, like in a coal mine, which can make them very hard to put out and can last for many years. The fire fighters will not give up on stopping a fire if it could hurt people or things. In the United States, there is a fire in Ohio that started over 100 years ago and is still burning underground."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.

Q:I read this background article the other day: When wind waves approach to coast area from deep water, the waves change their heights and lengths. The wave height becomes higher and the wavelength becomes shorter as the wave velocity is slowed when ocean waves approach to the shore. If the water depth is sufficiently shallow, the wave crest become steeper and the trough gets broader and shallower; finally, the ocean waves break at the shore. The motions of wave breaking are different with along to the steepness of shores and waves, and can be categorized by below three types.[11][12]  I am facing a new situation today: The tourist village had two beaches: Coral beach with nice sand and deeper water was preferred by families, and Surfer beach which  had shallow water was a surfer's heaven.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which beach had waves with a broad and shallow trough? A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the description of the two beaches, it is likely that Surfer beach had waves with a broad and shallow trough.  Since Surfer beach has shallow water, this would cause the ocean waves to slow down as they approach the shore. As the wave velocity decreases, the wave height increases, the wavelength shortens, and the wave crest becomes steeper. Meanwhile, the trough gets broader and shallower. Eventually, the waves break at the shore. This shallow water condition combined with wave breaking is ideal for surfing, which is why this beach is considered a surfer's heaven. On the other hand, Coral beach has nice sand and deeper water, which is preferred by families. Deeper water prevents the waves from slowing down and steepening as much as they would at Surfer beach, so the troughs would be less broad and shallow compared to Surfer beach."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Leadbeater arrived around the same time as Fuller, and soon afterward he \\"discovered\\" the person he believed would become a global teacher and orator, Jiddu Krishnamurti (then in his teens). Leadbetter and others tutored Krishnamurti. Fuller may have taught him photography. She also had a small studio built in the grounds, and painted. Her works from the period include a portrait of Leadbeater and Portrait of the Lord Buddha. McFarlane emphasises the significance of the latter work, pointing out that it is \\"strikingly modern\\" in comparison to all of Fuller's other work, and more radical than compositions created by Grace Cossington Smith and Roland Wakelin, half a decade later. The painting owes much to theosophy's emphasis on seeing the subject \\"through a psychic, visionary experience\\". Sources describing Fuller's movements after her time in India sometimes are ambiguous. She arrived in England in June 1911, where she marched with Besant in the suffragette protests associated with the coronation of George V. She continued to paint portraits, but found it difficult to realise the transformation in her art that she had conceptualised in India:I have painted a great many portraits since I have been in England, and have been, I suppose, fairly successful—though I have done nothing in any way remarkable.

A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?  --yes. --no.","output":"Yes, the question is answered in a satisfactory fashion, but I can provide a more detailed and long answer for better understanding.  In Philippine mythology, each region has a unique set of gods and goddesses, spirits, and other mystic creatures. The Tagalog ethnic group, which is one of the largest groups in the Philippines, has a wealth of myths and folktales featuring various deities and mythical beings. Tadaklan and his pet Kimat are some of the figures from this rich mythology. Tadaklan, also known as \\"Dadaklan\\" or \\"Darakla\\" in some Tagalog myths, is believed to be the god of thunder. He is often depicted as a powerful deity who rides the clouds and controls the forces of thunder and storms. The concept of a thunder deity in Philippine mythology is quite common, as in many other world mythologies. Tadaklan was widely revered and feared, as the natural phenomenon of thunderstorms was considered to be a manifestation of his power and might. Kimat, on the other hand, represents the key element associated with thunderstorms - lightning. Kimat is known to be Tadaklan's loyal pet, often described as a dog or a serpent, which unleashes lightning whenever a storm approaches. It is believed that when Tadaklan cracks his whip, it signals Kimat to create lightning, causing a powerful display of electric light in the sky. As a fierce pet and loyal companion, Kimat was seen as an extension of Tadaklan's authority and strength. At the behest of Tadaklan, Kimat terrifies people and creatures below with terrifying bolts of lightning during stormy weather. These myths and stories represent the ancient Tagalog people's way of explaining natural occurrences, such as thunderstorms and lightning, through the intervention of powerful beings. In this case, the god of thunder Tadaklan and his pet Kimat were responsible for the terrifying yet mesmerizing natural events that were witnessed during intense storms. This belief system greatly influenced the ancient Tagalog's worldview and their understanding of the forces of nature. In conclusion, Kimat is the pet of Tadaklan, the god of thunder in Philippine mythology, and is responsible for creating lightning during thunderstorms. The ancient Tagalog people attributed the phenomenon of lightning to the actions of these supernatural beings as a way of explaining and understanding the natural world around them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

New length = L + (20% of L) = L + 0.20L = 1.20L New breadth = B - (20% of B) = B - 0.20B = 0.80B Now, we need to calculate the new area of the rectangle: New area = (New length) × (New breadth) New area = (1.20L) × (0.80B) But we want to find the effect on its area. So, we need to find the difference in the initial area and the new area: Area difference = New area - Initial area Area difference = (1.20L)(0.80B) - L × B Now, we can see that we have no numerical values for L and B in the problem, so we cannot find an exact numerical value for the area difference.

These days are set aside to show love and respect for parents. They raise their children and educate them to be responsible citizens. They give love and care. These two days make us think about the changing roles of mothers and fathers. More mothers now work outside the home. More fathers must help with child care. These two special days are celebrated in many different ways. On Mother's Day people wear carnations. A red one symbolizes a living mother. A white one shows that the mother is dead. Many people attend religious services to honor parents. It is also a day when people whose parents are dead visit the cemetery .On these days families get together at home, as well as in restaurants. They often have outdoor barbecues for Father's Day. These are days of fun and good feelings and memories. Another tradition is to give cards and gifts. Children make them in school. Many people make their own presents. These are valued more than the ones bought in stores. It is not the value of the gift that is important, but it is \\"the thought that counts\\". Greeting card stores, florists, candy makers, bakeries, telephone companies, and other stores do a lot of business during these holidays.

Answer the following question: Renegade Republicans who are trying to force a vote on immigration reform in the House of Representatives survived an attempt by leaders of their party to block their efforts. The renegades, a group of moderate Republicans, are five signatures short of the 25 needed to bypass leadership and force floor votes on several immigration proposals through a rare procedural tactic known as a discharge petition. Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, has described the discharge petition as \\"futile\\" because it lacks any guarantee that a bill would become law in the face of a threatened presidential veto. But it was House conservatives who defeated the 867 million farm bill Friday when their own move to get an immigration bill to the House floor failed. The House Freedom Caucus — a conservative voting bloc in the U.S. House — had offered to vote for the farm bill in exchange for a promise that one immigration bill would be brought up for a vote. The hope was that the offer would be enough to keep some Republican House members from signing the discharge petition. The immigration bill, known as the Goodlatte Bill, is a conservative approach to immigration that would provide legal status to undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, but only in addition to changes in the U.S. legal immigration system. The Goodlatte Bill is opposed by many moderate Republicans. For them, the deal offered an opportunity to negotiate on legislation that might win the support of President Donald Trump and resolve the status of DACA recipients. The deal fell through, and the farm bill failed to pass by a 193-213 vote Friday. \\"It's not a fatal blow — it's just a reorganize,\\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows told reporters shortly after the vote, \\"At this point, we really need to deal with immigration in an effective way.\\" Meadows said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy negotiated in good faith on the immigration issue, but would not elaborate on why a deal was elusive. According to the above context, answer the following question. How does Paul Ryan feel about the petition? Possible answers: (1). not enough information (2). He is sure that Trump will sign it (3).

Write a title for this article: One of Marvel Comics' brightest stars takes on the original Marvel Universe book when Fraction becomes the writer on the relaunched Fantastic Four in the fall, as well as the spinoff sister series FF, as part of the company's Marvel NOW! initiative. \\"This is the family car. Don't scratch it,\\" says Fraction, who takes on the two books while moving on from The Mighty Thor and Invincible Iron Man. He's doing some detailing on the old classic, though. His Fantastic Four, which teams Fraction with artist Mark Bagley (Ultimate Spider-Man, Thunderbolts), will take the whole family of superheroes —Reed Richards and wife Sue (aka Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman), their two kids Franklin and Valeria, plus teammates Johnny Storm (the Human Torch) and Ben Grimm, the ever-lovin' Thing — on a journey through time and space. Illustrated by Mike Allred (Madman) in his trademark pop-art style, FF will get a new look and a new replacement Fantastic Four squad, with Ant-Man heading up Reed's Future Foundation and teaming with She-Hulk, the Inhumans' Medusa and Miss Thing, an all-new female character clad in a Thing suit of armor. For the main Fantastic Four book, Fraction says, \\"it's the first family, and we're putting family first.\\" The story line to kick off both of his new books, which share a definite road map, is actually inspired by, of all people, Gov. Angus King of Maine. When he left office in 2003, he, his wife and his two kids hopped in a 40-foot RV and for six months, saw America by driving 15,000 miles over 34 states. \\"It was this intensive road-trip home-school experience,\\" Fraction says. \\"I don't really know any parent who wouldn't want to do that with the time and money available.\\" The story stuck with Fraction, and it became the root of his idea for the Richards clan: Reed builds a ship that will take his team and his children across time and space for an epic historical lesson, the writer says. \\"If they're studying ancient Rome, then by God let's go have lunch with Caesar on the Ides of March. If they're looking at the Big Bang, they're going to watch it from the front row.\\" They'll be gone for a year — which will only be four minutes in regular Earth time — and while there will be continuing plot threads, each issue will be a new adventure and new situation. \\"It's very easy to say, 'I want to stay true to what Stan and Jack did.' Well, what Stan and Jack did was invent the entirety of the Marvel Universe in 104 issues,\\" Fraction says of the original Fantastic Four comic that launched in 1961. \\"This is the place to be wildly inventive, and I would like to put as many things down on the page as humanly possible and offer up another dose next issue.\\" The Big Bang happened in less than a second, though, so four minutes is an eternity for the big brain of Reed Richards. He makes it a point for them to choose the people they want to carry on their legacy just in case something goes awry since the Earth will still need protection. Ant-Man and his group stand guard for the four minutes, but nothing happens. Three weeks later, a one-eyed, one-legged, long-haired, half-insane, bearded Johnny Storm walks through the time gateway, shuts it behind him and says, \\"We can never open this door again.\\" The new crew of FF were carefully chosen by the old team as well as Fraction. Reed Richards reaches out to Scott Lang because as Ant-Man, he's scientific, he has things to prove, he's a family man and, because he recently lost his daughter Cassie, Reed feels putting this brokenhearted hero in charge of the kids in the Future Foundation will help him. Sue wants a woman like Medusa who has a link to the Fantastic Four through the Inhumans but could also be a mother, a hero, a friend, a wife and \\"seemingly have eight arms to handle all these jobs at once,\\" Fraction says. She-Hulk has a pedigree with the team since she has been a member of the Fantastic Four, plus she'd be Ben's pick because she's \\"the one person he knew he could never lick,\\" says Fraction, who writes Red She-Hulk in Defenders, which ends its run at issue 12 in November. \\"Strong guys are easy but you need more than just a strong guy.\\" Miss Thing is the most interesting choice because, as Fraction puts it, \\"Johnny spaces it because he's Johnny.\\" She just happens to be a \\"Lohan-esque celebutante blonde\\" he's with the night before he leaves and she's thrown into the middle of this situation. \\"She's the regular person, she's the human, she's the overwhelmed 'Whaaa?' of it all,\\" Fraction says. For Fantastic Four, Bagley takes his first crack at the group and brings both warmth as well as big-time action sequences to the book, according to Marvel executive editor Tom Brevoort. And with Allred, he says, FF will have a tone and a flavor that will make it different from anything else on comic shelves. \\"My hope is that it will be quirky in the same way that the Fantastic Four were quirky when they first appeared in the early '60s,\\" Brevoort explains. \\"We know who they are, we know what they're about, but when they first showed up, it was like a bomb going off in comics. \\"These were remarkable characters who were doing unexpected things and had a real element of danger to it and excitement and unpredictability. The hope is we'll be able to tap into something akin to that.\\" Ant-Man has been one of Allred's all-time favorite characters since he was a kid, and when Marvel editor in chief Axel Alonso told him he'd be doing the superhero with Fraction, \\"I did a back flip,\\" the artist says. \\"He's always in touch with the deepest part of my brain.\\" Allred \\"melted\\" when he learned Medusa was on the new team — \\"She was my first and favorite costumed comic-book crush,\\" he says — and is falling for the other two women, too. He almost pushed to replace She-Hulk, \\"but then my brain cracked open, and like many 'arranged marriages,' I saw her soul and opened my heart to her,\\" says Allred, adding that Miss Thing \\"is so weird and wild.\\" He digs the chemistry between the four and is giving them all matching uniforms — \\"except the 'new kid' who has the most 'traditional' look for obvious reasons,\\" Allred says. Brevoort reports that the new FF artist is \\"the happiest man on the face of the Earth. His enthusiasm is electrifying. He enjoys getting to play with all this stuff. It has such a nice bounce and spark to it because of that.\\" At meetings discussing the changes of Marvel NOW!, Fantastic Four received a good amount of interest from different writers because it's one of \\"the mini-crown jewels of Marvel,\\" according to Brevoort. Fraction, though, was perfect for it and FF in a couple of ways, the editor says, starting with the cutting-edge, technological aspect of Fantastic Four. \\"Matt's obviously got something of a crazy science brain.\\" Plus, like Reed Richards, he's a big family man — Fraction has two young children with wife (and Captain Marvel writer) Kelly Sue DeConnick, and part of the Fantastic Four appeal for him, he says, was \\"a chance for me to tell stories about my family through the lens of the cornerstone of the Marvel Universe.\\" In doing so, Fraction aims for the title to be entertaining for all ages, from his kids to the older comic fan. \\"I feel that one of the best Fantastic Four stories was The Incredibles, and I want to take that back. It's so arrogant to say but it should have been us. We should have done that,\\" Fraction says, laughing. \\"If this could be the Pixar version of the Fantastic Four, something that everyone can enjoy, not just our medium 30-year-old white-dude reader, I'd be happy.\\" Whereas the Fantastic Four is about the Richards family having all-new adventures, FF is about an all-new Fantastic Four getting to meet the team's greatest hits, Fraction teases. \\"Suddenly, there are imposters to the throne and they come out of the woodwork for these guys.\\" Ant-Man has an agenda of his own, too, in addition to protecting the world. He blames Doctor Doom for the death of his daughter and, with the power of the Fantastic Four and the Future Foundation, wonders what would happen if they declared war on Latveria and devoted all their time and resources to eliminating Doom once and for all. \\"It's a dark twist on what the Fantastic Four is about — it's the other side of the coin,\\" Fraction says. \\"We have this Fantastic Four with a specific mission in FF and how can he direct and bring these people along with him?\\" His favorite Fantastic Four run of all time is still Lee and Kirby's first issues in the '60s, and Fraction feels the pure raw inventive power of them is unmatched. Reading those, \\"you watch an idiom get invented, and when they really hit their stride, just page after page after page is remarkable,\\" Fraction says. \\"I can't actually read Kirby for too long. I can only go a handful of pages and I have to take a break and chew things over. \\"It's so imaginative, it just sends me spinning. I have to put it down and daydream for a little while and go back to it.\\" Fraction admits he's \\"terrified\\" he's going to screw up Fantastic Four, but he feeds off that fear and to be true to the spirit of the book, he says, \\"you've got to invent, invent, invent. \\"That's an all-too-rare occurrence in comics these days but I'm excited to get started.\\"","output":"A Fantastic Adventure: Marvel's Superhero Family Explores Time and Space"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The camel left the alley and moved into the street, as the","output":"sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm, golden glow on the bustling marketplace. Merchants shouted in various languages, advertising their vibrant textiles, aromatic spices, and exquisite handcrafted goods. Children darted through the crowd, laughing and playing, their energy seemingly endless as twilight approached. The camel, named Fatima, was adorned with a brightly-colored saddle blanket and intricate bridle, signifying her owner's wealth and stature within the community. She graciously accepted the gentle pats and admiring looks from passersby while her owner, a kind-hearted trader named Rashid, haggled with other merchants and customers. As the day transitioned into night, the flickering torches and lanterns set the marketplace aglow, giving the area an enchanting, almost mysterious ambiance. The air was heavy with the scent of exotic spices mixed with the tantalizing aroma of freshly grilled meats and sweet, syrupy pastries. An intoxicating blend of music from street musicians and spirited conversations filled the atmosphere, creating a vibrant tapestry of sound. Fatima, being a well-behaved and experienced camel, patiently waited for Rashid as he conducted his business. Her large, dark eyes scanned the raucous crowd while her ears perked up at the myriad of sounds that surrounded her. The evening's energy seemed to invigorate the camel, her tail swishing from side to side with gentle contentment. As the evening wore on, the crowd began to dissipate, with vendors packing up their wares and families returning to their homes for dinner. Fatima stood still, taking in the sights and sounds of the marketplace as it transformed from a hub of activity to a quiet, flickering canvas of shadows and dancing flames. Eventually, Rashid returned to his beloved camel, his face flushed from the heat and excitement of the day. Feeling the satisfying weight of a job well done and a successful day's investment, Rashid patted Fatima affectionately on the side, and they began to make their way back through the now-quietened streets. The warm air carried a gentle breeze, which offered a faint whisper of relief from the day's earlier heat. As they moved through the sleepy town, Rashid reflected on his experiences and transactions, eagerly anticipating what fortune the next market day might bring. Each step that Fatima took carried them further from the lively atmosphere of the marketplace and deeper into the realm of possibility that awaited them."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird.

Please write a short summary for the following article: 5 Things Never Heard at the Most Innovative Companies My colleague Kathy Gersch explains that while it may be difficult for your company to generate innovative ideas, high-tech start-ups and other companies we consider to have innovation built into their DNA have just as much difficulty maintaining their innovative edge. The most interesting thing about the Fast Company Most Innovative Companies 2013 list isn’t who is on it. It’s who isn’t. Writing about the companies that had fallen off the list (and were obviously upset about it), Robert Safian, Editor of Fast Company magazine said, “It’s not that these businesses suddenly lost their mojo. But in a climate where the velocity of change is accelerating, these companies didn’t have a compelling-enough breakthrough for us to highlight.” Safian’s remark perfectly illustrates the essential element required for survival in today’s economic environment. If you aren’t constantly innovating, your organization is most likely losing its edge. If your innovations are incremental – not big enough to move the needle – you’re still losing. What do the companies on Fast Company’s list like Nike, Uber, and Pinterest have that others like Facebook and Twitter don’t? Better new products – which came from innovative ideas, that’s obvious. The mystery is where these ideas come from, how they rise to get noticed, and then how they are brought to market faster than anyone else. This list is a reminder that some of the companies we’ve historically associated with innovation because of their brand name (3M, Facebook, and Twitter) aren’t immune to losing their edge. While people have spilled much ink on how to create innovation, I’d like to offer an easier way to get there – by process of elimination. Let’s start with five things you will NOT hear at the most innovative organizations. Be on alert for them; These are clear indicators that your company is losing its innovation “mojo.” 1. “Can we do that?” Permission seekers are the mark of unclear company vision. If your company’s vision is clear enough, and has been communicated constantly and consistently, people do not come to you for permission, they come to show you what they’ve already done. 2. “We can’t do that.” On the flip side of the previous comment, you find the limitations or barriers people have set up in reaction to the punishment they’ve experienced for prior failures. If your people see others try, fail, then get punished, you can guarantee that people will remain in the safe spot. No one is going to try to innovate, much less try anything remotely outside the box ever again. 3. “We have to go through proper channels.” A mark of truly innovative companies is that the employees are well-networked, and they are constantly crossing silo walls to engage other departments, gather knowledge, or just get an outside opinion. Though one person may come up with the idea, nobody creates a great innovation solely on their own. 4. “That’s good enough.” In many companies, once significant progress is made, momentum slows and eventually the project fails. This is one of the key reasons 70% of change efforts fail. Yes, it’s important to celebrate incremental wins, but in innovative companies, people don’t let up – they continue to focus on the final prize. This only comes from a relentless focus on winning. 5. “That’s not my job.” This final phrase is the clearest indicator that people aren’t focused on the future of the company. If employees have a clear understanding of the vision set by leadership, no one will be talking in terms of their box on the org-chart. If you hear “us” and “them” language referring to internal teams, beware. Employees at innovative companies know it is always “our” job – we win together. Stay on the alert to these dangerous phrases that might sneak into conversations in your organization. A great brand name no longer protects you from losing your edge. Remember Kodak? Kathy Gersch is an Executive Vice President at Kotter International, a firm that helps leaders accelerate strategy implementation in their organizations. John Kotter is the chief innovation officer at Kotter International, and is the Konosuke Matsushita Professor of Leadership, Emeritus, at Harvard Business School. Read Dr. Kotter’s new article, “Accelerate!,” featured in the Harvard Business Review, in which he explains how organizations can develop the agility required to succeed in today’s rapidly changing world.

The Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies list highlights this issue, with some familiar names, such as Facebook and Twitter, falling off the list. Companies like Nike, Uber, and Pinterest managed to remain on the list by constantly developing better products and staying ahead in the market. To maintain innovation, companies must eliminate certain barriers that impede progress, such as unclear company vision, fear of punishment for failure, strict adherence to proper channels, settling for \\"good enough,\\" and a lack of unity or teamwork. Awareness of these issues can help prevent a company from losing its innovative edge and remaining competitive in the market."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choices:  - weight  - resistance  - energy  - pressure  A:","output":"Aside from temperature, pressure also has a significant effect on the phase of a substance. Let's explore it in more detail, as well as briefly discuss the other options. A. Pressure: Pressure plays a crucial role in determining the phase of a substance, affecting the balance of the intermolecular forces between particles. For example, an increase in pressure can cause a gas to condense into a liquid and a liquid to solidify. Vice versa, a decrease in pressure can cause a solid to become a liquid, or a liquid to turn into a gas. The equilibrium between phases can be described by phase diagrams, which are graphical representations of the pressure and temperature conditions under which various phases of a substance coexist. An excellent example of pressure's influence on a substance's phase is carbon dioxide, which is a solid (dry ice) at low temperatures and pressures but becomes a liquid or gas at higher pressures and temperatures. B. Weight: Weight, defined as the force exerted on an object due to gravity, does not directly impact a substance's phase. However, weight can influence processes such as sedimentation, where the particles in a substance settle due to gravity, resulting in phase separation. In such cases, weight can contribute indirectly to phase behavior, but it does not inherently affect the phase of a substance. C. Resistance: Resistance refers to the opposition a material offers to the flow of electric current. While resistance can be related to the material's properties, it does not directly affect a substance's phase. A higher or lower resistance value would not impact the state of matter of a substance, as it is not associated with the fundamental physical and chemical properties responsible for phase transitions. D. Energy: Energy plays an indirect role in determining the phase of a substance. A change in a substance's phase, such as the transition from solid to liquid, typically occurs when it absorbs or releases energy, either in the form of heat or work. This process is driven by the principle of conservation of energy, which states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed but can only be transferred from one form to another. For example, when a solid melts, it absorbs energy as heat, overcoming the intermolecular forces that keep its particles in place, and allowing the particles to move more freely, thus becoming a liquid. Similarly, during freezing, a liquid releases energy as heat, and its particles slow and their intermolecular forces strengthen, forming a solid. In summary, while weight, resistance, and energy can have some indirect influences on the behavior of substances, pressure has the most direct impact on their phase. Changes in pressure can shift the equilibrium between phases, leading to phase transitions that fulfill the conditions set by phase diagrams and the thermodynamics of the substance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One of the keys to a successful trip is traveling light, which means leaving unnecessary items at home. Not only does this make your journey more enjoyable, but it can also save you money on baggage fees and reduce the risk of losing valuable items. In this article, we will discuss the importance of leaving valuables, toiletries, bulky books, and gadgets at home, ensuring a stress-free and organized travel experience. 1. Leave Your Valuables at Home: The first step to traveling light is leaving your valuable items at home. Bringing expensive items such as jewelry, high-end electronics, and designer bags can make you a target for theft. In addition, losing or damaging these items during transit would be a terrible disappointment. Instead, select travel-friendly, less expensive alternatives for your journey.  Tip: Use a digital wallet or prepaid debit card instead of carrying large amounts of cash or credit cards. 2. Ditch the Toiletries: Packing full-sized toiletries is a common mistake that adds unnecessary weight and takes up space in your luggage. Instead, transfer your favorite shampoo, conditioner, and body wash into small, travel-sized bottles that meet airline regulations. Better yet, consider purchasing travel-sized toiletries upon arrival at your destination. This will save space in your luggage and ensure that you only have the essentials.  Tip: Opt for solid toiletries like bar soap and shampoo bars, which take up less space and eliminate the risk of spills. 3. Leave Bulky Books Behind: While books can be great travel companions, they can also weigh down your luggage. Instead of bringing heavy paperbacks or hardcover books, utilize e-books and audiobooks on your smartphone or e-reader. This will not only lighten your load but also provide you with a wide variety of reading material for your journey.  Tip: Public libraries often offer free access to e-books and audiobooks through their digital lending programs. 4. Travel Without Unnecessary Gadgets: In today's technological age, it's easy to become overwhelmed by the number of gadgets available for daily use. While you may be tempted to bring along multiple devices, consider which gadgets are essential to your trip and leave the rest at home. For instance, most smartphones now have impressive built-in cameras, making it unnecessary to carry a separate digital camera. Additionally, portable chargers and multi-purpose adapters can replace multiple cables and charging devices.  Tip: Invest in a dedicated travel tech organizer to keep your essential gadgets organized and easily accessible. Conclusion: Traveling light can make your journey more enjoyable, organized, and stress-free. By leaving valuables at home, ditching the toiletries, opting for digital reading material, and carefully selecting necessary gadgets, you can ensure a smooth and hassle-free travel experience. Embrace the freedom that comes with packing light, and discover the joy of exploring new places unburdened by the weight of unnecessary possessions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fifteen members of a group Respect the Flag face street gang charges from the incident near Atlanta in late July.

I've got a normal old carpet, nothing special or plush...and it does a half-you know what-job.

Knowing this information will help you tailor your efforts more effectively. Step 2: Develop strong basketball skills It is crucial to practice regularly and improve your basketball skills to showcase your talent to college coaches. Consider joining a local team or attending basketball camps to enhance your playing abilities and gain experience. Step 3: Excel academically Maintaining good grades and a high GPA is essential, as colleges and scholarship programs often consider both your athletic and academic achievements. Academic success can also lead to additional scholarship opportunities. Step 4: Create an athletic resume or portfolio Prepare a resume or portfolio that highlights your basketball achievements, statistics, awards, and any relevant experience such as team captainship. This document will be helpful when contacting coaches and applying for scholarships. Step 5: Record and compile game footage Coaches and recruiters often want to see you in action, so make sure to have game footage readily available, either through a personal website, social media, or video-sharing platform like YouTube. This will help showcase your skills and provide evidence of your talent on the court. Step 6: Attend college exposure camps and showcases Participate in exposure camps or showcases to gain visibility and network with college coaches. These events are designed to provide an opportunity for high school athletes to demonstrate their skills and receive recruiting attention.

It's not the Baroque film I expected it to be. The trailer (which I saw on a Something Weird DVD) is much better than the entire film, which is remarkably forgettable. There are almost no stand out scenes in it and the look and feel is interesting but it doesn't even come close to other Baroque styled movies out there, from Fellini or Jodorowsky. The characters are dull and there's almost nothing dramatic going on, even though we see rape, crucifixion, insanity, etc. The main problem with DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON was the fact that it was a talk-a-thon more than anything else.

Your statement emphasizes that your work leads you to multiple grocery stores - \\"dozens\\" in fact. The term \\"dozens\\" suggests a significant number, much more than just one store. Hence, your job appears to be characterized by visiting many different grocery stores, not persistently visiting a singular one. Also, the context provided suggests that you might be involved in either distribution of reading materials (the 'offensive babble-on-ion manuscripts'), inspection, or even some form of consultative work that requires a deep understanding of grocery store operations and employee habits across several locations.  A statement like \\"My job persistently takes me to one grocery store,\\" implies a focused, repetitive visit to one particular grocery store. This differs greatly from your original description where your role involves various grocery stores. However, while the statement doesn't follow as is, it could be true under certain conditions. For example, among the dozens of grocery stores you visit, if there is one particular store that requires more frequent or regular visits due to factors like higher demand, specific problems, or proximity to your workspace, your job could indeed be said to 'persistently take you to one grocery store.'

It makes difficult things seem easy, like getting all the right answers on the test. But it doesn't solve the problem of not knowing the material and it won't help on the next test --- unless the person cheats again. Some people lose respect for cheaters and think less of them. The cheaters themselves may feel bad because they know they are not really earning that good grade. And, if they get caught cheating, they will be in trouble at school, and maybe at home, too. Some kids cheat because they're busy or lazy and they want to get good grades without spending the time studying. Other kids might feel like they can't pass the test without cheating. Even when there seems to be a \\"good reason\\" for cheating, cheating isn't a good idea. If you were sick or upset about something the night before and couldn't study, it would be better to talk with the teacher about this.

What is the best way to: Dry school notebook.","output":"Drying a wet school notebook may require some time, patience, and specific techniques to minimize damage to the pages and ensure that the contents remain legible. Here is a step-by-step approach to dry your school notebook effectively: 1. Remove Excess Water: The first step is to remove as much water as possible from the notebook. Hold the notebook by its edge or spine, allowing gravity to drain the excess water. You can also gently shake the notebook to remove any remaining droplets. Be cautious not to tear or further damage the pages. 2. Blot and Absorb: Place the notebook on a clean, flat surface with the pages spread open. Lay some absorbent material, such as paper towels or tissue papers, between the wet pages to help absorb the moisture. Start by placing a paper towel every 10 to 20 pages. Press down gently on the pages to help the absorbent material soak up the moisture. Replace the wet towels with dry ones, repeating the process until they no longer absorb any water. Be mindful not to rub the pages as it may cause ink smudging or tearing. 3. Use a Fan or Air-dry: Set up a fan near the open notebook on a medium setting to encourage quicker evaporation of moisture. Ensure the fan is not blowing directly on the pages to avoid scattering them or further damaging the notebook. Alternatively, if you don't have access to a fan, leave the notebook in a well-ventilated area to air-dry. This process may take several hours or even days, depending on the amount of moisture and the type of paper. 4. Make Use of Heavy Books or Weights: As the pages of the notebook start drying, you may notice some warping or wrinkling. To minimize this issue, place a heavy book or a flat weight on top of the notebook. Be sure that the notebook is not completely dry before applying any weight; otherwise, it may damage the pages or cause them to stick together. 5. Use a Hairdryer or Iron (Optional): If you're in a hurry or need your notebook dried faster, you can cautiously use a hairdryer or an iron. Keep the hairdryer on a low heat or cool setting and maintain a safe distance from the pages to avoid burning or damaging them. Keep the dryer moving back and forth to evenly distribute the warm air. For the iron method, first, ensure the iron is on the lowest heat setting, and the steam function is turned off. Place a paper towel or thin cloth between the notebook page and the iron to avoid direct contact. Gently iron over the pages in a consistent motion to dry them out while avoiding any creases or burns. This method can be time-consuming as you will need to do this for each page, making it unsuitable for thick notebooks. 6. Monitor the Drying Process: Check the notebook periodically to assess the moisture level and to replace the paper towels or tissues if necessary. If using a fan, hairdryer, or iron, keep an eye on the notebook to ensure it is not over-dried or damaged. 7. Final Pressing: Once the notebook is entirely dry, close it, and place heavy books or weights on top. Leave it for at least a few hours or overnight to help flatten the pages further and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Remember, patience is key when it comes to drying a school notebook. The most effective method is allowing it to air-dry naturally, although it may take longer. Avoid microwaves or other high-heat methods, as they may cause irreversible damage to your notebook."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The story of Lady Godiva’s naked ride through the streets of Coventry has been a cornerstone of British folklore for 1,000 years. But now a Belgian chocolate manufacturer has sparked outrage by claiming it has exclusive rights to both her name and the famous image of her on top of a horse. The situation was exposed when lawyers acting for the confectionery giant fired a warning letter to a pub called The Lady Godiva last week, warning that it was infringing on its ‘intellectual property’. Owner Glen Simons was given a 90-day ultimatum to change his bar’s name and remove all references to the 11th Century noblewoman, whose daring protest at oppressive taxes has become the stuff of legend.

We understand that the inclusion of Lady Godiva's name and image in our branding and marketing efforts not only builds a strong connection to the British cultural heritage and a rich historical legacy, but also allows us to offer a unique and engaging proposition to consumers, both in the United Kingdom and worldwide. While we acknowledge that the story of Lady Godiva is a beloved part of British folklore, it is important to protect our brand identity and the significant investments we have made in developing our range of Lady Godiva-themed offerings. It is our mission to create value through our Lady Godiva brand and to continue innovating our offerings to meet the evolving taste preferences and demands of our global customer base. Legally, our company has taken significant steps to secure the rights to both the name \\"Lady Godiva\\" and the famous image of her on top of a horse. We have filed various trademark and copyright applications to protect our intellectual property and to ensure that no other business can profit from our efforts in building and promoting the Lady Godiva brand. That being said, we recognize the importance of coexistence and collaboration within the communities where our products are sold and enjoyed. We have approached the matter of The Lady Godiva pub with a great deal of sensitivity and respect, understanding that the pub owner and the local community might have a strong attachment to the historical figure and her actions against oppressive taxes. Rather than resorting to legal battles, we believe the most logical solution to this situation would be to initiate a dialogue with The Lady Godiva pub and to explore possible options that could benefit both parties without infringing on our intellectual property rights. These options could include: 1. Exploring a co-branding or licensing opportunity, where the pub could retain the use of the Lady Godiva name and image in exchange for certain brand-related commitments, potentially even incorporating our Lady Godiva-themed products and services within their establishment. 2. Offering financial or marketing assistance to the pub, helping them with the rebranding process to create a new identity that respects the historical significance of Lady Godiva but does not infringe on our intellectual property rights. 3. Encouraging the pub owner to come up with an alternative connection to British folklore or historical figures that are not under the protection of trademark or copyright law, and agreeing to collaborate on the creation of a new, shared identity that highlights the unique qualities of both The Lady Godiva pub and our Lady Godiva brand. In conclusion, while we must protect our legal rights to the Lady Godiva name and image, we believe that the most logical approach to completing this passage is to seek a resolution that embraces the shared values and interests of both our company and The Lady Godiva pub. By engaging in a respectful dialogue and exploring creative solutions, we can both maintain our commitment to promoting the rich cultural heritage of Britain, while respecting the need to protect our respective investments and brand equity."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer. Q: In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper. Your task is to classify whether the given title is suitable or not for the research paper based on the given paragraph. Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Paragraph: Arenaviruses cause severe diseases in humans but establish asymptomatic, lifelong infections in rodent reservoirs. Persistently-infected rodents harbor high levels of defective interfering (DI) particles, which are thought to be important for establishing persistence and mitigating virus-induced cytopathic effect. Little is known about what drives the production of DI particles. We show that neither the PPXY late domain encoded within the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) matrix protein nor a functional endosomal sorting complex transport (ESCRT) pathway is absolutely required for the generation of standard infectious virus particles. In contrast, DI particle release critically requires the PPXY late domain and is ESCRT-dependent. Additionally, the terminal tyrosine in the PPXY motif is reversibly phosphorylated and our findings indicate that this posttranslational modification may regulate DI particle formation. Thus we have uncovered a new role for the PPXY late domain and a possible mechanism for its regulation. Arenaviruses cause severe and often fatal diseases in humans yet typically establish lifelong, asymptomatic infections in their rodent reservoirs. Several families of enveloped RNA viruses, including the arenaviruses, encode short amino acid motifs, called late domains, to hijack host proteins in the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) to drive the release of virus particles from the host cell's outer membrane. Many late domain-containing viruses produce defective interfering (DI) particles in addition to standard, infectious virus. DI particles cannot self-replicate but interfere with the production of infectious virus and mitigate virus-induced cytopathic effect. Arenaviruses such as PLOS Pathogens | lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) generate high levels of DI particles, yet, the mechanism that drives their formation is not known. We show that LCMV's only encoded late domain, PPXY, and a functional ESCRT pathway are critical for DI particle production, but in contrast, are not absolutely required for infectious virus production. We also demonstrate that the LCMV PPXY late domain is phosphorylated and that this modification may regulate DI particle production. In summary, we have discovered a new and unexpected role for a viral late domain in selectively driving the production of DI particles independently of standard infectious virus particles. Arenaviruses are a family of rodent-borne viruses with a worldwide distribution. These viruses typically establish persistent, asymptomatic infections in rodent reservoir species [1]. In contrast, arenaviruses cause severe and often fatal diseases in humans. Several arenaviruses, including Lassa virus and Junín virus, cause hemorrhagic fever syndromes whereas infection with the prototypic arenavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), can lead to aseptic meningitis in immunocompetent individuals, high lethality in immunocompromised individuals, or severe birth defects in the developing fetus [2,3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccines do not exist for the prevention of arenavirus infection and effective antiviral therapies have been limited to the use of ribavirin for Lassa virus [4] or immune plasma for Junín virus [5] . Arenaviruses are enveloped viruses with a single-stranded, bi-segmented RNA genome that encodes four proteins in an ambisense manner. The small (S) segment encodes the nucleoprotein (NP) and glycoprotein (GP) while the large (L) segment encodes the RNAdependent RNA polymerase (L) and the matrix protein (Z) [6] . Arenaviruses enter cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis [7], undergo genomic replication and transcription in the cytoplasm [6], and assemble and bud new particles at the plasma membrane [8] . The Z protein, which lines the luminal side of the viral membrane, is responsible for a number of critical functions in the virus life cycle, including driving the process of viral particle assembly and budding [9] . Accordingly, Z can form virus-like particles (VLPs) in the absence of other viral proteins and is thought to be both necessary and sufficient for driving the budding process [10, 11] . Several VLP-based studies indicate that Z drives viral particle release by virtue of one or more encoded viral late domain(s) (P(S/T)AP, YXXL, and/or PPXY), which can recruit proteins from the cellular endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway [10] [11] [12] . ESCRT machinery is required for most cellular membrane scission events that result in separation away from the cytosol including multivesicular body formation and cellular abscission [13] [14] [15] . Many enveloped viruses are known to hijack cellular ESCRT machinery via their late domains to complete the final membrane scission step required for virions to bud from host membranes (for review see [16] ). Viruses from diverse families, including arenaviruses, produce defective interfering (DI) particles in addition to standard, infectious virus during the normal course of infection [17] . DI particles are largely similar to standard virus particles in their appearance and viral protein content but cannot self-replicate, and interfere with the production of homologous standard virus [17] . In many cases, the primary difference between DI particles and standard virus is thought to be the presence of deletions in the viral genome [18] . With regard to LCMV, small deletions in the terminal untranslated regions of genomic and antigenomic RNAs have been PPXY Late Domain Drives the Release of LCMV DI Particles PLOS Pathogens |   Title: The Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus Matrix Protein PPXY Late Domain Drives the Production of Defective Interfering Particles A:","output":"True I used the definition given in the task to determine if the title is suitable for the research paper based on the given paragraph.

The race pits controversial Republican Roy Moore, who is battling sexual harassment allegations, against Democrat Doug Jones, a former prosecutor. The outcome of the race could have national implications for both political parties and for President Donald Trump. Moore has denied several allegations of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s involving women who were teenagers at the time, including one who was 14. \\"I do not know them.

Plains Indians, Interior Plains Indians or Indigenous people of the Great Plains and Canadian Prairies are the Native American tribes and First Nation band governments who have traditionally lived on the greater Interior Plains (i.e. the Great Plains and the Canadian Prairies) in North America. Their historic nomadic culture and development of equestrian culture and resistance to domination by the government and military forces of Canada and the United States have made the Plains Indian culture groups an archetype in literature and art for American Indians everywhere. Plains Indians are usually divided into two broad classifications which overlap to some degree. The first group became a fully nomadic horse culture during the 18th and 19th centuries, following the vast herds of buffalo, although some tribes occasionally engaged in agriculture. The earliest Spanish explorers in the 16th century did not find the Plains Indians especially warlike. The Wichita in Kansas and Oklahoma lived in dispersed settlements with no defensive works. The Spanish initially had friendly contacts with the Apache (Querechos) in the Texas Panhandle.  Three factors led to a growing importance of warfare in Plains Indian culture. First, was the Spanish colonization of New Mexico which stimulated raids and counter-raids by Spaniards and Indians for goods and slaves. Second, was the contact of the Indians with French fur traders which increased rivalry among Indian tribes to control trade and trade routes. Third, was the acquisition of the horse and the greater mobility it afforded the Plains Indians. What evolved among the Plains Indians from the 17th to the late 19th century was warfare as both a means of livelihood and a sport.  The Plains Indians raided each other, the Spanish colonies, and, increasingly, the encroaching frontier of the Anglos for horses, and other property. They acquired guns and other European goods primarily by trade. Their principal trading products were buffalo hides and beaver pelts.  Although they could be tenacious in defense, Plains Indians warriors took the offensive mostly for material gain and individual prestige. The highest military honors were for \\"counting coup\\"--touching a live enemy. Battles between Indians often consisted of opposing warriors demonstrating their bravery rather than attempting to achieve concrete military objectives. The emphasis was on ambush and hit and run actions rather than closing with an enemy. Success was often counted by the number of horses or property obtained in the raid. Casualties were usually light. \\"Indians consider it foolhardiness to make an attack where it is certain some of them will be killed.\\"  Due to their mobility, endurance, horsemanship, and knowledge of the vast plains that were their domain, the Plains Indians were often victors in their battles against the U.S. army in the American era from 1803 to about 1890. However, although Indians won many battles, they could not undertake lengthy campaigns. Indian armies could only be assembled for brief periods of time as warriors also had to hunt for food for their families. The exception to that was raids into Mexico by the Comanche and their allies in which the raiders often subsisted for months off the riches of Mexican haciendas and settlements. The basic weapon of the Indian warrior was the short, stout bow, designed for use on horseback and deadly, but only at short range. Guns were usually in short supply and ammunition scarce for Native warriors. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Who did the plains indians have battles with","output":"The Plains Indians had battles with several groups. They fought with each other, as well as with the Spanish colonies, and later, with the people moving into their lands from the United States, this group of people are often referred to as the \\"Anglos\\" in history. They fought for many reasons, like getting more horses or other things they wanted, and also to show how brave and strong they were.

He is widely considered one of the most notable representatives of Early Netherlandish painting school. His work is known for its fantastic imagery, detailed landscapes, and illustrations of religious concepts and narratives. Within his lifetime his work was collected in the Netherlands, Austria, and Spain, and widely copied, especially his macabre and nightmarish depictions of hell.  - Sir Peter Paul Rubens (28 June 1577  30 May 1640) was a Flemish/Netherlandish draughtsman and painter. He is widely considered as the most notable artist of Flemish Baroque art school. A proponent of an extravagant Baroque style that emphasized movement, colour, and sensuality, Rubens is well known for his Counter-Reformation altarpieces, portraits, landscapes, and history paintings of mythological and allegorical subjects.  - The Prado Museum is the main Spanish national art museum, located in central Madrid. It features one of the world's finest collections of European art, dating from the 12th century to the early 20th century, based on the former Spanish Royal Collection, and unquestionably the best single collection of Spanish art. Founded as a museum of paintings and sculpture in 1819, it also contains important collections of other types of works. El Prado is one of the most visited sites in the world, and is considered one of the greatest museums of art in the world. The numerous works by Francisco de Goya, the single most extensively represented artist, as well as by Diego Velázquez, El Greco, Titian, Peter Paul Rubens and Hieronymus Bosch are some of the highlights of the collection.  - Tiziano Vecelli or Tiziano Vecellio (1488/1490  27 August 1576), known in English as Titian , was an Italian painter, the most important member of the 16th-century Venetian school. He was born in Pieve di Cadore, near Belluno (in Veneto, Republic of Venice). During his lifetime he was often called \\"da Cadore\\", taken from the place of his birth.  - Doménikos Theotokópoulos (; 1541 7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco, was a painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. \\"El Greco\\" (\\"The Greek\\") was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters,   (\\"Doménikos Theotokópoulos\\"), often adding the word  (\\"Krs\\", \\"Cretan\\").  - The Dog is the name usually given to a painting by Spanish artist Francisco Goya , now in the Museo del Prado , Madrid .

Q:Information:  - Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, or SFWA (or ) is a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization of professional science fiction and fantasy writers in the United States. It was founded in 1965 by Damon Knight under the name Science Fiction Writers of America, Inc. The president of SFWA as of 2015 is Cat Rambo.  - Big science is a term used by scientists and historians of science to describe a series of changes in science which occurred in industrial nations during and after World War II, as scientific progress increasingly came to rely on large-scale projects usually funded by national governments or groups of governments. Individual or small group efforts, or Small Science, is still relevant today as theoretical results by individual authors may have a significant impact, but very often the empirical verification requires experiments using constructions, such as the Large Hadron Collider, costing between 5 and 10 billion.  - Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful.  - The Ringworld Throne is a novel by Larry Niven , first published in 1996 . It is the direct sequel to his previous work The Ringworld Engineers ( 1980 ) . He wrote it as a replacement after being unable to finish his contracted novel The Ghost Ships , the sequel to The Integral Trees and The Smoke Ring .  - The Integral Trees is a 1984 science fiction novel by Larry Niven (first published as a serial in \\"Analog\\" in 1983). Like much of Niven's work, the story is heavily influenced by the setting: a gas torus, a ring of air around a neutron star. A sequel, \\"The Smoke Ring\\", was published in 1987.  - A neutron star is the collapsed core of a large (1029 solar masses) star. Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stars known to exist. Though neutron stars typically have a radius on the order of 10 km, they can have masses of about twice that of the Sun. They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star, combined with gravitational collapse, that compresses the core past the white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei. Most of the basic models for these objects imply that neutron stars are composed almost entirely of neutrons, which are subatomic particles with no net electrical charge and with slightly larger mass than protons. They are supported against further collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure, a phenomenon described by the Pauli exclusion principle. If the remnant has too great a density, something which occurs in excess of an upper limit of the size of neutron stars at 2-3 solar masses, it will continue collapsing to form a black hole.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - The Magic Goes Away is a fantasy short story written by Larry Niven in 1976, and later expanded to a novella of the same name which was published in 1978. While these works were not the first in the \\"Magic Universe\\" or \\"Warlock\\" series, they marked a turning point after the 1973 oil crisis and Niven's subsequent transformation of the series into an allegory for a modern-day energy crisis. The setting was later used as a backdrop for a series of full-length novels, \\"The Burning City\\" (2000) and its sequel, \\"Burning Tower\\" (2005), which were co-written with Jerry Pournelle.  - Laurence van Cott Niven (born April 30, 1938)known as Larry Nivenis an American science fiction writer. His best-known work is \\"Ringworld\\" (1970), which received Hugo, Locus, Ditmar, and Nebula awards. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America named him the 2015 recipient of the Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award. His work is primarily hard science fiction, using big science concepts and theoretical physics. It also often includes elements of detective fiction and adventure stories. His fantasy includes the series \\"The Magic Goes Away\\", rational fantasy dealing with magic as a non-renewable resource.  - Detective fiction is a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or a detectiveeither professional or amateurinvestigates a crime, often murder.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - The Locus Awards are an annual set of literary awards by the science fiction and fantasy magazine \\"Locus\\", a monthly based in Oakland, California, United States. The award winners are selected by poll of magazine readers.  - Ringworld is a 1970 science fiction novel by Larry Niven, set in his Known Space universe and considered a classic of science fiction literature. Niven later added four sequels and four prequels. (The Fleet of Worlds series, co-written with Edward M. Lerner provides the four prequels as well as \\"Fate of Worlds\\", the final sequel.) These books tie into numerous other books set in Known Space. \\"Ringworld\\" won the Nebula Award in 1970, as well as both the Hugo Award and Locus Award in 1971.  - The Ringworld Engineers is a 1980 science fiction novel by Larry Niven. It is the first sequel to Niven's award-winning \\"Ringworld\\" and was nominated for both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1981.  - The Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award is a lifetime honor presented annually by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America to no more than one living writer of fantasy or science fiction. It was inaugurated in 1975 when Robert Heinlein was made the first SFWA Grand Master and it was renamed in 2002 after the Association's founder, Damon Knight, who had died that year.

The Commission's response to the crisis could not, therefore, be formulated globally but has taken into account the situation of each country. Translate to Romanian Romanian:","output":"Răspunsul Comisiei la criză nu a putut, prin urmare, să fie formulat la nivel global, ci a luat în considerare situația fiecărei țări. În contextul crizei, Comisia Europeană a fost nevoită să adapteze și să formuleze măsuri specifice pentru fiecare țară în parte, în loc să adopte o abordare globală. Acest lucru a fost necesar, deoarece nivelul de impact și nevoile diferitelor țări variază în mod semnificativ, astfel încât o strategie globală ar fi fost insuficientă în abordarea problemelor cu care se confruntă fiecare națiune. Mai întâi, Comisia a trebuit să identifice zonele-cheie în care erau necesare intervenții, precum sănătatea publică, sistemul economic și piața muncii. De asemenea, a fost important să se analizeze severitatea crizei și vulnerabilitățile specifice ale fiecărei țări. Acest lucru a permis Comisiei să adopte o perspectivă multilaterală și să coordoneze eforturile la nivel național și european în contextul politicii de coeziune și al politicii economice și sociale.  Un exemplu al abordării diferențiate a fost crearea de instrumente financiare la nivel european, cum ar fi: Mecanismul European de Stabilitate (MES), Fondul European pentru Investiții Strategice (FEIS) și programul SURE (Suport temporar pentru atenuarea riscului de șomaj în situația de urgență). Aceste instrumente au fost concepute pentru a ajuta statele membre să facă față impactului economic negativ cauzat de criza pandemică și pentru a facilita redresarea lor. De asemenea, pentru a aborda problemele de sănătate publică, Comisia a inclus în Planul European de Redresare și Reziliență (PERR) inițiative specifice în domeniul sănătății, cum ar fi EU4Health și fonduri dedicate reșelelor de sănătate și infrastructurii medicale. În plus, Comisia a coordonat eforturile în ceea ce privește procurarea și distribuirea vaccinurilor, precum și gestionarea frontierelor în interiorul spațiului Schengen. Pe lângă aceste măsuri, Comisia a adoptat, de asemenea, o serie de inițiative pentru a sprijini IMM-urile și pentru a proteja ocuparea forței de muncă în cadrul Programului de lucru al Comisiei Europene pentru 2021. Printre aceste inițiative se numără planurile naționale de investiții și reforme, precum și mecanisme pentru a facilita accesul la finanțare și partajarea riscului. În concluzie, Comisia Europeană a răspuns la criza generată de pandemie printr-o abordare diferențiată și adaptată situației fiecărei țări, luând în considerare circumstanțele și provocările specifice.

Options: - become adults - wonder about - open door - became healthy - distracting  Explain why a human would choose \\"distracting\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"\\"Distracting\\" would be the most feasible answer for the aforementioned question about the effects of the TV on kids, from the given options. This option directly relates to the substantial influence that television can play in children's daily lives, and has several underlying reasons pertaining to a child's mental, physical, and social development. First and foremost, when children spend substantial amounts of time in front of the television, it can detract from other important activities such as homework, reading, family conversation, or physical activity, leading to the interpretation of TV as a distraction. It absorbs time that they could use to develop necessary life skills, discover personal interests, or engage in creative play. In terms of mental development, TV can compete with quiet contemplation or reading that can foster creativity and critical thinking skills in children. This potential loss of cognitive development is a form of distraction. From a physical perspective, excess TV can promote a sedentary lifestyle and can lead to childhood obesity. This can create a mode of life that pushes physical activity into the periphery, distracting kids from the importance of maintaining their health. Moreover, social development could be hampered due to spending more time with technology than with people. Children risk losing out on essential interpersonal and communication skills. These issues frame the television as a device that distracts children from exploring and learning about the world around them in a beneficial, hands-on manner. The other options – \\"become adults,\\" \\"wonder about,\\" \\"open door,\\" and \\"became healthy\\" – don't suitably capture the broad impact television can have on children. None of these speak to common concerns about TV's effect on a child's growth and development.  \\"Become adults\\" may not be accurate as watching TV doesn't necessarily precipitate maturity or take on adult responsibilities. \\"Wonder about\\" might hint at a stimulating effect, but it's less specific than \\"distracting\\" about the type of impact. \\"Open door\\" is too ambiguous - it could mean an intellectual 'opening of doors' or otherwise, but without context it's unclear. \\"Became healthy\\" could also be misleading as although there could be educational health programs, incessant TV watching is often linked to an unhealthy, sedentary lifestyle in kids. Therefore, \\"distracting\\" stands out as the best choice from the options, considering the acknowledged negative impacts excessive TV watching can have on the overall development of children."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.  After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. When will fresh skin cells ready for treatment occur when cleansing skin? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - not enough information - after using water - after using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser - after using soap A:","output":"After using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Although makeup can be great for hiding acne, it can also cause breakouts. Over applying makeups or using particularly oily products can clog your pores and lead to infections. If you are getting breakouts on certain parts of your face, try a different product and see if it clears up.  In general, try to use products that are oil-free or noncomedogenic. You should also look for makeups that contain acne-fighting ingredients. Always remove your makeup before you go to bed. If your skin is particularly oily, you may need to use a special makeup remover instead of simply washing your face. If you suffer from breakouts on your forehead, scalp, neck, and back, the culprit may be your hair products. Products like gels, pomades, and sprays tend to block pores and irritate your skin. They can also cause allergic reactions that can result in acne. To avoid acne, experiment with different products to find one that does not irritate your skin.  In general, look for products with shorter and more natural ingredient lists. In particular, look for products that are fragrance-free and noncomedogenic (non-pore clogging). To avoid using too much product, consider washing your hair two or three times a week or rinse it with conditioner daily. You might also want to consider sleeping with your hair up to avoid rolling around in your dirty hair all night. If you believe that you are having an allergic reaction to a certain product, quit using it and talk to your doctor or a dermatologist. You may want to be tested so you know what to avoid in the future. Because your hands come in contact with numerous objects during the day, they can transfer countless bacteria to your face, resulting in breakouts. If you rest your head in your hands, you may get breakouts on your chin or cheeks. To avoid this, wash your hands regularly and try to touch your face as little as possible. If you tend to get breakouts around your nose, your glasses may be the culprit. Your glasses house bacteria that can cause infections. In addition, they rub and put pressure on your skin, which can irritate it and stimulate oil production. If your glasses are causing you acne, consider using a spot treatment or ditching your glasses entirely and wear contacts. Be sure to regularly clean the nose pads of your glasses by washing them with hot soapy water. This remove any bacteria that might cause a breakout. Whenever you pull hairs from a follicle, you create an opening that is susceptible to infection. If you have your eyebrows plucked or any facial hair waxed, such as around your mouth and chin, you might see some breakouts. To avoid this, limit how often you pluck or wax any facial hairs.  Shaving can have a similar effect, especially if you use a dull razor that pulls the hairs from the follicle instead of cutting them. Try sugaring or threading as alternatives to plucking or waxing. If you must pluck or wax your hair, use some basic precautions to avoid potential breakouts:  Gently exfoliate and cleanse your skin before plucking or waxing. Use an anti-microbial pre-wax cleanser. Carefully clean your hands and nails before plucking and waxing, and wear disposable gloves during waxing and cleanup. Cleanse again after plucking or waxing, and gently exfoliate the next day. Keep the freshly waxed or plucked areas clean and free from sweat, dirt, or irritating products. Because most people take them everywhere (even to the bathroom) and touch them constantly, cellular phones are covered in bacteria. Whenever you talk on your phones, you are rubbing those bacteria all over your face. This can lead to breakouts on your cheeks and chin.   To avoid any phone-related breakouts, consider using your phone's speaker function or getting a hands-free Bluetooth headpiece. You can also minimize phone-related breakouts by regularly cleaning your phone with antibacterial wipes. What is a summary?","output":"In summary, makeup and certain hair products can cause acne breakouts due to clogged pores, infections, and allergic reactions. To prevent acne, use oil-free, noncomedogenic, and fragrance-free products, and remove makeup before going to bed. Washing hair a few times a week and sleeping with it up can also help. Avoid touching your face with dirty hands, and clean glasses regularly to prevent breakouts around the nose. Plucking, waxing, and shaving can cause breakouts, so try alternative hair removal methods or take extra precautions before and after hair removal. Lastly, mobile phones carry bacteria that cause breakouts; using the speaker function or cleaning the phone with antibacterial wipes can help prevent acne."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ambassador Susan Rice is the leading contender to become the White House’s new national security adviser, following a failed bid to become secretary of state, a senior Obama administration official told Fox News this weekend. President Obama could appoint Rice without the Senate confirmation needed for a Cabinet post. Rice withdrew herself from consideration for the secretary of state post in the face of withering criticism by congressional Republicans and others for her handling of the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2012, Libya terror attacks. Five days after the attacks that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans at a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, Rice said the attacks appeared spontaneous and sparked by an anti-Islamic video. Rice, 48, later said she gave an incorrect account, based on intelligence reports at the time. However, subsequent meetings with leading Senate Republicans appeared only to increase her lack of support for the Cabinet post. This weekend, the administration official told Fox a Rice appointment is not imminent because the president still has to find an ambassadorship or another post for current National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon. Fox first reported last year, shortly after the outcome of the November elections, that Rice might get the NSA post –- under the assumption Donilon might become the new White House chief of staff. Donilon did not get the job so the president must first find a new post for him before moving Rice.

Many economists make the case that this understates the magnitude of growth, as many of the goods and services consumed at the end of the 20th century, such as improved medicine (causing world life expectancy to increase by more than two decades) and communications technologies, were not available at any price at its beginning. However, the gulf between the world's rich and poor grew wider, and the majority of the global population remained in the poor side of the divide.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"The answer to the question \\"What much was surpassed in the 20th century?\\" can be found in the given passage. Over the course of the 20th century, significant advancements and growth were observed in various aspects of human life, including economics, technology, and medicine. Firstly, the world's per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) grew by a factor of five during the 20th century. This growth was much more than all earlier centuries combined, including the 19th century, which is known for its Industrial Revolution. This implies that the economic progress made during the 20th century greatly surpassed that of previous centuries, making it a period of remarkable growth and development. Another important aspect highlighted in the passage is the role of technology and its impact on human life. The passage contends that many economists believe that the mere economic growth figures might actually understate the true magnitude of development that occurred during the 20th century. One reason for this is the availability and consumption of various goods and services at the end of the 20th century that were unimaginable at its beginning. Improved medicine, for instance, led to a significant increase in global life expectancy, which rose by more than two decades. Communications technologies also underwent a massive transformation, revolutionizing the way people connected with each other. However, the passage also indicates that the 20th century witnessed a widening gap between the rich and the poor. While considerable progress was made in various fields, the majority of the global population remained on the poorer side of this divide. This implies that the benefits and advancements of the 20th century were not evenly distributed or accessible to everyone. In summary, the 20th century surpassed earlier centuries in terms of economic growth, technological advancements, and improvements in medicine. However, this progress was accompanied by a growing economic divide between the rich and the poor, which left the majority of the global population struggling to access the benefits arising from these advancements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

James Fenimore Cooper (September 15, 1789 - September 14, 1851) was a prolific and popular American writer of the first half of the 19th century. His historical romances draw a picture of frontier and American Indian life in the early American days which created a unique form of American literature. He lived most of his life in Cooperstown, New York, which was founded by his father William on property that he owned. Cooper was a lifelong member of the Episcopal Church and contributed generously to it. James Fenimore Cooper was born in Burlington, New Jersey in 1789 to William Cooper and Elizabeth (Fenimore) Cooper, the eleventh of 12 children, most of whom died during infancy or childhood. He was descended from James Cooper of Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, England, who immigrated to the American colonies in 1679.  Shortly after James' first birthday, his family moved to Cooperstown, New York, a community founded by his father on a large piece of land which he had bought for development. Later, his father was elected to the United States Congress as a representative from Otsego County. Their town was in a central area of New York that had previously been occupied by the Iroquois, who had allied themselves with the British during the Revolutionary War and were forced to cede the territory after British defeat. The State of New York opened the land for sale and development after the war, and Cooper's father purchased several thousand acres in upstate along the headwaters of the Susquehanna River. By 1788, William Cooper had selected and surveyed the site where Cooperstown would be established. He erected a home on the shore of Otsego lake and moved his family there in the autumn of 1790. He soon began construction of the mansion that became known as Otsego Hall, completed in 1799 when James was ten.  Cooper was enrolled at Yale University at age 13, but he incited a dangerous prank which involved blowing up another student's door -- after having already locked a donkey in a recitation room. He was expelled in his third year without completing his degree, so he obtained work in 1806 as a sailor and joined the crew of a merchant vessel at age 17. By 1811, he obtained the rank of midshipman in the fledgling United States Navy, conferred upon him on an officer's warrant signed by Thomas Jefferson.  At 20, Cooper inherited a fortune from his father. He married Susan Augusta de Lancey at Mamaroneck, Westchester County, New York on January 1, 1811 at age 21. She was from a wealthy family who remained loyal to Great Britain during the Revolution. The Coopers had seven children, five of whom lived to adulthood. Their daughter Susan Fenimore Cooper was a writer on nature, female suffrage, and other topics. She and her father often edited each other's work. Among his descendants was Paul Fenimore Cooper (1899-1970), who also became a writer.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Who did they side with","output":"The text provided does not have any article with a quote to answer the question \\"Who did they side with.\\" If you could provide the article, I would be more than happy to provide the quote and answer the question accordingly."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Answer a question about this article: Unicode has the explicit aim of transcending the limitations of traditional character encodings, such as those defined by the ISO 8859 standard, which find wide usage in various countries of the world but remain largely incompatible with each other. Many traditional character encodings share a common problem in that they allow bilingual computer processing (usually using Latin characters and the local script), but not multilingual computer processing (computer processing of arbitrary scripts mixed with each other). What is the major limitation of traditional character encodings?","output":"The major limitation of traditional character encodings, such as those defined by the ISO 8859 standard, is their inability to effectively support multilingual computer processing. These character encodings were developed to accommodate the growing need for digitally representing text in different languages, but they were designed specifically for bilingual processing. This means that while they perform well when dealing with Latin characters and a local script, they struggle to handle arbitrary scripts mixed with each other.  Traditional character encodings have a limited repertoire of characters – typically accommodating a specific region or a limited set of languages. As a result, they lack a unified and comprehensive character set which can address the textual needs of multiple languages simultaneously. This limitation forces computers and software systems to switch between different encodings, risking data loss, character corruption, and compatibility issues when sharing or displaying text between users with different systems, languages, or regions. Unicode was introduced to overcome these limitations by providing a universal character encoding system. It aims to assign a unique code point to every character used in written languages across the world, encompassing not only modern languages but also historical scripts and special symbols. By transcending the limitations of traditional character encodings, Unicode enables more efficient, accurate, and streamlined multilingual computing, allowing computer processing of various scripts mixed seamlessly with one another. This benefits users, developers, and industries by promoting easier communication, preserving the integrity of textual content, and reducing the complexity of multilingual software development."},{"instruction":"Gary and Joe are two farmers.

Nigerians turn out en masse to vote in tight presidential election ABUJA, Nigeria — Nigerians turned out en masse to vote in a presidential election Saturday that analysts say is too close to call between President Goodluck Jonathan and former military dictator Muhammadu Buhari. A car bomb exploded at a polling station in south-central Enugu state but police said none of the voters lining up was hurt in the 7:30 a.m. blast.

Muhammadu Buhari, shake hands after signing a renewal of their pledge to hold peaceful “free, fair and credible” elections.Photo: AP Police detonated two other car bombs at the scene, a primary school, said Enugu state police Commissioner Dan Bature. The explosion occurred far from the northeastern center of the Islamic uprising by Nigeria’s home-grown Boko Haram. Voters in the oil-rich south who traditionally support President Goodluck Jonathan could determine the outcome of the first election in Nigeria’s history where an opposition candidate has a realistic chance of defeating a sitting president. Polling stations opened late in many areas as official rushed across the country delivering ballot materials by trucks, speedboats, motorcycles, mules and even camels, in the case of a northern mountaintop village, according to spokesman Kayode Idowu of the Independent National Electoral Commission. Streets are deserted. Only electoral officials, observers, security officials and media with relevant stickers are allowed to use the roads.

Jonathan and Buhari are front-runners among 14 candidates who want to govern Africa’s most populous nation beset by a northeastern Islamic uprising. Buhari, resplendent in white robes, was the first voter to have his fingerprints taken at a polling station that opened a half hour late in Daura, his hometown in northern Katsina state. The registration of Jonathan, in black with his trademark Fedora hat, was delayed in the southern oil-rich state of Bayelsa. Three newly imported card readers failed to recognize his fingerprints, and his wife’s. He returned two hours later and was accredited without the machine. Biometric cards and readers are being used for the first time to discourage the kind of fraud that has marred previous votes. Afterward, Jonathan wiped sweat from his brow and urged people to be patient as he had, telling Channels TV: “I appeal to all Nigerians to be patient no matter the pains it takes as long as if, as a nation, we can conduct free and fair elections that the whole world will accept.” Trader Angela Okele expressed concern after getting accredited in Port Harcourt, Nigeria’s southern oil capital. “The process is too slow, if it continues like this many people will not be able to cast their votes today,” she said. Men sing and hold up their ID cards as they wait in line at a polling station in Kano.

At Jere, a town 38 miles north of Abuja, electoral officials said they had only one card reader, which has a capacity for about 700 voters, and twice as many people lined up. An official was sent by motorcycle to collect another. This is only the eighth election since Nigeria’s independence from Britain in 1960. In a country steeped in a history of military coups and bloodshed caused by politics, ethnicity, land disputes, oil theft and, lately, the Boko Haram Islamic uprising, the election is important as Africa’s richest nation consolidates its democracy. An elderly woman holds up her voter registration card. Polling stations opened late in many areas as official rushed across the country delivering ballot materials by trucks, speedboats, motorcycles, mules and even camels.Photo: Getty Images There’s a lot of international interest, especially among nervous foreign investors as Nigeria is Africa’s largest destination for direct foreign investment. Its oil-dependent economy is hurting from slashed petroleum prices. Nigeria’s military announced Friday it had destroyed the headquarters of Boko Haram’s so-called Islamic caliphate and driven the insurgents from all major areas in northeast Nigeria, a claim that seems unlikely. There was no way to verify the report. Critics of Jonathan have said recent military victories after months of ceding territory to the Islamic extremists are a ploy to win votes — a charge the presidential campaign denies. The failure of Jonathan’s administration to curb the insurgency, which killed about 10,000 people last year, has angered many Nigerians especially in the north. International outrage has grown over another failure — the rescue of 219 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram nearly a year ago. The extremists have abducted hundreds more since then, using them as sex slaves and fighters. Jonathan and Buhari on Thursday signed a peace pledge and promised to accept the results of a free and fair election. But already dozens have been killed amid hate speech highlighting the religious, ethnic and geographic divisions among Nigerians. Voters from an Internally Displaced People camp, who fled areas affected by Boko Haram violence, line up at a polling station in Maiduguri. Electoral officials have stressed that voting will not end until the very last person in line has voted.Photo: Getty Images The Islamic uprising has exacerbated relations between Christians like Jonathan, who dominate the oil-rich south, and Muslims like Buhari who are the majority in the agricultural and cattle-herding lands of the north. The population of 170 million is almost evenly divided between Christians and Muslims. Some 1,000 people were killed in rioting after Buhari lost to Jonathan in the 2011 elections. Thousands of Nigerians and foreign workers have left the country amid fears of post-election violence. In 2011, there was no doubt that Jonathan had swept the polls by millions of votes. Now the race is much closer. The game-changer that transformed Nigeria’s political landscape came two years ago when the main opposition parties formed a coalition and for the first time united behind one candidate, Buhari. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"Here's the important parts of the story explained like I'm talking to a five year old: A very important event happened in Nigeria, a big country in Africa, where people were deciding who they wanted to be their big leader, the president. The two main people who could become the president were a man named Goodluck Jonathan, who was already the president, and another man named Muhammadu Buhari.  Lots and lots of people came out to vote. Voting is when people pick who they want to be their leader. Sometimes, these people had to wait in long lines before they could vote.  There were some scary parts too. There were car bombs at one place where people were supposed to vote. Car bombs are very dangerous and can hurt people but thankfully, no one got hurt. To stop any kind of cheating during voting, special cards and machines were used. But these new machines made the voting process a bit slow. But the officials said that everyone who wanted to vote can vote, even if it takes all day and night. This election was important because Nigeria has had some difficult times because of violence and people not getting along. The results of this vote could change a lot of things. It's a bit like when we decide on a new game to play, it could change the way we all play together.  Also, a bad group called Boko Haram has been causing trouble in the country and the current president, Mr. Jonathan, has been criticized for not being able to stop them. So, people's votes might also be influenced by how they feel about that. It's just like when you choose to play with the kid who promises to stop the school bully.  Lastly, this is one of the first times that the opponent, Mr. Buhari, has a good chance of winning against the current president. So everyone is really interested to see what happens and hoping that all goes peacefully.

Article: AFP | Armed men passing a burning house on 7 September 2017 in the Burmese state of Rakhine, where many Rohingya live.      The UN human rights chief on Monday slammed Myanmar's apparent \\"systematic attack\\" on the Rohingya minority, warning that \\"ethnic cleansing\\" seemed to be underway.      \\"Because Myanmar has refused access to human rights investigators the current situation cannot yet be fully assessed, but the situation seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing,\\" Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein told the UN Human Rights Council.      The Rohingya are reviled in Myanmar, where the roughly one million-strong community are accused of being illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.      The United Nations says 294,000 bedraggled and exhausted Rohingya refugees have arrived in Bangladesh since the militants' attacks on Myanmar security forces in neighbouring Rakhine state on August 25 sparked a major military backlash.      Tens of thousands more are believed to be on the move inside Rakhine after more than two weeks without shelter, food and water.      \\"The operation... is clearly disproportionate and without regard for basic principles of international law,\\" Zeid said.      \\"We have received multiple reports and satellite imagery of security forces and local militia burning Rohingya villages, and consistent accounts of extrajudicial killings, including shooting fleeing civilians,\\" he said.

He said he was particularly \\"appalled\\" by reports that Myanmar authorities had begun laying landmines along the border with Bangladesh to prevent those who fled from returning.      He also criticised \\"official statements that refugees who have fled the violence will only be allowed back if they can provide 'proof of nationality',\\" pointing out that Myanmar since 1962 had been stripping Rohingyas of a wide range of rights, including citizenship rights.      \\"This measure resembles a cynical ploy to forcibly transfer large numbers of people without possibility of return,\\" he said.      Zeid urged the Myanmar government to \\"stop pretending that the Rohingyas are setting fire to their own homes and laying waste to their own villages.\\"      \\"This complete denial of reality is doing great damage to the international standing of a government which, until recently, benefited from immense good will,\\" he said, calling on authorities to allow his office access to investigate the situation in the country.

Speaking as she visited a refugee camp, Sheikh Hasina urged Myanmar to view the situation with humanity, saying innocent people were suffering.      Some 370,000 Rohingyas have crossed the border since violence began last month.      Myanmar's military says it is fighting Rohingya militants and denies it is targeting civilians.      But many of those who have fled say troops responded to attacks by Rohingya militants on 25 August with a brutal campaign of violence and village burnings aimed at driving them out.      The BBC has spoken to Rohingyas maimed by landmines as they fled Myanmar. Bangladeshi sources say Myanmar's army recently planted new mines - an allegation denied by Myanmar officials.      The Rohingyas, a stateless mostly Muslim minority in Buddhist-majority Rakhine, have long experienced persecution in Myanmar, which says they are illegal immigrants.      Bangladesh is already home to hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas who have fled previous outbreaks of violence in Myanmar.      Its two official refugee camps are full and aid agencies say the new arrivals desperately need food, shelter and medical help.      'These people... are suffering'      Sheikh Hasina's comments came as she visited the Kutupalong camp, one of the official camps.      \\"My personal message is very clear, that they should consider this situation with the eyes of humanity,\\" she told the BBC.

How they can deny that they are not their citizens?\\"      The Bangladesh prime minister said her country would offer Rohingyas shelter until Myanmar took them back.      She also condemned the militants for their role in the violence, but said Myanmar's government should have dealt with the situation more patiently.

About 32,000 registered refugees live in the two official camps, but more than 300,000 undocumented Rohingyas were also estimated to be in Bangladesh before this latest influx.      Bangladesh says their presence strains local resources, increases crime and deters tourists in the Cox's Bazar area.      Earlier this year, it backed a plan to transfer them to an island in the Bay of Bengal, Thengar Char, but rights groups said the island was unfit for human habitation due to seasonal flooding.      International condemnation grows      Myanmar is facing mounting criticism over the Rohingya crisis and there have been protests in several Muslim-majority nations.      UN human rights chief Zeid Raad al-Hussein said on Monday that the security operation in Rakhine appeared to be \\"a textbook example of ethnic cleansing\\".

The UN Security Council is due to meet on Wednesday to discuss the Rakhine crisis. ||||| COX’S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Pressure mounted on Myanmar on Tuesday to end violence that has sent about 370,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh, with the United States calling for protection of civilians and Bangladesh urging safe zones to enable refugees to go home.      But China, which competes for influence in its southern neighbor with the United States, said it backed Myanmar’s efforts to safeguard “development and stability”.      The government of Buddhist-majority Myanmar says its security forces are fighting Rohingya militants behind a surge of violence in Rakhine state that began on Aug. 25, and they are doing all they can to avoid harming civilians.      The government says about 400 people have been killed in the fighting, the latest in the western state.      The top U.N. human rights official denounced Myanmar on Monday for conducting a “cruel military operation” against Rohingya, branding it “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing”.      The United States said the violent displacement of the Rohingya showed Myanmar’s security forces were not protecting civilians. Washington has been a staunch supporter of Myanmar’s transition from decades of harsh military rule that is being led by Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.      “We call on Burmese security authorities to respect the rule of law, stop the violence, and end the displacement of civilians from all communities,” the White House said in a statement.      Myanmar government spokesmen were not immediately available for comment but the foreign ministry said shortly before the U.S. statement was issued that Myanmar was also concerned about the suffering. Its forces were carrying out their legitimate duty to restore order in response to acts of extremism.      “The government of Myanmar fully shares the concern of the international community regarding the displacement and suffering of all communities affected by the latest escalation of violence ignited by the acts of terrorism,” the ministry said in a statement.      Myanmar’s government regards Rohingya as illegal migrants from Bangladesh and denies them citizenship, even though many Rohingya families have lived there for generations.      Attacks by a Rohingya insurgent group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), on police posts and an army base in the north of Rakhine on Aug. 25 provoked the military counter-offensive that refugees say is aimed at pushing Rohingya out of the country.      A similar but smaller wave of attacks by the same insurgents last October also sparked what critics called a heavy-handed response by the security forces that sent 87,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh.      Reports from refugees and rights groups paint a picture of widespread attacks on Rohingya villages in the north of Rakhine by the security forces and ethnic Rakhine Buddhists, who have put numerous Muslim villages to the torch.      But Myanmar authorities have denied that the security forces, or Buddhist civilians, have been setting the fires, instead blaming the insurgents. Nearly 30,000 Buddhist villagers have also been displaced, they say.      ‘STOP THE VIOLENCE’      The U.N. Security Council is to meet on Wednesday behind closed doors for the second time during the crisis since Aug. 25. British U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft said he hoped there would be a public statement agreed by the council on the crisis.      “It is important that the Security Council plays its role in responding,” said Sweden’s U.N. Ambassador Olof Skoog said on Tuesday. Britain and Sweden requested the meeting.      However, rights groups slammed the 15-member council for not holding a public meeting. Diplomats have said China and Russia would likely object to such a move and protect Myanmar if there was any push for council action to try and end the crisis.

It’s appalling, frankly,” Human Rights Watch U.N. director Louis Charbonneau told reporters on Tuesday.      Sherine Tadros, head Amnesty International in New York, said if the council doesn’t act “the price is being paid.”      “The danger is without some sort of public proclamation by Security Council members ... the message that you’re sending to the Myanmar government is deadly, and they will continue to do it,” Tadros told reporters.      The exodus to Bangladesh shows no sign of slowing with 370,000 the latest estimate, according to a U.N. refugee agency spokeswoman, up from an estimate of 313,000 on the weekend.      Bangladesh was already home to about 400,000 Rohingyas.      Many refugees are hungry and sick, without shelter or clean water in the middle of the rainy season. The United Nations said 200,000 children needed urgent support.      Two emergency flights organized by the U.N. refugee agency arrived in Bangladesh with aid for about 25,000 refugees. More flights are planned with the aim of helping 120,000, a spokesman said.      Worry is also growing about conditions inside Rakhine State, with fears a hidden humanitarian crisis may be unfolding. Myanmar has rejected a ceasefire declared by ARSA to enable the delivery of aid there, saying it did not negotiate with terrorists.      But Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said Myanmar should set up safe zones to enable the refugees to go home.      “Myanmar will have to take back all Rohingya refugees who entered Bangladesh,” Hasina said on a visit to the Cox’s Bazar border district where she distributed aid.      Slideshow (12 Images)      “Myanmar has created the problem and they will have to solve it,” she said, adding: “We want peaceful relations with our neighbors, but we can’t accept any injustice.      “Stop this violence against innocent people.”      Myanmar has said those who can verify their citizenship can return but most Rohingya are stateless.      In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said, “The international community should support Myanmar in its efforts to safeguard development and stability.” ||||| [versi Bahasa Indonesia]            In the past week, it has been reported that the military under Aung San Suu Kyi’s Government of Myanmar has been attacking the predominantly muslim Rohingyas in Rakhine, Myanmar. According to the reports, the Rohingyas — including women and children — have been killed and physically tortured. According to the European Rohingya Council (ERC), 3,000 Rohingyas have been killed within three days between 25 and 27 August, 2017. Their villages have been burned to the ground. The military claimed that this was an effort to eliminate terrorism.      Until this second, the de facto ruler of Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi has done virtually nothing to stop this crime against humanity in her country. As a result, there are many of the Rohingyas fled their homes and are stranded in the Myanmar’s border with Bangladesh. The International Organization of Migration (IOM) reported that there are at least 18,445 Rohingya refugees currently fled the area (bbc.com).      But Suu Kyi as a Nobel Peace Prize laureate appears to be deaf and have done nothing to protect her citizens. Meanwhile, in 2013, Suu Kyi made a controversial statement that appeared to be anti-Islam.      “No one told me that I was to be interviewed by a muslim.”      This statement was made by Aung San Suu Kyi, after her interview by a BBC Today anchor, Mishal Husain, in 2013. Suu Kyi’s disappointment may be caused by the question asked by Husain on the hardships experienced by muslims in Myanmar. Suu Kyi was also asked to condemn the anti-muslims and those who acted violently against the muslims that led the Rohingyas to leave Myanmar (from Popham, Peter, Journalist for The Independent, The Lady and The Generals — Aung San Suu Kyi and Burma’s Struggle for Freedom, 2016).      Many people were caught by surprise that those words came from Suu Kyi, a democracy hero in Myanmar and a 2012 Nobel Peace Prize laureate. It might only be one racially-insensitive sentence, but that was one sentence too many, and the meaning is too much for those who love peace.      Many people in many countries, including in Indonesia, respect and admire Suu Kyi. She is known as a figure of patience, of peace loving, who eventually took back the power in her country peacefully from the military dictatorship in Myanmar. Her statement made many more disappointed and angry. This opens up the prevailing question regarding Suu Kyi’s position on the muslim minority in Myanmar. There has been no official position from Suu Kyi with regards to the human right violations that have been rampant as experienced by the Rohingya minority.      Over the past three years more than 140,000 Rohingya muslims have been living in grave conditions in refugee camps in Myanmar and in many other countries, including Indonesia.      What is wrong with being a muslim, Suu Kyi? Doesn't democracy and human rights teach us to respect differences in beliefs and celebrate brotherhood and sisterhood? Whatever the religion, shouldn’t Suu Kyi and all of us respect each other and not discriminate against other human beings?      Coming from a democratic hero, one racist statement is one too many. It destroys the democratic values that respects differences in beliefs. As a laureate of Nobel Peace Prize, a racist statement renders the peaceful values to be artificial, giving rise to suspicions even conflicts.      The Nobel Prize is the highest prize only to be given to “people who have given their utmost to international brotherhood and sisterhood.” These peaceful values need to be nurtured by the laureates of the Nobel Peace Prize, including Suu Kyi, until their last days. When a laureate cannot maintain peace, then for the sake of peace itself the prize needs to be returned or confiscated by the Nobel Peace Prize Committee.      Therefore, we hereby demand the Chair of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee confiscate or take back the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Aung San Suu Kyi. Only those who are serious in keeping the world peace may be awarded such a coveted Prize.      ----      This petition is initiated and supported by Emerson Yuntho; Hamid Basyaib; Agus Sari; Nong Darol Mahmada; Ulin Yusron; Zainal Arifin Mochtar; Saidiman Ahmad; Ahmad Mukhlis Yusuf; Teguh Juwarno; Syamsul Munir; Naufal Firman Yursak; Kusfuardi; Ahmad Farhan; Andi Harianto Sinulingga; Andy Budiman; Goenawan Mohamad; Bonnie Triyana; Berly Martawardaya; Iwan Gunawan; Mirwan Bz Vauly; Effendi Ishak; Tatat Rahmita Utami; Fajar R.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: Who does Lowell speak to constantly, as if they are children? is inside the article: It is implied that, in the future, all plant life on Earth has become extinct. As many specimens as possible have been preserved in a series of  enormous, greenhouse-like geodesic domes, attached to a large spaceship named \\"Valley Forge\\", forming part of a fleet of American Airlines space freighters, currently just outside the orbit of Saturn.  Freeman Lowell, one of four crewmen aboard, is the resident botanist and ecologist who carefully preserves a variety of plants for their eventual return to Earth and the reforestation of the planet. Lowell spends most of his time in the domes, both cultivating the crops and attending to the animal life. The crew receives orders to jettison and destroy the domes (with nuclear charges) and return the freighters to commercial service. After four of the six domes are jettisoned and blown up Lowell rebels and opts instead to save the plants and animals on his ship. Lowell kills one of his crew-mates who arrives to plant explosives in his favorite dome, and his right leg is seriously injured in the process. He then jettisons and triggers the destruction of one of the remaining domes, trapping and killing the remaining two crewmen. Enlisting the aid of the ship's three \\"drones\\" (service robots), Huey, Dewey and Louie (named after Donald Duck's nephews), Lowell stages a fake premature explosion as a ruse and sends the Valley Forge careening towards Saturn in an attempt to hijack the ship and flee with the last forest dome. He then reprograms the drones to perform surgery on his leg and sets the Valley Forge on a risky course through Saturn's rings. Later, as the ship endures the rough passage, Drone 3 (Louie) is lost, but the ship and its remaining dome emerge relatively undamaged on the other side of the rings. Lowell and the surviving drones, Huey and Dewey, set out into deep space to maintain the forest. Lowell reprograms Huey and Dewey to plant trees and play poker. Lowell begins speaking to them constantly, as if they are children., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the article, Lowell speaks constantly to the ship's three \\"drones\\" - Huey, Dewey, and Louie, as if they are children.

Is \\"ISPs with more than one point of presence (PoP) may have separate connections to an upstream ISP at multiple PoPs, or they may be customers of multiple upstream ISPs and may have connections to each one of them at one or more point of presence.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What is the simplest case of an ISP using an upstream ISP?\\"","output":"The provided answer is not the simplest case of an ISP using an upstream ISP, as it focuses mainly on ISPs with more than one point of presence (PoP) and their relationship with multiple upstream ISPs. Instead, the simplest case can be described by focusing on a single ISP with just one point of presence connecting to an upstream provider. Here's a detailed explanation of the simplest case: The simplest case of an ISP using an upstream ISP involves an Internet Service Provider (ISP) having only one Point of Presence (PoP) connecting to a single upstream ISP for their internet connectivity. In this scenario, the smaller ISP (also known as a downstream ISP) relies on a larger, upstream ISP to provide them with access to the global internet and to route their traffic accordingly. The connection between the two ISPs is typically established through a dedicated, high-speed physical link, such as a fiber optic cable. This enables the smaller ISP to extend its network coverage and offer its subscribers internet access. The relationship between the two ISPs is often governed by a contractual agreement known as a peering or transit agreement. These agreements outline the commercial terms, technical specifications, and service level agreements (SLAs) necessary for the ISPs to interconnect and exchange traffic efficiently. In the simplest case, the smaller ISP does not have multiple PoPs, nor does it have connections to multiple upstream ISPs. Instead, it relies solely on the single upstream ISP for its entire internet connectivity, making it vulnerable to potential issues related to the performance or reliability of the upstream ISP's network. The arrangement also limits the smaller ISP's control and flexibility in managing its traffic flow and routing decisions since they depend largely on their upstream provider. Moreover, it may affect the smaller ISP's ability to negotiate competitive service rates and terms due to the lack of alternatives. In summary, the simplest case of an ISP using an upstream ISP involves a downstream ISP having just one point of presence, which is connected to a single upstream ISP for its global internet connectivity. This arrangement is characterized by a direct physical connection and a contractual relationship between the ISPs, but it may expose the smaller ISP to potential risks related to network reliability, performance, and limited control over routing decisions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: Oct. 15, 2014 file photo of former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in New Hampshire and Nov. 20, 2014 file photo of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in Washington. (Reuters/AP) **Want FOX News First in your inbox every day? Sign up here.** Buzz Cut: • Are Mitt and Jeb getting ready to rumble? • McConnell: W.H. downplaying threat from Islamist militants • Boehner may pardon some coup plotters • Immigration crowds out other issues for Obama • Arch A. Moore, Jr., R.I.P. ARE MITT AND JEB GETTING READY TO RUMBLE? When Jeb Bush jumped in the presidential pond, it was widely assumed that it would mean the end of speculation about a possible third run for Mitt Romney. But not only has Romney continued to entertain pleas from advisers to run again, according to two senior staffers from Romney’s 2012 campaign, Bush’s exploratory move hasn’t changed the landscape for Romney that much. Romney huddled with top advisers in California on Wednesday, a group that reportedly was to include big names like Ben Ginsberg, Andrea Saul and Lanhee Chen. While we can’t know exactly what was said, top aides who spoke to Fox News First prior to the conclave said that Bush’s build-out isn’t a factor. One said that Bush and Romney were “fishing in different pools” of donors and could both proceed with explorations. The other pointed out that not even Bush would be likely to equal Romney’s potential fundraising haul. By continuing to entertain the entreaties of an increasingly enthusiastic circle of advisers, though, Romney is putting himself on a collision course with Bush. There may be enough money for both of them, but not enough votes. A shot across the bow? - Politico reports that former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., is preparing to release a decade or more of personal tax returns. While others say such a bold move is “grossly premature,” there’s no doubt that Bush will be expansive in his disclosures. If and when such a move happens it is seen by many as an early way to distance himself from 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney who came under fire for such a limited release of his own returns. Romney’s first release came in late January 2012 after the undisclosed returns helped cost him the South Carolina primary. Another release came in late September 2012, a few weeks after the Republican Convention. Romney refused to go further, but offered a summary of information from the previous 20 years as prepared by Pricewaterhouse Coopers. BAIER TRACKS: PERRY 2.0… “Outgoing Texas Gov. Rick Perry is making every move to suggest that he is running for president again. He’s hitting the trail hard in early primary states, but more importantly, Perry is touting the fact that he’s been shuttling in a broad array of policy experts to Austin to bone up. I traveled to Texas before Christmas to interview the governor and visit the southern border with him. We talked about his policy workshops, which Perry calls “listening sessions” but certainly sound like cramming for a presidential exam. Tonight on ‘Special Report,’ we’ll share that interview as part our series examining the ‘2016 Presidential Contenders.’ We’ll cover all aspects of a possible Perry run: recovering from the ‘oops’ moment, his confrontation with President Obama over immigration, his legal issues and his prescription for Texas-style prosperity for America.” - Bret Baier.

Scott Walker wasn’t just Twitter trolling his potential 2016 GOP presidential rivals on Wednesday. Walker has brought aboard one of the most sought-after presidential strategists for this cycle, Rick Wiley. Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: “In an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel last week, Walker suggested for his potential presidential run he would hire someone he knew but had not worked closely with. Wiley fits that bill. Wiley, who is based in Austin, Texas, served as the political director and later executive director of the Wisconsin Republican Party, and then went on to serve in a top position in Rudy Giuliani's 2008 presidential campaign. From there, Wiley went to work for the Republican National Committee, eventually serving as political director. Most recently, as a consultant with Washington, D.C.-based Mercury Public Affairs, Wiley served as a liaison for the Republican Governors Association, helping Walker and other GOP candidates around the country in last fall's elections.” JERRY JONES GUSHES OVER CHRISTIE: ‘I WANT THAT ORANGE SWEATER’ Dallas Morning News: “Jerry Jones was talking about Chris Christie’s mojo again on Wednesday.

We’ve had him in the locker room. It feels good to have him here. We do need all hands on deck to even come close to these Packers.

Republicans have traditionally done a good job collecting small donations via direct mail, but email is many times cheaper. On top of that, an early start building an email list may be critical for whoever actually wins the nomination. None of this is lost on high-profile GOP hopefuls including Sen.

Asked on “The Kelly File” about White House’s initial ambivalence to call the onslaught a terrorist attack and whether there is a conscious decision not to link these types of attacks to Islam, McConnell told Megyn Kelly, “They refuse to call these attacks what they are.” “These are terrorist attacks invariably spawned by some perverted notion of Islam and to not call it what it is strikes me as not being forthcoming with the American people” Watch the interview here. [Watch the second part of McConnell’s interview on “The Kelly File” tonight at 9 p.m. ET] Unhappy precedent - David Harsanyi at The Federalist: “After the horrific and deadly terrorist attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris, France, it’s worth remembering again that there is no conciliatory rhetoric or kowtowing that will stop attacks on our liberal values. They won’t stop even if we give in, which is something we’ve done. It’s something we do quite often. Surely you remember that the “Innocence of Muslims” fiasco didn’t end in Egypt. U.S. taxpayers paid for television ads in Pakistan featuring footage of Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during press a press conference – subtitled in Urdu – condemning the film. ‘We absolutely reject its content and message,’ Clinton explained. Bro-ster Tommy Vietor, then spokesman for the National Security Council, told the Washington Post that the White House has ‘reached out to YouTube to call the video to their attention and ask them to review whether it violates their terms of use.’ And due to this pressure – what amounts to no less than de facto censorship – YouTube pulled the video. The man ended up in prison and the extremists won.” A pox on media mice - Peter Beinart at The Atlantic: “But because these assaults aim to intimidate movie studios and journalists, their impact cannot be measured merely by how governments respond. Historically, terrorists and dictators have often used violence to blackmail democratic governments into changing policy. Now they are using violence to blackmail editors and studio heads into doing so. Which means that journalists and media executives, rather than merely politicians, must choose either appeasement or defiance. By first refusing to disseminate The Interview, and then agreeing to, Sony pivoted from the former to the latter. With most of its staff murdered, Charlie Hebdo itself may, tragically, not have the choice. But in deciding whether to show the images that seem to have gotten Charlie Hebdo’s cartoonists and editors killed, countless other magazines, newspapers, websites, and television networks will be acting as either hawks or doves.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Today would have been Elvis Presley’s 80th birthday and one might wonder what the King of Rock and Roll would be like today had he not died in August 1977 at age 42. Well, consider this: On December 4, 1956 there was an impromptu jam session at Sun Records Memphis studios included Elvis and three other rockabilly pioneers: Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash and Jerry Lee Louis. That session and the famous photo of the four would come to be known as the Million Dollar Quartet. So to guess where The King would be today we can look at what became of the other three, who shared similar backgrounds and sadly, similar demons. Perkins, with the help of Cash, eventually confronted his alcoholism and, after a career tailspin died at age 65, esteemed by all of rock and country music as a legend. Cash has one of the best known stories of loss, redemption and love, written with his beloved wife, June Carter Cash. The Man in Black, who died at 71 in 2003, was still recording and innovating up until the end. The last rockabilly still rocking though is The Killer. Jerry Lee Louis is the subject of new book from Rick Bragg and the author makes it clear that Louis is still struggling with the same tempestuous soul that churned within him even on the day he stood with those three other giants.

Chaffetz made clear to his subcommittee chairs before the vote that he expected them to be ‘team players.’…Similarly, Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling [R-Texas] is likely to keep Garrett as chairman of the capital markets subcommittee, an aide said. Garrett voted for Webster, as well.” IMMIGRATION CROWDS OUT OTHER ISSUES FOR OBAMA While President Obama is in Phoenix today to unveil a plan benefiting potential low income home buyers that some industry insiders say tinkers around the edges of the lagging housing market, the hot topic in the southern border state is immigration. House Republican leaders huddled with rank and file Wednesday in Washington to develop strategies to block the president’s executive action granting temporary amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. The Hill: “Gathered in the Capitol office of Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy [R-Calif.], the Republicans discussed a handful of different GOP proposals designed to prevent Obama’s order from taking effect. Emerging from that meeting, the lawmakers said they haven’t settled on a final design surrounding either the policy or the strategy for moving the language through the lower chamber. But they said they made enough progress that they hope to vote on the measure next week as part of a larger package funding the Department of Homeland Security [DHS] beyond February.” [Byron York takes a look at the two GOP plans to put a stop to President Obama’s immigration actions.] EPA delays coal war salvo - AP: “The Obama administration on Wednesday said it would delay for months a final rule to control carbon dioxide emissions at new coal-fired power plants, thwarting for now one way the Republican-controlled Congress could have blocked the administration’s plans on global warming. A final rule was due by law on Jan. 8, a year after it was first proposed. But the Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday it would wait until midsummer, and issue the new power plant rules with a separate regulation aimed at cutting the pollution blamed for global warming from the existing coal-fired power fleet. That would put the rule weeks past the deadline set by President Barack Obama when he announced his second-term plans for climate in June 2013…Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell [R-Ky.] has vowed to overturn the emissions rules in short order to halt what he views as a war on coal, an industry important to his state but in decline there.” States will be forced to comply - NYT: “The Environmental Protection Agency will force states to comply with a federal “model rule” to cut their carbon emissions if the states do not submit customized plans under the Obama administration’s new climate change regulations, a senior official said Wednesday.” A.G. confirmation hearings set - Politico:“Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley [R-Iowa] plans to hold confirmation hearings for attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch in the last week of January or the beginning of February, an aide said Wednesday. ‘He has spoken with the White House Counsel about this goal, and the White House was agreeable to this timetable,’ Grassley’s spokeswoman, Beth Levine, said in an email. The nomination of Lynch, who was chosen late last year to replace outgoing attorney general Eric Holder, will be one of the highest profile confirmations that the new GOP majority in the Senate will take up early this year.” Reid ramps up for 2016 challenge - The Hill: “Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s [D-Nev.] chief of staff David Krone is stepping down although he will still advise Reid, according to a source familiar with the staff shakeup. The source said Krone will be replaced by Drew Willison, a longtime senior aide to Reid who recently served as Senate Sergeant-at-Arms. The source added that Krone ‘will have a major role’ on Reid’s re-election campaign. The move dovetails with Reid’s plans to run for re-election in 2016 because Willison oversaw important legislative projects for Nevada while serving as a senior aide on the Environment and Public Works Committee and the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee…” THE JUDGE’S RULING: Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano illustrates how over the past 100 years the country has been on a slow steady march toward the federal destruction of the presumption of liberty: “…on the transcendental issues of our day -- life, liberty, war and debt -- the leadership of both political parties and the behavior of all modern presidents have revealed a steadfast willingness to write any law and regulate any behavior or permit any evil, whether authorized by the Constitution or not.” WARREN AIMS TO SHAPE DEBATE AS 2016 RACE BEGINS AP: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren [D-Mass.] on Wednesday hammered Washington's leaders, Republicans and Democrats alike, for failing to help middle-class workers since the 1980s. Left unsaid: That time period includes President Bill Clinton's administration. As Warren continues to insist she won't run for president, and all of politics is waiting for Hillary Rodham Clinton to announce her candidacy, it was a notable omission during Warren's speech at a conference sponsored by the AFL-CIO. Bill Clinton famously declared ‘the era of big government is over’ in 1996, and Warren's indictment of three decades of economic policy referenced complaints among liberals that the policies of Democrats contributed to Wall Street excess in the past decade…That sort of rhetoric has some liberals pining for Warren to enter the Democratic presidential contest, a move that would likely pit her against Hillary Rodham Clinton, the party's leading contender should she enter the campaign as is widely expected.” Podesta gets ready for Hillary kick off - WaPo: “White House counselor John Podesta will leave the White House next month, according to a senior administration official, and will help Hillary Rodham Clinton’s presidential bid… Clinton is likely to announce her intention to seek the Oval Office this spring, according to her advisers and Democratic strategists.” ARCH A. MOORE, JR., R.I.P. Ed. note: It was my great privilege, sometimes frustration and always fascination to cover former West Virginia Gov. Arch Moore. When I came to know and ultimately befriend the former three-term Republican governor, he was seeking the restoration of his law license following completion of his sentence for corruption charges. While I thought Moore’s admirers quite right that what he had done to keep his political machine going was less bad than many Democrats had gotten away with, I resented the argument that West Virginia should somehow accept a lower threshold for public corruption. But at least he did not steal from the public. His crimes were rooted in ambition, not greed or weakness – and there was no denying that his ambition was tied to a deep love for the state I adore. Arch was, like all of us, a complicated contradiction. What made us friends, though, was that he loved and understood politics more than almost anyone I had ever known. In hour after hour of phone calls, even at 75, he was scalpel-sharp and crackling with energy. Arch lived to see his daughter elected in a landslide to the Senate and his beloved West Virginia awash in a sea of red in November, ending finally the New Deal Democrat coalition that ruled the state for four generations. It would have surely pleased him, but I doubt it would have surprised him. He could see around corners better than most of us. As to why I ultimately came to admire him, it was his refusal to be defeated. He was truly a brave man. So he should probably be best remembered not for what he did in office or politics but for what he did before he ever won his first vote: Charleston Daily Mail: “In November 1944, during a battle near Aachen, Germany, a machine-gun bullet hit Moore, then an infantry sergeant, in the face. It broke his jaw and almost severed his tongue. ‘Moore lay on the soggy, wintry-cold German beet field, with his face torn apart and severe blood loss, for several hours that day,’ according to his biography. ‘At some point, his two decades of life flashed in front of him, as if he was going to die.’ That day, 33 of the 36 men in his platoon were killed. Several oral and facial surgeries later, Moore spent the better part of a year learning how to speak again.” Rest in peace, Governor. Thank you for your service.

Greeks: Greeks from Cyprus have a similar history of emigration, usually to the English-speaking world because of the island's colonization by the British Empire. Waves of emigration followed the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, while the population decreased between mid-1974 and 1977 as a result of emigration, war losses, and a temporary decline in fertility. After the ethnic cleansing of a third of the Greek population of the island in 1974, there was also an increase in the number of Greek Cypriots leaving, especially for the Middle East, which contributed to a decrease in population that tapered off in the 1990s. Today more than two-thirds of the Greek population in Cyprus is urban. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\".

Guru Pitka is the #2 Guru in the world, after Deepak Chopra. A flashback shows that Pitka was an orphan, taught by Guru Tugginmypudha. When the twelve year old Pitka announces he wants to become a Guru so that girls will love him, Tugginmypudha puts a chastity belt on him until he can learn that loving himself is more important than being loved by others. Pitka's dream is to become the number #1 Guru and appear on The Oprah Winfrey Show. He lives a charmed life with thousands of followers, including the celebrities Jessica Simpson, Val Kilmer and Mariska Hargitay. His teachings, which involve simplistic acronyms and plays on words, are displayed in PowerPoint slide shows. In Canada, Jane Bullard inherits the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team, who are on a losing streak; her star player, Darren Roanoke, has been playing badly ever since his wife Prudence left him for the rival Los Angeles Kings player, Jacques \\"Lè Cocq\\" Grandé. Jane is a big fan of Pitka's, and offers to pay him 2 million to patch up Darren's marriage, so the team can win the Stanley Cup. Pitka's agent tells him that if he succeeds, Oprah will have him on her show. Pitka encourages the rival team to beat Darren up during a game, to distract him from his distress over his wife's affair. Darren begins to play well but then gets suspended for the next two games after beating up Le Cocq, and hitting Coach Cherkov with a hockey puck. Later, Pitka has dinner with Jane. He tries to kiss her, only to hear a ding on his chastity belt. Upset when he tells her their love cannot be, she runs out. Pitka advises Darren to write an apology to Prudence, and fights off a rooster to deliver the letter. After they lose three games, Coach Cherkoff berates Jane and punches Pitka in the groin. He is only slightly injured from hitting the chastity belt but Pitka moans and drops to the ground.

When this land first became a nation, after winning its independence from England, it had thirteen states. Each of the states was represented on the American flag by a star. All these states were in the eastern part of the continent. As the nation grew toward the west, new states were added and new stars appeared on the flag. For a long time, there were 48 stars.

Some people choose to use this option, but others still sexually reproduce. Billy was born by asexual reproduction and his parent has a genetic disease called Horkrumatis. Jimmy was born by sexual reproduction and one of his parents has the same genetic disease as Billy's parents.  Which child is less likely to have Horkrumatis? A:","output":"To answer this question, let's break it down step by step. Step 1: Understand the differences between asexual and sexual reproduction. - Asexual reproduction: Offspring are produced by a single parent and inherit all their traits from that single parent. - Sexual reproduction: Offspring are produced by the combination of genetic material from two parents, resulting in a mix of inherited traits from both parents. Step 2: Analyze the given information. - Billy: Born by asexual reproduction. Parent has Horkrumatis. As he inherits all traits from the single parent, this includes the genetic disease. - Jimmy: Born by sexual reproduction. One parent has Horkrumatis. Jimmy's chance of inheriting the disease depends on the pattern of inheritance of the disease, but generally, his risk of having it is reduced because he also inherits traits from the other parent who doesn't have the disease. Step 3: Determine which child is less likely to have Horkrumatis. As Billy has inherited all his traits from his parent with Horkrumatis, he has a higher chance of having the disease. In contrast, Jimmy has a lower chance because he derives genes from both parents, which serves to dilute the risk of carrying the genetic disease, assuming that it is a recessive trait. If the disease is dominant, the risk of having the Horkrumatis disease in sexual reproduction will depend on the carrier status of both parents. Therefore, Jimmy (born by sexual reproduction) is less likely to have Horkrumatis compared to Billy (born by asexual reproduction)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"How would Remy feel as a result?\\", is \\"Glad to get a gift\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"The validity of the answer \\"Glad to get a gift\\" as a representation of Remy's feelings depends on various factors in the given situation and Remy's personal preferences and values. To fully explore this question, it is essential to consider different perspectives and potential outcomes. 1. Remy's perspective on gifts and financial priorities: If Remy is an individual who values thoughtful and meaningful gifts, they may appreciate Lee's gesture and feel happy to receive the present. In this case, the answer \\"Glad to get a gift\\" could be valid. However, should Remy place greater importance on financial responsibility and planning over receiving material possessions, they might feel more concerned about how their money was spent, diminishing the impact of the gift and making the answer less valid. 2. The nature of the relationship between Lee and Remy: The validity of the answer may also greatly depend on the dynamics between Lee and Remy, as well as the boundaries and expectations in their relationship. For instance, if Lee is a close friend or family member with a long-standing tradition of exchanging gifts, Remy might be glad to receive the gift. Conversely, if Lee and Remy have agreed on financial management and spending boundaries that were violated by the purchase, Remy could feel betrayed instead of feeling glad about the gift. 3. The significance of the occasion: The importance of the situation surrounding the exchange of the gift might also influence Remy's emotional response. If the gift is for a significant milestone such as Remy's birthday or their anniversary, Remy might appreciate the effort Lee put into selecting an appropriate gift. On the other hand, if the gift is spontaneous and unrelated to any significant event, Remy may not be as glad to receive it, making the answer less valid. 4. Remy's financial situation: Understanding Remy's financial context is another essential aspect to consider. For instance, if Remy is financially stable and can afford to have money spent on a gift, they might not mind the expense and could feel glad to receive the present. However, if Remy is struggling financially, the act of Lee spending all their money on a gift might be seen as more of a burden than a thoughtful gesture, reducing the validity of the answer. 5. The gift's personal or emotional value: Lastly, the emotional or personal significance of the gift to Remy might affect their reaction. If Lee has chosen a gift with tremendous sentimental value or a strong connection to Remy's interests or preferences, they could feel touched and grateful, making the answer valid. However, if the gift does not resonate with Remy on a deeper level or is perceived as extravagant or unnecessary, the gift's impact may be lost, and they might not be glad about receiving it. In conclusion, while it is possible that Remy could feel \\"Glad to get a gift,\\" the validity of this answer relies on numerous factors such as Remy's personal values, the nature of their relationship with Lee, the significance of the occasion, their financial situation, and the gift's emotional value. Without understanding these factors, it is difficult to determine the validity of the answer in this specific case."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Another account published by Christina Smith in 1880 gave the number of victims as eleven, and specified that they belonged to the Tanganekald people. Pastoralist James Brown and his overseer, a man named Eastwood, were suspected of committing the murders in retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep. In January 1849, reports of the massacre reached Matthew Moorhouse, the Protector of Aborigines. He visited the district to investigate the claims, and based on his enquiries Brown was charged with the murders in March 1849. Proceedings against Brown began in June 1849 and continued in the Supreme Court of South Australia for several months, but were eventually abandoned. Some key witnesses, including Eastwood, either fled the colony or refused to cooperate with the investigation. There were also significant restrictions on the use of evidence given by Aboriginal witnesses, especially where a verdict could involve capital punishment. These legal hurdles and settler solidarity ensured the case did not go to trial, although the magistrate who committed him for trial told a friend that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\". Although the details of the case were known for decades after the murders, distortions of the massacre eventually appeared in print and were embellished by local white and Aboriginal historians. Two key aspects of these later accounts were that Brown poisoned rather than shot the victims, and that he had undertaken an epic horse ride to Adelaide to establish an alibi.... contains an answer for the question: What were the full names of the two people who were suspected of committing the murders in the Avenue Range Station massacre?, what is it ? The answer is:","output":"James Brown and his overseer, a man named Eastwood."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
