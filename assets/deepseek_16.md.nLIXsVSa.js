Angola , officially the Republic of Angola ( ; Kikongo, Kimbundu and Umbundu: \\"Repubilika ya Ngola\\"), is a country in Southern Africa. It is the seventh-largest country in Africa and is bordered by Namibia to the south, the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north, Zambia to the east, and the Atlantic Ocean to west. The exclave province of Cabinda has borders with the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The capital and largest city of Angola is Luanda.  Although its territory has been inhabited since the Paleolithic Era, what is now the modern country of Angola was influenced by Portuguese colonisation, which began with, and was for centuries limited to, coastal settlements and trading posts established beginning in the 16th century. In the 19th century, European settlers slowly and hesitantly began to establish themselves in the interior. As a Portuguese colony, Angola did not encompass its present borders until the early 20th century, following resistance by groups such as the Cuamato, the Kwanyama and the Mbunda. Independence was achieved in 1975 under a Marxist-Leninist one party state, backed by the Soviet Union and Cuba after a protracted anti-colonial struggle. However, the country soon descended into an even lengthier civil war that lasted until 2002. It has since become a relatively stable unitary presidential republic. 1.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person in whose view the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music? from the following article ?  Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less...

He's given strict instructions not to damage the vehicle or pick up any hitchhikers. Sean is driving cross country when he picks up Nick, a hitchhiker who happens to be a vampire hunter hunting a group of vampires led by one of the Forsaken--a group of knights who made a pact with the fallen angel Abaddon to live forever. Two of the Forsaken are located in the United States (including the one Nick is tracking, Kit). Nick was bitten and infected by a vampire but, thanks to an antiviral drug cocktail, the vampire virus is kept at bay. Each of the Forsaken carry a unique strain of vampirism; killing a Forsaken kills his entire bloodline and reverses the condition of anyone infected. Nick believes that if he kills Kit, he will be cured before he turns (as the drug cocktail eventually will lose effect).

News article: Dogs killed over unpaid fines By Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken California resident Gerilynn Aflleje was horrified when her 4-year-old Siberian Husky mix was killed by a local animal shelter over 180 in fees that she couldn't afford. Her dog, Chunk, had been dropped off at the Stockton shelter after getting lost in 2013, she later explained at a city council meeting. When Aflleje discovered her dog there less than a week later, she said the shelter demanded 180 within 24 hours for storing Chunk. Unemployed, Aflleje couldn't get the money in time. \\"We didn't only lose our pet. We lost a family member,\\" she said. In a number of cities across the country, animal control agencies are aggressively going after pet owners with big fines for small violations. Some hold people's pets until they settle their bills, even if it means they end up killed. Others leave the dogs alone but issue arrest warrants for owners who can't pay up. We didn't only lose our pet. We lost a family member.\\" The infractions can include failing to license a pet, owning a dog that barks a lot, or accidentally letting an animal get loose in the neighborhood. But the penalties are serious, often amounting to hundreds or even thousands of dollars. So are the consequences. When owners of seized or lost dogs can't afford to get their pets back, they relinquish their rights to the animal, which can result in a pet being euthanized. Meanwhile, a CNNMoney analysis of active warrants from a sampling of 15 cities and counties across the country found thousands of outstanding warrants for small pet-related offenses. Outraged pet owners and animal rights attorneys say these harsh tactics are all about generating money and unfairly impact low-income Americans. Chunk had been part of the Aflleje family since he was six weeks old. He was euthanized in 2013. But animal control agencies, which are run by local governments or contractors, say the fees and fines they collect help them to do their jobs and pay for things like storing animals. They also say their rules are meant to encourage responsible pet ownership and keep neighborhoods and animals safe. The ASPCA, an animal welfare non-profit, said enforcement efforts are \\"typically rooted in good intentions\\" but they can have \\"unintended consequences\\" that can lead to owners losing their pets. After coming under fire for alleged mistreatment of animals, Stockton has overhauled its shelter policies by lowering fees, facilitating more animal adoptions, and trying harder to reunite lost and seized pets with their owners -- all of which the shelter claims has resulted in a steep drop in euthanizations, from more than 75% of animals at the shelter in 2012 to 25% last year. It still faces a lawsuit filed by an animal rights group that alleges animal abuse, though the shelter says many of the allegations were already being addressed. But aggressive tactics are still common elsewhere. They are threatening people. They are intimidating people.\\" Indio, California resident Elizabeth Vasquez says that animal control officers seized her two dogs, Silver and Canelo, for being loose in the neighborhood and fined her 500. She claims they were secure in her backyard at the time. She used her grocery money to pay 200 -- enough to get Canelo back. But animal control killed Silver before she could scrape together enough cash to get the dog out, says Vasquez, who speaks only Spanish. Allan Drusys, chief veterinarian for Riverside County -- which took over Indio's animal services in 2013 -- said Vasquez's dogs were loose and picked up as part of a routine sweep for stray dogs and that a payment plan should have been made available to her. One pet owner was hit with this hefty fine for failing to sterilize, vaccinate, microchip and license three dogs. In some cases, dogs don't even have to leave the yard for animal control to come calling. Last year, Riverside County inspectors incited controversy for going door-to-door and giving out citations of up to 400 per dog in Indio's low-income and mainly Hispanic neighborhoods. In some cases, they cited people for failing to have their pets licensed, sterilized, vaccinated and microchipped without even seeing the animals. Riverside County told CNNMoney that this was part of its ongoing enforcement efforts across the county and residents could avoid paying the fines by fixing the violation within 30 days. While there are some low-cost options available for sterilization and other procedures, local advocates said waiting lists are often months long. They also railed against the agency for leaving wealthy, gated communities untouched. \\"They are threatening people. They are intimidating people,\\" said Kim Maguire-Hardee, a local activist who runs a low-cost spay and neuter clinic.\\"[But] if people have lawyers and speak English, they don't go there.\\" Drusys, who oversees the pet licensing program, says he takes \\"great exception to the accusation that we are picking on poor people.\\" Licensing revenues are projected to almost double in Riverside County in two years. \\"It's not our fault that we don't go to the gated communities -- we go there all the time, they refuse entry,\\" he said. Across Riverside County, many people are rushing to get their pets licensed. Licenses cost 16 a year for most dogs but jump to 100 for dogs that aren't spayed or neutered -- a procedure that can cost hundreds of dollars. Amid these aggressive enforcement efforts, Riverside projects that county licensing revenue will almost double from two years ago to nearly 1 million. But Drusys said the licensing program, which includes low-cost services like sterilization, is \\"not focused on revenue.\\" \\"It is focused on getting dogs and cats spayed and neutered,\\" he said. \\"Because if they're not born, they can't be impounded into the system.\\" Elsewhere, owners are being charged to keep their animals alive until they are given a chance to argue their pet's innocence. Colorado resident Caitlin McAdam's dogs, Jake and Lucy, were seized from her home two months ago after they were accused of killing a neighbor's cat. Even though no evidence was provided that linked her dogs to the incident, McAdam was told that they could be killed if she didn't pay 1,200 in upfront impound fees within 10 days. The Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region, a contractor that handles animal control for the area, said fees are set by state law and the court determines how quickly a case gets heard. With the help of an attorney, McAdam moved her dogs to a private facility while they await trial. This costs her 250 a week. An initial hearing overseen by a judge was held in mid-February. And while her attorney recently learned that an autopsy of the cat found it unlikely that it was attacked by two dogs, McAdam is still awaiting a jury trial in April. At that point, she and her attorney plan to present proof of the dogs' innocence -- including multiple witnesses who were with the dogs when the alleged incident occurred. Until then, her family can only see their dogs during approved visits and will be spending thousands of dollars on storage fees and legal costs. To help cover these expenses, they've sold an old car, used a tax refund, borrowed money from friends and raised money through crowdfunding. Derrick was heartbroken when his dogs were seized by animal control. But if the dogs are found guilty they could be killed anyway. If found innocent, McAdam will still be out thousands of dollars. \\"We've had to come up with extra (money) that frankly we just don't have,\\" said McAdam, whose 9-year-old son Derrick has been traumatized by the incident. \\"It's hard -- it's definitely hard.\\" Mary Root was arrested after her Chihuahuas got loose and she couldn’t afford to pay the fines. Mary Root, an 82-year-old widow from Havre de Grace, Maryland, spent two days in jail last March after her neighbor complained to animal control that her Chihuahuas had gotten loose three times. Root was charged 525 for the incidents. Living on roughly 2,000 a month and already struggling to pay her property taxes, she couldn't afford the fines. But she was thankful nothing happened to her dogs. When she missed a court hearing about the violations -- which Root said she couldn't attend for medical reasons -- an arrest warrant was issued and she was put in jail. Locals rallied for support of Mary Root, who went to jail over unpaid pet fines. Root learned that she could either face more than a year in jail or owe 7,000 -- an amount that included the initial fines and new ones for missing the hearing. A Harford County spokesperson didn't respond to requests for comment. Root was only able to get out of jail after a good Samaritan heard her story on the local news and bailed her out. A pro bono attorney helped her negotiate the 7,000 bill to around 500, which she paid with the help of her church and lawyer. \\"It's been a nightmare,\\" said Root, who lives alone. \\"I'm 82 and I'm just hanging in there -- that's why I value my little dogs.\\" What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1.

He was created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks at the Walt Disney Studios in 1928. An anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts, large yellow shoes, and white gloves, Mickey has become one of the world's most recognizable characters.  - Chilly Willy is a funny animal cartoon character, a diminutive anthropomorphic penguin living in Alaska (although, in reality, the species is native only to the Southern Hemisphere). He was created by Paul J. Smith for the Walter Lantz studio in 1953. The character soon became the second most popular Lantz/Universal character, behind Woody Woodpecker.  - Popeye the Sailor Man is a cartoon fictional character created by Elzie Crisler Segar. The character first appeared in the daily King Features comic strip, Thimble Theatre, on January 17, 1929, and Popeye became the strip's title in later years; Popeye has also appeared in theatrical and television animated cartoons.  - Frederick Bean \\"Tex\\" Avery (February 26, 1908  August 26, 1980) was an American animator, cartoonist, voice actor and director, known for producing animated cartoons during the golden age of American animation. His most significant work was for the Warner Bros. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios, crucial in the evolution of Bugs Bunny, creating Daffy Duck, Droopy, and Screwy Squirrel, and developing Porky Pig and Chilly Willy (this last one for the Walter Lantz Studio) into the personas for which they are remembered.  - Elmer J. Fudd is a fictional cartoon character and one of the most famous \\"Looney Tunes\\" characters, and the \\"de facto\\" archenemy of Bugs Bunny. He has one of the more disputed origins in the Warner Bros. cartoon pantheon (second only to Bugs himself). His aim is to hunt Bugs, but he usually ends up seriously injuring himself and other antagonizing characters. He speaks in an unusual way, replacing his Rs and Ls with Ws, so he always refers to Bugs Bunny as a \\"wabbit\\". Elmer's signature catchphrase is, \\"Shhh. Be vewy vewy quiet, I'm hunting wabbits\\", as well as his trademark laughter.  - Daffy Duck in Hollywood is a 1938 Merrie Melodies animated short starring Daffy Duck ( in his similar design from Daffy Duck & Egghead ) . This was the final Daffy Duck cartoon directed by Tex Avery .  - Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. (abbreviated as MGM or M-G-M, also known as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer or Metro, and for a former interval known as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer/United Artists, or MGM/UA) is an American media company, involved primarily in the production and distribution of feature films and television programs.  - Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. (known professionally as Warner Bros. Pictures, often referred to as Warner Bros. and Warner Brothers and abbreviated as WB) is an American entertainment company, film studio and film distributor that is a division of Time Warner and is headquartered in Burbank, California. It is one of the \\"Big Six\\" major American film studios.  - Droopy is an animated cartoon character from the Golden Age of American Animation: an anthropomorphic dog with a droopy face, hence the name Droopy. He was created in 1943 by Tex Avery for theatrical cartoon shorts produced by the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio. Essentially the polar opposite of Avery's other famous MGM character, the loud and wacky Screwy Squirrel, Droopy moves slowly and lethargically, speaks in a jowly monotone voice, andthough hardly an imposing characteris shrewd enough to outwit his enemies. When finally roused to anger, often by a bad guy laughing heartily at him, Droopy is capable of beating adversaries many times his size with a comical thrashing (\\"You know what? That makes me mad!\\").  - Bugs Bunny is an animated cartoon character; created in 1940 by Leon Schlesinger Productions (later Warner Bros. Cartoons) and voiced originally by the legendary vocal artist, Mel Blanc. Bugs is best known for his starring roles in the \\"Looney Tunes\\" and \\"Merrie Melodies\\" series of animated short films, produced by Warner Bros. during the golden age of American animation. His popularity during this era led to his becoming an American cultural icon, as well as the official mascot of Warner Bros. Entertainment.  - Looney Tunes is an American animated series of comedy short films produced by Warner Bros. from 1930 to 1969 during the golden age of American animation, alongside its sister series \\"Merrie Melodies\\".

Daffy was one of the first of the new \\"screwball\\" characters that emerged in the late 1930s to replace traditional everyman characters who were more popular earlier in the decade, such as Mickey Mouse and Popeye. Daffy starred in 130 shorts in the golden age, making him the third-most frequent character in the \\"Looney Tunes\\"/\\"Merrie Melodies\\" cartoons, behind Bugs Bunny's 180 appearances and Porky Pig's 162 appearances.  - Merrie Melodies is an American animated series of comedy short films produced by Warner Bros. between 1931 and 1969, during the golden age of American animation. As with its parent series, \\"Looney Tunes\\", \\"Merrie Melodies\\" featured some of the most famous cartoon characters ever created; including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig and Elmer Fudd.  - Porky Pig is an animated cartoon character in the Warner Bros. \\"Looney Tunes\\" and \\"Merrie Melodies\\" series of cartoons. He was the first character created by the studio to draw audiences based on his star power, and the animators created many critically acclaimed shorts using the fat little pig.

Summarize this article: FBI Director James Comey said he was worried about a spike in the murder rate in American cities. | Getty Comey increasingly worried about murder spike in cities      FBI Director James Comey is again sounding the alarm about a surge in murders in several American cities and is publicly complaining that the problem isn't getting much national media attention because the victims are minorities who live in particular neighborhoods.      \\"I was very worried about it last fall and I am in many ways more worried,\\" Comey told reporters during a question-and-answer session at FBI headquarters Wednesday. \\"The numbers are not only going up, they're continuing to go up faster than they were going up last year. And I worry very much it's a problem that most of America can drive around....I don't know what the answer is, but, holy cow, do we have a problem.\\"      Story Continued Below      Comey said he was briefed Wednesday on quarterly murder statistics for about 40 major cities and most of them have seen increases.      \\"From the Las Vegas strip, you can't tell that 60 people have been murdered in Las Vegas this year. From the Miracle Mile in Chicago, you can't hear the sounds of gunshots that have killed over 200 people this year,\\" the FBI chief said. \\"It's again happening in certain parts of the cities and the people dying are almost entirely black and Latino men and we can't drive around that problem.\\"      Comey gently prodded the national media to devote more coverage to the issue. \\"It's being reported on at local levels, but in my view it's not getting the attention at the national level it deserves,\\" he said.      Comey evoked the ire of some White House officials last fall when he publicly suggested that the surge in murders could be due to police stepping back from engagement with minority communities in the wake of numerous cell-phone videos depicting police abuse. Some Obama administration officials indicated at the time that there was no evidence of a widespread crime surge or that police had changed their tactics.      The FBI chief has acknowledged that the surge in murders is perplexing in several respects, including the fact that some cities have not seen any uptick while others are experiencing a shocking level of violence.      \\"Why does Dallas see a dramatic spike and Houston doesn't?...The map and the calendar makes no sense,\\" Comey said. \\"It's a complicated, hard issue, but the stakes couldn't be higher. A whole lot of people are dying. I don't want to drive around it.\\"      Comey said the FBI is working with police in several cities to try to improve relationships between minority communities and police.      The FBI director acknowledged he still has no hard proof that attention to police-involved shootings and other instances of alleged abuse has changed the policing dynamic. But he said he continues to hear that from officers informally.      \\"What I'm talking about is sort of the viral video effect....Changes in the way police may be acting and in the way communities may be acting in terms of how much information they share with police could well be at the heart of this or could well be an important factor in this,\\" Comey said. \\"I think it is the potential effect of marginal pullbacks by lots and lots of police officers that is changing some cities. I continue to hear that privately.....I've heard it in lots of conversations privately with police leaders.\\"      \\"I don't know for sure ... something has happened,\\" Comey added.            Authors: ||||| FBI Director James Comey speaks in Detroit in April. (Photo: Carlos Osorio, AP)      WASHINGTON — FBI Director James Comey once again raised the prospect that sustained spikes in violent crime in many U.S. cities could be linked to a pull back by police who fear the scrutiny of a plethora of cellphone video trained on law enforcement actions across the country.      Citing rising murder numbers in some of America's largest cities, including Chicago and Las Vegas, Comey said the phenomenon of \\"viral videos'' may be prompting changes in the way officers are policing their cities.      \\"I was worried about it last fall,'' Comey told reporters at a Wednesday briefing, referring to continuing surges in violence. \\"And I am, in many ways, more worried now. ...The people dying are almost entirely black and Latino. I don't know what the answer is. But, holy cow, do we have a problem.''      And the director said that \\"changes in the way police may be acting ... could well be at the heart of this'' troubling trend.      The director’s remarks echoed a similar assessment he provided during separate appearances last fall in Chicago, which put him at odds with some in law enforcement and the White House.      At that time, White House spokesman Josh Earnest and Attorney General Loretta Lynch said that the available data did not support such a conclusion. The White House and Justice Department did not address Comey's remarks Wednesday.      But Comey said he continues to hear from local law enforcement authorities who fear that officers have become less aggressive in carrying out their duties, if only marginally, out of concern that their actions will be captured on video and dissected publicly.      While Comey could not absolutely attribute the crime spikes to less aggressive policing, he urged academics and others to examine the possible relationship.      \\"It's a problem (violent crime) that most of America can drive around,'' the director said. \\"From the Las Vegas strip, you can't tell that more 60 people have been murdered in Las Vegas this year. From the Miracle Mile in Chicago, you can't hear the sounds of gun shots that have killed more than 200 people so far this year.      \\"There is a perception that police are less likely to do the marginal things that suppress crime,'' the director said.      Comey said he had become newly concerned about the issue after reviewing quarterly crime data collected by the Major Cities Chiefs Association, a law enforcement group representing the nation's largest cities. Many of the more than 40 cities represented in the in the group's review, he said, were reporting problems with violence.      Darrel Stephens, executive director of the chiefs' association, could not be immediately reached for comment.      But Chuck Wexler, director of the law enforcement think tank Police Executive Research Forum, said police officials were scheduled to meet later this month in New York to discuss the possible causes of the scattered surges in violence. That meeting, Wexler said, would address the issue known as de-policing.      \\"Why is crime going up in some cities and not in others? It is a question that police chiefs are asking,'' Wexler said.

But some dissenters said he was needlessly stirring up an unproven and divisive notion.      “He ought to stick to what he knows,” James O. Pasco Jr., executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police, said in a telephone interview. The organization has more than 330,000 members.      “He’s basically saying that police officers are afraid to do their jobs with absolutely no proof,” Mr. Pasco said.      Mr. Comey’s remarks were prompted by a private briefing he received on Wednesday about rising crime rates in more than 40 cities during the first quarter of 2016.      He said the new statistics, which have not been made public, showed a significant jump in murder rates in many cities. The numbers rose even more quickly than last year, Mr. Comey said. In 2015, rising murder tallies in Washington, Baltimore, Milwaukee, St. Louis and other cities made national news.      Video      The two cities Mr. Comey singled out in the latest tallies were Las Vegas and Chicago. He said most of the murder victims were either black or Hispanic men, although F.B.I. officials declined to provide specific figures and said the data would likely be released later this week. In Chicago, where violence and police shootings have angered the city, officials say that as of April, murders were up 54 percent from last year, and shootings were up by 70 percent.      Mr. Comey said that he could not fully explain the trend or the major differences from one city to the next.

He said that the spike in violent crime deserves more national attention from scholars, the media, and the public.      “Something is happening,” he said. “A whole lot more people are dying this year than last year, and last year than the year before and I don’t know why for sure.”      Asked about his past views on the “Ferguson effect” as a possible explanation, Mr. Comey said he rejected that particular term, but added that he continued to hear from police officials in private conversations that “lots and lots of police officers” are pulling back from aggressive confrontations with the public because of viral videos.      He said that the phenomenon “could well be an important factor in this.”      More than many of his predecessors at the F.B.I., Mr. Comey has not hesitated to use the prestige of his office to draw attention to difficult and sometimes unpopular issues involving race and crime.      Last year, he gave an unusually candid speech at Georgetown University about the tense relationship between police and blacks, saying that minorities are scrutinized more closely than whites because of bias. In the talk, he cited a song from a Broadway musical called “Everyone’s a Little Bit Racist.”      That won him praise from some advocates of minorities, but in the debate over the Ferguson effect, he has angered some minority leaders who say the real problem remains policing in their communities that, if anything, is too aggressive, and far short of passive.      One reason for the sharp disagreement is that there is little reliable national data on the topic, even at the F.B.I.      The F.B.I. has promised to build a database compiling police shootings and confrontations with members of the public, but Mr. Comey said that project was at least two years from completion.      “That does frustrate me,” he said. |||||","output":"FBI Director, James Comey, has expressed his concerns over a spike in murder rates in American cities, complaining that not enough national media attention is being given to the issue and believes it is a problem \\"that most of America can drive around.\\" Comey points out that the people dying are almost entirely black and Latino men, indicating that the rise in murders could be attributed to police stepping back from engagement in minority communities following numerous cell-phone videos showing police abuse.

Bundan biraz sonra, Nijeryalı Nwankwo Kanu oradan geçti ve takım arkadaşı Sani Kaita'nın oyundan atılmasıyla ilgili kaçınılmaz soruyu sordu. Which language is this?","output":"The language in question is Turkish. Turkish is a member of the Oghuz group of languages, a subgroup of the Turkic language family. The language has a strong structure of vowel harmony (much like Finnish and Hungarian) and agglutination, meaning that morphemes can be added to a root-word to alter its meaning and create a new word. In terms of the geographical location, it is primarily spoken in Turkey and Cyprus and has nearly 80 million speakers worldwide. You'll find Turkish-speaking communities in several countries due to migration, including Germany, the Netherlands, France, and the UK. It is also one of the official languages of Cyprus. Regarding the alphabet, Turkish uses a Latin-script based alphabet of 29 letters: 8 vowels and 21 consonants. It has been adapted from the Latin script after the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1928, during a series of sweeping reforms initiated by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Now, for some specifics about this language. Turkish is known for its SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order, although this is not strictly adhered to all the time - especially in spoken conversation. The Turkish Vocabulary is rich with synonyms, and it has a flexible and expressive grammar. Additionally, its rules of pronunciation are quite simple and clear compared to many other languages.  However, Turkish can be challenging to learn for speakers of Indo-European languages due to its completely different grammar structure. Its agglutinative nature, vowel harmony rules, and lack of gendered nouns are among the factors that can make it difficult for some learners. The language also boasts an extensive system of honorifics, with different ways of speaking based on relationship, formality, and politeness. In addition to being spoken in its \\"pure\\" form, the Turkish language has dialects and accents that vary regionally. These regional varieties, while generally intelligible with standard Istanbul Turkish, have distinct phonological, syntactical, and lexical traits that can underscore the rich linguistic variety within the Turcophone sphere. To summarize, the language of the given text is Turkish, a rich and unique language belonging to the Turkic family, primarily spoken in Turkey and Cyprus, and known for its agglutinative structure and vowel harmony."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: If I tell you that Freezing causes ice to form, and ask you the question \\"what causes ice to form?\\", is the correct answer \\"liquid\\"?

Ca n't complain , really , but this means I ca n't afford to move out . SO . Answer the following question: why ca n't the person afford to move out ?","output":"Based on the information provided, the person cannot afford to move out due to several reasons related to their education and financial circumstances. These reasons can be analyzed and elaborated upon to better understand the individual's situation.  1. Double majoring: The person has chosen to pursue a double major in their studies, meaning that they are completing the requirements for two different fields of study simultaneously. This decision not only extends the duration of their education, but it also likely increases their tuition fees and other related expenses. By taking on this additional academic challenge, the person may have reduced their available financial resources for other aspects of their life, such as living independently. 2. Extended time in school: Because the individual is double majoring, they have decided to spend a few more years in school rather than graduating in the winter. This prolonged period of education can limit the person's ability to earn a full-time salary, as they must focus on their studies and potentially balance part-time work rather than pursuing a career. As a result, their income may not be sufficient to cover the costs associated with moving out and living on their own. 3. Tuition fees and student loans: Higher education is often associated with significant tuition fees and other costs, such as textbooks, supplies, and transportation. In many cases, students rely on loans to finance their education, which can lead to substantial debt. This financial burden may make it difficult for the person to save money for a security deposit, rent, and other living expenses required to move out of their current living situation. 4. Opportunity cost: Although the individual mentions that they cannot complain about their choice to double major and extend their time in school, this decision may have had an opportunity cost. By investing more time and money into their education, the person may have forgone other financial opportunities that could have enabled them to move out, such as investing in savings or pursuing lucrative career opportunities earlier. 5. Inability to work full time: Balancing a double major workload may also mean that the person cannot commit to a full-time job. They may have to settle for part-time work or internships that do not provide enough income to support living independently. The need to focus on academic success and positioning themselves for a successful post-graduation career might force them to prioritize their education over the financial stability required to move out. 6. Economic factors and cost of living: Depending on the location, the cost of living can be quite high, making it challenging for individuals to secure affordable housing, especially while still in school. The person might be unable to move out due to these external factors, which are out of their control. In conclusion, the person cannot afford to move out primarily because they have chosen to extend their time in school and pursue a double major, which has limited their financial resources and income-generating potential. Factors such as tuition fees, student loans, the opportunity cost of their decision, and external economic conditions have contributed to their inability to move out and live independently at this stage in their life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The combination of two elected houses, in which the members of the Senate represent the six States and the two self-governing Territories while the members of the House represent electoral divisions according to population, is modelled on the United States Congress. Through both houses, however, there is a fused executive, drawn from the Westminster System.  - The Australian Democrats was a centrist political party in Australia with a social-liberal ideology. The party was formed in 1977, a merger of the Australia Party and the New Liberal Movement, with former Liberal minister Don Chipp as its high-profile leader. Though never achieving a seat in the House of Representatives, the party had considerable influence in the Senate for the following thirty years. Its representation in the Parliament of Australia ended on 30 June 2008, after loss of its four remaining Senate seats at the 2007 general election. , the organisation had disintegrated and control was contested by two factions associated with two former parliamentarians. The party was deregistered by the Australian Electoral Commission on 16 April 2015 due to the party's failure to demonstrate requisite 500 members to maintain registration. Even before its deregistration and since it became extinct as a parliamentary party anywhere in Australia, the party saw many of its prominent members defect to the Greens, including former federal party leaders Janet Powell and Andrew Bartlett and former NSW MLC Arthur Chesterfield-Evans.  - Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands in Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of . The country's capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal.

Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population.  - The single transferable vote (STV) is a voting system designed to achieve proportional representation through ranked voting in multi-seat organizations or constituencies (voting districts). Under STV, an elector (voter) has a single vote that is initially allocated to their most preferred candidate and, as the count proceeds and candidates are either elected or eliminated, is transferred to other candidates according to the voter's stated preferences, in proportion to any surplus or discarded votes. The exact method of reapportioning votes can vary (see Counting methods).  - East Timor or Timor-Leste (Tetum: \\"Timór Lorosa'e\\"), officially the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, is a sovereign state in Maritime Southeast Asia. It comprises the eastern half of the island of Timor; the nearby islands of Atauro and Jaco; and Oecusse, an exclave on the northwestern side of the island surrounded by Indonesian West Timor. The country's size is about 15,410 km (5,400 sq mi).  - The Australian Senate is the upper house of the bicameral Parliament of Australia, the lower house being the House of Representatives. The composition and powers of the Senate are established in Chapter I, Part II of the Australian Constitution. There are a total of 76 senators: 12 senators are elected from each of the six states (regardless of population) and two from each of the two autonomous internal territories (the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory). Senators are popularly elected under the single transferable vote system of proportional representation.   - Andrew John Julian Bartlett (born 4 August 1964) is a former Australian politician. He was an Australian Democrats member of the Australian Senate from 1997 to 2008, representing the state of Queensland.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"propellers are on some airplanes primarily to give\\" is \\"protection from bird strikes\\", given that  some airplanes use propellers to move? A:","output":"I believe that the phrase \\"propellers are on some airplanes primarily to give\\" is looking for a reason as to why propellers are featured on certain aircraft. In this case, I would argue that the primary purpose of propellers on aircraft is not for protection from bird strikes, but rather to provide propulsion and forward movement for the airplane. Let me provide a detailed explanation. Propellers have been a part of aviation since the beginning, with one of the most famous examples being the Wright brothers' airplane, the Wright Flyer. Propellers are essentially rotating airfoils that convert rotational motion, typically generated from a piston engine or turboprop engine, into linear thrust. This thrust is the force that pushes the airplane forward, allowing it to overcome air resistance (drag) and achieve flight. Propellers have several advantages over jet engines, particularly in smaller, general aviation aircraft. They are generally more fuel-efficient at lower speeds and altitudes, quieter, and less complex in terms of maintenance. As a result, propellers can be found on a variety of aircraft, including small single-engine planes, regional turboprops, and some military transport aircraft. Now, coming to the question of whether propellers primarily serve as protection from bird strikes: Bird strikes are a serious concern for aviation safety. A bird strike occurs when an airplane and a bird collide during flight, potentially causing significant damage to the aircraft or its engines. While propellers have the potential to cause damage or kill birds that fly into them, it is not their primary function to serve as protection from bird strikes.  In fact, both propeller-driven and jet-powered aircraft face risks from bird strikes. Jet engines are particularly vulnerable due to the potential for ingesting birds into the engine core, which can cause engine failure or damage. Propeller-driven aircraft can also suffer damage from bird strikes, with a propeller potentially being damaged or bent, which could lead to instability, vibration, and reduced performance. It should also be noted that aircraft designs employ several strategies to mitigate the risk of bird strikes, such as specially designed engine intakes, bird diversion tactics around airports, and even bird-scaring devices. However, these features are supplementary to the primary functions of their respective aircraft components (such as providing propulsion or lift). In conclusion, propellers are found on some airplanes primarily to provide thrust and propulsion, enabling them to achieve and maintain flight. The notion that propellers are designed primarily for protection from bird strikes is not accurate, as both propeller-driven and jet-powered aircraft face the risk of bird strikes, and various other strategies are employed to address this issue."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.

Summarize the following: Sometimes, half of your work will be done for you. You'll have all the varying terms on one side and all the constant terms on the other side. If this is the case, all you have to do is the following. For the equation 16x−5x=32−10{displaystyle 16x-5x=32-10}, we just have to subtract the numbers from one another. Remember that the coefficient of x is the number in front of the varying term.  In this example, the coefficient of x{displaystyle x} in 11x{displaystyle 11x} is 11{displaystyle 11}. That division is 11x/11=22/11{displaystyle 11x/11=22/11} to get x=2{displaystyle x=2}.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: John wanted to charge his electronic gadgets remotely. To that end, he first conducted two experiments, case A and case B. In case A he used conduction, and in case B he used induction. In both cases he used same two objects. Finally, John tried to  charge his phone remotely. He called this test as case C.  But I can use this background: Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction. By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction . This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object, while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge.  What is an answer for this question: Would the objects be closer to or farther from each other in case A than in case B? Answer:","output":"In order to determine whether the objects would be closer to or farther from each other in case A (charging by conduction) than in case B (charging by induction), let's first recap the essential differences between the two methods. 1. Charging by Conduction (Case A):    - A charged object comes into direct contact with an uncharged object.    - Electrons flow between the objects to equalize the charges.    - Both objects end up with the same charge. 2. Charging by Induction (Case B):    - A charged object is brought close to an uncharged object, but they do not touch.    - The presence of the charged object causes the electrons in the uncharged object to redistribute their positions.    - The previously uncharged object attains the opposite charge without direct contact with the charged object. With these key differences in mind, we can conclude that the objects would be closer to each other in Case A than in Case B. In Case A, charging by conduction requires direct contact between the objects, meaning they need to be close enough to touch each other. In contrast, Case B involved charging by induction, which does not necessitate physical contact between the objects – only that they be in close proximity to allow the charged object to influence the distribution of electrons in the uncharged object.  So, in summary, the objects would be closer to each other in Case A (charging by conduction) than in Case B (charging by induction)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Warts typically go away with home treatment or on their own. If you’ve been treating your wart but it isn’t improving, talk to your doctor to find out if you need additional treatments. Your doctor may be able to give you a stronger treatment than what you can find in the store.  They may treat your wart in their office and might even be able to remove it. Alternatively, your doctor might offer you a prescription-strength topical cream. Sometimes warts can develop on your hands and feet, which might make it hard for you to carry out your daily activities. If this happens, talk to your doctor about treatment options that can help your wart heal faster. Then, follow your doctor’s advice so you can get back to your normal activities. Medical treatments can help your wart heal a lot faster than they would with home treatment. Try not to worry, but this could be a sign that what you have is more serious than a wart.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Rice Energy's Gas Deal Gives OPEC a Black Eye If you want to understand why OPEC is having such a hard time squeezing shale producers out of the energy market, look no further than Rice Energy's multi-dimensional, 2.7 billion acquisition of Vantage Energy. Yes, it's a natural-gas deal, not oil. But that isn't the point. The point is that a deal of this scale, requiring this much new money, for a commodity this beaten down, is getting done at all in the U.S. exploration and production sector. Gas has rallied recently, although 3 per million BTU counts as enough to get a high-five from bulls these days. 3, That's The Magic Number Natural gas prices have rallied, albeit from very low levels Note: Generic 1st-month natural gas futures contract. But the U.S. gas market is a patchwork of regions, with local pricing often markedly different from the benchmark Nymex futures price because of constraints on pipeline capacity. Such is the case in Appalachia, where Rice and Vantage have their core assets: Natural gas prices at the Dominion South Point hub in Pennsylvania have slipped back below 1 So sentiment overall is better than it was but hardly jubilant. Certainly, you might think a gas producer would have some problems going to investors and telling them it wants to raise more money selling new shares than it did at its IPO less than three years ago. But Rice seems to be handling it. To fund the deal, Rice is pulling multiple levers. Its selling almost 1.2 billion of new shares (including the greenshoe), which is more than it raised when the stock debuted in late 2013, according to Bloomberg data. It's issuing roughly another 1 billion to Vantage's private equity owners. All in all, the 85.1 million new shares are equal to a staggering 43 percent of the existing number outstanding. Increase in Rice Energy's Share Count to Fund This Deal In addition, Rice will immediately sell the pipeline assets that come as part of the package to its master limited partnership, Rice Midstream Partners, to cover 600 million of the cost. That money will come from a combination of the MLP using debt and selling new units or just handing some over to Rice. The seemingly endless appetite of U.S. capital markets is what has enabled the country's E&P firms to withstand OPEC's onslaught better than many expected heading into this crash. Despite (and because of) the crash, 2016 is a banner year for U.S. E&P stock offerings Note: Data for 2016 are year-to-date through September 27th. That isn't to say Rice is just riding a wave. It has managed rapid growth while keeping its borrowing in check -- a rare feat these days. Part of this is down to savvy use of futures: Rice's average realized gas price last year was 2.21 per million BTU before hedges but 3.18 -- 44 percent higher -- after. Indeed, one of the attractions of Vantage, other than its main acreage sitting neatly next to Rice's own, is its own hedge book. Roughly two-thirds of pro forma production next year is hedged. Rice's stock has been a star performer this year, despite the company selling another 561 million of stock in April to help fund another deal. The same goes for Rice Midstream, which has trounced the broader MLP sector. Rice's two securities have surged this year Note: Performance indexed to 100. So Rice is taking advantage of investors' generosity -- including Rice Midstream's current cost of equity below 4 percent -- and liquid futures markets to keep expanding. In the process, the deal also offers a way for Vantage's private equity owners to cash out and back into an established, listed stock rather than continue down the path of trying to IPO the company themselves. Is it an option open to everyone? No. Earlier this summer, I noted the club of E&P companies coming to the stock market to raise more money had shrunk somewhat compared to 2015. Equally, though, any company able to claim real estate in the Permian basin seems able to name their price. It's a trend that appears unsustainable if energy prices remain depressed and if interest rates should rise. But it's appeared unsustainable for quite some time already. And now along comes this Rice deal. OPEC may be showing some fatigue in its battle to recover market share. Until it finally beats the capital markets into submission, though, it should soldier on.

A miniature donkey, born with a deformed leg, is thriving after being fitted with one of the first prosthetic limbs to be created by equine surgeons. The young foal named Emma had her hind leg amputated at just two days old because it stopped her from standing. But she is now enjoying a new lease of life after vets at Auburn University, Alabama, managed to create a special artificial leg for her, similar to those used by Paralympic athletes. Scroll down for video. Miniature donkey Emma, pictured with her owner Cece Smith, proudly displaying her prosthesis limb which allows her to stand. The leg needs to be replaced every few months until Emma is fully grown, but at five months old, she is able to run around with the rest of her herd. She is now on her second prosthesis and experts predict she will need about seven different legs before she reaches adulthood. Dr Fred Caldwell, an assistant professor in the Department of Clinical Sciences and equine surgeon at the university, performed the procedure and is working with clinician Billy Fletcher from Hanger Clinic. The clinic is part of the same company which created a prosthetic tail for Winter, the amputee dolphin and star of the film ‘Dolphin Tale’, who lost her tail after she was caught in a crab trap off the coast of Florida. Thanks to the artificial limb Emma can run around and jump like the rest of the group. She was fitted with the pink prosthesis after surgeons amputated her severely deformed leg which stopped her from walking. Dolphin trainer Cammie Zodrow with Winter the dolphin, who was fitted with a prosthetic tail by the same company who fitted Emma the miniature donkey with an artificial limb. The two worked out a plan to allow Emma time to heal from the surgery and transition from her cast to the prosthesis. Dr. Caldwell said: ‘Once we proceeded with the surgery and amputated the. distal limb, he provided a small footplate to incorporate into the cast. to even out the length of her hind limbs so she could bear weight until. we could get the surgical site healed and have her fitted with a. prosthesis. ‘It has been a group effort on behalf of many caring individuals willing to go to great lengths to save her.’ Emma's case is providing a unique teaching opportunity for the clinicians involved, as the practice of using prostheses with large horses is relatively uncommon due to size and weight-bearing limitations. But because Emma is a miniature donkey, even as an adult she will only weigh approximately 350 pounds once fully grown. A team of doctors and surgeons from Auburn University, Alabama, carefully fit Emma with her latest prosthesis. The veterinary team are excited at Emma's progress since she was fitted with the prosthetuic limb - which could soon be an option for all horses. Dr Caldwell added: ‘She absolutely loved it from the start. It was a very impressive design and she did very well in it. A close-up of Emma's first prosthetic limb which has enabled her to run. ‘She has progressed to the second. iteration of her prosthesis, which doesn't incorporate as much of the. limb and allows her more range of motion. She is getting stronger; she's. growing and doing wonderfully.’ The. prosthesis is made of carbon fibre, Kevlar and fibreglass, materials. that are strong and extremely light, and the same as though used for. prostheses for Paralympic athletes. The first finished prosthesis weighed less than a pound and the most recent iteration, which is pink, is smaller, but weighs a little more to provide stability as she's grown taller and almost doubled her weight since surgery. Prosthesis expert Billy said: ‘The next step is trying to make sure we keep the prosthesis set up so she's ambulatory and she can run and play and do things uninhibited, but also, to keep the area of concern, the surgical site, offloaded so Dr Caldwell can do his job in keeping her completely healed. ‘As time goes by, we'll continue to provide a prosthesis that's going to allow for growth. ‘We want to provide her with full range of motion, but also give her the ability to use full strength.’ Dr Caldwell added: ‘It's been very educational for me as an equine surgeon to learn; this has certainly been my first case. ‘I think we have a long way to go before we get to this being a procedure that's routinely an option for our larger patients, but for a prosthetic limb to be an option in horses is something that's pretty exciting.’ Emma has no problem grazing alongside the other ponies and horses in the field following the efforts of her veterinary team.

The Vatican issued a protest, and bans on Beatles' records were imposed by Spanish and Dutch stations and South Africa's national broadcasting service. Epstein accused Datebook of having taken Lennon's words out of context; at a press conference Lennon pointed out, \\"If I'd said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it.\\" Lennon claimed that he was referring to how other people viewed their success, but at the prompting of reporters, he concluded: \\"If you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then okay, I'm sorry.\\"As preparations were made for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard.

Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness.

Context: Holometabolism, or complete metamorphosis, is where the insect changes in four stages, an egg or embryo, a larva, a pupa and the adult or imago. In these species, an egg hatches to produce a larva, which is generally worm-like in form. This worm-like form can be one of several varieties: eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa, a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon. There are three types of pupae: obtect, exarate or coarctate. Obtect pupae are compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed. Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended. Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin.:151 Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage, and emerge as adults.

Question: Who is formerly a priest? Title: Signs Movie plot: Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), a former priest, lives with his asthmatic son, Morgan (Rory Culkin), his daughter Bo (Abigail Breslin) who leaves glasses of water around the house for various reasons, and his younger brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), a failed minor league baseball player, on an isolated farm in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. Hess has lost his faith and gave up his priesthood after his wife, Colleen, died in a traffic accident caused by a town local, Ray Reddy (Shyamalan). One morning, Graham discovers a crop circle in his field. While investigating the crop circle with the local law enforcement, Morgan is forced to kill one of the family dogs when it turns violent against him and Bo. Graham then learns of animals becoming violent across town. They hear reports of crop circles appearing around the globe, and there are reports of strange lights over Mexico. Later, Graham and Merrill find the farm is being watched by a tall dark figure which disappears into the fields when they give chase. The next day, they hear strange noises over a baby monitor, but cannot find their source. Graham approaches the crop circle but on seeing a green leg sticking out of the cornrows, flees back to the house. After opening up to Merrill about the death of his wife, noting that her last words were \\"tell Merrill to swing away\\", Graham goes to visit Ray, the first time since the incident. When Graham is gone, Merrill and the children watch a news report about footage taken of an alien creature in Brazil, showing that the aliens can blend into their surroundings. Merrill joins the children in wearing tin foil hats, believing the aliens can read their minds. At Ray's, Graham finds Ray is bleeding from an injury but otherwise apologetic for the accident. After Graham accepts his apology, Ray departs for a nearby lake, saying \\"they\\" do not like water. Graham finds Ray has trapped one of the aliens in his pantry, and tries to see what the alien looks like using a kitchen knife under the door; the alien grabs at him, and Graham...

Ian wanted to treat Brian's agoraphobia because  Choices: [1]. Ian is a doctor and wants him to get better.; [2]. Brian is a doctor and wants him to get better.;","output":"Ian wanted to treat Brian's agoraphobia because Ian is a doctor and wants him to get better. As a healthcare professional dedicated to helping his patients, Ian felt responsible for addressing Brian's condition and believed that with the right support, Brian could overcome his fears. As a first step, Ian assessed the severity of Brian's agoraphobia to determine the appropriate course of action. He asked Brian to describe his symptoms and experiences to gain a better understanding of his specific challenges. This information would be essential in creating a personalized treatment plan suited to Brian's needs. Next, Ian decided to refer Brian to a mental health specialist, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist, who had expertise in treating agoraphobia. Collaborating with other medical professionals would be essential to ensure that the recommended treatments and therapies would be effective in helping Brian manage his condition. After consulting with the specialist, Ian and the mental health professional agreed that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) would be the most suitable therapeutic approach for Brian. CBT focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to anxiety, which can play a significant role in agoraphobia. In addition to CBT, Ian also suggested that Brian could benefit from participating in an exposure therapy program. This would involve gradually exposing Brian to the situations and places that triggered his agoraphobia, at a pace that he would find manageable. The goal was to help Brian develop coping strategies to handle his anxiety more effectively and eventually feel more comfortable in these environments. Lastly, Ian considered the possibility of prescribing medication to help manage Brian's anxiety symptoms in the initial stages of treatment. However, this decision would be made in consultation with the mental health specialist, to ensure the potential benefits of medication would outweigh any potential side effects. Ian wanted nothing more than to see Brian live a happier and healthier life, free from the constraints of agoraphobia. He was determined to provide the necessary support and expertise to help Brian overcome his fears, face the world with renewed confidence, and live a life he truly enjoyed."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Process:  - Muscles work by expanding and contracting - A muscle fiber gets a signal from its nerve - Proteins and chemicals release energy to either contract the muscle or relax it - When the muscles contracts the bones connected to he muscle are pulled closer together - When the muscle relaxes the bones move farther apart.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose The muscles being pulled closer to the bones happens, how will it affect muscles contracting LESS INTENSELY.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of muscles being pulled closer to the bones may have an indirect effect on the process of muscle contraction. If the muscles are pulled closer to the bones, the initial distance between the bones would be reduced. As a result, when the muscles contract, they may generate less force or pull on the bones. This could lead to less movement and potentially a less intense contraction. However, the actual intensity of the muscle contraction would still be determined by the nerve signals, proteins, and chemicals involved in the process, so the perturbation might be seen as an additional factor influencing the outcome, rather than a direct impact on the contraction process itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does \\"This model has been refined since the discovery of genes that can encode multiple proteins by alternative splicing and coding sequences split in short section across the genome whose mRNAs are concatenated by trans-splicing.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"How are alternative splicing and coding sequences distributed?\\"","output":"The sentence you provided states, \\"This model has been refined since the discovery of genes that can encode multiple proteins by alternative splicing and coding sequences split in short sections across the genome whose mRNAs are concatenated by trans-splicing.\\" This sentence provides information related to the concepts of alternative splicing, coding sequences, and trans-splicing, but does not offer a clear or comprehensive answer to the question \\"How are alternative splicing and coding sequences distributed?\\"  To address the question, let's first explain alternative splicing and coding sequences. Alternative splicing is a process by which a single gene can produce multiple protein isoforms through the selective inclusion or exclusion of exons in the mRNA transcript. Exons are the coding regions of a gene that contain the information for protein synthesis. During mRNA maturation, introns (non-coding regions) are removed, and exons are assembled in various combinations to create different mature mRNA transcripts. The alternative splicing process allows a single gene to generate diverse proteins, which adds complexity to the proteome without requiring an increase in the number of genes. Coding sequences, on the other hand, pertain to the sections of a gene that directly encode the information required to synthesize proteins. These sequences contain the triplet codon patterns that specify the amino acids needed to construct a protein. They are integral parts of the gene structure and play a crucial role in translating the genetic information into functional proteins. Now, to answer the question of how alternative splicing and coding sequences are distributed, we must consider the arrangement of coding sequences within the genome and how this influences the potential for alternative splicing. Coding sequences are typically located within exons, and the positioning of exons--particularly their relative distances and the presence of regulatory elements that control the splicing process--are essential factors in determining the potential for alternative splicing. In many cases, exons can be distributed throughout a gene, interspersed with introns. In some instances, exons can be quite small, and their distribution can impact the variety and regulation of alternative splicing events. The process of alternative splicing is influenced by cis-regulatory elements present within the exons and introns as well. These regulatory elements interact with trans-acting proteins, such as splicing factors, which collectively determine the outcome of alternative splicing events. Apart from alternative splicing, the aforementioned sentence also touches on trans-splicing, a less common form of RNA processing. Trans-splicing involves the joining of exons from two different primary RNA transcripts, generating a mature mRNA molecule. This process alters the distribution of coding sequences by physically linking exons from distinct transcripts together. Though this phenomenon has been observed in various organisms, it is less prevalent and less well understood as compared to alternative splicing. In summary, alternative splicing and coding sequences are distributed throughout the genome in a complex interplay between the arrangement of exons, introns, and regulatory elements. This distribution influences the potential for alternative splicing events to occur, ultimately impacting the diversity and complexity of the proteome. The provided sentence does touch upon some aspects of alternative splicing and coding sequences; however, it does not provide sufficient detail or clarity to completely answer the question at hand."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Landowners were seeking to \\"improve\\" their estates in line with the industrial revolution. Their hope was to make more capital from the land by running shooting estates, or starting industrial-scale livestock farming. In some cases people who had lived on the land for generations left voluntarily, while others were forcibly evicted and their homes burned and demolished. Once in Canada, Ms McPherson and the others cleared from Sutherland had to walk 100 miles (161kms) to the colony in wintry conditions in handmade snowshoes.

Translate to English","output":"Dear Mr. Speaker, it is rare that a draft directive arouses such passion. The speaker's statement indicates a situation in which a proposed directive (a legislative act of the European Union) has generated an unusually intense emotional response, likely from the public and the politicians involved in its discussion. A draft directive is a proposal for a new law or regulation. In this context, it seems to have caused quite a heated debate or significant controversy. Directives, as legal instruments, aim to establish binding goals or objectives for the relevant EU member states to achieve. They require each member state to adapt their national laws to meet these objectives, allowing for some flexibility in how they are implemented. Once legal acts are adopted, they become enforceable and can potentially have a significant impact on the daily life of EU citizens, public institutions, industry, and businesses. Given the nature of the debate around proposed legislation, there are various reasons why a draft directive could arouse such passion. Some of these factors might include the following: 1. Societal implications: Depending on the subject matter, a draft directive might have significant implications for citizens across the member states, affecting aspects of their daily lives, civil liberties, or human rights. This may lead to a strong emotional response, as individuals feel their quality of life or access to certain rights could be put at risk. 2. Economic repercussions: A draft directive with substantial economic consequences can lead to passionate debates, particularly if different stakeholders hold conflicting interests. For instance, a proposed regulation could benefit industry at the expense of environmental or consumer protection or vice versa. 3. Political ideologies: Legislation proposals can sometimes be closely linked to political ideology and express values that are championed by one political faction but opposed by another. In such cases, heated debates and passionate contestations may ensue. 4. Historical context: A draft directive may draw on historical disputes, events, or experiences that evoke strong emotions. Associations with past traumas or grievances can touch sensitivities, leading to heated discussions. In conclusion, the given statement expresses the sentiment that the draft directive has triggered an atypically fervent and impassioned response. The reasons for such a reaction may stem from the societal, economic, or political implications vested in the proposed legislation to historical context. The intensity of the response signifies the deep-rooted importance of the proposed directive and its potential impact on the European Union's member states and their citizens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options：  A. deep sea  B. slaughterhouse  C. cattle ranch  D. countryside  E. barnyard The answer to this question is:","output":"C. cattle ranch Step 1: Analyze the context The question is about cowboys herding heifers (young female cows) across the property. Cowboys are associated with handling, herding, and tending to cattle. Properties usually associated with cattle would be a ranch, farm, or similar setting. Step 2: Evaluate each option A. deep sea - This is unrelated to the context provided. Cowboys and heifers have no connection to the sea. B. slaughterhouse - Although possible, this answer suggests a more negative outcome and doesn't align with the more typical day-to-day duties of cowboys, such as herding cattle on a property. C. cattle ranch - This option is the most suitable answer. It aligns with the context of cowboys and their responsibility in tending to cattle. D. countryside - While this may be part of the property, it does not provide a specific destination for where the heifers are being herded. E. barnyard - While somewhat related to cattle, this option is more connected to a general farm setting rather than specifically a place for herding cattle.

Answer the following question: Process:  - Electromagnet creates magnetic field with electricity - Conductive copper wire is wrapped around a piece of metal - An electric current gets introduced from power source - Flows through the wire - Magnetic field gets created in the wire - And the metal gets magnetized - When turned off it is no longer magnetic.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less electric current flows through the wire happens, how will it affect a STRONGER electromagnet.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If less electric current flows through the wire, it will directly affect the strength of the electromagnet. Let's break down the process step-by-step: 1. Electromagnet creates a magnetic field with electricity: Electromagnetic strength depends on the amount of electric current flowing through the wire. 2. Conductive copper wire is wrapped around a piece of metal: This step remains unchanged as it depends on the physical setup of the electromagnet rather than the electric current. 3. An electric current gets introduced from the power source: With the perturbation hypothesis, the electric current introduced will be lesser than initially. 4. Flows through the wire: The lesser electric current will flow through the wire. 5. Magnetic field gets created in the wire: As the electric current gets reduced, the created magnetic field will be weaker than before. 6. And the metal gets magnetized: With a weaker magnetic field, the metal piece will be less magnetized than before. 7. When turned off it is no longer magnetic: This step remains unchanged as it depends on the absence of electric current, regardless of strength. So, yes, the supposed perturbation of less electric current flowing through the wire does have an effect on the process. It directly affects the strength of the resulting magnetic field and, consequently, the strength of the electromagnet. With less electric current, the electromagnet will be weaker than intended."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

However, being worn doesn't necessarily mean that the bat is sleeping. Step 3: Consider other possibilities There could be other reasons for a bat to look worn, such as age, illness, or injury. Additionally, just because a bat looks worn doesn't mean it's currently sleeping. The bat may have recently slept or is about to sleep, but it may not be sleeping at the moment based on the worn appearance alone.

These include:  Friction: This is generally intense friction over a short period of time. Corns and calluses develop from longer-term rubbing. Burns: Any source of intense heat from flames, steam, the sun, or hot surfaces can result in a blister Cold: Blisters can result from intense cold. Irritants or Allergens: The reaction of the skin to various chemical irritants or allergens can result in blistering. Drug reactions: There are a wide variety of drugs which can cause skin reactions, including blisters. Diseases and Infections: There are autoimmune diseases where the immune system reacts against components of the skin that can result in blisters. These all require medical attention. These disorders include pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid, and dermatitis herpetiformis. Infections with viruses, such as chickenpox, shingles, and cold sores, or bacteria can also result in blistering Genetics: Certain rare genetic disorders result in widespread blistering. Insect bites: Some insect and spider bites result in blisters. Most blisters are minor and will go away on their own. However, there are a few reasons why you should go to the doctor with a blister.  Go to the doctor if your blister is infected. The blister will have yellow or green pus in it if it is infected. It may also be extremely painful, red, and hot. See your doctor if the blisters are causing you severe pain. Get checked out by a doctor if your blisters keep coming back. You should also get checked out if your blisters are in odd places, like eyelids and your mouth. See your doctor if severe blisters are received from sunburns, burns, scalds, or allergic reactions. You should try to prevent any blisters from happening in the first place. To help prevent blisters on your feet, only wear properly fitting shoes or socks, shoes, and insoles marketed to help prevent blisters. You may also consider moisture-wicking socks.  Place moleskin on places in your shoes to rub against your skin or put powder inside your shoes to absorb moisture.

Katrina had to pull Victoria out of the dangerous ocean current because","output":"Katrina had to pull Victoria out of the dangerous ocean current because Victoria, who was inexperienced in navigating the unpredictable waters, found herself entangled in the deceptive grip of a powerful riptide. This forceful convergence of waves and currents invariably puts the lives of divers and swimmers at risk as it can swiftly transport them out to sea, trapping them in a vortex of relentless surf. For Katrina, her extensive knowledge of oceanic conditions and an inherent passion for water safety had led her to become well-acquainted with the techniques needed to escape such treacherous situations. No stranger to the ocean and its potential perils, she had spent several years honing her lifesaving skills – both through formal training and firsthand experience – to prepare for moments like these. Upon identifying Victoria's struggle for safety amidst the churning waves, Katrina quickly assessed the situation and identified the severity of Victoria's plight. Reacting with both precision and calmness, she swam out to her friend in a diagonal course, ensuring that she did not become entrapped in the same deadly current. Along the way, she recalled the importance of conserving energy while offering assistance, quietly noting that every ounce of strength would be crucial in their survival. As she neared Victoria, Katrina saw the terror and desperation etched across her friend's face, her eyes widening with fear as she wrestled to break free from the water's vice-like hold. Wasting no time, Katrina skillfully maneuvered herself into a position where she could wrap her arm around Victoria's torso, carefully positioning her in a way that would provide maximum buoyancy while she swam. With her free arm, Katrina employed a combination of both strength and strategy to navigate out of the riptide's deadly clutch. By swimming at a forty-five-degree angle parallel to the shore, she managed to harness the power of the lateral current to disrupt the force keeping Victoria captive. Katrina knew that timing was of the essence, and her knowledge of the ocean's dynamics allowed her to expertly maneuver in a manner that would ultimately carry the pair safely back to the shallower waters. Exhausted but alive, they finally reached the safety of the shoreline. With adrenaline coursing through her veins and her heart pounding in her ears, Katrina could not help but feel a deep sense of relief, gratification, and pride in her ability to save Victoria from harm's way.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Rouvas was born on 5 January 1972 in the village of Mandoukion, near Corfu City on the island of Corfu, the eldest of four sons of Konstantinos \\"Kostas\\" Rouvas (an ambulance driver) and the teenaged Anna-Maria Panaretou (a duty-free shop clerk at the local airport). He has three brothers: Billy (b. Vasilios), Tolis (b. Apostolos, 1975) and Nikos (b. Nikolaos, 1991). The family was poor, and Rouvas began taking care of his brothers at age five. At age four, he exhibited athletic ability and took ballet classes as a child. Context: In December 1998 Rouvas released his sixth album (the first with his new label): Kati Apo Mena (Something From Me), written by Giorgos Theofanous. \\"Den Ehi Sidera I Kardia Sou\\" (\\"Your Heart Doesn't Have Steel Rails\\") was a hit, and remains one of his most-popular songs. To promote the album Rouvas performed at the Virgin Megastore in Athens, where thousands of fans created a traffic jam. The next year, Rouvas records \\"Oso Exo Esena\\" (\\"As Long As I Have You\\"), a duet with singer Stelios Rokkos. The two artists work and perform together at Bio Bio in Athens during the summer.  In March 2000 Rouvas released his seventh album, 21os Akatallilos (21+ X-Rated), and performed with Katy Garbi at Pili Axiou in Thessaloniki. The album and its first single, \\"Andexa\\" (\\"I Held Out\\"), reached number one on the charts. During May rehearsals for summer performances Rouvas was hospitalized with abdominal pain, which was diagnosed as peritonitis and required an appendectomy. On 25 October 2000, he began appearing with Antonis Remos and Peggy Zina at Apollonas for the winter season. That year Rouvas became the Pepsi spokesperson for the company's Greek summer campaign making a first television ad, a first for a Greek entertainer. His collaboration with Pepsi continued into 2001, with a May television ad. The advertisement, featuring a semi-nude Rouvas holding a Pepsi bottle in front of his genitals, was controversial among women's rights and parental associations. Calling it \\"unsightly, vulgar and unacceptable\\", they tried to have the ad blocked as \\"disgrac[ing] childhood innocence and dignity.\\" The Pepsi Tour 2001, of seven Greek cities, followed.  During summer 2000 Rouvas, Psinakis and a number of other celebrities visited Mykonos on a yacht borrowed from a local physician. They were accused of drug possession, since the yacht contained narcotics. The incident was publicized amid speculation that Rouvas might have a drug addiction. Although the doctor admitted that the narcotics were his, his guests were questioned. Wishing to avoid court, Rouvas paid a fine and minimized the incident. However, thousands of T-shirts were printed which read: \\"Imoun ki ego sto kotero!\\" (\\"I was on the yacht, too!\\"). Question: what label Answer:","output":"Rouvas' new label in December 1998 was called Kati Apo Mena (Something From Me)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

Chinese A:","output":"Title: The Price of Progress Genre: Drama/Comedy Plot: In a small, financially struggling Midwestern American town, the residents are desperate to bring life back to their once-prosperous community. When a Chinese multinational corporation announces plans to open a manufacturing plant in the town, everyone is initially overjoyed by the prospect of new job opportunities and an economic boost.  The main character, Emma Thompson, is a single mother working two jobs to make ends meet for her and her teenage daughter, Lily. She is excited about the new plant, hoping that it would improve their lives. However, things take an unexpected turn when rumors begin to circulate that the corporation plans to staff the plant with Chinese workers instead of hiring the local townspeople. The reasoning behind this move is the lower wages that Chinese workers would accept, keeping costs low for the corporation. Angry and frustrated by this decision, the people of the town, led by Emma, decide to band together and fight for their right to have the company hire them instead. They hold protests, attend town hall meetings, and launch a social media campaign to raise awareness of their plight. As the story unfolds, a rivalry develops between the local townspeople and the Chinese workers. However, Emma's daughter, Lily, unexpectedly befriends one of the young Chinese workers, Wang Li, who is a victim of human trafficking and is forced to work for the company. Through their friendship, it becomes clear that the Chinese workers are also being exploited, and Emma realizes that the real enemy is not the workers themselves, but the corporation taking advantage of both groups. Together, Emma and Wang Li expose the truth about the company's labor practices, leading to a nationwide debate about the consequences of globalization and the true cost of cheap labor. Eventually, the corporation is forced to change its policies, agreeing to pay fair wages to all workers, both local and foreign.  In the end, the town benefits from the new factory, and Emma takes a job there, ensuring a more stable future for her and her daughter. Meanwhile, Wang Li, having gained his freedom, decides to stay in the town and continue working alongside the townspeople. The movie ends on a hopeful note, showing that despite their differences, people can come together to fight for a common cause and create positive change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His life is disrupted when the store's night security guard is murdered. The local police have no leads, and show no interest in investigating further. Determined to find the killer and bring him to justice, Evan decides to form a neighborhood watch. However, he only manages to recruit Bob (Vince Vaughn), a construction worker and loving father; Franklin (Jonah Hill), a high school dropout who dreams of being a police officer but failed the written, physical, and mental-health tests; and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), a recent divorcÃ©. The watch members use the group as an excuse to drink and have fun (much to Evan's annoyance). While driving on patrol, they accidentally hit something. They discover a strange metallic orb that acts as a highly-destructive weapon, and deduce that it is of alien origin. Meanwhile, several more townspeople are mysteriously killed.

Is Buddhists believe that this is accomplished through the direct understanding and perception of dependent origination and the Four Noble Truths. a good answer to this question? OPT: A). yes. B). no.","output":"B). No. While the provided answer touches upon some key points, it does not offer a comprehensive understanding of the practices of Buddhism. Here is a more detailed and long answer to better address the question: The practices of Buddhism are based on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, also known as the Buddha. Buddhism emphasizes the cultivation of wisdom, ethical conduct, and mental discipline to achieve the ultimate goal of enlightenment, or Nirvana. There are several core teachings and practices central to Buddhism, including the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, the Five Precepts, and meditation. 1. The Four Noble Truths: The Four Noble Truths are the foundational teachings of Buddhism and serve as a guide to understanding the nature of existence. They are:    a) The truth of suffering (Dukkha): Life is characterized by suffering, be it physical, emotional, or mental.    b) The truth of the cause of suffering (Samudaya): Suffering is caused by craving and attachment to transient objects and experiences. This cause is often referred to as the Three Poisons—desire, hatred, and ignorance.    c) The truth of the end of suffering (Nirodha): By eliminating craving and attachment, one can achieve the cessation of suffering.    d) The truth of the path to the cessation of suffering (Magga): The path to the cessation of suffering is found through following the Eightfold Path. 2. The Eightfold Path: This path offers practical guidance and practice for achieving the cessation of suffering. The Eightfold Path consists of:    a) Right Understanding: Developing a deep understanding of the Four Noble Truths.    b) Right Intention: Cultivating an attitude of compassionate non-harming and renouncing craving.    c) Right Speech: Communicating truthfully, kindly, and helpfully.    d) Right Action: Acting ethically and responsibly toward oneself and others.    e) Right Livelihood: Engaging in an occupation that promotes peace and well-being, avoiding those that contribute to suffering.    f) Right Effort: Diligently working to maintain wholesome states of mind and eliminate unwholesome ones.    g) Right Mindfulness: Developing awareness and being fully present in each moment.    h) Right Concentration: Practicing meditation to cultivate deeper states of concentration and insight. 3. The Five Precepts: These precepts serve as guidelines for ethical conduct in daily life. They are:    a) Abstaining from taking life.        b) Abstaining from taking what is not freely given.        c) Abstaining from sexual misconduct.        d) Abstaining from false speech.        e) Abstaining from intoxicants leading to heedlessness. 4. Meditation: Meditation is a central practice in Buddhism for cultivating mindfulness, concentration, and insight. There are many forms of meditation in Buddhism, with two primary types being:    a) Mindfulness meditation (Vipassana): A practice focused on developing insight into the nature of reality through observation of the impermanence, suffering, and selflessness of phenomena.    b) Concentration meditation (Samatha): A practice aimed at developing deep concentration and mental tranquility, often by focusing on a single object or concept. By engaging in these practices, Buddhists aim to eradicate ignorance and cultivate wisdom, fostering direct understanding and perception of dependent origination (the interconnected nature of phenomena), and ultimately, achieving enlightenment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: A man sustained life-threatening injuries after a \\"domestic incident\\" in Merthyr Tydfil, police have said. Article:","output":"Title: Life-threatening Injuries Result From Domestic Incident in Merthyr Tydfil Introduction A recent domestic incident in Merthyr Tydfil, a town in Wales, has resulted in a man sustaining life-threatening injuries. While the exact nature of the incident remains under investigation, these events often involve violence or abuse within a household, which highlights the ongoing need for increased awareness and resources to address domestic violence. Details of the Incident According to the local police, the incident took place in a residential neighborhood in Merthyr Tydfil. The victim, an adult male, was transported to a nearby hospital following the altercation. Though specific details on the nature of the injuries have not been disclosed, it is evident that they were of a severe nature, necessitating urgent medical attention. The authorities have emphasized that the case is being treated as a \\"domestic incident,\\" indicating that it likely occurred within a household or close relationship. While the police have yet to release details of the circumstances leading up to the violent event, it can be inferred that such situations often involve intimate partners or family members. Addressing Domestic Violence Domestic incidents, such as this, are a tragic reminder of the prevalence of domestic violence within our society. Many experts argue that the true extent of domestic violence remains hidden due to unreported cases, stigma, and a lack of awareness surrounding the issue. It is crucial for communities to come together to support victims, raise awareness, and work towards breaking the cycles of violence that persist in so many households. Social, emotional, and psychological factors often contribute to the complexity of domestic violence incidents. These include, but are not limited to, financial stress, substance abuse, and unaddressed mental health issues. By addressing the root causes of domestic violence and providing support to those affected, communities can begin to break these cycles and create safer environments for individuals and families. Resources for Victims of Domestic Violence It is important for anyone impacted by domestic violence, either directly or indirectly, to know that help is available. Multiple resources exist to aid victims, including hotlines, shelters, and support groups. In the UK, organizations such as Women's Aid and Refuge, as well as the national domestic violence helpline, offer 24-hour support services to those in need. For those who suspect a friend or family member may be experiencing domestic violence, it is crucial to offer a listening ear, emotional support, and guidance towards appropriate resources. It is also important to remember that domestic violence does not discriminate and affects individuals of all genders, ages, and backgrounds. Conclusion The unfortunate incident that unfolded in Merthyr Tydfil is yet another stark reminder of the devastation that domestic violence can bring to individuals and families. As investigations continue into this specific case, it is imperative for communities, law enforcement, and support organizations to work together in addressing the underlying causes of domestic violence and providing aid to those affected. Together, we can end the cycle of violence and create a more compassionate, supportive world for everyone."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

I found myself sitting in my house constantly worried. I decided to force myself to find some volunteer work to occupy my thoughts. The first place I sought out was the Arizona Humane Society. It offered me a program, \\"Equestrian Therapy Program\\" ,whose mission is to build self-esteem and confidence in children who have been through difficult times in their lives. Being with animals was the only time I truly felt 1 had a place in the world. But I had never been around a horse in my life. I found myself a little apprehensive during my first day--being around such large strong animals was much harder than the three cats I'm accustomed to caring for. I found that I wasn't different during my first day around these fantastic creatures from the kids who came into the program. But there is a strange transformation when one is around horses. I found myself playing the role of student, observer, teacher, mentor, worker, friend, and companion; not only to the kids,but to the horses and staff! Before long, I was good at handling the horses and kids and having a grand time working with human and animal elements equally. I realize this experience has helped me to develop my horizons in ways I never thought likely.

In addition, they choose among elective subjects  to complete their high school education. Electives include subjects in technology, music, art, and foreign languages. Each student in the school has their own locker for books and personal items. This convenience saves students from carrying textbooks, and allows students a small space they can decorate with(......)posters and favorite objects. Cheating in any form is strictly prohibited in American schools. And in fact, high school students usually don't cheat. If they are caught cheating, they will have to face severe punishment. Each school holds certain yearly activities for all school students, such as homecoming , prom night , holiday celebrations, etc. Most high schools have at least one sports team that competes in local games, and all students are encouraged to take part in athletics. Schools often offer football, baseball and softball, basketball, volleyball, tennis, and soccer. Some may even have sports like golf, swimming, gymnastics and cross-country skiing. Many high school students have part-time jobs by the age of 15 or 16, some even earlier. Their first jobs are often babysitting or cutting lawns , but later they will likely get a job at a fast-food restaurant, video store, or clothing shop. Sixteen years old is legal driving age in most states, and students usually want to own a car as soon as they can.

I know that the answer to the question \\"An adjective that refers to threefold is?\\" is in \\"Due to recording mastering and manufacturing limitations, both high and low frequencies were removed from the first recorded signals by various formulae. With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise.

Inspired by the variety of music that his parents listened to, which included country, rock, disco and R&B, McGaughey first sang in his church choir before founding an R&B band. He later switched his focus to country music, performing in various bars and clubs in Texas. McGaughey, after attending junior college near his hometown, found work selling shoes at a shopping mall. You Gotta Love That, his fourth album, also received a platinum certification and producing four singles: \\"For a Change\\", \\"They're Playin' Our Song\\" and the title track (respectively the first, second, and fourth singles) all peaked at No. 3, while \\"If I Was a Drinkin' Man\\" reached No. 16.  McCoy's self-titled fifth studio album began a decline in his chart momentum. Although it was certified gold, Neal McCoy accounted for only one Top Ten hit in a cover of The Casinos' 1967 doo-wop single \\"Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye\\". The next two singles -- \\"Going, Going, Gone\\" and \\"That Woman of Mine\\" -- both peaked at No. 35. Also in 1996, he sang guest vocals on the multi-artist charity single \\"Hope\\", the proceeds of which went to the T. J. Martell Foundation's cancer research. After \\"That Woman of Mine\\", he reached No. 5 with \\"The Shake\\", the only new song on his first Greatest Hits package, which reprised nine of his greatest hits to that point and also earned platinum certification.  Be Good at It, his sixth studio release, followed in 1998. This was his first album since Where Forever Begins not to include a Top Ten hit. The title track, \\"If You Can't Be Good, Be Good at It\\", was the highest-peaking single release from it at No. 22, followed by \\"Party On\\", which became his first single since 1992 to miss Top 40 entirely. After it came the No. 29 \\"Love Happens Like That.\\" McCoy made a second appearance on a multi-artist charity single that same year, as one of several collaborators on \\"One Heart at a Time\\", a song written by Victoria Shaw to benefit cystic fibrosis research.  In 1999, McCoy released his final album for Atlantic, The Life of the Party. It only accounted for two singles: the Phil Vassar co-write \\"I Was\\" at No. 37 and \\"The Girls of Summer\\" at No. 42. He, Tracy Byrd, and T. Graham Brown also sang guest vocals on \\"Now That's Awesome\\", a song featuring snippets of a Bill Engvall comedy sketch, found on Engvall's Now That's Awesome album.

Given the question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What term provides a career description that matches the brothers Louis and Nathan Thompson? The answer is:","output":"The term that best provides a career description matching the brothers Louis and Nathan Thompson is \\"roller coaster designers\\" or \\"roller coaster engineers\\". Louis and Nathan Thompson are renowned for their work as roller coaster engineers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Born into a family of engineers, they were inspired from a young age to build and innovate. They went on to become among the most influential figures in the amusement park industry, significantly contributing to the development and popularization of roller coasters as we know them today. Louis Thompson is arguably the more famous of the two brothers, largely due to his invention of the \\"Scenic Railway\\", widely considered the world's first modern roller coaster. This revolutionary design, first unveiled at a fairground in Massachusetts in 1884, introduced several new features that set it apart from its precursors. Most notably, it was the first roller coaster to be designed as a complete circuit, meaning that the cars would end their journey at the same place they started, something we take for granted in roller coasters today. Meanwhile, Nathan Thompson's contribution to roller coaster engineering was no less impactful. He focused on improving the safety of roller coasters, which at that time were notorious for causing numerous accidents. He developed a new braking system that reduced the chance of a car derailing or failing to stop, significantly improving the safety of such rides. The Thompson brothers' work eventually led to the formation of the L.A. Thompson Scenic Railway Company, which operated and produced roller coasters across the United States and Europe. The company grew rapidly and became a dominant force in the amusement park industry in the early 20th century. In summary, the term \\"roller coaster designers\\" or \\"roller coaster engineers\\" would suitably describe the career paths of Louis and Nathan Thompson. Their work and innovations in roller coaster design and safety have left a lasting legacy, and they are widely recognized as pioneers of the roller coaster industry."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Also, assign neutral label to reviews that express no clear sentiment toward an entity or any aspect of it. Teacher: Now, understand the problem?

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the work that was criticised as old-fashioned? , can you please find it?   Sir William Turner Walton, OM (29 March 1902 – 8 March 1983) was an English composer. During a sixty-year career, he wrote music in several classical genres and styles, from film scores to opera. His best-known works include Façade, the cantata Belshazzar's Feast, the Viola Concerto, the First Symphony, and the British coronation anthems Crown Imperial and Orb and Sceptre. Born in Oldham, Lancashire, the son of a musician, Walton was a chorister and then an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford. On leaving the university, he was taken up by the literary Sitwell siblings, who provided him with a home and a cultural education. His earliest work of note was a collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Façade, which at first brought him notoriety as a modernist, but later became a popular ballet score. In middle age, Walton left Britain and set up home with his young wife Susana on the Italian island of Ischia. By this time, he had ceased to be regarded as a modernist, and some of his compositions of the 1950s were criticised as old-fashioned. His only full-length opera, Troilus and Cressida, was among the works to be so labelled and has made little impact in opera houses. In his last years, his works came back into critical fashion; his later compositions, dismissed by critics at the time of their premieres, were revalued and regarded alongside his earlier works. Walton was a slow worker, painstakingly perfectionist, and his complete body of work across his long career is not large. His most popular compositions continue to be frequently performed in the 21st century, and by 2010 almost all his works had been released on CD.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said.

Question: What is a benefit of fused quartz? Answer: It has excellent thermal shock characteristics, being able to survive immersion in water while red hot.  A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Choose your answer from: (a). yes (b). no","output":"(b). no Fused quartz, also referred to as fused silica, is a type of glass made from high-purity silica in a non-crystalline state. It is produced by melting silica at extremely high temperatures and cooling it rapidly to form a vitreous solid. Fused quartz offers several unique properties that make it a valuable material in various applications, including lighting, electronics, semiconductors, and optics. Some of the key benefits of fused quartz include: 1. Exceptional thermal shock resistance: Fused quartz exhibits excellent resistance to thermal shock, making it suitable for applications that involve rapid temperature changes or exposure to extreme temperatures. This property allows it to withstand immersion in water while red-hot, as mentioned in the original answer. 2. Optical transparency: Due to its pure and non-crystalline nature, fused quartz displays outstanding transparency over a wide range of wavelengths, from ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR). This characteristic makes it ideal for use in lenses, windows, and other optical components that require high transmittance of light. 3. Low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE): Fused quartz has a very low CTE, which means it does not expand or contract significantly when exposed to temperature changes. This property is particularly desirable in applications where dimensional stability is crucial, such as precision instruments and semiconductor manufacturing. 4. Chemical inertness: Fused quartz is highly resistant to chemical attack, even when exposed to aggressive chemicals and acids. This attribute makes it a suitable material for laboratory glassware, chemical processing equipment, and semiconductor manufacturing, where maintaining purity and minimizing contamination is essential. 5. High electrical resistivity: Fused quartz possesses a very high electrical resistivity, making it a strong electrical insulator. This property allows it to be used in various electrical and electronic applications, such as insulators, sensors, and high-voltage equipment. 6. High mechanical strength: Though it is a form of glass, fused quartz exhibits impressive mechanical strength and hardness. These features contribute to its durability and make it suitable for demanding applications where other forms of glass may not withstand the mechanical stress. 7. Radiation resistance: Fused quartz can withstand high levels of ionizing radiation, making it suitable for use in nuclear power plants, medical imaging devices, and radiation monitoring equipment. In summary, fused quartz offers several unique benefits that make it a valuable material in numerous applications. Its outstanding thermal shock resistance, optical transparency, low coefficient of thermal expansion, chemical inertness, high electrical resistivity, mechanical strength, and radiation resistance make it a versatile and high-performance material that is sought after in various industries."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The expected temperature is 11°C, which could be considered relatively cool depending on the time of year and the geographical location. 3. \\"During the day, they will reach a maximum of 34°C\\": This suggests that as the day progresses, the temperatures will rise significantly, reaching a peak of 34°C. This is a rather high temperature and could denote a hot summer day. 4. \\"Low temperatures at night will be around 11°C\\": This part refers to the nighttime temperatures, which are forecasted to drop back down to around 11°C. This could indicate a significant daily temperature range, again common in summer months in many regions. 5. \\"We have weak northwesterly winds\\": This is information about the expected wind conditions. The forecast predicts weak winds, moving from the northwest direction. The wind direction and strength can have an impact on the perceived temperature and the general weather development. For example, in some regions, certain wind directions are associated with particular weather patterns. The term 'weak' suggests that the wind will be gentle, and likely not a cause for concern.

Quidditch is a popular sport in the wizarding world, as portrayed in the Harry Potter series written by J.K. Rowling. As they play their game, the players are transported to a world involving magical creatures, powerful spells, and flying broomsticks, where they can escape their everyday lives and experience the thrill of playing Quidditch as if they are attending the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In their imaginative story, the main protagonist seems to be a young witch who is eager to play Quidditch and prove her worth, despite her overprotective brothers not allowing her to participate in their pickup games. She has always been left on the sidelines, having to keep score and watch enviously as her brothers take part in the exciting sport. This character's struggles reflect the universal theme of breaking free from expectations and challenges imposed by others and pursue one's passion. As they play the game, the players are crafting a story filled with memorable characters who take on different roles in the Quidditch team. The character who performs a good impression of Fred is likely referring to Fred Weasley, a Quidditch player and mischief-maker at the Hogwarts school. This reference creates a sense of camaraderie and shared experiences among the players, who are familiar with the Harry Potter series and can easily relate to the characters' dynamics. Within their imaginative story, the players might include dramatic in-game confrontations, exhilarating matches, and nail-biting finishes as they emulate their favorite characters in the Quidditch matches. They may also weave in elements of friendship, teamwork, and personal growth as their characters learn to trust each other and overcome obstacles together, just like the students at Hogwarts do. In conclusion, the players are imagining a captivating and thrilling story set in the enchanting world of Harry Potter, where they not only participate in exhilarating Quidditch matches but also explore themes of friendship, perseverance, and personal growth. Through their game, they are able to escape their mundane lives temporarily and venture into a magical realm where their characters can battle against all odds to prove themselves as formidable Quidditch players."},{"instruction":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who was known for their fascination with contrasts in skin tones?  William Etty (1787–1849), the seventh child of a York baker and miller, began his career as an apprentice printer in Hull at the age of 11. On completing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk crayons\\", with the intention of becoming a history painter in the tradition of the Old Masters, and studied under renowned artist Thomas Lawrence. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, Etty submitted numerous paintings to the Royal Academy of Arts and the British Institution, all of which were either rejected or received little attention when exhibited.In 1821 the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra), which depicted a large number of nude figures. Cleopatra was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, over the next decade Etty tried to replicate its success by painting nudes in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 included nude figures.While some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, the country had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of such material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in painting nudes, and many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received. From 1832 onwards, needled by repeated attacks from the press, Etty remained a prominent painter of nudes, but made conscious efforts to try to reflect moral lessons in his work.

What is the best idea to wish my crush her birthday through video message? What's best way to reply when someone wishes you happy birthday? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"No, these two questions are inquiring about distinct information. The first question is seeking creative ideas to wish a crush a happy birthday through a video message, while the second question is looking for the best way to respond when someone wishes you a happy birthday. I will answer both questions separately. 1. What is the best idea to wish my crush her birthday through video message? To create a heartfelt and memorable birthday video message for your crush, consider the following steps: a) Choose the right setting: Find a comfortable and visually appealing location to record your video message. This could be a cozy room filled with the person's favorite colors or a picturesque outdoor location like a park or beach, depending on their interests. b) Personalize the message: Start the video with a warm and enthusiastic greeting, addressing your crush by their name. Make it clear that you are thinking specifically about them on their special day. c) Mention shared memories or inside jokes: If you have any memories or inside jokes shared with your crush, incorporating these details into the birthday message can make it more personal and special. This shows that you pay attention to your interactions and value the experiences you've had together. d) Compliment them: Make sure to include genuine compliments about their personality or appearance in the message. Keep it light-hearted and avoid being overly intimate or making them uncomfortable. e) Offer a birthday wish: Express a thoughtful and genuine birthday wish for your crush. This could include wishes for happiness, success, and good health in the year ahead. Keep it sincere and focus on the positive aspects of their life. f) Keep it concise: Although you want to create a personalized and heartfelt message, avoid making the video too long. Aim for a length between 1-2 minutes, keeping the video's pacing engaging. g) Add creative elements: If you are skilled in video editing or have access to special effects, consider incorporating animations, transitions, or music that aligns with your crush's interests to make the video even more memorable. 2. What's the best way to reply when someone wishes you a happy birthday? When someone wishes you a happy birthday, it's important to express gratitude and reciprocate their positivity. Here are a few ideas to respond to a birthday wish: a) Thank them: Start by thanking the person for taking the time to remember your birthday and sending their wishes. A simple \\"Thank you for the birthday wishes!\\" can go a long way in showing appreciation. b) Acknowledge their thoughtfulness: Let them know how much their message means to you, for example, \\"Your message brightened my day!\\" c) Share a quick update: If you haven't spoken to the person in a while, provide a brief update on how you're enjoying your birthday. This could involve mentioning the activities you've done, the gifts received, or the people you've spent time with. d) Show your interest in their life: End your response by asking about their well-being or inquiring about a specific aspect of their life, such as work, school, or an ongoing project. This demonstrates that you value the relationship and want to continue the conversation beyond your birthday. e) Keep it light and friendly: No matter how you choose to respond, remember to maintain a friendly and positive tone that reflects the sentiments of the birthday wish you received."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If you're on one of these medications, it could be the cause of your high prolactin levels.  Dopamine, a brain chemical, blocks some secretion of prolactin. When you're on medications that block or lower your dopamine levels, your prolactin levels may rise. Some antipsychotics can cause this effect, such as risperidone, molindone, trifluoperazine, and haloperidol, and some antidepressants can, too. Metoclopramide, which is prescribed for severe nausea and acid reflux, may also increase the secretion of prolactin. A few medications that treat high blood pressure could also be the culprit, though it happens less frequently with these medications, which include reserpine, verapamil, and alpha-methyldopa. You don't want to go off a medication abruptly, especially one like an antipsychotic, which can have severe withdrawal effects. Therefore, if you want to get off one of these medications, discuss the issue with your doctor first. They may be able to switch you to another medication that doesn't have this effect. This medication has been shown to reduce prolactin levels when taken in place of other antipsychotics or when taken in addition to other antipsychotics. Ask your doctor if taking this medication is a possibility for you.  Antipsychotics have the potential to raise prolactin since it inhibits the dopamine that causes prolactin to secrete from the pituitary gland. For long-term antipsychotic treatment, you may develop a tolerance so your prolactin levels return to normal, but they may stay above normal levels.  This medication can cause side effects like dizziness, nervousness, headaches, stomach issues, weight gain, and pain in your joints. It can also make you feel unsteady on your feet. Summary:","output":"Some medicines can make a brain chemical called dopamine go down, and this makes another thing called prolactin go up, which can cause some problems, so you should talk to your doctor if you think your medicine might be doing this."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

However, when he rapped on it (tapped or knocked on the surface), the sound he heard contradicted his original assumption. Out of the given choices, \\"hollowness\\" is most logical since it directly contrasts with solidity. A hollow sound would indicate that the desk might not be as solid as James initially thought, possibly due to the presence of empty spaces or less dense materials within the desk's construction. The other choices do not directly relate to the sound produced by rapping on a desk: - Openness refers to the state of being open or available, which doesn't relate to the sound made by tapping a desk. - Instability refers to the lack of stability or steadiness, which could be a consequence of the hollowness, but not the sound produced. - Strange sounds are too vague, and do not specifically indicate a contradiction to solidity. - Weakness refers to the lack of strength, which could be another consequence of the hollowness, but it does not describe the sound itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Coming off a record-setting divisional road game against the Vikings, the Packers went home for a Sunday night divisional clash with their nemesis, the Chicago Bears. This would be the 174th meeting between the two teams. In the first quarter, Green Bay got off to a fast start by capping off the game's opening drive with rookie RB DeShawn Wynn getting a 2-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Bears tied the game with RB  Cedric Benson's 10-yard TD run. The Packers would end the first half with QB Brett Favre completing a 41-yard TD pass to WR Greg Jennings, along with rookie kicker Mason Crosby converting a 37-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Chicago crept closer with kicker Robbie Gould converting a 44-yard field goal. Green Bay responded with Crosby kicking a 37-yard field goal, yet the Bears pulled to within three as QB Brian Griese completed a 19-yard TD pass to TE Greg Olsen. In the fourth quarter, Chicago erased their deficit completely with Gould's 36-yard field goal and Griese's 34-yard TD pass to TE Desmond Clark.

Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: Who suggests using the tree hazard? Beetee Answer:","output":"Step 1: Introduce the main characters and setting In a small, close-knit town called Greenfield, a group of friends – Alex, Tara, Hank, and Mia – are high school students with a passion for environmental conservation. They're all members of the school's Environmental Club, advised by their science teacher, Mr. Beetee. Step 2: Establish the conflict A massive construction project is planned at the edge of town, threatening to destroy a significant portion of the local forest. The town residents are divided over the issue – some support the economic benefits, while others fear the environmental damage. Step 3: Introduce the tree hazard During one of the club meetings, Mr. Beetee suggests using the \\"tree hazard\\" as a means to stop or at least stall the construction project. The tree hazard refers to a specific tree deep within the forest that is infected with a rare, contagious fungus. If the fungus spreads, it could pose a significant risk to the surrounding ecosystem. Step 4: Plan the mission The Environmental Club members plan a covert mission to introduce the tree hazard to the construction site. Their goal is to persuade the construction company and the town to reconsider the project, weighing the potential environmental destruction against the purported economic benefits. Step 5: Execute the plan The group embarks on a challenging adventure through the forest, facing numerous obstacles as they locate and transport the hazardous tree. They remain cautious about not spreading the fungus themselves, taking necessary precautions. Step 6: Consequences and resolution Once the hazardous tree is placed at the construction site, news of the contagious fungus spreads rapidly. Concerned residents, fearing the ecological damage and health risks, demand the construction project be halted. The construction company agrees to review their plans and explore alternative ways to boost the local economy without jeopardizing the environment. Step 7: Character growth and development Throughout the movie, the main characters transform not only as environmental activists but also as friends. They learn to cooperate, trust, and rely on each other to overcome various challenges. Mr. Beetee serves as a wise mentor, guiding them in their mission and helping them understand the complexities of balancing economic growth with environmental conservation. In conclusion, the movie plot revolves around an environmental conflict in a small town. The protagonist group, led by Mr. Beetee's suggestion, embarks on a perilous adventure to introduce a tree hazard to the construction site to protect the local ecosystem and raise awareness. This ultimately leads to the reconsideration of the project, the strengthening of friendships, and lessons learned about finding balance in life and society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How do you do this: To attach felt to a piece of wood.","output":"To attach felt to a piece of wood, follow these steps: Step 1: Gather materials Ensure that you have the following items: - A piece of wood (clean and smooth surface) - A piece of felt (cut to the desired size) - A strong adhesive, such as wood glue or fabric glue (preferably one that dries clear) - A foam brush or a regular brush for applying the adhesive - Scissors or a utility knife to trim the felt, if necessary - A clean cloth or paper towel - Heavy objects or clamps to hold the felt in place while the adhesive dries (optional) Step 2: Prep the surfaces Ensure that the wood surface is clean, free of dust, and smooth. You can use sandpaper to smooth out any rough spots or imperfections. Similarly, for the felt, be sure it is cut to the desired size, and free of any fuzz or loose fibers that might get in the way of a good bond. Step 3: Apply adhesive Apply an even layer of the adhesive to either the felt or the wood using the foam brush or regular brush. Make sure to cover the entire surface that you want the felt to bond to, and spread the glue evenly to prevent any lumps or bumps. Step 4: Attach the felt Carefully position the felt on the wood, aligning the edges and corners as desired. Press the felt onto the wood, starting from the center and working your way out to the edges. This will help eliminate any air bubbles that may get trapped between the felt and the wood. Use your hands to firmly press the felt onto the wood, ensuring a strong bond. Step 5: Secure the felt You may want to place heavy objects or use clamps to hold the felt in place while the adhesive dries. This ensures that the felt remains flat against the wood and reduces the chance of it lifting or peeling away. Step 6: Wipe off excess adhesive If there is any excess adhesive that has seeped out from the edges, use a clean cloth or paper towel to gently wipe it away before it dries. Step 7: Let it dry Allow the adhesive to dry completely according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically 24 hours. Do not disturb the felt or the wood during this time, as it may weaken the bond. Step 8: Trim, if necessary If the felt is not perfectly aligned with the wood, or if there is any overhang, use scissors or a utility knife to carefully trim the excess felt. By following these steps, you can successfully attach felt to a piece of wood for a neat and durable finish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

William Randolph Hearst Sr. (; April 29, 1863 - August 14, 1951) was an American businessman, politician, and newspaper publisher who built the nation's largest newspaper chain and media company Hearst Communications and whose flamboyant methods of yellow journalism influenced the nation's popular media by emphasizing sensationalism and human interest stories. Hearst entered the publishing business in 1887 after being given control of The San Francisco Examiner by his wealthy father. Beginning in 1919, Hearst began to build Hearst Castle, which he never completed, on a 240,000 acres (97,000 hectares) ranch at San Simeon, California, which he furnished with art, antiques and entire rooms brought from the great houses of Europe. He also used the ranch for an Arabian horse breeding operation. San Simeon was also used in the 1960 film Spartacus as the estate of Marcus Licinius Crassus (played by Laurence Olivier).  He also had a property on the McCloud River in Siskiyou County, in far northern California, called Wyntoon. Wyntoon was designed by famed architect Julia Morgan, who also designed Hearst Castle and worked in collaboration with William J. Dodd on a number of other projects.  In 1947, Hearst paid 120,000 for an H-shaped Beverly Hills mansion, (located at 1011 N Beverly Dr, Beverly Hills CA 90210) on 3.7 acres three blocks from Sunset Boulevard. This home, known as Beverly House, was once perhaps the \\"most expensive\\" private home in the U.S., valued at 165 million (PS81.4 million). It has 29 bedrooms, three swimming pools, tennis courts, its own cinema and a nightclub. Lawyer and investor Leonard Ross has owned it since 1976. The estate went on the market for 95 million at the end of 2010. The property had not sold by 2012 but was then listed at a significantly increased asking price of 135 million. The Beverly House, as it has come to be known, has some cinematic connections. It was the setting for the gruesome scene in the film The Godfather depicting a horse's severed head in the bed of film-producer, Jack Woltz. The character was head of a film company called International, the name of Hearst's early film company. According to Hearst Over Hollywood, John and Jacqueline Kennedy stayed at the house for part of their honeymoon. They watched their first film together as a married couple in the mansion's cinema. It was a Hearst-produced film from the 1920s.  In the early 1890s, Hearst began building a mansion on the hills overlooking Pleasanton, California on land purchased by his father a decade earlier. Hearst's mother took over the project, hired Julia Morgan to finish it as her home, and named it Hacienda del Pozo de Verona. After her death, it served as the clubhouse for Castlewood Country Club from 1925 to 1969, when it was destroyed in a massive fire.

Question: What is the full name of the person who died of consumption?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin. Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris. When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, \\"It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.\\" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B♭ (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher...

A:","output":"The first step of the gas exchange process begins with the process of inhalation, which is the act of taking in air containing oxygen into the lungs. This occurs due to the contraction of the diaphragm, a dome-shaped muscle located beneath the lungs, and the intercostal muscles, which are located between the ribs. When these muscles contract, the volume inside the thoracic cavity increases, creating a decrease in pressure relative to the atmospheric pressure outside the body. As a result, air flows into the lungs through the respiratory tract to equalize the pressure. The respiratory tract consists of several structures through which air passes during inhalation: 1. Nasal cavity: Air enters the body through the nostrils and is filtered, warmed, and humidified in the nasal cavity. 2. Pharynx: The pharynx is a common pathway shared by both the respiratory and digestive systems, where air moves to the larynx from the nasal cavity. 3. Larynx: Also known as the voice box, the larynx is responsible for sound production and contains the epiglottis, which prevents food and liquids from entering the trachea. 4. Trachea: The trachea, or windpipe, is a tube that extends from the larynx to the bronchi, transporting air to the lungs. 5. Bronchi: The trachea bifurcates into the left and right bronchi, each of which enters a lung. The bronchi then branch into smaller and smaller tubes called bronchioles. 6. Alveoli: At the end of the bronchioles are small sac-like structures called alveoli, which are surrounded by a network of capillaries. It is within the alveoli where the actual gas exchange takes place. During inhalation, oxygen-rich air reaches the alveoli, and the oxygen molecules diffuse across the thin alveolar wall and the adjoining capillary wall, entering the bloodstream. The oxygen then binds to hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells, which transport the oxygen throughout the body to be utilized by cells during various processes, including cellular respiration. At the same time, carbon dioxide, a waste product generated by cellular respiration, diffuses from the bloodstream into the alveoli, moving across the capillary and alveolar walls in the opposite direction of the oxygen flow. Carbon dioxide then gets exhaled as part of the waste gas when the individual breathes out. In summary, the first step in the gas exchange process is inhalation, during which oxygen-rich air enters the lungs via the respiratory tract. This sets the stage for the subsequent steps of oxygen moving into the bloodstream, being utilized by body cells, and carbon dioxide being removed and exhaled."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is a recollection of Paulo 's experiences as he made his way across northern Spain on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela . The novel serves as part adventure story , part guide to self - discovery .  - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.  - Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry. Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph.  - Santiago de Compostela, commonly known as Santiago, is the capital of the autonomous community of Galicia in northwestern Spain.  - A narrative or story is any report of connected events, real or imaginary, presented in a sequence of written or spoken words, and/or still or moving images.  - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla.  - Paulo Coelho de Souza (, , ; born August 24, 1947) is a Brazilian lyricist and novelist.

Thought critics aren't exactly bashing it, the film isn't getting anything close to the kind reviews that Skyfall did back in 2012. Here's what critics are saying: \\"It's not—as some critics have said—the worst\\" Bond flick, writes David Edelstein at Vulture. It's \\"satisfying\\" enough, and actually \\"fun, even if it's a mishmash, leaving you shaken, not stirred.\\" But the film doesn't \\"deliver the nipping, slightly syncopated rhythms of the best Bond films,\\" and the bad guys don't get the send-offs you'd expect. Meanwhile, Craig, who had planned to reclaim some of the earlier films' irony, doesn't quite manage. Rex Reed titles his review as follows: \\"Bland, James Bland.\\" Spectre is actually \\"one of the least interesting and most preposterous chapters in 007 history,\\" he writes at the Observer. \\"We've seen it all before. Despite a plot trajectory that changes so often they seem to be making it up as they go along, everyone on and off the screen seems to be doing it by the numbers.\\" Craig, in particular, looks bored.

Q:The answer to the question: Who are the communists demanding for the US to withdraw? is inside the article: The War Game depicts the prelude to, and the immediate weeks of the aftermath of, a Soviet nuclear attack against Britain. The narrator says that Britain's current nuclear deterrent policy threatens a would-be aggressor with devastation from Vulcan and Victor nuclear bombers of the British V bomber force. The film begins on Friday, 16 September (presumably 1966; this date wouldn't appear again until 1977). A news report tells of a Chinese invasion of South Vietnam; tensions escalate when the United States authorises tactical nuclear warfare against the Chinese. Although Soviet and East German forces threaten to invade West Berlin if the US does not withdraw, the US does not acquiesce to communist demands and the invasion takes place; two US Army divisions attempt to fight their way into Berlin to counter this, but the Russian and East German forces overwhelm them in conventional battle. In order to turn the tide, President Johnson authorises the NATO commanders to use their tactical nuclear weapons, and they soon do so. An escalating nuclear war results, during which larger Soviet strategic IRBMs are launched at Britain. The film remarks that many Soviet missiles were, at the time, believed to be liquid-fuelled and stored above ground, making them vulnerable to attack and bombings.

Fifty-one Impressionist paintings are forming part of an exhibition inBeijingto kick off the Year of France.    The show is being held in the capital between October 10 and November 27. Then it will move on to Shanghai and Hong Kong.    \\"It is such a good  opportunity to see the masters' works up close,\\" said Feng Jiajia, a Senior student form the High School Affiliated to theAcademyofArtand Design.

Worth a total of US 600 million, the paintings ate by French Impressionist masters, including Monet, Cezanne, Renoir and Degas.    As an art style, Impressionism was developed inFranceduring the late 19thand early 20thcenturies. Their work was a fresh and original way of painting. It seems that the artists painted a scene after just a quick look at it.    Often painting outside, rather than in a studio, the artists observed nature more directly and tried to capture individual moments in time especially the changing light of the sun. They avoided black and earth color1s and as a result their work is often very bright and can also look like that it is shining.    When they first appeared, the artists were criticized for not finishing their paintings and for being lazy. Critics said the Impressionists were satisfied with just a few inexact brushstrokes instead of completing a real painting. It was an art critic who first used the term \\"Impressionist\\" in a review of Monet's work \\"Impression, Sunrise\\"(1873) to satirize  his loose, inexact manner of painting.    \\"Everyone discusses my art and pretends to understand, as if it were necessary to understand, when it is simply necessary to love,\\" said Monet.

A few days later, the man saw a small hole in the cocoon. He sat and watched for several hours as a butterfly struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it stopped. So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a knife and cut a bigger hole in the cocoon. The butterfly came out of the cocoon but it had a weak body and small, thin wings. The butterfly didn't start to fly. In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling  around with a weak body and thin wings. It was never able to fly. The man acted with kindness but he didn't understand that he had done something wrong. When a butterfly crawls out of the cocoon, it must struggle. The hard work of getting out of the cocoon forces the fluid  from the butterfly's body into wings. It helps the butterfly be ready to fly. If the butterfly never has to force itself out of the cocoon, its wings never get the fluid and it can never fly. Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives.

Kayla spends no time pumping iron.  (B). Jessica spends no time pumping iron.","output":"The sentence should end with option (B). The correct sentence will read: \\"Kayla has a muscular body while Jessica does not, mostly due to the fact that Jessica spends no time pumping iron.\\" This sentence shows a clear contrast between Kayla's muscular body and Jessica's lack of it. The fact mentioned that Jessica spends no time pumping iron explains why her body is not as muscular as Kayla's. Pumping iron is a colloquial term, which essentially means to lift weights or to do resistance exercise, most commonly related to bodybuilding. Building a more muscular or toned body typically requires engaging in regular resistance training or weightlifting exercises and maintaining an appropriate diet that promotes muscle growth. Resistance training targets specific muscle groups and forces them to work against a source of resistance. This exertion causes the muscles to break down on a cellular level, ultimately leading to muscle fibers repairing, rebuilding, and growing back stronger and denser than before. On the other hand, if an individual doesn't engage in regular resistance training or weightlifting exercises, their muscle tone and strength may not be as prominent or developed as someone who does, which is the case for Jessica in this situation. It's important to remember, however, that simply lifting weights alone does not guarantee a muscular physique like Kayla's. A combination of factors, including genetics, nutrition, and consistency, will determine the outcome of physical appearance and muscle development in an individual. In conclusion, the sentence highlights the difference in lifestyles between Kayla and Jessica concerning their physical fitness and body composition. In order to develop a more muscular physique like Kayla, Jessica would need to invest time and effort in weightlifting or resistance training activities. Moreover, both of them have to focus on proper nutrition, adequate rest, and patience to achieve their respective fitness goals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

PAR-2 is normally expressed basolaterally in differentiated nasal ciliated cells. Objective: We tested if epithelial remodeling during diseases characterized by loss of cilia and squamous metaplasia may alter PAR-2 polarization. Methods: Endogenous PAR-2 responses were measured by live cell calcium and cilia imaging, measurement of fluid secretion, and quantification of cytokines. We utilized airway squamous cell lines, primary differentiated air-liquid interface cultures, and tissue explants. Cells were exposed to disease-related modifiers that alter epithelial morphology, including IL-13, cigarette smoke condensate, and retinoic acid deficiency. We used concentrations and exposure times that altered epithelial morphology without causing breakdown of the epithelial barrier, likely reflecting early disease states.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the bat makes sound waves happens, how will it affect the bat will not know where objects are.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an effect (both direct and indirect) on the process. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if the process of the bat making sound waves is disrupted, it will affect the bat's ability to know where objects are. Let's analyze the consequences of this perturbation on the overall process. Direct Effects: 1. Disruption of Echolocation: The main direct effect would be that the bat's echolocation abilities will be impaired. Echolocation is the primary means by which bats navigate, detect obstacles, and locate prey. If the bat cannot make sound waves, this essential biological function would be disrupted, leading to difficulties in perceiving its surroundings accurately. 2. Increased chances of collision: When a bat cannot effectively use echolocation, it becomes more likely to collide with objects in its environment, as it will not receive any information regarding the location and distance of these objects. This could potentially result in injuries to the bat, damage to its wings, or disorientation. Indirect Effects: 1. Decreased foraging efficiency: Bats rely on echolocation to find and capture prey (often insects) while flying. If the bat is unable to make sound waves, it will have a harder time locating and catching prey, which could eventually lead to decreased foraging efficiency and malnutrition. 2. Reduced ability to avoid predators: Bats use echolocation not only to navigate and locate food but also to detect potential threats and evade predators. A bat that cannot make sound waves is more likely to become a target for predators, as it will have difficulty detecting them on time and taking evasive actions. 3. Compromised social interactions: Bats are known to be social creatures that use echolocation calls and other vocalizations for communication purposes. If a bat cannot produce sound waves, it may experience challenges in communicating with other bats, affecting its social relationships and group dynamics within the colony. 4. Adaptive consequences: In the long term, if a disruption in the bat's ability to make sound waves persists, it could lead to selective pressures on the affected bat population. Bats unable to use echolocation effectively would be at a disadvantage, as they would face challenges in acquiring food, avoiding predators, and reproducing. This could lead to reduced population sizes or perhaps adaptation of alternative strategies for navigation and foraging. In conclusion, the perturbation of a bat's ability to make sound waves would indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the aforementioned process, compromising the bat's echolocation capabilities, and potentially leading to various challenges and dangers in its life-cycle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Rick Norsigian Experts enlisted by the negatives' owner said the images were early works by Adams, famous for photographing the West. If authentic, they would represent rare works from the '20s and '30s.      A set of 65 glass photographic negatives was identified Tuesday as vintage work of Ansel Adams by a team of experts enlisted by the owner, eliciting cries of skepticism.      If authentic, the negatives, purchased for 45 at a garage sale 10 years ago, would represent a major addition to the body of work attributed to the iconic American photographer.      A house painter claims that the 65 glass negatives he bought for 45 at a garage sale were made by Ansel Adams. According to a Beverly Hills art appraiser, they are worth 200 million. Lauren Schuker discusses. Also, Brett Arends discusses four market myths that won't die.      But an heir who remains involved in curating Mr. Adams's work said he was doubtful. And Bill Turnage, the managing trustee of the Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust, said he didn't believe the photographs were the work of Mr. Adams.      \\"We don't think they look like Ansel's work,\\" he said. \\"Do you have any idea how many people were photographing Yosemite in the 1920s and 1930s? Millions! It could be anyone.\\"      The experts included a photographer, an art adviser and handwriting analysts, though no Adams experts per se. They concluded that the negatives were early works by Mr. Adams, who died in 1984 at age 82 and is best known for his black-and-white photographs documenting landscapes of the American West. Some of Mr. Adams's work from the 1920s and 1930s was destroyed in a darkroom fire in 1937. The newly revealed negatives would represent rare works from that period.      An appraiser estimated the negatives' value at around 200 million, though no plan to sell the collection has been announced.      Garage Sale Find Take a look at some of the photos. View Slideshow Courtesy of Rick Norsigian \\"Aerial View of the Yosemite Valley\\"      \\"The negatives aren't worth anything, even the 44,000 at the University of Arizona, because Ansel isn't around to print from them,\\" said Mr. Turnage of the Adams trust said. \\"The only authentic Ansel Adams works of art that are around are the ones that he printed.\\"      Arnold Peter, a lawyer the negatives' owner hired to assemble the team of experts, said: \\"It is such an uninformed response on his part. Of course Ansel is no longer with us, and part of his magic is the way he developed photographs. But it doesn't make them any less valuable or mean that they are not worth anything. You can still produce great prints.\\"      The trove was found a decade ago by Rick Norsigian, a 64-year-old building painter for the Fresno, Calif., public school system. Mr. Norsigian, who does not have a college degree, said in an interview he has never formally studied photography but collects antiques in his spare time. He noticed the negatives at a local garage sale initially because of their unusual material—they were made out glass rather than film—and bought them for 45 after negotiating down the 70 price tag.      The 200 million estimate includes forecast sales, prints and other licensing arrangement, based on auction prices and previous sales of Adams works. The most expensive Adams work ever sold was \\"Clearing Winter Storm, Yosemite National Park,\\" from 1938, sold at Sotheby's in New York last month for 722,500. The second-most-expensive was the well-known \\"Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico,\\" which sold in October 2006 for 609,600, also at Sotheby's.      Mr. Norsigian brought the negatives home and, over time, noticed that they resembled some of the photographs he had seen by Adams of Yosemite National Park.      \\"My buddies would come over and we'd be having a beer and start making jokes: 'That looks like Ansel Adams,' \\" he recalled. \\"I had seen his work at hospitals, businesses, that kind of thing. I was never a big fan, but I got curious, So I went to the library and got a biography and started doing some research.\\"      Seven years—and many biographies—later, Mr. Norsigian hired Mr. Peter. Mr. Peter said he and his team used handwriting analysis to show that the labels on envelopes encasing the negatives were written by the photographer's wife, Virginia.      \\"We have plenty of evidence that clearly establishes that these negatives belong to Adams,\\" Mr. Peter said in an interview Tuesday. \\"There is really no dispute about it.\\"      But Matthew Adams, the artist's grandson, who runs the Ansel Adams Gallery, said in an interview Tuesday that he remains \\"skeptical.\\"      \\"All of the evidence presented is circumstantial at best,\\" Mr. Adams added in a lengthy statement, calling that evidence little more than \\"hopeful supposition.\\" He called the 200 million figure \\"ludicrous.\\"      Mr. Adams said that one area of discrepancy emerges from misspellings on many of labels, presumably written by Virginia, who lived in Yosemite for much of her life. Mr. Adams said he was surprised that, after so many years in the region, she would misspell names such as Bridalveil, one of the most prominent waterfalls in the Yosemite Valley.      Mr. Peter said such mistakes were often made in haste. \\"It's normal to have some typographical errors, and we've done extensive research to verify the handwriting,\\" he said.      Mr. Adams said that when Mr. Peter presented images of the negatives and the evidence to him in November, he suggested using carbon dating to determine the period from when the negatives were made, but that procedure was never done. Mr. Peter said Tuesday that \\"there is really no reason to do carbon dating, because we have plenty of other evidence,\\" but added that he would consider it if Mr. Adams agreed that it would serve as definitive proof.      Mr. Norsigian is currently storing the negatives in a vault in Fresno. Fresno State University will display the negatives in their first public showing in mid-October.      Write to Lauren A. E. Schuker at lauren.schuker@wsj.com ||||| A wall painter for the Fresno school district who bought a cache of antique glass-plate photographic negatives at a garage sale 10 years ago laid out his case Tuesday that they were created by Ansel Adams early in his career, offering affirmations from photographic and forensic experts he had hired.In a Beverly Hills gallery packed with reporters and photographers, Rick Norsigian and the Beverly Hills law firm that is helping him market prints made from the negatives (and promote a documentary about his find) said the negatives of Yosemite, the San Francisco waterfront, and Carmel's mission and nearby Point Lobos were taken by Adams from 1919 to the 1930s, before he became famous as the visual bard of America's natural landscape.According to David W. Streets, the gallery owner who hosted the news conference and was part of a team of appraisers, the eventual yield from selling prints struck from Norsigian's find could amount to more than 200 million.But that sum and the flurry of publicity seemed absurd to dealers who have sold Adams' prints for millions of dollars, and to people from Adams' inner circle, including his grandson, Matthew Adams, and William Turnage, who was Adams' business manager until his death in 1984 and remains managing trustee in charge of administering the rights to publish or reproduce Adams' work.They pointedly question, if not outright dismiss, the conclusions Norsigian and his team have drawn. The evidence advanced Tuesday included handwriting on manila envelopes in which the negatives were found, and analyses of how the plates stack up physically, aesthetically and by subject with known Adams photographs from the period.\\"I really resent people who have gone out and hired some so-called experts. I give them no credence in terms of their knowledge of Ansel's work,\\" Turnage said. \\"They're doing this for only one thing, to make money. I feel sad for people who might be gulled into buying these things we think are fakes.\\"Even if the negatives did spring from Adams' camera, art-photography dealers say, any prints made from them will be essentially worthless in the collectors' market.It's not the negative that makes an Adams an Adams for the museums and private collectors who cherish his work and establish its market value, said Santa Monica dealer Peter Fetterman. It's the magic he worked in his darkroom to create the prints that bear the fruit of his artistry — not to mention his signature.A 1920s Adams negative developed in a 21st century darkroom by other hands just doesn't rate, agreed Andrew Smith, a Santa Fe art-photography dealer who says his gallery is America's busiest when it comes to reselling prints Adams made himself. \\"They just don't have much value. They weren't made by him.\\"Nevertheless, Norsigian and Arnold Peter, co-founder of the law firm that hired the experts and is helping Norsigian market what's billed as \\"The Lost Negatives of Ansel Adams,\\" said that Internet sales began a few days ago at http://www.lostnegatives.com for the first 17 images being offered. Limited edition prints hand-developed by North Carolina photographer Jesse Kalisher go for 7,500 each; digital prints cost 1,500, and for 45 you can get a poster.That compares to the record 722,500 paid last month at auction for \\"Clearing Winter Storm, Yosemite National Park,\\" and the 609,000 paid in 2006 for Adams' \\"Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico.\\"\\"If they were any good, he would have printed them,\\" Turnage said. \\"He printed everything that he felt was good. And [prints from Adams' hand] look completely different from what anybody they've hired to stamp out prints would make.\\"A 21-page summary of the Norsigian team's findings theorizes that the negatives survived a 1937 fire in Adams' studio, as suggested by scorch marks on some of them. Photography expert Patrick Alt of Los Angeles wrote that \\"it is very easy to imagine\\" that Norsigian's negatives were among the ones Adams' autobiography notes were saved by \\"throwing them in a bathtub filled with water.\\" Alt said that it was left to Adams' wife, Virginia, to write the identifying notes on the paper sleeves covering the negatives Norsigian bought 63 years later for about 75 cents each.Alt theorized that Adams brought the Norsigian negatives to Southern California in the early 1940s as examples for his students at what's now the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. \\"It would not be unreasonable for him to show the fire-damaged plates and regale his students with what was surely a great story,\\" Alt wrote. He added, \\"In almost all of the photographs, the compositions are virtually flawless,\\" indicating \\"a photographer of singular vision and talent.\\"Alt said the 6 1/2-by-8 1/2-inch negatives are consistent with what Adams is known to have used, and oxidation of the silver emulsion places the date they were taken at 70 years ago or more.Robert Moeller, a former curator of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, attested that, from the subjects and style, there is \\"a high degree of probability\\" that Adams took the pictures. Meteorologist George Wright compared the Norsigian photograph of a tree against a distant mountain backdrop with a known Adams photograph of the same tree and concluded that the cloud formation and snowcap prove they were taken at the same time. Handwriting experts Marcel Matley and Michael Nattenberg concluded that the writing on the envelopes matched samples from Virginia Adams.Matthew Adams, who is president of the Ansel Adams Gallery in Yosemite, doubts that his grandmother, who grew up in Yosemite, would have committed the misspellings of prominent Yosemite place names he saw when Norsigian's team provided him with copies of some of the manila sleeves. Adams said she never would have written \\"Vail\\" instead of \\"Veil\\" in Bridal Veil Falls, \\"Washborn Point\\" instead of \\"Washburn Point,\\" or \\"Glaciar Point\\" instead of \\"Glacier Point.\\"\\"She would know Yosemite place names extremely well and she was literate and well-read,\\" Adams said. \\"And to claim that she was ignorant and made these kinds of errors, I don't see how that happened.\\"Norsigian attorney Peter said the misspellings are few, and likely the result of hasty writing as Virginia Adams tried to scrawl identifications on hundreds of envelopes containing negatives rescued from the 1937 fire. \\"The best spellers from time to time will make typographical errors.\\"Matthew Adams and Turnage said Adams was extremely cautious about his negatives, keeping them under lock and key when not using them to make prints. \\"There's no way on God's green earth that Ansel would have left 65 negatives sitting somewhere,\\" then lose track of them, Turnage said. \\"He treated the negatives as if they were his children,\\" going so far as to house them in a concrete bunker built into a hillside behind his home in Carmel — where nobody could venture unless accompanied by the photographer. Adams left all 44,000 of his negatives to the Center for Creative Photography, which he helped establish at the University of Arizona in Tucson , Turnage said.Norsigian and Peter said the documentary about the find will premiere in October at the fledgling Anaheim International Film Festival. The film also will be shown Oct. 14 at Cal State Fresno, along with prints of some of the photographs, as part of the university's centennial celebration. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"In 2010, Rick Norsigian, a building painter, claimed that the set of 65 glass photographic negatives he purchased for 45 at a garage sale were the early works of renowned American photographer Ansel Adams. A team of experts he enlisted, including a photographer, an art adviser, and handwriting analysts, concluded that the negatives were authentic and estimated their value to be around 200 million. However, Bill Turnage, the managing trustee of the Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust, expressed doubt regarding the authenticity of the photographs. Furthermore, Matthew Adams, Ansel Adams' grandson and curator of his work, also remained skeptical and criticized the evidence presented. The negatives would represent a rare collection of Adams' works from the 1920s and 1930s, with some of his work from that period being destroyed in a darkroom fire in 1937."},{"instruction":"Instructions: You are given a sentence in Portuguese.

Write the answer: Who played Lord Melchett in the TV comedy series Blackadder II?","output":"Lord Melchett, a prominent character from the TV comedy series Blackadder II, was brilliantly portrayed by the talented British actor and comedian Stephen Fry. Blackadder II is the second series of the popular British television sitcom, created and written by Richard Curtis and Ben Elton. The show originally aired on BBC1 from January 9, 1986, to February 20, 1986. Blackadder II is set in the Elizabethan era and is characterized by the witty, cunning, and sarcastic character Edmund Blackadder, played by Rowan Atkinson. Stephen Fry's portrayal of Lord Melchett added a unique charm to the series. Lord Melchett is a sniveling and obsequious courtier, always trying to please and stay in the good graces of Queen Elizabeth, played by Miranda Richardson. Positioned as one of the primary antagonist figures in the series, Fry's Melchett constantly locks horns with Blackadder throughout each episode, engaging in incessant power struggles. In later series of Blackadder, Fry played other roles too, such as General Melchett in Blackadder Goes Forth, a character whose similar-sounding name alludes to his portrayal of Lord Melchett in the previous series. Stephen Fry's impeccable comic timing and diverse acting skills contributed significantly to the success of Blackadder II and the entire Blackadder franchise. It is essential to note that Stephen Fry is not only known for his performances in Blackadder – the prolific actor and comedian has enjoyed an extensive and successful career in the entertainment industry. Other notable works of Fry include his performance in the renowned comedy duo Fry and Laurie with his long-time collaborator and friend Hugh Laurie, his portrayal of Oscar Wilde in the film 'Wilde,' hosting the popular quiz show QI, and providing the voice for the British version of the Harry Potter audiobooks. Overall, Fry's portrayal of Lord Melchett in Blackadder II remains an iconic characterization in the annals of British television comedy, and his contributions to the series helped to create a lasting legacy that continues to be enjoyed by audiences to this day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What society did the man who had poor command of the Czech language become chorus master of after returning from Sweden? ?  In 1861, it was announced that a Provisional Theatre would be built in Prague, as a home for Czech opera. Smetana saw this as an opportunity to write and stage opera that would reflect Czech national character, similar to the portrayals of Russian life in Mikhail Glinka's operas. He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre's conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Maýr, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a \\"dangerous modernist\\", in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner. Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by Count Jan von Harrach, which offered prizes of 600 gulden each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture. With no useful model on which to base his work—Czech opera as a genre scarcely existed—Smetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist, and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by Otto of Brandenburg. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of The Brandenburgers in Bohemia. At this stage in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech language was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point of writing and speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper...

Q:What is the first name of the person who quits the band when Stevenson urges them to go on tour?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The film begins with the Descendents' origins in the neighboring communities of Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach, California in the late 1970s. Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years. In 1985 the Descendents reconvene for a second album, I Don't Want to Grow Up. Navetta has burned all of his equipment and moved to Oregon, and is replaced by Ray Cooper. Stevenson pushes for the band to tour, but Lombardo declines and quits. He is replaced by Doug Carrion, and this lineup records 1986's Enjoy!, after which Cooper and Carrion both leave the band. Stevenson recruits bassist Karl Alvarez from Salt Lake City, who brings in his close friend Stephen Egerton to play guitar.

What is the difference between BH and MH curves in magnetism? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. Let me explain each one like you're a five-year-old: 1. SpaceX hype vs. Arianespace: Think of SpaceX as a cool new toy that does things differently than the older toys. SpaceX is getting lots of attention because they made rockets that can land back on Earth and be used again, making it cheaper and more eco-friendly. Arianespace is like an older, more experienced toy that has been sending lots of big things into space for a long time, but they don't reuse their rockets. People are excited about SpaceX because it's new, different, and could make space travel better in the future. 2. BH curve and MH curve in magnetism: Imagine you have a toy magnet. When you put this magnet near other magnets or metal things, they stick together – that's because of magnetism. Now, scientists and engineers use special graphs called curves to understand how magnets work. A BH curve shows how strong the magnetic force is in the magnet and an MH curve is about how much the magnet can 'hold' the magnetism inside it before it becomes too full.

Input: Problem: points x , y , and z lie , in that order , on a straight railroad track . the distance from point x to point y is twice the distance from point y to point z . a train traveled from point x to point z without stopping . the train ' s average speed when traveling from point x to point y was 300 miles per hour and the train ' s average speed when traveling from point y to point z was 100 miles per hour . what was the train ' s average speed , in miles per hour , when traveling from point x to point z ?  Options: a ) 200 , b ) 220 , c ) 240 , d ) 180 , e ) 260 Output:","output":"To solve this problem, let's follow these steps: Step 1: Define the variables. Let the distance from point y to point z be d. Then the distance from point x to point y is 2d. Step 2: Calculate the time taken for each segment. Time = Distance/Speed t(xy) = Time taken to travel from point x to point y = (2d) / 300 t(yz) = Time taken to travel from point y to point z = d / 100 Step 3: Calculate the total distance and total time taken. Total distance = Distance from x to y + Distance from y to z = 2d + d = 3d Total time = Time taken from x to y + Time taken from y to z = t(xy) + t(yz) Step 4: Calculate the average speed from point x to point z. Average speed = Total distance / Total time = (3d) / (t(xy) + t(yz)) = (3d) / ((2d/300) + (d/100)) Step 5: Simplify the expression. = (3d) / ((2d/300) + (3d/300)) = (3d) / ((2d + 3d) / 300)) = (3d) / (5d / 300) = (3d * 300) / 5d Step 6: Analyze the final expression. The 'd' variable cancels out: = (3 * 300) / 5 = 900 / 5 = 180 Thus, the train's average speed when traveling from point x to point z was 180 miles per hour. Output: d) 180"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Objective: How can I make a cheap air freshener?

In his company he was known as Office Desk, because when he was working he always sat behind his well-used piece of conference table standing in a hard to notice corner in the software specialists' room. Christopher wasn't a wide person, and so his piece of conference table didn't have to be too big either, which also practically solved office space problems in the 0-1 Computer firm. It was Warm's secret that the majority of his time outside of the company, he also spent behind a desk. On his keyboard he typed various letters and numbers, which would become computer programs for the 0-1 Computer Associates company. While the Man Called Office Desk (MCOD, or simply Cod in an alternative version) was writing an intuitive program for the management of empty office desk space in software companies, a thing that nobody had ever expected to happen happened. Warm became fused with the chair. The staff at 0-1 Computer were disappointed, they had expected Cod to fuse with a desk. It would have been much more entertaining to watch, you could have laughed at him a little, and the nickname, given to him by the programmers' boss would have gotten a whole new meaning. And right now, there wasn't even much to talk about during cigarette breaks. Warm did not hide the fact he would have preferred to fuse with a mouse, or a mouse pad. Right now, all he could do was to pretend he totally ignored the fact he was physically stuck to a chair. And he was doing just fine until it was time to go to his second shift at 1-0 Computer Associates, where he had been working on a program for the management of empty space in staff lockers in telecommunications companies. Question: Warm's second shift came up Answer: A:","output":"B). After the fuse with the chair.  Step-by-step justification: 1. The context describes Christopher Warm's sedentary job and how he becomes fused with the chair. 2. While fused with the chair, he continues to work and pretends to ignore the fact he's stuck to the chair. 3. The question asks about when Warm's second shift came up, which would be a time-based event. 4. Since the context establishes that Warm's fusion with the chair has already occurred and he is continuing to work, I choose option B because it implies that his second shift comes up after the fusion with the chair."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif (Urdu/Punjabi: myN mHmd nwz shryf, born 25 December 1949) is a Pakistani businessman and politician who served as the Prime Minister of Pakistan from 2013 until he was disqualified for life from office by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 2017. He had previously served as the Prime Minister twice in the 90s (1990-93 and 1997-99) and the Chief Minister of Punjab from 1985 to 1990. He is Pakistan's longest-serving prime minister. Born into the upper-middle class Sharif family in Lahore, he is the son of Ittefaq and Sharif Group founder, Muhammad Sharif, and the elder-brother of three-time elected Punjab Chief Minister, Shehbaz. Sharif was born in Lahore, Punjab on 25 December 1949. The Sharif family are Punjabis of Kashmiri origin. His father, Muhammad Sharif, was an upper-middle-class businessman and industrialist whose family had emigrated from Anantnag in Kashmir for business, and eventually settled in the village of Jati Umra in Amritsar district, Punjab, at the beginning of the twentieth century. His mother's family came from Pulwama. After the movement led by Jinnah and his struggle to create Pakistan in 1947, his parents migrated from Amritsar to Lahore. His father followed the teachings of the Ahl-i Hadith. His family owns Ittefaq Group, a multimillion-dollar steel conglomerate and Sharif Group, a conglomerate company with holdings in agriculture, transport and sugar mills.  He is married to Kalsoom Nawaz Sharif, who is also descended from a Kashmiri family. His brother Shehbaz Sharif is the incumbent Chief Minister of Punjab province, while his nephew Hamza Shahbaz Sharif is a member of the National Assembly. His daughter Maryam Nawaz is currently the chairperson for the prime minister's youth initiative. Maryam is married to politician Muhammad Safdar Awan. His other daughter, Asma Nawaz, is married to Ali Dar, son of Ishaq Dar, the current finance minister of Pakistan. The personal residence of the Sharif family, Raiwind Palace, is located in Jati Umra, Raiwind, on the outskirts of Lahore. He also has a residence in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, known as the Sharif Villa, where he lived during his years in exile. His elder son, Hussain Nawaz, is a businessman based in Saudi Arabia and currently resides in the Jeddah house. His younger son, Hassan Nawaz, is also a businessman and lives in London.  He went to Saint Anthony High School. He graduated from the Government College University (GCU) with an art and business degree and then received a law degree from the Law College of Punjab University in Lahore.  Sharif underwent heart surgery in May 2016 in London. It was his second open-heart operation. His deteriorating health forced him to undergo an open heart surgery only three days before the presentation of the country's annual budget. Many opposition leaders and the legal fraternity, including former Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, raised questions about a possible constitutional crisis in Pakistan. Chaudhry called for electing a new interim Prime Minister to avoid the crisis.  Sharif started his political career during the period of nationalization policies introduced by former Prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. The Sharif family were financially devastated after the family steel business was nationalised, and Sharif jumped into national politics soon afterwards. In 1976 Sharif joined the Pakistan Muslim League, a conservative front rooted in the Punjab province. He initially focused on regaining control of his steel plants from the government. In May 1980 Ghulam Jilani Khan, the recently appointed Governor of the Punjab Province and a former Director-General of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), initiated a search for new urban leaders; Sharif was one of the men he found and promoted, quickly making him Finance Minister of the Punjab. In 1981, Sharif joined the Punjab Advisory Board under General Zia-ul-Haq and principally rose to public and political prominence as a staunch proponent of the military government of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq during the 1980s.  He maintained close relations with Zia-ul-Haq, who soon agreed to return the steel mill which had been lost to nationalisation by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Sharif maintained an alliance with General Rahimuddin Khan, who was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee. During his political career, Sharif also had close ties with the Director-General of ISI, Lieutenant-General (retired) Hamid Gul, who played a substantial role in the formation of the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI) - a conservative political alliance that supported Sharif.  Sharif invested in Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich Arab countries in the Middle East to rebuild his steel empire. According to personal accounts and his time spent with Sharif, American historian Stephen Philips Cohen states in his book Idea of Pakistan: \\"Nawaz Sharif never forgave Bhutto after his steel empire was lost into the hands of Bhutto; and even after [Bhutto's] terrible end, Sharif publicly refused to forgive the soul of Bhutto or the Pakistan Peoples Party.\\" After coming to national power in 1990, Sharif attempted to reverse Bhutto's nationalisation policies, introducing an economy based on privatisation and economic liberalisation.  Following the imposition and passing of the Resolution 660, Resolution 661, and the Resolution 665, Sharif sided with the United Nations on Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. A major international incident took place in the Middle East with Iraq invading the Kuwait which dismayed the world. Sharif's government criticised Iraq for invading the fellow Muslim country, which strained Pakistan's relationships with Iraq. The relationships continued to be strained as Pakistan seek to tighten its relations with Iran, and his foreign policy continued by Benazir Bhutto, Pervez Musharraf until the removal of Saddam Hussein in 2003.  Sharif contended with former Chief of Army Staff General Mirza Aslam Beg over the 1991 Gulf War (See Operation Desert Storm). Under the direction of General Beg, Pakistan Armed Forces actively participated in the conflict and the Army Special Service Group and the Naval Special Service Group were rushed to Saudi Arabia to provide intense security to Saudi royal family. Sharif also contended the upcoming Chief of Army Staff General Asif Nawaz over the paramilitary operation in Sindh Province (See Operation Clean-Up).  Sharif, during his first term, found it difficult working with the PPP and the Mutahidda Qaumi Movement (MQM), a potent force in Karachi. The MQM and PPP opposed Sharif widely due to his focus on beautifying Punjab and Kashmir while neglecting Sindh. The MQM, a liberal force, also opposed Sharif's conservatism. The clash between liberalism and conservatism soon erupted forces in 1992 when political tension began to arise in which both party renegading ideological war against each other. Despite MQM had formed government with Sharif, more and more problems were mounted between Sharif and the MQM in 1992. Sharif's government members passed the resolution in the Parliament, to launch the paramilitary operation to end the cold war between PML-N and MQM. During this time, the centre left Pakistan Peoples Party remained quiet and neutral while watching the impact of the cold war between liberal and conservative forces. Prime minister Sharif also contended this upcoming operation with Chief of Army Staff General Asif Navaz over the paramilitary operation in Sindh Province (See Operation Clean-Up). Launched in 1992, violence erupted in Karachi and brought an economic halt in the country that dismantled Sharif's industrialisation and investment that was being brought by Sharif. Benazir Bhutto, during the course of this episode, remained silent as she too had opposed the MQM. His operation continued by Benazir also, but due to amid pressure exerted by her brother Murtaza Bhutto, the operation came to halt. The period of 1992-1994 is considered the bloodiest years in the history of the city, with many went missing.  During his second term, Altaf Hussain decided to join with Sharif and tried to reach a compromise. Soon after the 1997 parliamentary elections, MQM joined with Sharif but this alliance fall apart following the assassination of Hakim Said. Therefore, the Prime minister kicked the MQM out of the government on immediate effect and assumed the control of Karachi. MQM was forced to continued its political activities underground. This action led Sharif to claim the exclusive mandate of entire Pakistan, and for the first time in his political career, Sharif and his party had the control of Sindh, Balochistan, Northwest Frontier, Kashmir and the Punjab Provinces.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What led to the surgery","output":"Nawaz Sharif underwent heart surgery in May 2016 in London due to his deteriorating health.

But it has the clearest and cleanest air. Amazingly, in this place, the sun sometimes hangs even in the midnight sky. This place is Antarctica  : the coldest, windiest and harshest   place on the Earth. As the world's least-known place, Antarctica is of great interest to scientists around the world. In 1983, China joined the Antarctic Treaty (<<>> ). The treaty made Antarctica a peaceful place for member countries to do scientific research. During 30 years, China has sent many scientists to Antarctica. They mostly look at the resources under the icy land and do research about climate change and marine   biology. Antarctica is a place with fantastic views. However, life there is very hard. Food is one of the biggest problems. Frozen food which can be heated easily is people's daily food. Fresh vegetables are hard to grow in the cold weather. Therefore, scientists often eat dried or canned vegetables. Sleep is also troublesome. In Antarctica, summer lasts from November to March. During this period, Antarctica points to the sun and receives sunlight 24 hours a day. In order to get some sleep, scientists cover the windows with black plastic cloth to create \\"night\\". Working in Antarctica is dangerous, especially when meeting gale-force winds.Sometimes the wind is even stronger than a typhoon.It can easily blow people away.So there are ropes that connect buildings of some research stations.People can hold these ropes to keep their balance in forceful winds.

(A) Jim (B) Bill","output":"Based on the logic test presented, the answer your students should choose is (B) Bill. The test provides us with information about Jim and Bill, both riding their ATVs. Jim is pulling a trailer full of lemons, while Bill isn't pulling anything behind his ATV. They both try to speed up to get home before it starts raining. The question asks who was able to pull ahead of the other. Logically, we can analyze the situation using the concepts of force, mass, and acceleration. According to Newton's second law of motion, force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma). To increase their speeds, both Jim and Bill's ATVs need to exert a force. The more force they exert, the higher the acceleration they can achieve. However, the force produced by the ATVs is not only used to propel the ATVs forward; it is also used to overcome the forces of friction and air resistance. Additionally, in Jim's case, it also needs to overcome the additional weight and resistance posed by the trailer full of lemons. Since the mass of Jim's ATV, along with the trailer of lemons, is greater than the mass of Bill's ATV without any additional load, it means that the force generated by both their ATVs will result in a lower acceleration for Jim compared to Bill, assuming both ATVs exert the same amount of force. Taking all of this into account, it becomes clear that Bill, without any additional load to carry, will be able to achieve a higher speed and pull ahead of Jim, who is burdened with the extra weight of the trailer full of lemons.

Article:Wage campaigners argue that this does not equate to a \\"living wage\\" and have called for an increase to reflect the cost of living. Some politicians have been calling for a revision as well, with some cabinet ministers suggesting a 50p increase is needed. There are also suggestions that a minimum wage \\"top-up\\" in areas of high costs and higher average earnings could be introduced - paid for by employers. Labour politicians have also talked of backing a significant rise in the minimum wage, but without specific figures- and of having a higher \\"minimum\\" in some sectors of the economy. What is the national UK minimum wage, and who gets it? The minimum wage depends on age and whether the employee is an apprentice. Only those of school leaving age or above are eligible. It currently stands at £6.31 for the over-21s (a rate which was increased on 1 October 2013 by 12p an hour.) Those aged 18-20 must be paid £5.03 an hour, while under-18s receive £3.72 and apprentices must get £2.68. The minimum wage was introduced by Labour in 1999, at a rate of £3.60 an hour for the over-22s. Workers under the age of 22 were to be paid £3 an hour. Do employers have an obligation to pay at least these amounts? Yes. All employers must pay workers at least the minimum wage. Recently it was announced that employers who fail to pay workers the national minimum wage will face tougher penalties. The maximum fine for anyone failing to pay the statutory level will increase from £5,000 to £20,000 in February 2014. The government also plans to \\"name and shame\\" companies which do not pay the right levels. How is the minimum wage level decided? The National Minimum Wage Act of 1998 created a minimum wage across the United Kingdom. It was part of the 1997 general election Labour Party manifesto. Each year, the rates are reviewed by the Low Pay Commission, which is an independent body. It reports to the government in February. The commission makes recommendations to the government, which sets the rate. It is enforced by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). The secretary of state can make exceptions under the National Minimum Wage Act, and has for au pairs, who are not entitled to the National Minimum Wage. The Low Pay Commission carries out surveys to research pay and other factors. It consults employers and looks at economic data from the Office of National Statistics before making its recommendations. What is the 'living wage'? Many groups and politicians - including Business Secretary Vince Cable - argue that the current minimum wage isn't high enough. Others have sought a so-called \\"living wage\\" for employees, arguing the minimum wage does not reflect the real costs of living, especially in the capital. The Living Wage Foundation argues that companies should pay £7.45 an hour in the UK as a whole and £8.55 in London. Both London's former and current Mayor, Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson, are supporters. The Greater London Authority (GLA) is among the organisations that pay the living wage to their employees. The living wage is currently calculated by the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University, while the London living wage has been calculated by the GLA since 2005. How much do UK workers earn? In the year ending April 2013, the ONS said UK pre-tax pay reached £27,000 a year, an increase of 2.1% over 2012. That is a below-inflation increase for that period. The ONS said in December 2013, the average hourly earnings before tax for UK workers were £13.60 for men and £12.24 for women. In April 2013, 10% of full-time employees earned less than £7.28 per hour (excluding overtime), an increase of 1.5% compared with the previous year. Based on an eight-hour day, five days a week without overtime, someone earning the adult national minimum wage would make £12,115.20p a year. After tax, that would be £11,055.96 a year. How many people in the UK do minimum wage jobs? The Low Pay Commission estimates that there are 1,386,000 minimum wage jobs. Nearly half (46%) of all low-wage workers are employed in two sectors: wholesale and retail, and hotels and restaurants. About three-quarters of a million minimum-wage jobs are accounted for by hospitality, retail and cleaning. How do the UK's wages compare internationally? The UK has the second-highest rate of low pay in the OECD and twice the rate in some other advanced countries. Last year, figures requested by the Labour Party and collated by the House of Commons library showed average hourly UK wages had fallen 5.5% since mid-2010, adjusted for inflation. That is the fourth-worst decline among the 27 EU nations. Over the same time, German hourly wages rose by 2.7%. Only Greek, Portuguese and Dutch workers have had a steeper decline in hourly wages, the figures showed. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The national UK minimum wage varies depending on age and whether the employee is an apprentice, with those aged over-21 earning £6.31 per hour.

Paragraph: The earliest signs of people on Jamaica are the remains of the Arawak, an AmerIndian society that originated on the north coast of South America. Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517.  Question: \\"After Esquival arrived, did the Spanish remain in Nueva Sevilla?\\" Answer: \\"Settled in St. Ann's Bay\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"No, the answer is not correct based on the paragraph. After Esquivel arrived, the Spanish did initially settle in Nueva Sevilla, which was near St. Ann's Bay. However, the site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden. As a result, in 1534, the Spanish moved and founded Villa de la Vega, which is known today as Spanish Town. So, while they initially settled in Nueva Sevilla, they did not remain there."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Options: A).

Given the question \\"What will Others want to do next?\\", is \\"strong\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"In order to determine if \\"strong\\" is a valid answer to the question \\"What will Others want to do next?\\" after Aubrey's interaction with the annoying salesmen, it is important to analyze the context of the situation and break down the components of the answer. First, let us understand the situation in which Aubrey slams the door at the annoying salesmen who would never leave. A response like this typically indicates a sense of frustration or annoyance within the individual, which in this case, is Aubrey. By slamming the door, Aubrey is physically and metaphorically severing any further interaction or communication with the salesmen, expressing her unwillingness to entertain their persistence. Now, let's consider the question \\"What will Others want to do next?\\". This question seeks to predict or make an inference about the actions of other parties involved in the situation. In this context, \\"Others\\" refers to the salesmen outside of Aubrey's door. The answer we are evaluating is \\"strong\\". The word 'strong' typically refers to physical strength or the level of intensity regarding a feeling or opinion. It could also imply determination or assertiveness. This may not directly relate to the next course of action or motive of the salesmen. We can, however, infer several possibilities for the salesmen's next move based on their interaction with Aubrey: 1. Regroup and strategize: The salesmen might want to approach their sales pitch differently after seeing Aubrey's strong reaction. They may discuss and try to come up with a better approach for the next potential customer. 2. Leave and move on: Realizing that Aubrey is not interested in their product or service, the salesmen may decide to continue to the next house or area without further attempting to convince her. 3. Reflect on the situation: The salesmen might pause and assess their sales tactics so far, reflecting on whether their persistence and approach has been causing others to respond negatively, like Aubrey. It is clear that \\"strong\\" as an answer does not directly provide a prediction or inferential conclusion about the next steps for the salesmen following Aubrey's reaction. Therefore, it cannot be considered a valid answer to the question \\"What will Others want to do next?\\". A more appropriate answer might be something along the lines of: \\"The salesmen, after being faced with Aubrey's frustration, might choose to re-evaluate their approach, move on to the next potential client, or reflect on their tactics to improve future interactions.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Since it is 18 million short of the agreed payment, Elmo threatens to leave. In a room across the street, Dakota is about to take a shot at Elmo's head when the Lizard calls cancelling the hit; not wanting to kill Elmo until he has the formula.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Mississippi is a state in the southern region of the United States, with part of its southern border formed by the Gulf of Mexico. Its western border is formed by the Mississippi River.  - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.  - North Carolina is a state in the southeastern region of the United States. The state borders South Carolina and Georgia to the south, Tennessee to the west, Virginia to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the east.

Question: ho does Sidney double cross? Movie title: Deathtrap Movie plot: Famed playwright Sidney Bruhl (Caine) debuts the latest in a series of Broadway flops and returns to his opulent Long Island home and his wife, Myra (Cannon). Although their financial situation is not dire, Sidney is hungry for a hit. He has received a manuscript of a play called Deathtrap written by one of his students, Clifford Anderson, that he considers near perfection. Clifford recently attended one of Sidney's writing workshops and now asks for input on his play. Sidney suggests that he murder Clifford and produce the play as his own. He invites Clifford to their secluded home, decorated with weapons from Sidney's plays, to discuss it. Clifford (Reeve) arrives by train. Myra tries desperately over the course of an evening to convince Sidney to work with Clifford as equal partners, but to no avail; Sidney attacks Clifford, strangling him with a chain. Sidney removes the body but still has to convince Myra to conspire with him. She reveals nothing when they receive an unexpected visit from the psychic Helga Ten Dorp (Irene Worth), a minor celebrity who is staying with the Bruhls' neighbors. Helga senses pain and death in the house; before she leaves she warns Sidney about a man in boots who will attack him. As she prepares for bed, Myra is beginning to come to terms with what Sidney has done. All is calm until Clifford bursts through the bedroom window and beats Sidney with a log. Clifford chases Myra through the house until her weak heart gives out; she collapses and dies. Sidney calmly descends the stairs, uninjured, and sidles unperturbed to Clifford's side. They exchange a few words about what to do with Myra's body, then exchange a passionate kiss. Clifford moves in with Sidney. The two work together at a partner's desk, Sidney suffering from writer's block but Clifford busily typing page after page of a new play that he keeps suspiciously under lock and key.

A:","output":"Based on the movie plot you provided, Sidney does not double-cross anyone directly. However, he does betray his wife, Myra, by suggesting that he murder Clifford and produce the play as his own. This act can be considered an indirect double-crossing of Myra, as he goes against her attempts to convince him to work with Clifford as equal partners. Furthermore, it appears that Sidney and Clifford double-cross Myra when they stage the attack and Clifford's supposed murder. They deceive Myra into believing that Sidney has actually killed Clifford, which directly contributes to her weak heart giving out when Clifford bursts through the bedroom window and chases her around the house. In summary, although Sidney does not double-cross anyone directly, his betrayal of Myra indirectly contributes to her death and can be seen as a form of double-crossing. Additionally, the calculated deception by both Sidney and Clifford further contributes to the overall sense of manipulation and betrayal present throughout the film. It is crucial to consider all these factors when deciding whether to invest in the film proposal, given that these elements play a significant role in the movie's suspense and dramatic tension."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Martínez-González, M.D., Ph.D.      University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain      [email protected]      This letter was published on June 13, 2018, at NEJM.org.      Editor’s note: An analysis of reports of randomized trials for improbable distributions of baseline data included 934 reports published in the Journal and identified 11 with distributions of baseline variables that did not appear consistent with randomization (Carlisle JB. Anaesthesia 2017;72:944-52. DOI: 10.1111/anae.13938. Epub 2017 June 4). We reviewed these 11 trial reports and replicated the Carlisle analysis. In 5 reports, standard errors were inadvertently reported as standard deviations, or vice versa. These errors explained the findings and have been corrected; the 5 reports are as follows: High-Dose Atorvastatin after Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (N Engl J Med 2006;355:549-59), Treatment of Periodontitis and Endothelial Function (N Engl J Med 2007;356:911-20), Extended Antiretroviral Prophylaxis to Reduce Breast-Milk HIV-1 Transmission (N Engl J Med 2008;359:119-29), Effect of Bronchoconstriction on Airway Remodeling in Asthma (N Engl J Med 2011;364:2006-15), and Horse versus Rabbit Antithymocyte Globulin in Acquired Aplastic Anemia (N Engl J Med 2011;365:430-8). For 5 other reports, limitations in the Carlisle analysis, such as lack of accounting for correlation among baseline variables, most likely explained the findings.      For the remaining report, Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet (N Engl J Med 2013;368:1279-90), the authors’ subsequent review of their data and randomization procedures identified protocol deviations, including the enrollment of participants who were not randomized. The authors have therefore withdrawn their original report (Retraction and Republication: Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet. N Engl J Med 2013;368:1279-90. N Engl J Med. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMc1806491). The Journal has now published their new report of the study, which describes the protocol deviations and reports reanalyses of the data (Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet Supplemented with Extra-Virgin Olive Oil or Nuts. N Engl J Med. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1800389). ||||| Study Design      The PREDIMED trial (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) was a parallel-group, multicenter, randomized trial. Details of the trial design are provided elsewhere.10-12 The trial was designed and conducted by the authors, and the protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at all study locations. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and all analyses and for the fidelity of this report to the protocol, which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.      Supplemental foods were donated, including extra-virgin olive oil (by Hojiblanca and Patrimonio Comunal Olivarero, both in Spain), walnuts (by the California Walnut Commission), almonds (by Borges, in Spain), and hazelnuts (by La Morella Nuts, in Spain). None of the sponsors had any role in the trial design, data analysis, or reporting of the results.      Participant Selection and Randomization      Eligible participants were men (55 to 80 years of age) and women (60 to 80 years of age) with no cardiovascular disease at enrollment, who had either type 2 diabetes mellitus or at least three of the following major risk factors: smoking, hypertension, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, overweight or obesity, or a family history of premature coronary heart disease. Detailed enrollment criteria are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org. All participants provided written informed consent.      Beginning on October 1, 2003, participants were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to one of three dietary intervention groups: a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts, or a control diet. Randomization was performed centrally by means of a computer-generated random-number sequence.      Interventions and Measurements      Table 1. Table 1. Summary of Dietary Recommendations to Participants in the Mediterranean-Diet Groups and the Control-Diet Group.      The dietary intervention8,10-13 is detailed in the Supplementary Appendix. The specific recommended diets are summarized in Table 1. Participants in the two Mediterranean-diet groups received either extra-virgin olive oil (approximately 1 liter per week) or 30 g of mixed nuts per day (15 g of walnuts, 7.5 g of hazelnuts, and 7.5 g of almonds) at no cost, and those in the control group received small nonfood gifts. No total calorie restriction was advised, nor was physical activity promoted.      For participants in the two Mediterranean-diet groups, dietitians ran individual and group dietary-training sessions at the baseline visit and quarterly thereafter. In each session, a 14-item dietary screener was used to assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet8,14 (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix) so that personalized advice could be provided to the study participants in these groups.      Participants in the control group also received dietary training at the baseline visit and completed the 14-item dietary screener used to assess baseline adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Thereafter, during the first 3 years of the trial, they received a leaflet explaining the low-fat diet (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix) on a yearly basis. However, the realization that the more infrequent visit schedule and less intense support for the control group might be limitations of the trial prompted us to amend the protocol in October 2006. Thereafter, participants assigned to the control diet received personalized advice and were invited to group sessions with the same frequency and intensity as those in the Mediterranean-diet groups, with the use of a separate 9-item dietary screener (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).      A general medical questionnaire, a 137-item validated food-frequency questionnaire,15 and the Minnesota Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire were administered on a yearly basis.10 Information from the food-frequency questionnaire was used to calculate intake of energy and nutrients. Weight, height, and waist circumference were directly measured.16 Biomarkers of compliance, including urinary hydroxytyrosol levels (to confirm compliance in the group receiving extra-virgin olive oil) and plasma alpha-linolenic acid levels (to confirm compliance in the group receiving mixed nuts), were measured in random subsamples of participants at 1, 3, and 5 years (see the Supplementary Appendix).      End Points      The primary end point was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death from cardiovascular causes. Secondary end points were stroke, myocardial infarction, death from cardiovascular causes, and death from any cause. We used four sources of information to identify end points: repeated contacts with participants, contacts with family physicians, a yearly review of medical records, and consultation of the National Death Index. All medical records related to end points were examined by the end-point adjudication committee, whose members were unaware of the study-group assignments. Only end points that were confirmed by the adjudication committee and that occurred between October 1, 2003, and December 1, 2010, were included in the analyses. The criteria for adjudicating primary and secondary end points are detailed in the Supplementary Appendix.      Statistical Analysis      We initially estimated that a sample of 9000 participants would be required to provide statistical power of 80% to detect a relative risk reduction of 20% in each Mediterranean-diet group versus the control-diet group during a 4-year follow-up period, assuming an event rate of 12% in the control group.10,17 In April 2008, on the advice of the data and safety monitoring board and on the basis of lower-than-expected rates of end-point events, the sample size was recalculated as 7400 participants, with the assumption of a 6-year follow-up period and underlying event rates of 8.8% and 6.6% in the control and intervention groups, respectively. Power curves under several assumptions can be found in Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix.      Yearly interim analyses began after a median of 2 years of follow-up. With the use of O'Brien–Fleming stopping boundaries, the P values for stopping the trial at each yearly interim analysis were 5×10−6, 0.001, 0.009, and 0.02 for benefit and 9×10−5, 0.005, 0.02, and 0.05 for adverse effects.18 The stopping boundary for the benefit of the Mediterranean diets with respect to the primary end point was crossed at the fourth interim evaluation; on July 22, 2011, the data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial on the basis of end points documented through December 1, 2010.      All primary analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis by two independent analysts. Time-to-event data were analyzed with the use of Cox models with two dummy variables (one for the Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil and another for the Mediterranean diet with nuts) to obtain two hazard ratios for the comparison with the control group. To account for small imbalances in risk factors at baseline among the groups, Cox regression models were used to adjust for sex, age, and baseline risk factors. We tested the proportionality of hazards with the use of time-varying covariates. All analyses were stratified according to center. Prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted according to sex, age, body-mass index (BMI), cardiovascular-risk-factor status, and baseline adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Sensitivity analyses were conducted under several assumptions, including imputation of data for missing values and participants who dropped out (see the Supplementary Appendix). ||||| Errors Trigger Retraction Of Study On Mediterranean Diet's Heart Benefits      Enlarge this image toggle caption Westend61/Getty Images Westend61/Getty Images      Ask just about anybody, and you'll probably hear that a healthy diet is one full of fruits and vegetables, olive oil, nuts and fish — what's called Mediterranean diet. A lot of research has suggested people who eat this way tend to be healthier, but it's been harder to prove whether that is because of the diet or some other factor.      So in 2013, many took notice of a study in the New England Journal of Medicine that seemed to provide some proof. The study found that people eating the Mediterranean diet supplemented with olive oil were 30 percent less likely to experience a heart attack, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes than people assigned to a low-fat diet. People who stuck with a Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts had a 28 percent lower risk than those asked to follow a low-fat diet.      The results got wide media attention, including from NPR.      But the New England Journal of Medicine retracted the paper Wednesday because of problems in the way the study was carried out.      A retraction is a last resort for medical and scientific journals, a sign to readers that the results are no longer trustworthy and are beyond correcting. Although retractions are relatively rare — taking down fewer than 1 in 1,000 published articles — the rate is increasing.      The authors of the NEJM paper are replacing the 2013 paper with a corrected version that shows people following the diet had a similarly reduced level of heart attacks and strokes. The major change is softer language about the conclusions.      The revised paper says only that people eating the Mediterranean diet had fewer strokes and heart attacks, not, as the original paper claimed, that the diet was the direct cause of those health benefits.      Of course, a change in one paper — even a high-profile one — doesn't mean that researchers have lost faith in the benefits of the Mediterranean diet. \\"I don't know anybody who would turn around from this and say, 'Now that this has been revealed, we should all eat cotton candy and turn away from the Mediterranean diet,' \\" says David Allison, dean of the School of Public Health at Indiana University in Bloomington.      Still, without the strong language touting the benefits of the diet in the original paper, \\"the legs have been kicked out from under it, in some sense,\\" says Allison, a longtime nutrition researcher whose research has at times been partially funded by the food industry.      What prompted the Mediterranean diet researchers to soften their language?      A persistent British anesthesiologist named John Carlisle.      He knew very little about analyzing the details behind clinical trials until a few years ago, when he wrote a letter to an anesthesiology journal bemoaning the fact that his field was polluted by one researcher's data that many suspected were problematic. The journal editor told Carlisle, a practicing anesthesiologist at Torbay Hospital in Torquay, England, to prove it.      So Carlisle did. He read up on statistical methods and looked over more than 160 trials by the researcher, Dr. Yoshitaka Fujii, and analyzed how likely it was that the people had been randomized to different treatments. Randomization is part of the gold standard for clinical studies because it reduces the risk of bias and allows researchers to determine cause-effect relationships.      Carlisle found the odds were infinitesimally small that Fujii had randomized people properly. Since Carlisle's findings were published in 2012, medical journals have retracted more than 160 papers by Fujii — the most retractions for any one researcher, by a large margin, according to Retraction Watch.      Carlisle's analysis drew accolades — and added him to the ranks of a small but growing number of such sleuths. The success of the approach prompted Carlisle to expand his scope to include randomized trials from other researchers and in other fields.      After the Fujii paper, he spent two years applying the \\"Carlisle method\\" to thousands of clinical trials published in eight journals. In 2017, he reported that roughly 2 percent showed signs of problems.      Among the more than 5,000 trials Carlisle analyzed, 934 were published by the New England Journal of Medicine. He flagged 11. One was the 2013 study showing the Mediterranean diet was responsible for the reduced rates of heart attack and stroke.      Today, NEJM is replacing the 2013 study and correcting five others on different topics. The Mediterranean diet paper is being retracted because it turns out Carlisle was correct. When the lead author of the paper, Dr. Miguel Ángel Martínez González of the University of Navarra Medical School, saw Carlisle's analysis, he conducted a detailed audit of the study and quickly noticed some problems.      It turns out approximately 14 percent of the more than 7,400 study participants hadn't been assigned randomly to either the Mediterranean diet or a low-fat one. When couples joined the study together, both had been picked to follow the same diet. At one of the 11 participating study sites, the lead investigator had assigned the same diet to an entire village and didn't tell the rest of the investigators.      \\"This affected only a small part of the trial,\\" says Martínez González. When the researchers reanalyzed the data excluding the nonrandomized people, the results were the same, he adds.      Still, because everybody wasn't randomly assigned to different groups, the study can no longer claim the diet directly caused those health benefits. \\"We need to tone down the results, but it is just a little bit,\\" he says.      Many other studies have shown that people eating the Mediterranean diet have lower risks of various ailments, without claiming cause and effect.      But would the New England Journal of Medicine, one of the world's most selective and prestigious journals, have published the Mediterranean diet paper from Martínez González if the randomization issues and softened conclusion had been included in the first place?      \\"It is difficult to answer hypothetical questions,\\" New England Journal of Medicine spokeswoman Jennifer Zeis says. \\"We believe the evidence [in favor of the diet] is still strong, but not as strong as a randomized study in which the randomization was executed flawlessly.\\"      Carlisle praised the journal's response. \\"I think that the NEJM editorial team responded very maturely to my paper,\\" he says. \\"They took the possibility of a problem seriously and acted quickly and thoroughly.\\"      Alison McCook is the editor of Retraction Watch, a website that reports on scientific retractions and related issues.

Martínez-González Credit via Wikimedia Commons      An omission like that erodes the randomized nature of the trial. Family members are likely to share more than just a diet: If a husband and wife both dodge heart disease, it’s difficult to say that their diet is the only reason.      In their re-analysis, the investigators statistically adjusted data on 390 people who happened to be household members but whose diets were not randomly assigned.      Then the investigators discovered another problem.      A researcher at one of the 11 clinical centers in the trial worked in small villages. Participants there complained that some neighbors were receiving free olive oil, while they got only nuts or inexpensive gifts.      So the investigator decided to give everyone in each village the same diet. He never told the leaders of the study what he had done.      “He did not think it was important,” Dr. Martínez-González said.      But the decision meant that participants were not truly randomized and forced Dr. Martínez-González and his colleagues to make another statistical adjustment to data on 652 people in the trial.      The investigators spent a year working on the re-analysis in collaboration with Dr. Miguel Hernan of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.      In the end, they concluded that the original findings were still accurate.      “You cannot imagine what it has been like,” Dr. Martínez-González said, adding that he and his team worked through vacations and weekends — and swallowed considerable professional embarrassment. |||||Summary:","output":"The New England Journal of Medicine recently retracted an article on the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet, after concerns were raised about the randomization procedures of the study.

What was the full name of the existing monument Horace Albright drafted a proposal to enlarge?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Zion National Park is an American national park located in southwestern Utah near the town of Springdale. A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile (590 km2) park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24 km) long and up to 2,640 ft (800 m) deep. The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River. The lowest point in the park is 3,666 ft (1,117 m) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726 ft (2,660 m) at Horse Ranch Mountain. Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches. Human habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans, one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Anasazi (c. 300 CE). Subsequently, the Virgin Anasazi culture (c. 500) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities. Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes. Mormons came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s. In 1909, President William Howard Taft named the area Mukuntuweap National Monument in order to protect the canyon. In 1918, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service, Horace Albright, drafted a proposal to enlarge the existing monument and change the park's name to Zion National Monument, Zion being a term used by the Mormons. According to historian Hal Rothman: \\"The name change played to a prevalent bias of the time.

According to an arrest warrant released Tuesday , Dotson admitted to FBI agents that he shot Dennehy in the head \\" because Patrick had tried to shoot him . \\"","output":"Yes, the two sentences have the same meaning, but they are structured differently. Both sentences convey the same information: Dotson admitted to FBI agents that he shot Dennehy in the head because Patrick had tried to shoot him, and this information came from an arrest warrant released on Tuesday. The difference between the two sentences lies in the order of the information presented and the syntactic structure used. In the first sentence, the main clause is \\"Dotson admitted to FBI agents that he shot Dennehy in the head 'because Patrick had tried to shoot him,'\\" and the secondary information, \\"according to an arrest warrant released Tuesday,\\" is placed at the end of the sentence. This structure emphasizes the action of Dotson admitting his actions to the FBI agents and the reason behind the shooting. In the second sentence, the information about the arrest warrant being released on Tuesday is shifted to the beginning of the sentence. By starting with \\"According to an arrest warrant released Tuesday,\\" the author places greater emphasis on the source of the information and establishes a context before presenting the main information. The main clause about Dotson's admission and the reason behind the shooting remains the same. In summary, while both sentences convey the same meaning, the difference in their structures emphasizes different aspects of the information – the first sentence puts more focus on Dotson's action and the reason for the shooting, while the second sentence highlights the source and context of the information. Regardless of their syntactic differences, the core meaning remains the same between the two sentences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write some highlights for the following article: The United States and Afghanistan have reached a deal on the final language of a bilateral security agreement, guiding the role of American troops in that south Asian nation for years to come, America's top diplomat said Wednesday. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the accord was reached during conversations Wednesday between himself and Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Afghan leaders will hold a meeting -- known as a loya jirga, or grand assembly -- starting on Thursday to decide whether to accept or reject the deal, which lays out a limited support role for American forces beyond next year. \\"They have to pass it,\\" Kerry said. \\"... It's up to the people of Afghanistan.\\" If approved, the agreement would go into effect January 1, 2015, and last \\"until the end of 2024 and beyond, unless terminated\\" by mutual agreement and with two years notice by either party, according to a copy of the deal posted online Wednesday by the Afghan government that a U.S. official confirms is authentic. Rice: Reports of a U.S. apology to Afghanistan are false. The subject of military raids and strikes has long been a sore point between the two countries, especially given a number of incidents in which noncombatant men, women and children were killed. The proposed deal contains references to respecting \\"Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity,\\" and adds U.S. forces \\"shall not target Afghan civilians, including in their homes.\\" But this agreement does not address past transgressions. In fact, Kerry strongly rejected a U.S. apology for operations that resulted in civilian casualties was part of the back-and-forth, as some published reports suggested, insisting \\"it's just not even on the table.\\" \\"I don't know where the idea of an apology started,\\" Kerry said. \\"President Karzai didn't ask for an apology. ... There has never been a discussion of or the word apology used in our discussions whatsoever.\\" The agreement does state that U.S. forces will play a support role in Afghanistan, while at the same time ceding that \\"U.S. military operations to defeat al Qaeda and its affiliates may be appropriate in the common fight against terrorism.\\" \\"U.S. military counterterrorism operations are intended to complement and support (the Afghan military's) counterterrorism operations, with the goal of maintaining (the Afghan military's) lead and with full respect for Afghan sovereignty and full regard for the safety and security of the Afghan people, including in their homes,\\" the tentative deal states. Mine blast kills seven -- and they were all children. The agreement also includes language on the U.S. government's continued funding for Afghan security forces, funneling such contributions through the Kabul-based government. The U.S. military \\"shall have the exclusive right\\" to discipline and prosecute its members for alleged acts committed on Afghan soil, according to the tentative deal, though Afghan authorities can ask that anyone be taken out of the country. U.S. troops first deployed to Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, which were coordinated by al Qaeda leaders then based in the south Asian nation. Since taking office, President Barack Obama has promised -- and, in some cases, acted -- to reduce troop levels there, in addition to stating the goal of ending the U.S. combat mission by the end of 2014. The approval of a security agreement would pave the way for Americans troops to remain on the ground in Afghanistan beyond that. Speaking on Wednesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney stressed that any U.S. forces would have \\"a very limited mission\\" and would not be \\"patrolling cities or mountains.\\" \\"The war in Afghanistan will end next year, as the president has promised,\\" Carney said. \\"The combat mission will be over.\\" Kerry used similar language in calling the U.S. military's role in Afghanistan \\"very limited,\\" adding \\"it is entirely (to) train, equip and assist\\" Afghan forces.

Captain Morgan  The Captain wasn't always just the choice of sorority girls looking to blend spiced rum with Diet Coke; in the 17th century he was a feared privateer.  Not only did the Welsh pirate marry his own cousin, he ran risky missions for the governor of Jamaica, including capturing some Spanish prisoners in Cuba and sacking Port-au-Prince in Haiti.  He then plundered the Cuban coast before holding for ransom the entire city of Portobelo, Panama.  He later looted and burned Panama City, but his pillaging career came to an end when Spain and England signed a peace treaty in 1671.  Instead of getting in trouble for his high-seas antics, Morgan received knighthood and became the lieutenant governor of Jamaica. Mental Floss: 5 drinking stories that put yours to shame  2.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. How do you do this: How to dye yarn.","output":"Alright, little buddy! Let's learn how to dye yarn together. For this colorful project, we'll need a few things and follow some simple steps. What we need: 1. Yarn: made from wool or other animal fibers 2. Dye: We'll use food coloring because it's safe and easy to find 3. Vinegar: This helps the dye stick to the yarn 4. Warm water 5. A large bowl or container 6. Gloves (so your hands don't get too colorful!) 7. Plastic wrap or a microwave-safe plate 8. Microwave or a heat source (ask an adult for help) Here's what we'll do step by step: 1. Soak the yarn: Fill the bowl with warm water and a little bit of vinegar. Put the yarn in the water and let it soak for at least 30 minutes. This helps the yarn become friends with the dye later. 2. Prepare the dye: While the yarn is soaking, mix a few drops of food coloring with some warm water and vinegar in a separate container. You can use your favorite color, or mix colors to make a new one! Make sure it's well mixed. 3. Remove the yarn: After soaking, gently take the yarn out of the bowl and slightly squeeze out the extra water, but don't twist or wring it. You want it to be damp, not too wet. 4. Time for color: Now, wearing gloves, slowly pour the dye mix onto the yarn, making sure you get the color where you want it. You can use your hands to move the dye around. Remember, it's okay if it's not perfect because that makes it unique! 5. Let it soak: Once the yarn is covered in the dye, let it soak for a bit. The longer you let the yarn soak, the stronger the color will be. 6. Cook the yarn: To set the dye, ask an adult to place the yarn on plastic wrap or a microwave-safe plate, and then put it in the microwave. Heat it up for 1-2 minutes, checking every 30 seconds to avoid burning. Be careful; it might be hot! 7. Cool and rinse: Let the yarn cool down. When it's not too hot to touch, rinse it under cold water until the water runs clear. Gently squeeze out any extra water. 8. Time to dry: Hang the yarn up to dry. Once it's completely dry, your colorful yarn is ready for you to use in any fun craft project! Remember, it's important to have a grown-up help you with the heating part and always be careful when using dye so you don't make a mess. Have fun and enjoy creating your colorful yarn!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

At first her name was \\"Malù\\", but the most fitting Ramba was launched by a journalist as he was referring to her aggressive look with guns and magazines. She has appeared in many films. Hypothesis: Ramba and Malù are the same person.","output":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that Ramba and Malù are the same person from the context provided. Reasoning: 1. Context mentions that Ileana Carusio is best known by the stage names of Ramba, Malù, or Malù Ramba, which suggests that these are alternative names for the same individual. 2. The text further elaborates that, initially, her name was \\"Malù\\" but a journalist eventually gave her the name \\"Ramba,\\" referring to her aggressive look with guns and magazines. This emphasizes that the names Ramba and Malù are linked to the same person. 3. Finally, the context specifies that Ileana Carusio, who assumably went by both names Ramba and Malù, is a retired Italian pornographic actress who appeared in many films.

One simplistic distinction between soft law and hard law states that hard law is legally binding, while soft law is not. This distinction can lead scholars into a semantic debate over whether any agreement that isn't legally binding can rightfully be called a law. Answer:","output":"To know the difference between soft law and hard law in international law, it is essential to identify the type of document or agreement and understand their characteristics. Hard law is generally associated with legally binding agreements, such as treaties, which are traditionally considered hard law by default. In contrast, soft law often consists of non-binding guidelines, frameworks, or principles that all parties agree to abide by without a legally enforceable requirement. One way to distinguish between the two is to consider enforceability. If an agreement or document has enforceable obligations or consequences for non-compliance, it is likely to be classified as hard law.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of Rose's ex-boyfriend?, using the article: In Bridger's Wells, Nevada in 1885, Art Croft and Gil Carter ride into town and enter Darby's Saloon. The atmosphere is subdued due to recent incidents of cattle-rustling. Art and Gil are suspected to be rustlers because they have rarely been seen in town. A man enters the saloon and announces that a rancher named Larry Kinkaid has been murdered. The townspeople immediately form a posse to pursue the murderers, who they believe are cattle rustlers. A judge tells the posse that it must bring the suspects back for trial, and that its formation by a deputy (the sheriff being out of town) is illegal. Art and Gil join the posse to avoid raising even more suspicion. Davies, who was initially opposed to forming the posse, also joins, along with \\"Major\\" Tetley and his son Gerald. Poncho informs the posse that three men and cattle bearing Kinkaid's brand have just entered Bridger's Pass. The posse encounters a stagecoach. When they try to stop it, the stagecoach guard assumes that it is a stickup, and shoots, wounding Art. In the coach are Rose Mapen, Gil's ex-girlfriend, and her new husband, Swanson. Later that night in Ox-Bow Canyon, the posse finds three men sleeping, with what are presumed to be stolen cattle nearby. The posse interrogates them: a young, well-spoken man, Donald Martin; a Mexican, Juan Martínez; and an old man, Alva Hardwicke (Francis Ford, brother of film director John Ford). Martin claims that he purchased the cattle from Kinkaid but received no bill of sale. No one believes Martin, and the posse decides to hang the three men at sunrise. Martin writes a letter to his wife and asks Davies, the only member of the posse that he trusts, to deliver it. Davies reads the letter, and, hoping to save Martin's life, shows it to the others.

Question: suppose more people work on building satellites happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER satelites in space.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If more people work on building satellites, it is likely to have more effect on the development and deployment of smaller satellites rather than less. This increased workforce in the satellite industry would potentially lead to a higher number of new satellites being developed and launched into space. With advancements in technology and the growing interest in small satellites, more people in the industry may result in a quicker development of smaller and more efficient satellite designs. The second effect mentioned is the supposed perturbation (unintended disruption or disturbance) caused by the increase in satellite development and launches. With more small satellites being developed and launched into space, there is likely to be an increase in the potential for perturbations caused by factors such as space debris, radio frequency interference, and increased satellite density in the low Earth orbits. In conclusion, more people working on building satellites would likely lead to more (the first effect) development and deployment of smaller satellites.

Single/multi-select question: Does the sentence \\"The relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection (CP).\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What makes zinc an efficient sacrificial anode?\\" Select from: a). yes; b). no;","output":"a). Yes, the sentence \\"The relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection (CP).\\" provides a valid answer to the question \\"What makes zinc an efficient sacrificial anode?\\". Let's break this down further to elaborate on the reasons that support this claim. First, it is essential to establish what cathodic protection (CP) is, as it aids in understanding the context of the question. Cathodic protection is an electrochemical technique designed to counteract corrosion in metal structures, such as pipelines, storage tanks, and other infrastructure elements. It operates by rendering the protected structure cathodic, thereby inhibiting anodic (oxidation) processes that lead to corrosion. Now, let's look at zinc as a material for creating sacrificial anodes. In a sacrificial anode system, a more reactive (easily oxidized) metal is linked to the structure to be protected. When the system is submerged in an electrolyte (such as seawater or soil), the more reactive metal corrodes preferentially, sacrificing itself and preventing corrosion on the primary structure. Zinc is a particularly efficient sacrificial anode for several reasons: 1. Relative reactivity: Compared to other metals, zinc has a higher rate of reactivity. Due to its position in the electrochemical series, it stands higher than iron and steel, making it ideal for safeguarding these materials from corrosion. Its higher reactivity means that zinc will corrode first in the presence of an electrolyte, shielding the primary metal structure. 2. Ability to attract oxidation: Zinc's chemical properties allow it to form a stable oxide layer that can protect its underlying layers from further corrosion. As zinc attracts oxidation to itself, it consumes the oxidizing agents before they can reach the protected metal structure. This self-sacrificing behavior is the main reason behind zinc's efficiency as a sacrificial anode. 3. Electrochemical properties: When submerged in an electrolyte, zinc can effectively transfer electrons between itself and the protected metallic structure, enabling the protection process. This electron exchange reduces the corrosion rate of the primary structure and prolongs its lifespan. 4. Cost-effectiveness: Zinc is relatively inexpensive compared to other sacrificial anode materials such as magnesium or aluminum. This factor enables the widespread application of zinc sacrificial anodes in the corrosion protection industry. In summary, the sentence provided is a valid answer to the question as it precisely explains the fundamental reasons behind zinc's efficiency as a sacrificial anode: its relative reactivity and ability to attract oxidation to itself. This information showcases why zinc is commonly employed in cathodic protection systems."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question \\"How would Cameron feel afterwards?\\", is \\"trusting\\" a valid answer? A:","output":"Yes, \\"trusting\\" can be considered a valid answer for how Cameron might feel afterwards. This is based on the given situation that Cameron believed Ash's hazel eyes despite the lack of direct evidence. Cameron's willingness to believe in Ash without concrete proof suggests that Cameron has a trusting nature and is inclined to put faith in others. However, it is essential to acknowledge that human emotions are complex, and feelings can vary by individual in a given situation. While \\"trusting\\" is a valid answer, there might be other emotions or reactions from Cameron depending on their personality, past experiences, and the specific context of the situation. For example, Cameron could also feel curious, protective, or empathetic towards Ash, leading to their belief in Ash's statement. Moreover, Cameron's feelings could differ depending on whether their trust in Ash is ultimately validated or proven to be misplaced. If subsequent events provide evidence that supports Ash's claim about their eyes, Cameron might feel vindicated or reassured in their trust. On the other hand, if Cameron learns that Ash's statement was false or a manipulation, they could feel betrayed, disillusioned, or skeptical. In conclusion, \\"trusting\\" is a valid answer to describe how Cameron might feel after believing Ash's claim despite the lack of direct evidence. However, it is crucial to recognize that emotions are multifaceted, and Cameron could potentially experience a range of feelings depending on their personality, experiences, and the outcome of the situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The passage discusses recent meetings among Chinese leaders to consider revaluing the yuan, China's national currency. The topic of currency revaluation falls under the domain of economics and finance, which makes this a business-related issue. International currency values play a significant role in global trade and economic stability. The evaluation and possible adjustment of a nation's currency in relation to other global currencies can have far-reaching effects on import and export markets, domestic economic growth, and international business relations. The text mentions that the Chinese leaders have decided not to make changes to the yuan's valuation for now. This decision can impact both Chinese businesses and international business partners. While revaluing a currency can sometimes boost a country's economy by making its exports more attractive to foreign buyers, there are also potential downsides, such as inflation and reduced purchasing power for its citizens. As the world's second-largest economy, China plays a significant role in global business, and decisions regarding its currency valuation can impact multiple sectors worldwide.

Closing in on a planet, the ship is attacked by a mysterious weapon (a red blobby field) which drives the crew insane. Three escape pods launch during the attack, but the ship crashes into the atmosphere of the planet and is destroyed. Meanwhile, smuggler Stella Star and her sidekick Akton run into the Imperial Space Police, led by robot sheriff Elle. Akton and Stella escape by jumping into hyperspace. When they emerge, they discover an escape pod from the attacked starship, and in it, a sole survivor. Before they can escape, they are apprehended by the police, who tracked their hyperspace trail. Tried and convicted of piracy, they are each sentenced to life in prison on separate prison planets. When a riot breaks out at Stella's prison, she uses the diversion to escape the prison, which explodes shortly afterwards. Police Chief Thor recaptures her and she is taken to an orbiting ship, where she is reunited with Akton. They are contacted holographically by the Emperor of the Galaxy, who thanks them for recovering the starship survivor. They are offered clemency if they help find three more missing escape pods, one of which may contain the Emperor's only son. The Emperor is in a feud with Count Zarth Arn, who has a secret weapon hidden away on a planet somewhere. The weapon has immense power, and he can use it to take over the galaxy. The Emperor orders Stella and Akton to find the Count's weapon, and find and rescue his son. With Chief Thor and Elle accompanying them, Stella and Akton set off on their quest.

Irving Grant Thalberg (May 30, 1899 - September 14, 1936) was an American film producer during the early years of motion pictures. He was called \\"The Boy Wonder\\" for his youth and ability to select scripts, choose actors, gather production staff, and make profitable films, including Grand Hotel, China Seas, Camille, Mutiny on the Bounty, and The Good Earth. His films carved out an international market, \\"projecting a seductive image of American life brimming with vitality and rooted in democracy and personal freedom,\\" states biographer Roland Flamini. Thalberg was born in Brooklyn, to German Jewish immigrant parents, William and Henrietta (Haymann). Shortly after birth, he was diagnosed with \\"blue baby syndrome,\\" caused by a congenital disease that limited the oxygen supply to his heart. The prognosis from the family's doctor and specialists was that he might live to age twenty, or at most, age thirty.  During his high school years in Brooklyn, he began having attacks of chest pains, dizziness and fatigue. This affected his ability to study, though until that time he was a good student. When he was 17, he contracted rheumatic fever, and was confined to bed for a year. His mother, Henrietta, to prevent him falling too far behind other students, brought him homework from school, books, and tutors to teach him at home. She also hoped that the schoolwork and reading would distract him from the \\"tantalizing sounds\\" of children playing outside his window.  With little to entertain him, he read books as a main activity. He devoured popular novels, classics, plays, and biographies. His books, of necessity, replaced the streets of New York, and led to his interest in classical philosophy and philosophers, such as William James.  When Thalberg returned to school, he finished high school but lacked the stamina for college, which he felt would have required constant late-night studying and cramming for exams. Instead, he took part-time jobs as a store clerk, and in the evenings, to gain some job skills, taught himself typing, shorthand and Spanish at a night vocational school. When he turned 18, he placed an ad with the local newspaper hoping to find better work:  \\"Situation Wanted: Secretary, stenographer, Spanish, English, high school education, no experience; 15.\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: where did he grow up","output":"Irving Thalberg grew up in Brooklyn, as mentioned in the passage: \\"Thalberg was born in Brooklyn, to German Jewish immigrant parents, William and Henrietta (Haymann).\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on \\"kohl and challenger see gizmos but not each other at german\\" Text:","output":"Title: Kohl and Challenger Encounter Gizmos at German Event, but Miss Each Other In a remarkable turn of events, political figures Helmut Kohl and a prominent challenger found themselves sharing the same space at a German event, surrounded by innovative gadgets and gizmos. However, to the surprise of onlookers, the two influential individuals never crossed paths or acknowledged each other's presence. The event, which showcased cutting-edge technology and creative devices, drew a massive crowd of enthusiasts and professionals eager to discuss the future of German innovation. Among these attendees were Kohl, a notable political leader, and his challenger, a respected figure in the competing political camp. Step 1: Identify Key Points The key points to consider in this text include: the presence of Kohl and his challenger at the same German event, the focus on innovative gadgets and gizmos, and the fact that the two political figures did not interact. Step 2: Focus on Elaboration and Description To give the readers a better understanding, the text should provide more details about the event, such as its name, purpose, and the types of gadgets and technologies on display. Additionally, it should emphasize the significance of these two renowned political figures attending the same event. Step 3: Discuss the Lack of Interaction The text must explore the potential implications of Kohl and his challenger not meeting or acknowledging each other at the event. This could involve discussing their past interactions, political context, and the potential consequences of their decision to remain aloof. As the bustling event unfolded with technological enthusiasts demonstrating their latest inventions, Kohl and his adversary, both influential personalities in the political arena, navigated through the crowd independently, apparently oblivious to each other's presence. Attendees and onlookers eagerly anticipated a possible encounter between the two, curious to see if tensions would arise or if they'd share a rare moment of camaraderie. However, the much-anticipated interaction never came to fruition as the two leaders moved in different directions, ultimately leaving those present with a lingering sense of what might have been. While it remains unclear if this lack of encounter was intentional or by chance, the absence of a public exchange between the two rivals speaks volumes about the current state of political discourse. In the age of advancing technology and growing possibilities, the silent near-encounter of Kohl and his challenger highlights the gulf that continues to widen between political camps. As German innovators present their latest \\"gizmos\\" with hopes of a brighter future, the unresolved personal and political tensions between these two formidable figures remain a sobering reminder of what challenges lie ahead in the real world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you're a parent who spends long hours on the job, you probably feel sorry for spending so much time away from your kids. But the results of a new study show that a mother's voice alone can be just as comforting to an anxious   child as physical contact  . In an experiment, researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison asked a group of girls between the age of 7 and 12 to solve math problems in front of judges --- a stressful   situation for anyone. Before the girls were set to solve math problems, the researchers measured their levels of two hormones  : cortisol, which goes up during stressful periods, and oxytocin, the \\"love\\" hormone. After they were finished, some of the girls got to meet up with their mothers right away. The mums came in and hugged the girls. Another group of the girls didn't see their mothers, but received phone calls from them, in which their mothers told them how well they'd done. The final group had no contact with their mothers, but watched an animal movie, March of the Penguins instead. Finally, the girls' hormone levels were measured again. Although the movie was interesting, it did nothing to ease   the children's anxiety   ---- but, surprisingly, both the physical contact and phone calls from their mothers had the same effect on easing the girls' stress levels.

Provided Answer: As a result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, which limited the construction of new heavy surface combat ships, most early aircraft carriers were conversions of ships that were laid down (or had served) as different ship types: cargo ships, cruisers, battlecruisers, or battleships.

The main subject is the conflict between Christianity and the corruption of the Roman Empire, especially in the last period of the Julio-Claudian line. The characters and events depicted are a mixture of actual historical figures and situations and fictionalized ones. The film tells the story of a Roman military commander, Marcus Vinicius (Robert Taylor), who is also the legate of the XIV Gemina, returning from the wars, who falls in love with a devout Christian, Lygia (Deborah Kerr), and slowly becomes intrigued by her religion. Their love story is told against the broader historical background of early Christianity and its persecution by Nero (Peter Ustinov). Though she grew up Roman as the adopted daughter of a retired general, Aulus Plautius (Felix Aylmer), Lygia is technically a hostage of Rome. Marcus persuades Nero to give her to him for services rendered. Lygia resents this, but still falls in love with Marcus. Meanwhile, Nero's atrocities become increasingly more outrageous and his acts more insane. When he burns Rome and blames the Christians, Marcus goes off to save Lygia and her family. Nero captures them and all the Christians, and condemns them to be killed in the arena. However, Marcus's uncle, Petronius (Leo Genn), Nero's most trusted advisor, warns that the Christians will be made martyrs and, tired of Nero's insanity and suspecting that he might become a victim of his antics too, commits suicide by slitting his wrist artery, sending Nero a farewell letter in which he finally communicates his derisive opinions he had never been able to tell the emperor in fear of his own life.

He'd agreed for a reason, and once Greg had a reason for making a decision it was usually impossible to change his mind. And it didn't make sense anyway. All he would have done is buy himself a little more time. Chloe and Paul would just march right back in and start all over again - probably after sending out pics of Evan in drag to all the employees. From his point of view, there was no reason for Greg to do that. Of course, it was still a huge risk for Chloe and Paul. If Greg just wanted a delay to get the lawyers involved, then they were in trouble. Chloe and he had broken a fist full of laws in the past twelve hours. They needed to cash that check and disappear as soon as they could. The bank put up a bit of a fuss about the check, which was one more reason Paul hated Bank of Fucking America. They always had some rule to screw a customer. But Chloe made a bunch of noise and actually jumped up and down at one point and eventually they walked out of the bank with a cashier's check. What is probably the relationship between Chloe and Paul? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. They are cousins.  B. They are married.  C. not enough information  D. They are strangers. Answer:","output":"C. not enough information"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Later that night, Sokurah secretly reduces the princess to diminutive size, enraging her father who then declares war on Bagdad. Sinbad and the Caliph give in to Sokurah, who explains that the eggshell of a Roc needed for the potion to release Parisah from her spell can be found only on Colossa. Sokurah provides Sinbad and his crew with the construction plans for a giant crossbow, if needed, to be used against the island's giant creatures.Sinbad recruits additional sailors for the voyage from among the convicts in the Caliph's prisons. Before they reach Colossa, the cutthroats mutiny and capture Sokurah, Sinbad, and his men.

Roger Spottiswoode is a British-Canadian film director, editor, and screenwriter, born in 1945. He started his career in the film industry as an editor, working on several well-known films, including \\"Straw Dogs\\" (1971) and \\"Hard Times\\" (1975) before transitioning into directing. As a director, Spottiswoode has helmed numerous critically acclaimed and commercially successful films throughout his career. Some of his notable works include \\"Under Fire\\" (1983), \\"A Street Cat Named Bob\\" (2016), and the 18th installment of the James Bond film series, \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" (1997). Though primarily focused on directing, Spottiswoode has also contributed to the screenplays of various films he directed, showcasing his aptitude in various aspects of filmmaking. Holger-Madsen, on the other hand, was a Danish film actor and director, born in 1878 and passed away in 1943. With a career that spanned the early 20th century, Madsen primarily worked in the silent film era, which can be seen as a significant distinction between him and Spottiswoode. He started his career as an actor in 1910, later transitioning into writing and directing. As a director, Madsen was known for creating several Danish, Swedish, and German films, including \\"Towards the Light\\" (1919), \\"The Golden Smile\\" (1921), and \\"The Wild Duck\\" (1921). Unlike Spottiswoode, who began his career in Hollywood, Madsen was more affiliated with the European film industry, particularly during a time when it was still in its nascent stage. In summary, although both Roger Spottiswoode and Holger-Madsen were involved in the film industry, their careers and areas of specialization differed significantly. While Spottiswoode's work spans from the late 20th to the 21st century and includes film editing, directing, and screenwriting, Holger-Madsen was part of the silent film era in the early 20th century, working primarily as an actor and director. Both figures, however, have left enduring imprints on the world of cinema, showcasing the vast scope and evolution of the film industry over time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Identify the keywords or phrases that convey sentiment:    - \\"terrific performances\\"    - \\"willingness to wander\\"    - \\"dark areas\\"    - \\"without flinching\\" 2. Analyze each keyword or phrase:    - \\"terrific performances\\" has a positive connotation since 'terrific' is an adjective with a positive meaning.    - \\"willingness to wander\\" has a neutral slant since it describes a trait or action and doesn't inherently convey an emotion.    - \\"dark areas\\" generally have a negative connotation, as 'dark' is often used to describe something negative or unpleasant.    - \\"without flinching\\" is a phrase indicating resilience, which carries a slightly positive connotation. 3. Consider the context in which the keywords or phrases are used:     - The sentence as a whole seems to praise Fontaine's ability to depict parent-child relationships without shying away from the darker aspects. 4. Weigh the positive and negative elements:     - There are two positive elements (terrific performances, without flinching) and one negative element (dark areas), with the remaining one being neutral (willingness to wander). 5.

Context: The filming was kind of a long process, but maybe it didn’t need to be? Or maybe it did? The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass. The main thing I learnt from the filming process was that you can plan out exactly what you want to do, and how your going to do it, but once you get into the location with the actors this plan often changes – however, you are still much better of having the plan than none at all! As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked. Of course no one else was interested in spending an entire night shooting the film – but with them as stands in – just so I could complete my psychotic endeavour of...

They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

(CNN)Jon Stewart ripped into Mike Huckabee on the \\"Daily Show\\" Monday, saying the former Arkansas governor was being hypocritical in his recent criticism of Beyoncé.

Thus, the phrase \\"Huckabee, we don't do that in our culture\\" would fit perfectly. In this ending, Jon Stewart turns Huckabee's criticism back onto him. Stewart, with characteristic irony, might retort, \\"Huckabee, we don't do that in our culture,\\" suggesting that it's not Beyoncé or Jay-Z that's crossing lines—it's Huckabee. Stewart argues that Huckabee is the one straying from societal norms by publicly criticizing individuals for their personal or professional choices and suggesting what the Obamas should allow their daughters to consume. Stewart could point out that it's not within Huckabee's jurisdiction to judge or dictate what others, including Beyoncé, the Obamas, or the general public, should or shouldn't consume, whether that's music, literature, or other forms of media. He might argue that it's an individual's personal right and freedom to choose without judgement or pressure from political figures taking moral high ground. Here, Stewart might analyze Huckabee's behavior as a form of cultural imposition—one culture or individual imposing their beliefs, values, and norms on others. This is what Huckabee seems to be doing in his book, demarcating cultural lines based on his personal perspectives and suggesting that those who cross these boundaries, such as Beyoncé with her \\"explicit\\" style, are morally wrong or inappropriate. Stewart might go further, arguing that such explicit criticism and public judgement do not belong in the modern societal culture that highly values personal freedom, diversity, and artistic expression. Thus, the phrase \\"Huckabee, we don't do that in our culture,\\" serves as a rallying call against Huckabee's judgemental perspective, turning his own criticism against him, and asserting a broader, more inclusive cultural norm. In this approach, the ending isn't just about a direct response to Huckabee's comments. Stewart uses the platform of the \\"Daily Show\\" to point out a broader social issue—the ongoing battle over cultural norms and freedom of expression. It's a statement that questions the right of any one individual or group to define what is acceptable or 'normal' in our diverse and evolving society. It's a promote reflection on the part of viewers, inviting them to consider where they stand in this wider cultural discourse."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer:","output":"Based on the given review, the chances of buying the product would most likely decrease. The reviewer clearly expresses their dissatisfaction and disappointment with the DVD's content, which does not align with what they were expecting. Here's a detailed breakdown of the factors that contribute to the overall decrease in the chances of purchasing the product: 1. Misleading content: The review states that the buyer was expecting to see Pink Floyd discussing their albums, but instead, the band only appears for about two minutes. This indicates that the DVD's description may have been misleading or not accurately representing the content, which would be a red flag for potential buyers. 2. Excessive focus on critics and other bands: The reviewer mentions that 45 minutes of the 47-minute DVD are dedicated to critics discussing Pink Floyd's albums and featuring another band named \\"Mostly Autumn.\\" This could be seen as irrelevant or uninteresting content for potential buyers who are primarily interested in Pink Floyd themselves. 3. Lack of value for seasoned Pink Floyd fans: The reviewer suggests that the DVD is only helpful for new fans to discover Pink Floyd's discography, whereas long-time fans would derive no real value from it and are better off saving their money for another product, like the PULSE DVD. 4. Potential waste of money: The reviewer outright states that the DVD is not worth the investment and urges readers to avoid wasting their money on it. This indicates that the product is not thought to be of high quality or worth the expense. Taking all of these factors into consideration, the review would likely decrease the chances of purchasing the product. The dissatisfaction expressed by the reviewer, along with the criticisms of the content, make the product seem less appealing and not worth the potential buyer's investment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the answer: What term is often used to describe a 6-0 scoreline in a set of a Tennis match?","output":"The term often used to describe a 6-0 scoreline in a set of a tennis match is a \\"bagel.\\" The term is derived from the shape of the zero in the score, which resembles a bagel, a round bread made of dough shaped into a ring and boiled and then baked to achieve a chewy texture. A bagel in tennis represents a dominating performance by one player over their opponent, where the player who scored 6 points didn't allow the opponent to score any games in the set. This scoreline showcases a significant gap in skill or form between the two players during that particular set, with the winning player demonstrating exceptional ability and often demoralizing their opponent in the process. It is worth noting that the term is primarily used in professional tennis, though it is also sometimes used in recreational play among knowledgeable fans and players. Although the term \\"bagel\\" might seem informal or humorous, it is widely recognized and accepted within the tennis community, both by players and in the media. Tennis commentators and journalists often use the term to describe a 6-0 scoreline in articles, analysis, and even during live broadcasts. In addition to the term \\"bagel,\\" there are some other tennis terms related to one-sided scorelines. For example, a \\"breadstick\\" is a term used to describe a 6-1 scoreline in a set, referring to the long, slim shape of the bread that resembles the number 1. A \\"golden set\\" refers to a rare achievement in which a player wins every single point in a set, leading to a 6-0 scoreline without dropping a point to their opponent, but this term is not commonly used to describe a simple 6-0 scoreline. It is important to understand that a bagel in a tennis match is not an indication of the overall outcome of the match since tennis matches, in most cases, are decided by a best-of-three or best-of-five sets format. A player who loses a set by a bagel can still come back to win the match with improved performance in subsequent sets. As a result, the term \\"bagel\\" only describes the scoreline of a single set and not the collective result of the game."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Which verses of the ballad about the Wabash River talk about missing a loved one?, using the article: The ballad speaks of the Wabash River, which flows through Indiana, and reminisces about events that occurred there. The song has two verses and a chorus. The first verse is about the narrator's childhood on a farm and his love for his mother. The second verse is about his lost love, Mary. While the subjects of the verses are connected, the narrative of the chorus is detached from the verses as it seemingly reminisces nostalgically.Without speaking directly of death, both verses indicate the absence of a loved one, and the narrator's sadness and inability to cope with the grief. In the second verse, the narrator cannot bring himself to come near to his lost love's grave. The effort to avoid the subject of death and the focus on fond memories is typical of songs and societal sensibilities at the time.The melody of the song is a memorable tune made easy to learn because of its combination of harmonic repetition and contrast—elements that make music easy to remember while avoiding monotony. The recurrence and dissimilarity within the melody is similar to the patterns in many popular folk songs. Dresser, however, avoided the common 19th-century practice of using a portion of the refrain's melody in the verse. With little formal training in music theory, it is unlikely that Dresser purposefully made any methodical calculations when he composed the melody.Written for piano, guitar, and mandolin, the music begins in the key of G major with an Andante Moderato tempo. The verses follow a chord progression of G–C–G. The chorus transitions to B minor, and progresses as B–E–E, before returning to G–C–G in its final bars. Although the melody of the chorus is unique within the piece, it is in harmonic unity with the verses. An upbeat version played at a Andantino tempo was also adapted for play by small orchestras and big bands., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The answer to the question would be: The second verse of the ballad about the Wabash River talks about missing a loved one, specifically the narrator's lost love, Mary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

My point, of course, is not to suggest that reality-show contestants can’t have worthwhile views on matters of international affairs. Rather, what’s striking here is the Republican Party – which once considered credibility on foreign matter a matter of GOP birthright – is taking on a former Secretary of State in this presidential election, and the party lacks the kind of credible, experienced, high-profile professionals who can assess Clinton’s record on foreign policy in a serious way. To be sure, such figures exist in the party – there are several living former Secretaries of State from Republican administrations, for example – but they generally want nothing to do with promoting Trump’s candidacy, and they’re keeping political activities this year at arm’s length.

Combine like terms (the terms that have the same variable, in this case, m).  -60*m + 63*m = (63 - 60)*m = 3*m. So, the equation now becomes: 3*m + 9 = 0. 2. As we want to find the value of m, we need to isolate m. We'll first move the constant term to the other side of the equation.  To do this, we'll subtract 9 from both sides: 3*m + 9 - 9 = 0 - 9 This simplifies to: 3*m = -9 3. Now, we have the term 3*m on the left side of the equation. To isolate m, we need to divide both sides by 3: (3*m)/3 = -9/3 This will cancel out the 3 on the left side, leaving just m: m = -3 Now, we have the value of m.

The dimmer of the two objects would be a star, primarily due to its distance from Earth and its intrinsic brightness. While the sun is also a star, it is much closer to Earth (about 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers away), making it appear significantly brighter and larger in the sky. Other stars are much farther away, with the closest star system, Alpha Centauri, located about 4.37 light-years away. Star brightness can vary greatly based on their size, temperature, age, and distance. Some stars are intrinsically brighter or dimmer than the sun.

Adjust your breathing and hold your breath when necessary. Extend your body horizontally under the wave. Wear surfing goggles. Practice diving under small or flat waves. Dive under supervision. Article:","output":"Title: Conquering the Waves: Master the Art of Diving Under Large Swells Introduction Surf's up, and there's no better feeling than hitting the waves and feeling the adrenaline surge through your body as you ride those big swells. However, while riding over colossal waves can be exhilarating, there's an essential skill every surfer must learn to stay safe in the water: diving under large waves. Diving under big waves can be challenging and intimidating for beginner surfers. Still, with some essential tips and continuous practice, you'll master this lifesaving skill and be on your way to confidently enjoying the ocean. In this article, we will discuss some crucial techniques to help you improve your surfing experience and safety. 1. Dive Early to Get Under Large Waves Timing is everything; you need to assess the wave quickly and make a decision to dive under it. When facing an impending large swell, start paddling towards it and dive early in the process. This technique will allow you to have enough time to get deep enough under the wave without being dragged back or slammed by the crashing wave. Learning to read the waves is a crucial skill, and it will significantly improve as you continue to practice and spend time in the water. 2. Adjust Your Breathing and Hold Your Breath When Necessary Breath control is essential when diving under waves. You'll want to master the art of quickly adjusting your breathing to the circumstances. Before diving under, take a deep breath, filling your lungs to their full capacity. This way, you'll have plenty of oxygen to help you through until you resurface. Remember to exhale slowly upon resurfacing to avoid hyperventilation or shallow breathing. 3. Extend Your Body Horizontally Under the Wave As you approach the wave, aim to extend your body horizontally while diving under it. This position will help you effectively cut through the water and ensure you pass under the wave with minimal resistance. Maintaining a streamlined and flat body position helps in reducing the drag, allowing you to dive smoothly and comfortably. 4. Wear Surfing Goggles Chances are, you'll have your eyes open underwater to navigate your way under those massive waves. To make your vision more precise and protect your eyes from saltwater irritation, consider wearing surfing goggles. These specially-designed goggles will help you see clearly underwater and prevent the possibility of losing contact lenses or experiencing painful eye stings. 5. Practice Diving Under Small or Flat Waves Before diving headfirst into large waves, hone your diving skills under smaller, flatter waves. Practicing under these calmer conditions allows you to get the correct body positioning, breath control, and timing without the added stress and anxiety of a big wave approaching. Gradually increase the size of waves you dive under as you gain confidence and improve your skill. 6. Dive Under Supervision As a beginner, it is always helpful to have a knowledgeable and experienced surfer nearby to provide guidance and support when learning to dive under waves. Taking surf lessons or joining a surf camp can offer helpful supervision and advice, ensuring that you are practicing the techniques correctly and safely. Additionally, they can offer real-time feedback to help you make adjustments and boost your overall performance. Conclusion Diving under large waves is an essential skill that every surfer must-have. It not only ensures that you can safely navigate the ocean but also significantly improves your surfing experience. By following these tips and consistently practicing, you'll overcome the fear and uncertainty that comes with diving under large swells. So go ahead, paddle out, dive under those menacing waves, and let the ocean reward you with an exhilarating ride."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His mother, Bow-sim Mark, is a Fu Style Wudangquan (internal martial arts) and Tai Chi grandmaster, while his father, Klyster Yen (Zhen Yun Long ), is a newspaper editor. When he was two years old, his family moved to Hong Kong and then to Boston when he was 11. His younger sister, Chris Yen, is also a martial artist and actress, and appeared in the 2007 film Adventures of Johnny Tao: Rock Around the Dragon. Donnie Yen was considered as one of the premiere action choreographers in the world, having been invited by Hollywood to choreograph blockbusters such as Blade II, Highlander: Endgame, and Shanghai Knights. In Asia, he is the action choreographer for most of his movies and has won multiple awards for his action choreography.  Yen's most famous works include films such as Flash Point and SPL: Sha Po Lang. He has mentioned that the main differences in filmmaking in Asia and Hollywood are with regards to freedom and control. In Asia, the action choreographer takes over the scene during the fight scene. This means that for action scenes filmed in Asia, the choreographer becomes the director and is in full control over camera placements, camera angles, and the relationship between the drama and the action; therefore the main director is not needed at all. While in Hollywood, on the other hand, Yen explains that the action choreographer simply choreographs the actions with the director, who still maintains full control of such settings and camera angles.  Yen's work as a choreographer won him \\"Best Action Choreography\\" awards at the 27th Hong Kong Film Awards and the 2008 and 2011 Golden Horse Film Awards.  Yen was the fight choreographer for the 2010 film Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen. For this film, Yen mentioned that he included Jeet Kune Do elements as a tribute to Bruce Lee, who played Chen Zhen in the 1972 film Fist of Fury. Furthermore, he incorporated many MMA elements in the film, coupled with the utilisation of Wing Chun. Yen also stated that the concept behind Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do is similar to that of MMA, hence the incorporation of many forms of martial arts was a necessity in the film. He won the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Action Choreography 4 times, being one of the most frequent winners of this coveted award. He has won awards for his choreography in films such as The Twins Effect, SPL: Sha Po Lang, Flash Point, and Kung Fu Jungle.

Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to learn about portion size  Determine your dietary goals and recommended daily caloric intake.  Your portion needs will depend on age, sex, activity level, and weight goals. Online interactive dietary planners and calorie calculators can help more closely estimate your necessary daily calorie intake and precise portion sizes.","output":"Once you have a clear understanding of your daily caloric needs, you can start to break down what a portion size looks like for different food categories such as carbohydrates, proteins, dairy, and fats, keeping in mind that it's not just about quantity, but quality. Healthier food choices, such as whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy, should make up the majority of your servings because they are lower in calories and rich in essential nutrients. In this context, understanding your portion sizes comes with familiarizing yourself with measuring tools and common household items. Measuring cups, spoons, and food scales can offer a more accurate representation of serving sizes, especially when you are just starting with portion control. Over time, it can become easier to eyeball these measurements. As a visual cue, for instance, a single serving of lean protein should be about the size of a deck of cards, while half a cup of cooked rice, pasta, or other carbohydrate-rich foods should be about the size of a small fist. Instead of going for seconds, consider filling half your plate with vegetables, a quarter with lean protein, and another quarter with healthy carbs. This balance approach will help ensure you are getting the nutrients you need and maintaining the right portion sizes for a balanced meal. Indeed, proper plate mapping can direct the eye and the stomach to accept smaller portions, while the variety and balance satisfy our nutritional and culinary needs. Meal planning and pre-portioning food, especially for meals and snacks that you often consume, make it easier to avoid overeating. For instance, instead of eating snacks like nuts or chips straight from the bag, pre-portion them into individual servings so that you can avoid mindless eating. Using smaller plates, bowls, and cups can also help control portion sizes. Finally, keep a food diary to track what and how much you're eating. Monitoring your intake can provide in-depth insight into your eating patterns and can be a useful tool for identifying areas of improvement. Over time, you will start to get a sense of how well you manage portion control and be able to adjust the quantities to better achieve your nutritional and weight goals. Regular exercise also plays a key role in managing calorie intake and portion control, as it not only burns calories but also increases feelings of fullness. Bear in mind that changing eating habits and learning portion control takes time, patience, and practice. Don't discourage yourself if you initially struggle with portion sizes, it's a learning process. Implementing these strategies consistently will help you better understand portion sizes and, hopefully, lead you to create healthier eating habits that can last a lifetime. Remember, achieving better health isn't just about restricting portion sizes but making informed food choices, eating mindfully, and appreciating each bite."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Amyntas III was forced to flee his kingdom in either 393 or 383 BC (based on conflicting accounts), owing to a massive invasion by the Illyrian Dardani led by Bardylis. The pretender to the throne Argaeus ruled in his absence, yet Amyntas III eventually returned to his kingdom with the aid of Thessalian allies. Amyntas III was also nearly overthrown by the forces of the Chalcidian city of Olynthos, but with the aid of Teleutias, brother of the Spartan king Agesilaus II, the Macedonians forced Olynthos to surrender and dissolve their Chalcidian League in 379 BC.Alexander II (r. 370 – 368 BC), son of Eurydice I and Amyntas III, succeeded his father and immediately invaded Thessaly to wage war against the tagus (supreme Thessalian military leader) Alexander of Pherae, capturing the city of Larissa. The Thessalians, desiring to remove both Alexander II and Alexander of Pherae as their overlords, appealed to Pelopidas of Thebes for aid; he succeeded in recapturing Larissa and, in the peace agreement arranged with Macedonia, received aristocratic hostages including Alexander II's brother and future king Philip II (r. 359–336 BC– ). When Alexander was assassinated by his brother-in-law Ptolemy of Aloros, the latter acted as an overbearing regent for Perdiccas III (r. 368 – 359 BC), younger brother of Alexander II, who eventually had Ptolemy executed when reaching the age of majority in 365 BC. The remainder of Perdiccas III's reign was marked by political stability and financial recovery.

Pick your answer from: [-] no. [-] yes.","output":"No, these questions do not have the same meaning. The first question is focused on understanding the strength of sigma bonds compared to pi bonds, while the second question is about the general concept of pi bonds. - In response to the first question, \\"Why is the sigma bond strong compared to the pi bond?\\": Sigma bonds are stronger than pi bonds because they involve end-to-end overlap of bonding orbitals, whereas pi bonds involve side-by-side overlap. In a sigma bond, the electron density is concentrated between the two bonding atoms, resulting in a strong covalent bond. Since the shared electron pair occupies the region directly between the bonded atoms, this interaction creates a strong, stable bond. Pi bonds, on the other hand, result from the side-by-side overlapping of p orbitals that are parallel to the bond axis. This leads to electron density being distributed above and below the bond axis, creating a region of electron sharing known as a pi bond. As a result, the electron density is spread out and not directly between the two nuclei, which makes the pi bond weaker compared to a sigma bond. Furthermore, sigma bonds allow for free rotation around the bond axis, while pi bonds restrict this rotation due to the overlapping p orbitals. This constraint in rotation introduces additional instability to pi bonds, and therefore they tend to be weaker than sigma bonds. - In response to the second question, \\"What are pi bonds?\\": Pi bonds are a type of covalent bond that occur when two adjacent atoms share a pair of electrons in the overlapping of unhybridized parallel p orbitals. They can be found in double or triple bonds, alongside sigma bonds. In double bonds, there is one sigma bond and one pi bond, and in triple bonds, there is one sigma bond and two pi bonds. The electron density in pi bonds is distributed above and below the bond axis, and these bonds are characterized by their side-by-side overlap. In contrast to sigma bonds, pi bonds do not allow for free rotation around the bond axis as the parallel p orbitals must maintain their overlap for the pi bond to exist. Pi bonds are generally weaker than sigma bonds due to the nature of their side-by-side overlap and constraint in rotation. One important application of pi bonds is in the study of organic chemistry, where these interactions play a crucial role in the structure and function of unsaturated hydrocarbons and other organic molecules with double or triple bonds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But here she was, at a crossroads, unsure about accepting an invitation from this seemingly ordinary man.  \\"Good, then maybe you won't mind if I join you,\\" Brad repeated, his eyes fixated on her, searching for a response. He appeared genuine, as if he truly wanted her company. Still, she couldn't help but weigh her options: step out of her comfort zone and explore potentially new experiences with Brad, or continue being stuck in the past, yearning for the one who got away.  \\"Sure, why not?\\" she replied carefully, cautiously extending an olive branch to a man she barely knew. The corners of his lips curled into a small yet warm smile that, despite its lack of fire, brought a sense of comfort and tranquility to the table.  As they spent time together, she soon discovered a sense of serenity in Brad's company. He was kind, attentive, and genuinely cared for her well-being. The more they laughed, the more she realized the spark she yearned for in his eyes was slowly flickering, trying to find a reason to ignite. They discussed their dreams, fears, and ambitions, sharing glimpses into their souls, acknowledging the vulnerabilities that made them human. With each passing day, Brad grew into a presence she couldn't ignore. In his arms, she found solace, and his steady heartbeat became the cadence to which she slept. Gone were the days of wild passion and intense longing that previously swarmed her thoughts; in its place was a quiet embrace, a slow dance of emotion that resonated within her core. But as the days turned into weeks and the bonds between them deepened, the ghost of Jack still haunted her mind. She tried to silence the memories - to smother them in Brad's calming presence - but they refused to be quelled or extinguished. There came an evening, as they danced underneath the twilight sky, when the weight of her past became too heavy to bear; the facade cracked, and a single tear escaped, tracing its somber path down her cheek. Brad noticed the change immediately, concern etching across his kind features. \\"Are you alright?\\" he inquired softly, brushing her tear away with his thumb. His gentleness touched her in a way she hadn't expected, and in that moment, she knew she couldn't keep her secret any longer. \\"Brad,\\" she whispered, \\"there's something I need to tell you.\\" As she divulged her haunted past, her soul ached at the thought of possibly losing the man who had taught her a new way to love. But as she finished, instead of anger or indifference, she was met with understanding and unwavering support. In Brad's eyes, she found not a storm, but the harbor - a place of safety where her emotions could find solace. From that day forward, they embarked on a new journey together - one that wasn't marred by the tempests of the heart but anchored in the steadiness of their love. Though the spark in Brad's eye would never quite dance the way Jack's did, it burned with a quiet intensity that spoke volumes about the depths of his love for her.  And so it was that in the end, she chose Brad - not just as a lover or a companion, but as someone who would shelter her from the storms, ignite the fire in her soul, and remind her that attraction can take on many shades, and within its undertones lie the secrets to a quieter, yet equally passionate, love story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information:  - Finchley Road, an inner city main road which runs for about , is one of the major thoroughfares of north London, England.  - Central London is the innermost part of London, England. There is no official definition of its area but its characteristics are understood to include a high density built environment, high land values, an elevated daytime population and a concentration of regionally, nationally and internationally significant organisations and facilities. Over time a number of definitions have been used to define the scope of central London for statistics, urban planning and local government.   - The Jubilee line is a London Underground line. Opened in 1979, it is the newest line on the network, although some sections of track date back to 1932 and some stations to 1879. Its western end beyond Baker Street was previously the Stanmore branch of the Bakerloo line, while the new build was completed in two major sections: initially in 1979 to Charing Cross tube station in central London; then extended in 1999 with the Jubilee Line Extension to Stratford station in east London. The later stations are larger and have special safety features, both aspects being attempts to future-proof the line. Following the extension into east London, serving areas once poorly connected to the Underground, the line has seen a huge growth in passenger numbers and is currently the third busiest on the network, with over 213 million passengers per year.  The Jubilee line is coloured silver/grey on the Tube map, to mark the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II after which the line was named.  - West Hampstead is an area in the London Borough of Camden in north-west London. Mainly defined by the railway stations of the same name, it is situated between Childs Hill to the north, Frognal and Hampstead to the north-east, Swiss Cottage to the east, South Hampstead to the south-east, Kilburn to the west and south-west, and Cricklewood to the north-west. The area is mainly residential with several small shops, restaurants, cafes, bakeries concentrated on the northern section of West End Lane and around West End Green.

This indicates","output":"This indicates a geological history involving deposition and changes in the environment over time. The layering of shale on top of limestone suggest different processes that occurred in the region during different periods. To fully understand the implications of this observation, it's important to understand the characteristics of the two rock types and how they form. Limestone is a sedimentary rock primarily composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the form of mineral calcite. It forms through the accumulation of marine organisms' shells, corals, and other calcium-rich materials in shallow, warm water environments. The formation of limestone is typically indicative of a marine environment, often in quiet-water conditions such as lagoons and shallow seas where deposition of these calcareous materials can occur without major disturbance. Limestone usually forms in layers and can exhibit both biogenic (organisms like mollusks, coral and plankton) and chemical origins (chemical precipitation and accumulation of calcium-rich minerals). On the other hand, shale is also a sedimentary rock, composed mostly of clay minerals and fine-grained fragments, like silt, mud or clay. It forms primarily in calm water environments as these tiny particles are easily erodible and can be transported long distances by water before eventually being deposited. The slow accumulation and settling of these small particles result in the formation of shale layers, often in deep marine basins or in low-energy environments like floodplains and lakes. Shale is characterized by its tendency to split into thin layers and often contains fossilized remains of the organisms or plant material that were present during its formation. Now, considering the observation that a layer of shale is found on top of a layer of limestone, several geological and environmental conditions can be inferred: 1. A change in depositional environment: A transition might have occurred in the area over time, shifting from a marine environment that supported limestone formation to a different environment characterized by deposition of fine-grained sediment like clay, silt, or mud. This could be due to various factors such as changes in sea level, climatic conditions, tectonic activity, or a combination of these factors. 2. A relative change in the energy of the depositional environment: The formation of fine-grained shale indicates that there could have been a reduction in the energy levels at this location. Calmer conditions would support the suspension of tiny particles in the water column, which would later settle down to form the shale layer. In contrast, the limestone might have formed in a higher energy environment, where calcium-rich organisms thrived in a shallow marine setting. 3. A difference in time of formation: The limestone beneath the shale represents an older geological time when the conditions were suitable for limestone deposition. As time passed, there was a change in the environment, leading to shale deposition. This geologic time gap could potentially provide information about the changes that happened on Earth during these periods based on the fossils and minerals found within each rock layer. In conclusion, a road cut showing a layer of shale on top of a layer of limestone is indicative of a transition in the depositional environment over time, possibly due to changes in sea level or climate, tectonic activity, or a shift in the energy of the depositional environment. This observation provides invaluable insights into the geological history of the area, as well as a glimpse into the paleoenvironments and paleoclimate during the time these rock layers were formed. Additionally, it can offer an opportunity to study the fossils and minerals within the layers, further enriching our understanding of Earth's history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What does a 'Vintner do?","output":"A vintner, also known as a winemaker or wine producer, is a professional involved in the intricate and multifaceted process of producing wine from grape cultivation to its eventual distribution and sale. The role of a vintner traditionally pertains to those who play a significant part in winemaking and may include an array of responsibilities such as vineyard management, grape harvesting, fermentation, blending, aging, bottling, and marketing. Here are the primary responsibilities and tasks of a vintner in greater detail: 1. Vineyard management: The cultivation of grapevines is an essential component of winemaking. A vintner is responsible for determining the location of the vineyard, selecting appropriate grape varieties, and establishing vineyard infrastructure. This includes incorporating proper trellising systems, deciding on planting densities, and developing a vineyard management plan that may involve decisions on pruning, fertilization, irrigation, and pest and disease control. 2. Grape harvesting: A vintner monitors the ripeness and maturity of the grapes, deciding when they should be picked to ensure that they possess the desired sugar, acid, and flavor profiles. The timing of harvest largely influences the character and quality of the wine produced. 3. Fermentation: The vintner oversees the fermentation process, which involves the conversion of the grape sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide by yeast. During fermentation, the vintner may control factors such as temperature, oxygen exposure, yeast strains, and must chemistry to shape the final aroma, flavor, and texture of the wine. 4. Blending: Many wines are composed of several grape varieties or multiple batches of the same variety. The vintner is responsible for blending these components, finding the appropriate balance of flavors, acidity, mouthfeel, and tannins to create a harmonious and well-structured wine. 5. Aging: A vintner determines the appropriate aging process for each wine, considering factors such as wine type, vintage, and desired characteristics. This may involve aging the wine in oak barrels or stainless steel tanks, stirring the lees (spent yeast cells), or exposing the wine to controlled amounts of oxygen to enhance complexity and mouthfeel. 6. Bottling and packaging: Once the wine has reached the desired quality, it is transferred from barrels or tanks to bottles. The vintner may oversee the bottling process and make decisions concerning bottle type, closures (corks, screw caps, or alternative closures), and label designs. 7. Quality control and tasting: Throughout the winemaking process, the vintner plays a crucial role in ensuring that the wine meets the qualitative standards. This includes tasting the wine at various stages of development and making necessary adjustments to balance flavors and improve the wine's overall character. 8. Marketing and sales: A vintner is often responsible for cultivating the brand identity and reputation of the winery or wine label. This may include creating marketing materials, setting pricing strategies, hosting tastings and events at the winery, and establishing relationships with wholesalers, retailers, and restaurant accounts. In summary, a vintner is a multifaceted professional responsible for all aspects of winemaking, from grape cultivation to wine distribution and sales. The vintner's primary goal is to produce high-quality, unique, and enjoyable wines that will resonate with consumers and contribute to the overall success of their wine brand."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But then these thrill-seekers high up in the northern Italian Alps aren't just anybody. They are members of a group of extreme athletes who have travelled to take part in the International Highline Meeting  in Monte Piana, Italy. The inaugural meeting took place in 2012, when Monte Piana was identified as a great place for the sport, easily accessible and with a glorious past and a fairy tale atmosphere. The highliners came together for a week to practice their sport in harmony with nature and without mutual showdown, and it was such a success that now the meeting takes place annually. There are seemingly no end of daredevils who like nothing better than to take up the challenges posed by highwire walking. From natural geographical features such as waterfalls and gorges, to man-made objects such as skyscrapers and suspension bridges, tightrope walkers have attempted to walk across them all - with varying degrees of success. It's a physical accomplishment which is not for the the faint of heart. Not at that altitude anyway. Perhaps they are secretly trying to emulate that great high wire walker Jean Francois Gravelet, alias Charles Blondin, of France, who made the earliest crossing of the Niagara Falls on a three-inch rope  1,100ft long and 160ft above the Falls in 1859. Blondin thereafter made each crossing of the Falls in a different manner: blindfolded; trundling a wheelbarrow; on stilts, once with a man on his back, and once and sitting down halfway to make an omelette. These guys look like cooking a few eggs while they chill out in hammocks wouldn't be far beyond them. Scroll down for video. Just chill out man: A guitarist strums a tune while all around him the high wire experts relax. But how did he get the guitar there? Come join! A highline walker heads towards his compadres who rest in a hammock on webbing stretched between rocks in the Italian Alps. Clingon: An extreme athlete makes the walk across a wire strung between the Italian Alps thousands of feet above ground level. Nearly there: After his long walk across this tightrope enthusiast is almost at the other side. Now get back up there: Losing your footing results in the inevitable, but a small safety rope stops this high wire enthusiast from plummeting to his death. Easy does it: A female highliner walks the line strung between rocks in the Alps as part of the gathering near Misurina in northern Italy.

Highliners tighten the webbings between rocks so they can continue to try new routes across the gorge. That's fairly high! This shot shows just how far above the ground these thrill seekers are as they nonchalantly walk across the webbings. Then three came along all at once: Highliners chat to each other, strung hundreds of feet above the ground.

You will receive half of the purchase price listed on the deed card when you sell the house back to the bank.  You can sell on your turn or between other player’s turns. You must sell houses in even numbers the same way they were bought. You can receive half go the deed price for the hotel or trade it in for houses equaling the same value. For instance a hotel can be sold to the bank and you can receive 4 houses from the bank to put on that property. You can sell sites, airports and utilities to other players to gain money.  The price they pay you is any amount agreed on by both parties.  Sites can’t be sold if there are buildings on any of the sites in that color group.  You must first sell those properties to the bank. You cannot sell houses or hotels to other players, only the bank. Summary:","output":"In this game, you can buy properties, utilities, and airports, then charge other players for using them, and you can sell them too, but sometimes you need to sell buildings back to the bank before selling properties to someone else."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is an article: Ohio will use an untried dose of two drugs to put to death a man who raped and killed his girlfriend's three-year-old daughter, the state prisons agency said on Monday. A warden determined that the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility doesn't have enough pentobarbital, the drug Ohio used until its manufacturer put it off-limits for executions, a Department of Rehabilitation and Correction spokeswoman, JoEllen Smith, said in an email. Instead, the state will use an intravenous combination of midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller, in the 14 November execution of Ronald Phillips. Those drugs are included in Ohio's untested backup execution method, which requires them to be injected directly into an inmate's muscle. No state has put a prisoner to death with those drugs in any fashion. Phillips, 40, was sentenced to death for killing Sheila Marie Evans in 1993, after a long period of abusing her. Ohio's revamped execution policy calls for the state to try to buy specialty batches of pentobarbital from compounding pharmacies, which mix individual doses of drugs for specific patients. If that fails, the policy calls for the use of the two-drug approach. A plan by Georgia to use a specialty batch of pentobarbital has been put on hold by a federal lawsuit challenging the state prison agency's refusal to identify the compounding pharmacy that provided the drug. The lawsuit also questions the drug's safety and effectiveness. Compounding pharmacies are under increased scrutiny following a 2012 meningitis outbreak which killed more than 60 people and sickened hundreds and was linked to contaminated ingredients at the New England Compounding Center in Massachusetts. Phillips' lawyers have pushed for mercy, arguing that he was raped and beaten by his late father as a child and grew up in a chaotic, filthy environment. The state says Phillips long denied suffering such abuse and raised it only as his execution became imminent.

The suit positions Microsoft as a champion of its customers’ privacy and draws attention to a legal process many may not be aware of.      “Most people do think of their email as their personal property, wherever it happens to reside,” said A. Michael Froomkin, a law professor at the University of Miami. “But there is a disconnect between behavior and expectations and the statute. And Microsoft is inviting a court to bring the law in line with people’s expectations.”      Beyond image-burnishing, the suit is a pragmatic attempt to move away from litigating cases one by one, which is costly and time-consuming.      “Microsoft is going on offense, but they’re kind of forced into it,” Mr. Froomkin said.      Judges grant the secrecy orders. Microsoft sees only the warrant for the information demanded and not the argument made by the prosecutors to justify a gag order. But the Microsoft legal team looked at the high percentage of secrecy orders granted in the year and a half through March of this year, and concluded that prosecutors often relied on a vague standard that there was a “reason to believe” that disclosure might hinder an investigation.      Microsoft, Mr. Smith said, “readily recognizes that nondisclosure orders are appropriate and necessary” when there is a risk of endangering a person’s life or that crucial evidence may be destroyed, for example. “What concerns us is the low standard the government has to bear and the absence of a time limit,” Mr. Smith added.      About two-thirds of the secrecy orders Microsoft received in the span it audited had no time limits. In the physical world, so-called sneak-and-peek warrants for secret searches are granted to look at documents without notifying a target. But most secrecy orders delay notification for a fixed period of time, typically 30 to 90 days, and detailed evidence is required for any extensions.      Microsoft, Mr. Smith said, has talked to other major tech companies, and others may join with briefs in support of Microsoft. ||||| Microsoft sued the Justice Department today, challenging the constitutionality of the gag orders issued by the government that prevent tech companies from informing their customers when their data is accessed as part of an investigation.      The suit challenges a provision in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) that allows courts to force Microsoft and other companies that offer cloud storage to stay silent when they turn over customer data to the government. Microsoft claims that these gag orders violate customers’ right to know when the government searches their property, and the company’s right to communicate freely with its customers.      Written 30 years ago, before cloud storage was as common as it is today, ECPA gives the government legal cover to access data stored in the cloud without notifying its owner. “The government,” Microsoft argues in its lawsuit, “has exploited the transition to cloud computing as a means of expanding its power to conduct secret investigations.”      Microsoft claims that, between September 2014 and March 2016, it has received 5,624 federal requests for customer data. Of those requests, 2,576 were accompanied by a gag order, prohibiting Microsoft from informing its customers that their information was being accessed by the government.      Although some of the secrecy orders came with a time limit, after which Microsoft could tell its customers about the intrusion, the majority did not — meaning that Microsoft could never divulge that the search had taken place. In its suit, Microsoft singles out its Outlook.com and and Office365 as products that are frequently targeted by the government.      “These twin developments—the increase in government demands for online data and the simultaneous increase in secrecy—have combined to undermine confidence in the privacy of the cloud and have impaired Microsoft’s right to be transparent with its customers, a right guaranteed by the First Amendment,” Microsoft states in its suit.      The lawsuit comes one day after the House Judiciary Committee voted unanimously on the Email Privacy Act, a bill that aims to reform ECPA.      Update: The ACLU praised Microsoft’s lawsuit and called on Congress to take up ECPA reform, specifically focusing on the gag order issues raised by Microsoft. “If Congress fails to include those changes as it considers ECPA reform, then the courts should step in, including in Microsoft’s case, to end the government’s constitutional failure to provide notice,” said ACLU staff attorney Alex Abdo. ||||| SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has sued the U.S. government for the right to tell its customers when a federal agency is looking at their emails, the latest in a series of clashes over privacy between the technology industry and Washington.      Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella delivers the keynote address during the Microsoft Build 2016 Developer Conference in San Francisco, California in this March 30, 2016, file photo. REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach/Files      The lawsuit, filed on Thursday in federal court in Seattle, argues that the government is violating the U.S. Constitution by preventing Microsoft from notifying thousands of customers about government requests for their emails and other documents.      The government’s actions contravene the Fourth Amendment, which establishes the right for people and businesses to know if the government searches or seizes their property, the suit argues, and Microsoft’s First Amendment right to free speech.      The Department of Justice is reviewing the filing, spokeswoman Emily Pierce said.      Microsoft’s suit focuses on the storage of data on remote servers, rather than locally on people’s computers, which Microsoft says has provided a new opening for the government to access electronic data.      Using the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), the government is increasingly directing investigations at the parties that store data in the so-called cloud, Microsoft says in the lawsuit. The 30-year-old law has long drawn scrutiny from technology companies and privacy advocates who say it was written before the rise of the commercial Internet and is therefore outdated.      “People do not give up their rights when they move their private information from physical storage to the cloud,” Microsoft says in the lawsuit. It adds that the government “has exploited the transition to cloud computing as a means of expanding its power to conduct secret investigations.”      Related Coverage Microsoft lawsuit against government relies on speech, privacy rights      SURVEILLANCE BATTLE      The lawsuit represents the newest front in the battle between technology companies and the U.S. government over how much private businesses should assist government surveillance.      By filing the suit, Microsoft is taking a more prominent role in that battle, dominated by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in recent months due to the government’s efforts to get the company to write software to unlock an iPhone used by one of the shooters in a December massacre in San Bernardino, California.      Apple, backed by big technology companies including Microsoft, had complained that cooperating would turn businesses into arms of the state.      “Just as Apple was the company in the last case and we stood with Apple, we expect other tech companies to stand with us,” Microsoft’s Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a phone interview after the suit was filed.      One security expert questioned Microsoft’s motivation and timing. Its lawsuit was “one hundred percent motivated by business interests” and timed to capitalize on new interest in customer privacy issues spurred in part by Apple’s dispute, said D.J. Rosenthal, a former White House cyber security official in the Obama administration.      As Microsoft’s Windows and other legacy software products are losing some traction in an increasingly mobile and Internet-centric computing environment, the company’s cloud-based business is taking on more importance. Chief Executive Satya Nadella’s describes Microsoft’s efforts as “mobile first, cloud first.”      Slideshow (2 Images)      Its customers have been asking the company about government surveillance, Smith said, suggesting that the issue could hurt Microsoft’s ability to win or keep cloud customers.      In its complaint, Microsoft says over the past 18 months it has received 5,624 legal orders under the ECPA, of which 2,576 prevented Microsoft from disclosing that the government is seeking customer data through warrants, subpoenas and other requests. Most of the ECPA requests apply to individuals, not companies, and provide no fixed end date to the secrecy provision, Microsoft said.      Microsoft and other companies won the right two years ago to disclose the number of government demands for data they receive. This case goes farther, requesting that it be allowed to notify individual businesses and people that the government is seeking information about them.      Increasingly, U.S. companies are under pressure to prove they are helping protect consumer privacy. The campaign gained momentum in the wake of revelations by former government contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 that the government routinely conducted extensive phone and Internet surveillance to a much greater degree than believed.      Late last year, after Reuters reported that Microsoft had not alerted customers, including leaders of China’s Tibetan and Uigher minorities, that their email was compromised by hackers operating from China, Microsoft said publicly it would adopt a policy of telling email customers when it believed their email had been hacked by a government.      The company’s lawsuit on Thursday comes a day after a U.S. congressional panel voted unanimously to advance a package of reforms to the ECPA.      Last-minute changes to the legislation removed an obligation for the government to notify a targeted user whose communications are being sought. Instead, the bill would require disclosure of a warrant only to a service provider, which retains the right to voluntarily notify users, unless a court grants a gag order.      It is unclear if the bill will advance through the Senate and become law this year.      Separately, Microsoft is fighting a U.S. government warrant to turn over data held in a server in Ireland, which the government argues is lawful under another part of the ECPA. Microsoft argues the government needs to go through a procedure outlined in a legal-assistance treaty between the U.S. and Ireland.      Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) is fighting a separate battle in federal court in Northern California over public disclosure of government requests for information on users.      The case is Microsoft Corp v United States Department of Justice et al in the United States District Court, Western District of Washington, No. 2:16-cv-00537. ||||| Sure, Microsoft's lawsuit aims to protect civil liberties, but the company says it also wants to ensure it can continue to sell products that its customers can trust. The company argues that the government has placed it under an unlimited gag order, forcing it to refrain from informing customers when the authorities request emails and other information. And that the gag order violates the free speech protections of the First Amendment.      Microsoft says it understands there are times when secrecy is needed so that a suspect doesn't destroy evidence or further jeopardize an investigation. However, some of the requests prohibit from ever telling a customer the government accessed their data.      \\"Based on the many secrecy orders we have received, we question whether these orders are grounded in specific facts that truly demand secrecy,\\" explained president and chief legal officer Brad Smith. \\"To the contrary, it appears that the issuance of secrecy orders has become too routine.\\"      The company is no stranger to battles with the US government over customer privacy and security. In 2014, for example, Microsoft resisted a demand to seize offshore email accounts stored at a data center in Ireland. Redmond is not alone in the fight for more transparency when it comes to government requests, either. Both Google and Twitter want to be able to disclose more information on the number of national security letters it receives. Twitter filed a lawsuit in 2014, asking a court to declare the government's restrictions on what it's able to disclose in transparency reports a violation of the First Amendment. ||||| SEATTLE—Microsoft Corp. sued the Justice Department on Thursday, saying it’s unconstitutional for the government to bar tech companies from telling customers when federal agents have examined their data.

In 1973, during the Yom Kippur War, an Israeli A-4 Skyhawk jet carrying a nuclear weapon is shot down.29 years later, in 2002, a Syrian scrap collector uncovers a large unexploded bomb buried in a field within the Golan Heights. He sells it to a South African black market arms trafficker named Olson (Feore), who recognizes it as the nuclear bomb that was lost during the war. He then sells it to a secretive far-right cabal seeking to impose a fascist world order, led by Austrian billionaire and Neo-Nazi Richard Dressler (Bates). Dressler's aim is to transform Europe into a united fascist superstate. He intends to start a nuclear war between the United States and Russia that will devastate them both.CIA analyst Jack Ryan (Affleck) is summoned by Director William Cabot (Freeman) to accompany him to Russia to meet President Nemerov (Hinds). In Moscow, Cabot and Ryan are allowed to examine a Russian nuclear weapons facility as prescribed by the START treaty, where Ryan notices the absence of three scientists listed on the facility's roster. Cabot sends Special Activities Division operative John Clark (Schreiber) to Russia to investigate the missing scientists. Clark tracks the missing scientists to a former Soviet military facility in Ukraine, where Cabot suspects they are building a secret nuclear weapon that Russia could use without any way to trace it back to them.Ryan and his colleagues discern that a crate from the facility in Ukraine was flown to the Canary Islands, then sent to Baltimore on a cargo ship. Ryan warns Cabot, who is attending a football game in Baltimore with the President, about a bomb threat being in play. The President is evacuated before the bomb detonates, but the city is wrecked by the ensuing shock wave. To escalate the situation, a corrupt Russian Air Force general who has been paid by Dressler sends Tu-22M Backfires to attack a U.S. aircraft carrier operating in the North Sea.Ryan learns from the radiation assessment team that the isotopic signature from the nuclear blast pinpoints it as having been manufactured at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina in 1968; evidence which would seem to exonerate the Russians. In Syria, Clark tracks down Ghazi, one of the men who found the bomb, now dying of radiation exposure. He tells Clark that he sold the bomb to Olson, who lives in Damascus. Ryan's colleagues at Langley infiltrate Olson's computer and download files that implicate Dressler as the person who bought the plutonium and who is behind the Baltimore attack.Ryan is able to reach the National Military Command Center in the Pentagon and get a message to Nemerov, saying that he knows that Russia was not behind the attack, while also asking Nemerov to stand down his forces as a show of good faith. Nemerov agrees to do so as President Fowler follows suit. The participants in the conspiracy, including Dressler, are later assassinated.

While on a tour of works at Cardiff, he caught a chill and returned to London, half-paralysed, where he lay dying for some three weeks. Among his last visitors were Oscar Wilde and James Whistler. He was buried in the tomb he designed for his mother at West Norwood, London. On his death, John Starling Chapple, Burges's office manager and close associate for more than twenty years, wrote \\"a constant relationship ... with one of the brightest ornaments of the profession has rendered the parting most severe.

Cynthia was feeling a bit lethargic, while Angela was full of energy and raring to go. Not wanting to waste any more of the beautiful summer day, they decided to hit the local farmer's market to find something delicious for Cynthia to eat before they started their activities. As they strolled through the bustling market, filled with delicious aromas and colorful fruits and vegetables, Angela couldn't help but continually sample the various offerings. She munched on a juicy peach, sipped on a fresh and tangy lemonade, and savored a delectable piece of artisanal cheese. Meanwhile, Cynthia's hunger grew. She finally spotted a food vendor selling her favorite dish: a warm and flaky pastry filled with a delightful mixture of spinach and feta cheese. Cynthia eagerly purchased one, and as she took her first bite, her energy levels seemed to immediately revive. With their appetites satisfied and their spirits lifted, the two friends chatted excitedly about their plans for the day. They had both recently taken up hiking as a new hobby and decided to tackle a nearby trail that boasted beautiful vistas and a stunning waterfall. Wanting to make the most out of their day, they picked up a few more snacks – fresh fruits, some granola, and a handful of protein bars – to fuel their adventure. Pumped and ready to conquer the great outdoors, Cynthia and Angela made their way to the trailhead. The path was steep and winding, but the vibrant green foliage and the gentle sounds of the rustling leaves filled them with a sense of calm. They trudged along the rocky trail, stopping now and then to admire the scenery, breathe in the fresh mountain air, and snap some photo memories to cherish later on. Their energy levels briefly waned as the ascent became more challenging, but they encouraged one another to press forward, knowing that the reward of the breathtaking waterfall lay ahead. Soon enough, they reached the top, greeted by the thunderous roar of the cascading water and a refreshing mist that danced through the air. They found a secluded spot nearby where they could rest and enjoy a well-deserved picnic with their farmer's market purchases. As they sat side by side on a large rock by the waterfall, the friends felt a sense of accomplishment in conquering the trail and gratitude for the beautiful wilderness that surrounded them. They enjoyed their meal, their conversation effortlessly drifting between shared memories and future dreams. With the sun beginning to descend in the sky, Cynthia and Angela knew they couldn't linger for too long. They cleaned up their picnic area, ensuring they left no garbage behind, and started their descent back down the trail. Although their morning meals had differed, they now felt equal in their weariness and satisfaction. By the time they reached the bottom and said their goodbyes for the day, one thing was clear: Cynthia would never skip breakfast again. And as for Angela, she had learned that sharing a sense of camaraderie and a deep appreciation for nature with a friend was one of the most rewarding feelings life has to offer. From that day on, they made it their tradition to embark on many more adventures together. Whether it was hiking a new trail, exploring a charming town, or simply trying a new dish at a local cafe, Cynthia and Angela learned the true value of friendship and the importance of seizing each day with wholehearted enthusiasm."},{"instruction":"Kamiah High School -  Kamiah High School is a four-year public secondary school in Kamiah Idaho the only high school in Kamiah School District #304.

Summarize this article: The Public Accounts Committee said the NHS was struggling to meet waiting time standards and had reduced resources. UK cancer survival rates, while improving, were poor compared with the rest of Europe, the report said. NHS England said it was already working on a new five-year strategy. The report, published following evidence from a number of cancer charities and experts, looked at what progress had been made in improving cancer services and outcomes in England. Margaret Hodge, who chairs the committee, said: \\"With more than one in three people developing cancer in their lifetime, cancer touches the lives of all of us at some point, and the Department of Health spends over Â£6.7bn on cancer services a year. \\"That is why it is so concerning that the Department of Health and NHS England have lost momentum in the drive to improve cancer services in the last two years. \\"More and more people are getting cancer but the resources available to support improvement have gone down.\\" The report said that despite a good record in improving cancer services, progress had dipped recently. Cancer waiting time targets, for example, had been missed. The NHS target that 85% of cancer patients should be treated within 62 days of being urgently referred by their GP was missed for the first three-quarters of 2014. As a result, 5,500 patients had to wait longer than 62 days for treatment between July and September last year. Two other cancer waiting time targets were also missed at times during 2014, the report said. It also said it was not good enough that in the UK nearly a third of people died within a year of a cancer diagnosis and about half did not survive for five years. The committee also had issues with \\"poor\\" survival rates and access to treatment for people over 65. Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, said the NHS was helping more people than ever survive cancer. But he acknowledged it was time to take \\"a fresh look at how we can do even better across the whole patient journey\\". \\"This is why we have already established an independent taskforce to develop a new cancer strategy for the next five years.\\" The taskforce, announced by NHS England in January, will focus on better prevention, faster diagnosis and better treatment, care and aftercare. Sarah Woolnough, executive director of policy at Cancer Research UK, said: \\"It is depressing that too many patients are waiting longer than they should for their diagnosis and effective treatment. \\"We hope the report will urgently catalyse NHS England, the Department of Health and others charged with providing cancer care to deliver the best for all patients, no matter their age, the cancer they suffer from or where they live. \\"All patients deserve the best treatment and care and many are not currently receiving it.\\" She said more people were surviving cancer thanks to the ability to diagnose patients earlier and treat them effectively. But with an ageing population, more people would inevitably develop cancer. To continue to improve cancer services, the right leadership, more investment and better planning was needed now, she said. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: \\"This report makes devastating reading for David Cameron and is damning proof of his mismanagement of the NHS. Under the Tories, cancer care has gone backwards and patients are missing out on the treatment they need.\\" A Department of Health spokesperson said an estimated 12,000 extra people would survive cancer by the end of 2015. \\"We have invested an extra Â£750m on cancer services, including early diagnosis and innovative radiotherapy.\\"","output":"A report by the Public Accounts Committee has found that the UK's National Health Service (NHS) is struggling to meet waiting time standards for cancer patients, with resources being reduced.

Did is characterized by the presence of alternate identities, often referred to as alters. These identities are often complex, with their own unique histories and physical and behavioral traits.","output":"When interacting with someone who has Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), it is essential to establish a respectful and empathetic approach by keeping some key points in mind. 1. Educate yourself about DID: To better understand the person, educate yourself about the symptoms and challenges faced by those with DID. Familiarize yourself with the concept of alters and how individuals with DID experience their lives. Understand that DID is a reaction to severe and traumatic experiences, and it is a coping mechanism that allowed the person to survive those events. 2. Address the person with respect: When engaging with someone with DID, always address them with respect and dignity, irrespective of which alter is present. Do not make fun or belittle the person or their alters, as their experiences are their reality. 3. Recognize their various alters: Understand that the person with DID may switch between alters during different situations. Recognize their different alters and refer to them by their preferred names, showing that you acknowledge and respect their unique identities. 4. Establish boundaries: Just like with any other relationship, make sure to establish and maintain healthy boundaries. It is essential to discuss communication preferences, personal space, and limitations early in the interaction to ensure a healthy relationship. 5. Offer support, but don’t push: Offer emotional support and encouragement when needed, but do not impose your will on the person or their alters. They may require time and space to process their emotions and experiences. Be patient and understanding of their needs. 6. Respect their triggers: It is crucial to recognize and avoid discussing certain topics or situations that may trigger distressing memories or switch alters for the person with DID. Tread with caution and always be sensitive when addressing these issues. 7. Facilitate integration: Integration, or the process of merging alters into a single identity, may be a goal for some individuals with DID. If the person you are interacting with is actively working towards integration, provide reassurance, and support their efforts. But, do not force them to integrate if they are unwilling or not ready to do so. 8. Encourage professional help: Encourage the person to seek appropriate professional help, like psychotherapy, to better understand and manage their DID. Offer to assist them on their journey to find the right therapist or support group if needed. 9. Communicate openly: Maintain open and honest communication with the person, and encourage them to share their thoughts and feelings without judgment. Be a good listener and offer guidance when necessary. 10. Be patient and adaptable: Understand that interacting with someone who has DID may be challenging and require patience, flexibility, and adaptability on your part. In conclusion, when interacting with someone who has DID, it is vital to educate yourself about the disorder, address the individual with respect, and take an empathetic approach to establish a meaningful relationship. Understanding and openness will go a long way in making the person feel accepted, valued, and supported."},{"instruction":"A friend asked me to answer this question: What does the woman from the Blue World need to return home?, using the article: One evening, Cleveland Heep, who became the superintendent of a Philadelphia apartment complex after his family was murdered, discovers Story, a naiad-like character (called a \\"Narf\\") from the Blue World, in his building's pool, immediately rescuing her from an attack by a \\"Scrunt\\", a grass-covered, wolf-like creature that hides by flattening its body against the turf.

Objective: how to make an herbed egg sandwich Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"To fully answer this question, I will first describe the process of making an herbed egg sandwich and then analyze the physical reasoning involved in various steps. How to make an Herbed Egg Sandwich: Ingredients: 1. 2 slices of bread 2. 1-2 large eggs 3. 2 tbsp unsalted butter 4. Fresh herbs (e.g., parsley, chives, or basil) 5. Salt and pepper 6. Cheese (optional) 7. Mayonnaise and mustard (optional) 8. Lettuce and tomato (optional) Instructions: 1. Prepare the ingredients: Finely chop the fresh herbs and set aside. If you're adding cheese, lettuce, and tomato, slice the cheese, wash the lettuce, and slice the tomato. Set these ingredients aside as well. 2. Crack the eggs: In a small bowl, crack the eggs and beat them with a fork or whisk until the yolks and whites are combined. Add the chopped herbs, salt, and pepper to the beaten eggs and whisk again to incorporate the herbs evenly. 3. Cook the eggs: In a non-stick frying pan or skillet, melt the butter over low to medium heat. Then, pour the egg mixture into the pan. Cook the eggs gently. If you wish, fold the cooked egg mixture in half or make it an omelette-style by adding the cheese on top of the egg mixture before folding. Let the cheese melt while the eggs cook through. Once the eggs are fully cooked, remove the frying pan from the heat. 4. Toast the bread: While the eggs are cooking, toast the bread slices in a toaster or toaster oven until they are golden brown and crispy. Alternatively, you can use the same frying pan used for the eggs, adding more butter to toast the bread slices on each side. 5. Assemble the sandwich: Spread mayonnaise and mustard on one side of each slice of bread if desired. Place the cooked herbed eggs onto one slice of bread, followed by the cheese if you haven't added it to the eggs already. Add lettuce and tomato slices if you choose to use them. Finally, top the sandwich with the second slice of bread. 6. Serve immediately: Cut the sandwich into halves or quarters, according to your preference, and serve immediately. You can enjoy the herbed egg sandwich as a hearty breakfast or a delicious lunch. Now that we have discussed how to make an herbed egg sandwich, it is essential to consider the naive physics reasoning involved in the process. Naive physics refers to the intuitive understanding of the principles guiding objects' behavior in the physical world. The most significant naive physics principles are cooking the eggs evenly, appropriate heat management to avoid overcooking or burning the ingredients, and the proper assembly of the sandwich to maintain its structural integrity. One sound naive physics reasoning aspect is gently cooking the eggs on low to medium heat, which ensures that the eggs are cooked evenly and prevents them from overcooking or burning. Another sound reasoning is assembling the sandwich in an orderly fashion, which involves adding the condiments, eggs, cheese, lettuce, and tomato slices in a way that maintains the sandwich's structural integrity. This makes it easier to hold, eat, and enhances the overall eating experience. In conclusion, the process of making an herbed egg sandwich involves sound naive physics reasoning with careful heat management and assembly techniques. Following the steps and ingredients described above will result in a delicious and satisfying herbed egg sandwich."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

His family were very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city. Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for showing goods to attract people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends ( ) for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said five cents each. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared. Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store., selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half. By 1919, Woolworth had over 1000 stores in the US and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always run his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: \\" The customer is always right.\\" A:","output":"What was the key lesson Frank Woolworth learned before becoming successful in his retail business?

Help as much as you can. Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Can you believe your eyes? A recent experiment suggests that the answer to that question may depend on your age. Martin Doherty, a psychologist at the University of Stirling in Scotland, led the team of scientists. In this experiment, Doherty and his team tested the perception  of some people, using pictures of some orange circles. The researchers showed the same pictures to two groups of people. The first group included 151 children aged 4 to 10, and the second group included 24 adults aged 18 to 25. The first group of pictures showed two circles alone on a white background. One of the circles was larger than the other, and these people were asked to identify the larger one. Four-year-olds identified the correct circle 79 percent of the time. Adults identified the correct circle 95 percent of the time. Next, both groups were shown a picture where the orange circles, again of different sizes, were surrounded by gray circles. Here's where the trick lies in. In some of the pictures, the smaller orange circle was surrounded by even smaller gray circles -- making the orange circle appear larger than the other orange circle, which was the real larger one. And the larger orange circle was surrounded by even bigger gray circles -- so it appeared to be smaller than the real smaller orange circle. When young children aged 4 to 6 looked at these tricky pictures, they weren't fooled -- they were still able to find the bigger circle with roughly the same accuracy as before. Older children and adults, on the other hand, did not do as well. Older children often identified the smaller circle as the larger one, and adults got it wrong most of the time. As children get older, Doherty said, their brains may develop the ability to identify visual context. In other words, they will begin to process the whole picture at once: the tricky gray circles, as well as the orange circle in the middle. As a result, they're more likely to fall for this kind of visual trick. Question: According to the passage, we can know that  _  . Answer: OPTIONS: (i). a smaller orange circle appears bigger on a white background. (ii). an orange circle appears bigger than a gray one of the same size. (iii). a circle surrounded by other circles looks bigger than its real size. (iv). a circle surrounded by bigger ones looks smaller than its real size. The answer is:","output":"(iii). a circle surrounded by other circles looks bigger than its real size.

Efforts to reform the Afghan National Police force have been stymied by \\"corruption and lack of political will,\\" and police are wrongly being used to help fight the insurgency instead of crime, an independent research group said in a report. An Afghan policeman guards the scene of a suicide attack in Kabul on November 27. \\"The U.S. military ... still mainly sees the police as an auxiliary security force rather than an enforcer of the law,\\" the International Crisis Group concluded in a report posted Thursday on its Web site. \\"Too much emphasis is still placed on using the police to fight the insurgency rather than crime. \\"The Afghan National Police (ANP) is ill-equipped for this role, and has been targeted by the Taliban, with 1,200 killed in 2007 and a similar toll expected in 2008,\\" the group added. The Taliban will be on the agenda during the first visit by Pakistan's president to Afghanistan on Friday. The talks come amid ongoing warfare and tension along the Afghan-Pakistan border. Some of the Taliban militants conducting attacks in Afghanistan have been based in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province and nearby tribal regions. \\"The goal of the Afghan government and the international community should be a national police force able to uphold the rule of law, and thereby help tackle the root causes of alienation that drive the insurgency,\\" the International Crisis Group said. The group described Afghanistan's Interior Ministry as a \\"hub of systemic corruption,\\" and accuses the department of placing \\"personal enrichment\\" above the need for improved policing. Recent leadership changes at the Interior Ministry should be used to stress that abuses will no longer be tolerated. \\"There has been little political will in Kabul or foreign capitals to tackle the power brokers who are preventing reform,\\" said Samina Ahmed, the group's South Asia project director. \\"Organized crime and lawlessness lie at the heart of much popular disillusionment and instability. Better law enforcement, including a functioning judicial system, would help counter any appeal the insurgents may hold in Afghanistan,\\" he added.

To begin with the strengths, the messaging of the campaign is clear and concise, making it easily digestible for a wide range of audiences. The slogan captures the core themes of the campaign effectively and will likely resonate with many people who share the same values and goals. Additionally, the choice of color schemes and visuals in the promotional materials is engaging, helping the campaign to stand out among its competitors. The use of social media and other digital platforms has been well-executed, allowing the campaign to connect with its target audience where they are most active. By leveraging the power of influencers and sharing a variety of content, such as videos, infographics, and testimonials, it has succeeded in generating a buzz and driving public conversation. Furthermore, the campaign's consistent engagement with supporters, which includes responding to comments, sharing user-generated content, and hosting live-stream events, has fostered a sense of community and loyalty among its followers. However, there are also some potential weaknesses that may hinder the campaign's success. First, the demographic focus might be too narrow, which could potentially limit the overall reach of the message. By not catering to a wider audience, the campaign may miss out on the opportunity to expand its supporter base and create broader awareness around its goals. Second, while the campaign has been efficient in utilizing digital platforms, there is still room for improvement in terms of traditional media. By neglecting print, radio, and television ads, it may lose out on supporters who are not as active on social media or who simply prefer other methods of receiving information. Lastly, there may be concerns surrounding the financing of the campaign. Transparent and ethical funding sources are vital for maintaining credibility in today's political climate. Thus, it is crucial that the campaign takes steps to ensure that all financial contributions are reported accurately and ethically. In conclusion, while the latest campaign demonstrates several strengths, such as a powerful message, engaging visuals, and strategic use of online platforms, it would be wise to address potential weaknesses, including broadening target demographics, increased utilization of traditional media methods, and ensuring transparency in funding. By addressing these areas, the campaign has the potential to achieve even greater success and impact in its quest to achieve its goals."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was the year of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation; Vaughan Williams's contribution was an arrangement of the Old Hundredth psalm tune, and a new setting of \\"O taste and see\\" from Psalm 34, performed at the service in Westminster Abbey. Having returned to live in London, Vaughan Williams, with Ursula's encouragement, became much more active socially and in pro bono publico activities. He was a leading figure in the Society for the Promotion of New Music, and in 1954 he set up and endowed the Vaughan Williams Trust to support young composers and promote new or neglected music. He and his wife travelled extensively in Europe, and in 1954 he visited the US once again, having been invited to lecture at Cornell and other universities and to conduct. He received an enthusiastic welcome from large audiences, and was overwhelmed at the warmth of his reception. Kennedy describes it as \\"like a musical state occasion\\".Of Vaughan Williams's works from the 1950s, Grove makes particular mention of Three Shakespeare Songs (1951) for unaccompanied chorus, the Christmas cantata Hodie (1953–1954), the Violin Sonata, and, most particularly, the Ten Blake Songs (1957) for voice and oboe, \\"a masterpiece of economy and precision\\". Unfinished works from the decade were a cello concerto and a new opera, Thomas the Rhymer. The predominant works of the 1950s were his three last symphonies. The seventh—officially unnumbered, and titled Sinfonia antartica—divided opinion; the score is a reworking of music Vaughan Williams had written for the 1948 film Scott of the Antarctic, and some critics thought it not truly symphonic. The Eighth, though wistful in parts, is predominantly lighthearted in tone; it was received enthusiastically at its premiere in 1956, given by the Hallé Orchestra under the dedicatee, Sir John Barbirolli. The Ninth, premiered at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert... The answer is:","output":"The last name of the person who received an enthusiastic welcome from large audiences, and was overwhelmed at the warmth of his reception is Williams. This detail is stated in the part that describes Vaughan Williams's activities in the 1950s. Vaughan Williams is the figure mentioned who visited the US, where he lectured at universities and conducted music. His reception there was characterized as being warmed by large audiences."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Anti-virus firm Sophos has identified numerous messages claiming to have pictures of Beckham with a woman in an enticing position. These messages are designed to pique users' curiosity and exploit their interest in celebrities or controversial content. A Trojan virus, a type of malware disguised as a harmless file or e-mail attachment, may be delivered via these enticements. When the user is persuaded to view or download the pictures, the Trojan can infiltrate their device, potentially leading to a wide range of malicious activities. These activities may include unauthorized access to the victim's personal data, modifications to the device's operating system, or using the device for subsequent cyberattacks without the user's knowledge. In this context, cyber criminals lure unsuspecting users by using Beckham's fame and the prospect of seeing potentially scandalous pictures of him. This strategy relies on social engineering tactics, where attackers manipulate user's emotions and trust. To mitigate such risks, users should be cautious when encountering messages with sensational content, especially unsolicited emails or messages from unknown sources. It is essential to keep anti-virus software and operating systems up to date to protect against the latest threats. Furthermore, users should avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unverified sources, as this can prevent the inadvertent installation of malware.

Is EMI cut the first stereo test discs using the system in 1933 (see Bell Labs Stereo Experiments of 1933) although the system was not exploited commercially until much later. a good answer to this question? Available choices: 1). yes 2). no","output":"2). No The answer you provided is not clear and could be improved for better understanding. A more detailed and long answer to the question \\"When did EMI create the first stereo discs?\\" would be: EMI (Electrical and Musical Industries Ltd.) had indeed been involved in the development of stereo sound technology since the 1930s. The company conducted several experiments and tests in cooperation with other industry pioneers, such as Bell Labs and Alan Blumlein. It is accurate that Bell Labs' stereo experiments took place in 1933 and EMI had cut some test discs using stereo technology during that period. However, it is essential to note that these tests were primarily aimed at the research and development of the new technology, and they did not lead to a commercial release in the 1930s. In the 1950s, stereo technology gained significant traction, and multiple companies were competing to establish their stereo systems in the market. EMI made a significant contribution to the development of stereo discs in 1957. The company started releasing its first stereo records in the 1958, using the Westrex \\"45/45\\" stereo cutting system. This system was developed by the Westrex Corporation (a division of the Western Electric Company) and was one of the pioneering methods for cutting stereo discs, where the lateral and vertical groove modulations represented the left and right channels of the stereo signal, respectively. In summary, EMI had been involved in stereo experiments and tests since the early 1930s, which contributed to the company's rich history in the field of stereo technology. However, it was not until 1958 that EMI started commercially releasing its first stereo records, using the Westrex \\"45/45\\" cutting system. This 1958 commercial introduction of stereo discs is an essential milestone in the history of stereo sound technology and the music industry overall."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - lower interest - raising interest rates - higher interest rates - lowering prices - save money  I believe the correct choice is \\"higher interest rates\\", here's why: The answer to this question is:","output":"The soon to be homeowner had to worry about the higher interest rates. Here's a step-by-step explanation for choosing this answer: Step 1: Identify the main concern of the question. The question focuses on a soon-to-be homeowner and their concerns in the context of fighting inflation. Step 2: Analyze the given options. The options provided are: - Lower interest - Raising interest rates - Higher interest rates - Lowering prices - Save money Step 3: Eliminate options that do not relate to inflation. Fighting inflation would typically result in changes to interest rates or prices, so we can eliminate \\"save money\\" as a viable option. Step 4: Identify the options that are relevant to homeowners. To narrow down further, we should consider which options directly impact homeowners. The options related to interest rates are more relevant to soon-to-be homeowners as they are likely to be borrowing money for their home purchase. Step 5: Determine the consequences of inflation on homeownership. Inflation typically leads to an increase in interest rates, as central banks use this as a tool to control inflation. As a result, borrowing costs for soon-to-be homeowners will increase. This means that among the given choices, \\"higher interest rates\\" and \\"raising interest rates\\" are possible options. Step 6: Select the most appropriate option that reflects the homeowner's concerns. Though both \\"higher interest rates\\" and \\"raising interest rates\\" are linked to inflation, the term \\"higher interest rates\\" better emphasizes the direct concern of the soon-to-be homeowner since it clearly highlights that they have to worry about the level of interest rates being higher than they would prefer. Therefore, the correct choice is \\"higher interest rates\\" because it directly connects to the concerns of a soon-to-be homeowner in the context of fighting inflation."},{"instruction":"Q: I heard that Addison was feeling ill, but they took the medicine too fast and it didn't sit well.

Suspect: Andrew Scott Boguslawski, 43, was charged with illegally making or possessing an explosive device after four guns and nearly 50 bombs were found in his vehicle during a traffic stop Monday. A man stopped for speeding in central Ohio was charged with illegally making or possessing an explosive device after nearly 50 bombs and four guns were discovered in his vehicle. Andrew Scott Boguslawski, 43, was arrested late New Year's Day on Interstate 70 west of Columbus. Investigators found two pistols, two rifles, 48 explosive devices and tools and materials to make additional explosives. Also inside was a remote detonating device, Assistant Madison County Prosecutor Nick Adkins said. Officials are trying to determine why the man had the cache of weapons and bombs. He is being held on 1million bond pending a court hearing Friday in Madison County. According to the state trooper who stopped him for going 85mph in a 70mph zone, Boguslawski said he had no weapons. However, the officer returned with a ticket and saw the handle of a gun between the man's knees. ‘At that point, he drew his service weapon, held the man there and called for backup,’ said Adkins.Boguslawski told authorities he has an attorney, but none was listed on the court docket. Adkins said a 1million bond set for the defendant reflected the possible risk to the public. Boguslawski was stopped on I-70 in Madison County just before midnight on New Year's Day for going about 15mph over the speed limit. Ohio State Highway Patrol Trooper William Davis asked the driver if he had any weapons in his vehicle after spotting a bumper sticker on Boguslawski's car that read: 'If you can read this, you’re in range,' The London Madison-Press reported. The 43-year-old man lied that he was unarmed, but when the trooper returned with his ticket, Boguslawski was clutching a gun with his knees. Tell-tale sign: An Ohio State Highway Patrol trooper asked Boguslawski if he had any weapons on him after spotting a bumper sticker on his car that read: 'If you can read this, you're in range' After additional officers arrived on the scene, Boguslawski's car was searched, yielding an arsenal of two pistols, two rifles, 48 explosives and bomb-making paraphernalia. 'Most concerning to me was that they found a remote detonating device,' said Adkins. According to Adkins, Boguslawski works at a training facility for Navy SEALS in Indiana. At the time of his arrest, the suspect was carrying blueprints for buildings that are part of his workplace. The prosecutor said investigators are trying to determine if Boguslawski has ties to any known terrorist organizations.","output":"1.

Question: Anna was saved by Lewis because? Movie plot title: Vantage Point Movie plot: U.S. President Henry Ashton (Hurt) attends a political summit in Salamanca, Spain, to promote an international treaty. Displayed with eight differing viewpoints, an assassination attempt on the president occurs, relayed in a time span of 23 minutes. Each time the events unfold from the beginning, a new vantage point is shown revealing additional details, which ultimately completes the story of what actually took place during the incident.[2] From the first vantage point, GNN producer Rex Brooks (Weaver), directs various media personnel from a mobile television studio as the president arrives at the gathering. Mayor De Soto (Rodriguez) delivers a short speech and then introduces the president, who is shot twice as he greets the crowd from the podium. An explosion outside the plaza soon follows. Moments later, the podium itself is destroyed by a secondary explosion, killing and injuring numerous people. As the smoke clears, GNN reporter Angie Jones (Saldana) is seen lying dead in the rubble.[2] The second vantage point follows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes (Quaid) and Kent Taylor (Fox). Barnes notices a curtain fluttering in the window of a nearby building that was allegedly vacated. He also observes American tourist Howard Lewis (Whitaker) filming the audience. After the president is shot, Barnes tackles a man rushing to the podium named Enrique (Noriega). Taylor pursues a lead to a potential assassin. Following the second explosion, Barnes barges into the GNN production studio and asks to view their footage. He calls Taylor, who reports the direction of the suspected assassin's escape route. Barnes then views an image on one of the camera's live feeds that startles him and prompts him to run out.[2] In the third vantage point, Enrique, a Spanish police officer assigned to protecting the mayor of Salamanca, sees his girlfriend Veronica (Zurer), being embraced by a stranger and overhears them speaking about meeting under an overpass.

Pour approfondir ce sujet, il est important de comprendre le contexte et les facteurs qui contribuent à ces chiffres. Le réchauffement climatique est un phénomène qui continue de s'accentuer, avec de graves conséquences sur l'environnement et la santé humaine. Les températures moyennes à travers le monde augmentent, entraînant des vagues de chaleur plus intenses et plus fréquentes. Cependant, au fur et à mesure que les températures montent, les hivers deviennent moins rigoureux, réduisant potentiellement la mortalité liée au froid. En ce qui concerne les décès dus à la chaleur, les personnes les plus vulnérables sont les personnes âgées, les enfants et ceux qui ont des problèmes de santé préexistants, comme les maladies cardiaques, les problèmes respiratoires et le diabète. Les travailleurs exposés à des environnements extrêmement chauds, comme les agriculteurs et les ouvriers du bâtiment, sont également à risque. Les vagues de chaleur peuvent provoquer divers problèmes de santé tels que la déshydratation, les coups de chaleur, l'épuisement par la chaleur, ainsi que des complications liées à des maladies préexistantes. D'un autre côté, la baisse du nombre de décès dus au froid peut sembler être une conséquence positive du réchauffement climatique. En effet, les températures moins extrêmes durant l'hiver pourraient réduire le nombre de personnes qui meurent de causes telles que l'hypothermie, les maladies respiratoires et les accidents vasculaires cérébraux liés au froid. Toutefois, il est important de tenir compte du fait que ces chiffres ne sont pas compensés par la hausse des décès liée à la chaleur. Il est également essentiel de mettre en place des mesures préventives pour faire face à ces changements de température. Des actions telles que la mise en place de systèmes d'alerte précoce, d'infrastructures adaptées, et de programmes de sensibilisation pour encourager la population à prendre les précautions nécessaires durant les périodes de températures extrêmes peuvent contribuer à minimiser les risques pour la santé. En conclusion, l'augmentation des températures mondiales aura des conséquences importantes sur la santé humaine. Les gouvernements et les communautés doivent adopter des stratégies adaptées pour faire face à ces défis et protéger les personnes les plus vulnérables face aux effets du réchauffement climatique."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Both were very sick----Ryan with brain cancer, Walter with leukemia  . Ryan, who was 3 at the time, began making silly faces at Walter and chatted about going home to change into his Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles costume. Several days later, Ryan moved to another hospital. Though they saw each other only a handful of times after that, Walter never forgot Ryan. \\"He inspired me to fight against my cancer,\\" said Walter, now 17, a football player. Then one day, Walter saw a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles shirt at a mall, which made him decide to search out Ryan. Back home, Walter typed in \\"Ryan Lake in the Hills brain cancer\\" on his computer, and a link to a Facebook page for Ryan came up. But, the news was shocking. Ryan had died on Sept. 8, 2005. He was 6. The Facebook  page  was  for  the  Ryan  Lamantia Foundation, a non-profit organization that Ryan's family formed after his death to raise money for brain cancer research. Walter left this message right away: .\\"Ryan is my hero. My trips to the hospital were always horrible, until the day I met Ryan.\\" Ryan's mom's eyes were filled with tears as she read Waiter's message. \\"We always knew Ryan was special, but to hear it from somebody else, it really means the world to us,\\" Lamantia said. Walter wasn't the only person who was greatly impressed with Ryan. \\"He was a little superhero,\\" said Wendy Stellpflug, a nurse at Children' s Memorial Hospital. \\"Ryan always kept his spirits high, even after he suffered hearing loss and experienced 14 operations.\\" \\"Ryan didn' t let his illness stop him. He always had a smile on his face,\\" said Dr. Stewart Goldman, the doctor who treated Ryan. Walter and his family have been in touch with the Lamantias for the past few weeks.

Please answer the following question: Give me the correct facts to answer this: what are historical places in new york? A:","output":"New York, known as the Empire State, has a rich history that dates back to the early colonial period. The state has been the stage for significant events, from battles during the Revolutionary War to momentous developments in art and culture. As a result, New York has numerous historical places that reflect its rich heritage. Some of the key historical sites and landmarks include: 1. Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island: The Statue of Liberty, a colossal neoclassical statue on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, is a symbol of freedom and was a gift from France to the United States in 1886. Ellis Island is the site of the former U.S. federal immigration station that processed over 12 million immigrants between 1892 and 1954. Both sites are part of the National Park Service and are accessible by ferry. 2. The National September 11 Memorial & Museum: Built on the footprint of the former World Trade Center, this memorial and museum honors the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Two reflecting pools mark the site where the Twin Towers once stood, and the museum contains numerous exhibits detailing the events of 9/11 and its aftermath. 3. New York State Capitol: Located in Albany, this historic building houses the New York State Legislature and the governor's office. Completed in 1899, the Capitol features Victorian architecture, symbolic carvings, and a renowned art collection. 4. Old Fort Niagara: Located on the eastern bank of the Niagara River, Old Fort Niagara has been an essential strategic location since the 1600s. The fort has witnessed several sieges and battles, particularly during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. Today, it serves as a living history museum. 5. Seneca Falls: This town is considered the birthplace of the American Women's Rights Movement. The Seneca Falls Convention, which took place in 1848, was the first women's rights convention in the United States. Visitors can explore the Women's Rights National Historical Park, including the Elizabeth Cady Stanton House and the Wesleyan Chapel, where the convention was held. 6. George Eastman Museum: Located in Rochester, this museum is dedicated to the life and work of George Eastman, the founder of the Eastman Kodak Company. The museum comprises Eastman's historic mansion, gorgeous gardens, and extensive collections related to photography and film. 7. Hyde Park: This historic site in the Hudson Valley is the location of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Home and Presidential Library, as well as the Vanderbilt Mansion. Both estates are open to the public and showcase the lifestyles of the wealthy and influential families in the early 20th century. 8. Saratoga National Historical Park: This park in Stillwater commemorates the site of the pivotal Battle of Saratoga during the Revolutionary War. The American victory here is considered a turning point in the war, leading to increased support from European allies. 9. Harriet Tubman Home: Located in Auburn, this historic site includes the residence of Harriet Tubman, the brave African American woman who guided many enslaved people to freedom via the Underground Railroad. The site also has the Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged, which she established to care for elderly African Americans. 10. Brooklyn Bridge: Completed in 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge is not only an iconic symbol of New York City but also a significant historic landmark in American engineering. Spanning the East River, the bridge connects Manhattan and Brooklyn and was the world's first steel-wire suspension bridge. These historical places represent just a fraction of New York's rich heritage, but they showcase the diversity and significance of the state's role in shaping American history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, determining whether it will be the longest standing fire lookout tower in the United States or not cannot be conclusively answered based on the information provided.

There could be other fire lookout towers in the country, either within or outside of the Catskill Mountains, that may already hold a more extended operational record. Likewise, upcoming maintenance, renovation, or eventual replacement of these towers could affect their longevity.

He does imitations of famous people and accents, and has some truly awful lines. Whoopi blames him for farting and he says, \\"It's not my butt trumpet!\\" Wow! What a puerile, immature line, even for a kid's movie of this caliber. Whoopi is also annoying and rude to everyone. I was hoping Teddy would bite her head off the entire length of the film. This movie never knew what it wanted to be. When the futuristic scenes and action occur, there is no comedy or humor. In any non-action scenes, the characters try to be as funny as they can, which just results in nonstop straight faced boredome. The action scenes don't work as they're too weird and not violent enough, and as stated earlier, the comedy is just a bunch of massacred jokes. Nothing ever works here. Having a dinosaur/human detective duo seems like a pretty original movie, if nothing else. Nope! This movie is a huge rip-off of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Just replace dinosaurs with cartoons, and set it in the future, and it's the exact same plot. A man is killed, a dinosaur is killed. A dinosaur and detective solve the murder, a toon and detective solve the murder. The bad guys in Roger Rabbit are Christopher Lloyd and weasels. The bad guys here are a guy who sounds like Christopher Lloyd and guys who act just like the weasels. The club scene in Roger Rabbit where Jessica Rabbit walks down the stage is imitated with dinosaurs. This is a huge rip-off of a much better movie! Overall, this is a bad movie, not even deserving of it's straight to VHS stature. My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 90 mins. PG for mild violence, language and crude humor.

A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the given paragraph, we cannot definitively determine which friend received more vaccinations. The paragraph only states that Nigel was more prone to viral infections and contracted HIV, and Manny had a bacterial infection. Vaccination history is not mentioned for either friend.  Vaccinations are typically used to protect against viral and bacterial infections by prompting an immune response in the person receiving the vaccine. This helps the person's immune system recognize and fight off the pathogen more effectively if they come into contact with it in the future.  It is important to note that there is currently no vaccine available for HIV. However, there are several vaccinations available for some bacterial and viral infections. Although we cannot determine from the paragraph provided who received more vaccinations, we do know that Nigel did not receive a vaccine for HIV, as it does not exist. For Manny, it depends on the type of bacterial infection he contracted. There are vaccines available for some bacterial infections like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Neisseria meningitidis, which can cause pneumonia, meningitis, and other infections. If Manny contracted one of these bacterial infections, it is possible that he had received some vaccinations, but failed to achieve full protection due to an inadequate response from his immune system or because he had not completed the entire vaccine series. In summary, we cannot definitively determine which friend received more vaccinations based on the information provided. To make a better comparison, more specific details about their vaccination histories would be needed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

There’s been a lot of discussion of this question since writer-directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel announced that they were planning a gender-flipped version of William Golding’s 1954 novel. But that conversation is perhaps less interesting than the one raised by Joanna Russ’ We Who Are About To. That question being: What if Lord of the Flies were feminist?      Advertisement            Many critics of McGehee and Siegel’s project have argued that the book is about violent masculinity, and the viciousness of upper-class boys trained to rule. Switching boys to girls, in this reading, undermines Golding’s critique of patriarchal violence.      But does the novel really critique patriarchal violence? Golding’s own discussion of the issue is quite confused. When asked to explain why he’d chosen to make the story about boys only, he rambled incoherently, first saying that he had been a boy so understood boys better, then arguing that boys were a better representation of a “scaled-down version of society,” then concluding that girls are superior to boys.      Golding, in short, did not seem to know why he had chosen boys, which suggests that the decision was less an intentional effort to critique gender roles, and more an unconscious default to the boy-centric adventure stories which Lord of the Flies both critiques and reproduces.      Joanna Russ was neither confused nor ambivalent. We Who Are About To, released in 1977, is a clear-eyed, bleak excoriation of the interpenetration of masculinity, colonialism, and death. The short novel is about eight people—five women and three men—whose spaceship has gone off course and dropped them on a distant, unknown, semi-hospitable planet.      Advertisement            According to science-fiction and boys adventure tropes, this should be the start of a story of adventure and excitement—or at least, à la Lord of the Flies, of devolution and satisfying violent confrontation with horrifying atavism. The people on the ship are familiar with these stories, as the narrator wearily informs us. The escape pod has barely landed before the others on board are engaged in “excited talk of ‘colonization,’ whatever that is.”      The narrator herself isn’t dreaming of colonization, though. As soon as the ship goes off course, she knows that on a world without food, with unknown dangers, billions of miles from rescue, they are all going to die. In fact, that’s the first line of the novel. “About to die. And so on. We’re all going to die.” The action of the novel—such as it is—is not about fighting for survival, either against the natural world or even against the other passengers. Rather, the narrator’s problem is that the other passengers won’t accept that they’re as good as dead. As a result, they decide that the women must agree to breed.      In Lord of the Flies, civilized young boys shuck off civilization and become pagan savages, as if the real evil of the British is that under the polish they’re just like the people they colonize. But in We Who Are About To, the civilized people are horrible not because they’re really savage, but because they are, after all, blandly civilized—and civilization is built on an edifice of sexism and violence. In the name of the noble ideal of perpetuating civilization, the men insist that they have to rape the women. The shipwrecked view themselves as colonizers, thrusting themselves upon a new virgin land, taming and teaching, spreading their seed across the soil. The narrator is forced to kill them all so that she can die in peace.      In Lord of the Flies, the terror of the novel is the vision of slipping backwards into savagery. Golding may be critiquing the upper classes, but when he wants to represent horror, he does it through paganism and images that might as well have been taken from Tarzan serials. If he is horrified by the violence of little boys, he also finds it exciting. That ambivalence, directed at a female cast, could easily turn into a mix of misogyny and fetishization, perhaps especially in the hands of male directors. ||||| EXCLUSIVE: Scott McGehee & David Siegel have made a deal at Warner Bros to write and direct a new version of Lord Of The Flies, based on the iconic William Golding novel. They plan to be faithful to the novel with one major twist: the young students stranded on a remote island who descend into a savage social order will be girls.      Two Arts      It is an intriguing take on a novel that was most famously turned into a 1963 film by Peter Brook. It was later turned into a 1990 Castle Rock film by director Harry Hook, which is how Warner Bros wound up with some of the rights. McGehee & Siegel last directed the 2012 drama What Maisie Knew, and before that Bee Season and The Deep End. They are very good at depicting traumatic events and stories seen through youthful eyes. They told Deadline they are big fans of Brook’s original film, but thought a new contemporized version felt timely. It took awhile for Warner Bros and their ICM Partners reps to work out the rights issues with the author’s estate. That just happened, and they have just closed their deals and will begin writing immediately.      “We want to do a very faithful but contemporized adaptation of the book, but our idea was to do it with all girls rather than boys,” Siegel told Deadline. “It is a timeless story that is especially relevant today, with the interpersonal conflicts and bullying, and the idea of children forming a society and replicating the behavior they saw in grownups before they were marooned.”      McGehee said the subject matter “is aggressively suspenseful, and taking the opportunity to tell it in a way it hasn’t been told before, with girls rather than boys, is that it shifts things in a way that might help people see the story anew. It breaks away from some of the conventions, the ways we think of boys and aggression. People still talk about the movie and the book from the standpoint of pure storytelling,” he said. “It is a great adventure story, real entertainment, but it has a lot of meaning embedded in it as well. We’ve gotten to think about this awhile as the rights were worked out, and we’re super eager to put pen to paper.”      They are repped by ICM Partners and Nelson Davis. ||||| Despite having few details known about the project, immediate criticism met the news that Warner Bros. is developing an all-female adaptation of Lord of the Flies, William Golding's 1954 novel.      The concern lay in the fact that the project would be written and directed by two men, Scott McGehee and David Siegel, who have said the movie would be a faithful adaptation of the novel, about a group of boys stranded on an island after a plane crash.      Lord of the Flies is a book about toxic masculinity and what happens when that is left unchecked, even at a young age. It could prove difficult, if not impossible, to be both faithful to the source material and also to the psychology of the young women the film would be about — particularly without the input of female creative talent at the top levels of the project.      “You aren’t even tapping the talent pool that will help you achieve market success,” contends Dr. Stacy Smith, who works on USC’s Media, Diversity and Social Change Initiative. The university's most recent study found that just 34 out of the 900 top-grossing films from 2007 to 2016 were directed by women.      Of the films currently in production at Warner Bros., none are being directed by women, though the studio delivered one of the biggest box-office successes of 2017 with Wonder Woman, which has earned more than 800 million and had Patty Jenkins at the helm of the female-driven film starring Gal Gadot as the Amazon princess Diana. Observers of Wonder Woman's success note that the film likely rang true because of the female voices in the mix in the creative process.      “One of the reasons the recent Wonder Woman film worked so well was because Diana was not just a male character dressed up in women's clothing,” says Dr. Martha Lauzen, the executive director at SDSU’s Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, which is responsible for the annual Celluloid Ceiling report.      Only 31.4 percent of speaking roles in the top 100 grossing movies in 2016 were women, according to Smith's study. With such little onscreen representation, a question that's being raised about the all-female Lord of the Flies is whether or not the industry and audiences should welcome any female-fronted studio movie, no matter who is behind the camera.      \\"That really complicates things because you don’t want to say in this industry that men can’t make stories about women,\\" says Kirsten Schaffer, the executive director of Women In Film.      Lord of the Flies is just the latest in a trend of Hollywood gender-bending — and many of the projects have women in top roles. There is a Splash remake (from screenwriter Marja-Lewis Ryan), where Jillian Bell will play the Tom Hanks role and Channing Tatum will have the tail as a merman; and a Dirty Rotten Scoundrels redo, titled Nasty Women (also written by a woman, screenwriter Jac Schaeffer). There’s a role-swapping Overboard in production with Anna Faris, and a Rocketeer movie in development with the protagonist being re-imagined as a young African-American girl. And, of course, there is that all-female Ocean’s Eleven spinoff, Ocean’s Eight, that has produced set images with Rihanna, Cate Blanchett and Sarah Paulson in a variety of fall outerwear.      In a post-Wonder Woman Hollywood, having female stories may no longer be enough. It is a matter of who is telling those stories.      “It’s a question of what is driving the appetite to put women in front of the camera. Is it just a business opportunity?” asks Dr. Katherine Pieper, a colleague of Smith’s. “Do the people greenlighting these stories want an authentic female representation of these characters? If they do, then I think we would see women telling these stories.”      Schaffer’s hope is that women screenwriters will see this as an opportunity to pitch their own gender-bending remakes of classic literature of their own. (Annie Clark, as known as the musician St. Vincent, is attached to direct a movie adaptation of The Portrait of Dorian Grey for Lionsgate, where the protagonist will be a woman.)      While both Lauzen and Smith's research has shown that films with female directors have higher numbers of women producers, cinematographers, editors and other women in below-the-line roles, all say that the prospective Lord of the Flies production should look to hire women in key gate-keeping roles. \\"Or take on a female mentee or an apprentice,\\" offers Schaffer. \\"A woman who has directed feature but not at this budget level, as a way to help women rise.” ||||| Warner Bros is planning to remake “Lord Of The Flies” into a movie that promises to stick to the fundamentals of the original book except with one minor tweak.      It’s an all female cast, and it’s written and directed by two males.      An all-girl Lord Of The Flies is by far one of the stupider ideas for a movie, and I’ve heard about the recently proposed Anti-American Sniper.      And in a rare and surprising turn of events, the internet actually agrees with me.

That it would be fun to watch girls for an hour and a half in limited clothing on an island? That every movie featuring boys should also include a separate girl version – just to make it fair? In that case, Christopher Nolan better get started on an all female Dunkirk.      Whether this movie is a grasp at gender equality or cheap way to generate buzz is beside the point. The fact of the matter is this already exists.      Now, my new Twitter friends can say this wouldn’t happen to an all-female group on a remote island because girls are superior blah-blah-blah. I’ve heard it all a million times.      That’s flagrantly false. Although I myself haven’t spent much time on a remote island, I did spend four years in high school as a girl. And the savagery in high school rivals, if not surpasses, that of a remote island.      In high school the claws come out, island or no island. Girls in high school have got it all: civic disorder, conflicts, and hierarchies, and even violence. I’ve seen a girl get bullied about the flavor of yogurt she brought to lunch. I’ve seen trash cans thrown. I’ve seen screaming, crying fights over which girl gets to hang out with another girl on Friday night. And if these directors think they need an island to bring out this level of savagery, they must not have gone to high school.      Besides, movies like this already exist. Ever heard of Mean Girls? Look up the descriptions for Mean Girls versus Lord Of The Flies. The summaries are basically the same.      This isn’t an issue of feminism, equality, or living in the bubble that “women aren’t savages.” Yes, women are. It’s just in a different way. We don’t need to debate this on the big screen for an hour and a half.      If these directors want real savagery, I suggest they lace up their converse and skinny jeans and march on over to their local high school. It’s guaranteed entertainment for a lot less money. ||||| In an undated interview, the author of the book, William Golding, who died in 1993, said he was often asked why he wrote about boys instead of girls. He said that it was partly because he grew up as one, but that gender was also crucial to the larger point of the novel.      “If you land with a group of little boys, they are more like scaled-down society than a group of little girls would be. Don’t ask me why, and this is a terrible thing to say, because I’m going to be chased from hell to breakfast by all the women who talk about equality. This has nothing to do with equality at all. I mean, I think women are foolish to pretend they’re equal to men — they’re far superior and always have been. But one thing you cannot do with them is take a bunch of them and boil them down, so to speak, into a set of little girls who would then become a kind of image of civilization, of society.”      Gender reversals in reboots are not new for Hollywood: A “Ghostbusters” with a cast of women was a critical and box office success last year, and women will be the outlaws in the upcoming “Ocean’s 8.” And teenage girls have long been awful to one another on screen, as seen in “Mean Girls” and “Heathers.”      What remains to be seen is whether the new “Lord of the Flies” will offer largely a mirror image of the novel, subbing in girls without changing the central plot points and behavior of the characters, or if it will wrestle with how girls would approach their fate differently.      “It could be problematic if all they’re doing is switching out girls for boys and saying, ‘Well, girls would do this too,’” said Pamela Davis-Kean, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan who studies children and families.      Though many differences between boys and girls tend to be overstated, boys do tend to be more physically aggressive, she said. Some of the novel’s scenes of physical violence probably wouldn’t align with how girls would settle their issues, especially in the era of the book, she said. ||||| Story highlights A remake is planned using girls instead of boys      Some don't think its a good idea      (CNN) A planned remake of \\"Lord of the Flies\\" reimagined with an all-female cast has stirred controversy.

Golding's reasoning was also confused and elliptic. This implies that choosing boys was more an unconscious nod to boy-centric adventure tales than a deliberate intention to critique gender roles.

Movie plot title: 12 Angry Men Movie plot: In a New York City courthouse, an eighteen-year-old boy from a slum is on trial for allegedly stabbing his father to death. Final closing arguments having been presented, a visibly bored judge instructs the jury to decide whether the boy is guilty of murder. If there is any reasonable doubt of his guilt they are to return a verdict of not guilty. The judge further informs them that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence.The jury retires to a private room, where the jurors spend a short while getting acquainted before they begin deliberating. It is immediately apparent that the jurors have already decided that the boy is guilty, and that they plan to return their verdict without taking time for discussion with the sole exception of Juror 8 (Henry Fonda), who is the only \\"not guilty\\" vote in a preliminary tally. He explains that there is too much at stake for him to go along with the verdict without at least talking about it first. His vote annoys the other jurors, especially Juror 7 (Jack Warden), who has tickets to a baseball game that evening; and Juror 10 (Ed Begley Sr.), who believes that people from slum backgrounds are liars, wild, and dangerous.The rest of the film's focus is the jury's difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict. While several of the jurors harbor personal prejudices, Juror 8 maintains that the evidence presented in the case is circumstantial, and that the boy deserves a fair deliberation. He calls into question the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder, the \\"rarity\\" of the murder weapon (a common switchblade, of which he has an identical copy), and the overall questionable circumstances. He further argues that he cannot in good conscience vote \\"guilty\\" when he feels there is reasonable doubt of the boy's guilt.Having argued several points and gotten no favorable response from the others, Juror 8 reluctantly agrees that he has only succeeded in hanging the jury. Instead, he requests another vote, this time by secret ballot. He... The answer to this question is:","output":"Not guilty"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: \\"That'll be 9.87.\\" Rebecca Ranghorn flipped up the top of the box, pulled out a glazed donut, and took bite. The young secretary behind her looked on in disbelief. She was so ready for the weekend. But first she had to get to the office and put in her lousy eight hours. Why couldn't this woman just pay and get out of the way? Rebecca tossed the box at the clerk. A couple of donuts flew out and fell on the floor behind the counter. \\"Those are yesterday's donuts.

Article: My first full-time job after high school was selling vacation packages via the telephone for a well-known company. One day, I was put through to a man who sounded a bit out of breath. I started with my normal pitch  , expecting to hear the normal reply --\\"I don't want any.\\" Instead, he spoke in a faint, weak voice and told me how he wished to take a vacation I was offering, but he couldn't because he was dying of illness. He explained how he was lacking in oxygen then, and it took almost all his energy to answer the call. He asked if I smoked, which I did, and begged me to stop. He told me smoking was what was killing him. He told me to spend every day with my loved ones, and tell them how much I love them. At this point, I couldn't control myself.

Information:  - Six Wheels On My Wagon is the second album by British electronic music group Fluke, released on 7 October 1993. The title parodies that of the song \\"Three Wheels on My Wagon\\", from the early 1960s. The most prominent track on the album, \\"Slid\\" is featured in the 1993 Phillip Noyce film \\"Sliver\\" as well as being a club favourite of popular DJ Sasha.  - An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music.  - An electronic musical instrument is a musical instrument that produces sound using electronics. Such an instrument sounds by outputting an electrical audio signal that ultimately drives a loudspeaker.  - The theremin (originally known as the ætherphone/etherphone, thereminophone or termenvox/thereminvox) is an early electronic musical instrument controlled without physical contact by the thereminist (performer). It is named after the Westernized name of its Russian inventor, Léon Theremin (é), who patented the device in 1928.  - Electronic music is music that employs electronic musical instruments and electronic music technology in its production, an electronic musician being a musician who composes and/or performs such music. In general, a distinction can be made between sound produced using electromechanical means and that produced using electronic technology. Examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, and the electric guitar. Purely electronic sound production can be achieved using devices such as the theremin, sound synthesizer, and computer.  - A synthesizer (often abbreviated as synth, also spelled synthesiser) is an electronic musical instrument that generates electric signals that are converted to sound through instrument amplifiers and loudspeakers or headphones. Synthesizers may either imitate instruments like piano, Hammond organ, flute, vocals; natural sounds like ocean waves, etc.; or generate new electronic timbres. They are often played with a musical keyboard, but they can be controlled via a variety of other input devices, including music sequencers, instrument controllers, fingerboards, guitar synthesizers, wind controllers, and electronic drums. Synthesizers without built-in controllers are often called \\"sound modules\\", and are controlled via MIDI or CV/Gate using a controller device, often a MIDI keyboard or other controller.  - The Hammond organ is an electric organ, invented by Laurens Hammond and John M. Hanert and first manufactured in 1935. Various models have been produced, most of which use sliding drawbars to create a variety of sounds. Until 1975, Hammond organs generated sound by creating an electric current from rotating a metal tonewheel near an electromagnetic pickup, and then strengthening the signal with an amplifier so that it can drive a speaker cabinet. Around two million Hammond organs have been manufactured. The organ is commonly used with, and associated with, the Leslie speaker.  - Phillip Noyce (born 29 April 1950) is an Australian film director.  - The Telharmonium (also known as the Dynamophone) was an early electrical organ, developed by Thaddeus Cahill circa 1896 and patented in 1897. The electrical signal from the Telharmonium was transmitted over wires; it was heard on the receiving end by means of \\"horn\\" speakers.  - \`\` Slid '' is the sixth single by the English electronic music band Fluke . Taken from the album Six Wheels on My Wagon the track became a club hit with the likes of Sasha and also appeared on the Sliver soundtrack .  - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones.

Native Americans, also referred to as American Indians, First Americans, or Indigenous Americans, are the pre-Columbian inhabitants of North America, including the contiguous United States, Alaska, and Hawaii. These Indigenous people possess diverse cultures, languages, and histories, and continue to hold a significant presence in contemporary American society, now comprising around 2.9 million people, or roughly 0.9% of the U.S. population. Native Americans contribute to the rich, cultural mosaic of the United States by preserving their heritage, customs, and traditions in various aspects of life, such as art, music, and dance. Regarding geography, the data set mentions Auburn, Washington, a city located in the United States. Auburn, with a population of approximately 81,000 residents, is situated in both King County and Pierce County, in the state of Washington. Historically, the Auburn area was home to Indigenous tribes such as the Skopamish, Smalhkamish, and the Stkamish. These tribes later became part of the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe, which still resides nearby on the Muckleshoot Indian Reservation. Today, the city of Auburn boasts a diverse population, including a small percentage of Native Americans.

Wisdom: Minerva was considered to be the goddess of wisdom, embodying knowledge, intellect, and understanding. If this aspect resonates strongly with you, you might identify with Minerva for her wisdom and ability to comprehend complex subjects and concepts. If you value education, seek continuous learning, and strive to make well-informed decisions, you are likely to have a strong connection with Minerva's wisdom domain. 2. Warfare: Minerva was also known as the goddess of warfare, particularly strategic warfare and defensive tactics. While the association with warfare might seem contradictory to her embodiment of wisdom, it highlights the importance of combining intelligence, strategy, and strength in order to overcome adversity. If you have natural leadership skills and tend to approach challenges with analytical thinking and strategic planning, you might identify with Minerva as the goddess of warfare. 3. The Arts: Minerva was the patron of numerous arts, crafts, and trades, including weaving, painting, sculpture, and metalwork. As such, she represents creativity, innovation, and skill in various forms of artistic expression. If you have a passion for the arts, value self-expression, and possess a creative mind, you likely resonate with Minerva's role as the goddess of the arts. 4. Invention and Industry: As the facilitator of numerous crafts, Minerva was also considered a goddess of invention and industry. She was often depicted with an owl, which symbolizes wisdom and foresight, as well as a shield, symbolizing her protective nature and her role in battles. If you are someone who likes to think outside the box, find innovative solutions to problems, and contribute to progress in society, you might identify with Minerva's attributes related to invention and industry. In conclusion, if you find yourself relating to Minerva's domains of wisdom, warfare, the arts, and invention, you might consider yourself aligned with this Roman goddess. Of course, Roman mythology encompasses a vast and diverse pantheon of gods and goddesses, each with their own unique traits and attributes. The suitability of this answer ultimately depends on how well it reflects your own personal characteristics and values."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Premise: But this problem was quickly resolved when McCain, who was attending the lunch as a guest of U.S. Hypothesis: This problem was swiftly resolved when McCain attended the lunch as a guest of U.S. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. When examining both statements, it is clear that they express the same essential idea - that the problem in question was resolved thanks to McCain's attendance at the lunch as a guest of the United States. The premise states that \\"this problem was quickly resolved when McCain, who was attending the lunch as a guest of U.S.\\" In this sentence, the adverb \\"quickly\\" is used to emphasize the swift resolution of the problem while clearly identifying that McCain's attendance at the lunch as a guest of the U.S. played a role in facilitating the resolution. The hypothesis, on the other hand, says \\"This problem was swiftly resolved when McCain attended the lunch as a guest of U.S.\\" The core meaning of this statement is the same – the problem was resolved on account of McCain's presence at the lunch event. The only difference between the two statements is the choice of adverbs: \\"quickly\\" in the premise and \\"swiftly\\" in the hypothesis. These two words are synonymous, both conveying a sense of rapid action or occurrence. Upon comparing the two sentences, it becomes apparent that the premise entails the hypothesis, as both convey the same basic information: the problem was resolved in a timely manner due to McCain's attendance at the lunch as a guest of the United States.

Barb takes a bite of her sandwich and remarks that the boat she is currently using doesn't have any cavitation.  and a hint : Cavitation is, in many cases, an undesirable occurrence. In devices such as propellers and pumps, cavitation causes a great deal of noise, damage to components, vibrations, and a loss of efficiency. Cavitation has also become a concern in the renewable energy sector as it may occur on the blade surface of tidal stream turbines.When the cavitation bubbles collapse, they force energetic liquid into very small volumes, thereby creating spots of high temperature and emitting shock waves, the latter of which are a source of noise. The noise created by cavitation is a particular problem for military submarines, as it increases the chances of being detected by passive sonar.  Please answer this question : Who would have a harder time going on a long distance trip with their boat?","output":"Stephanie would have a harder time going on a long distance trip with her boat due to the cavitation issues. Cavitation causes excessive noise, damage to components, vibrations, and a loss of efficiency, all of which can negatively impact the performance and reliability of the boat during a long distance trip. On the other hand, Barb's boat doesn't have any cavitation issues, making her boat more suitable for longer journeys without the risk of these problems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cobretti infiltrates the store, locates, and negotiates with him. During the negotiation, the criminal speaks of the unknown \\"New Order\\", a group of social darwinist radicals that despise modern society and believe in killing the weak, leaving only the strongest and smartest to rule the world. Cobretti then kills the gunman by throwing a knife at his abdomen and firing shots at him. As the bodies are removed from the supermarket, Cobretti is admonished by Detective Monte (Andrew Robinson) for his seeming disregard for police procedures and protocols. Harassed by reporters, Cobretti admonishes them for failing to put the safety of potential victims first. Little does everyone realize at the time is that the supermarket hostage crisis is only one of a string of recent and seemingly unconnected acts of violence and murder that have broken loose in Los Angeles, perpetrated by the same supremacist group the supermarket gunman mentioned.

However, his world is suddenly destabilised by a series of unexplained murders (including Harold's best friend, Colin) and exploding bombs from an unknown foe. He and his henchmen try to uncover his attackers' identity whilst simultaneously trying not to worry their American visitors, who Harold believes will not go into business with him if they think he's not in full control of his affairs.

Write some highlights for the following article: More than 160 people have been arrested in connection with the massacre earlier this month of scores of people in central Nigeria, a national police spokesman told CNN Monday. Of the 163 arrested, 41 will be charged with homicide, said spokesman Emmanuel Ojukwu. The other 122 will be charged with rioting, arson and possession of firearms, he said. More than 200 people died in the March 7 massacre,  according to some estimates. They took place in predominately Christian towns near the city of Jos, where about 150 people, mostly Muslims, were reported killed in January. The region lies on a faith-based fault line between Muslim-dominated northern Nigeria and the mainly Christian south. Ojukwu said the ethnic backgrounds of those arrested are mixed, but they are all from the area near Jos. Human Rights Watch said the attacks by Muslims with guns, machetes and knives apparently were in retaliation for the previous attacks against Islamic communities and the theft of cattle from herdsmen. Last week, at least 11 more people were killed in a predominantly Christian village. Choji Gyang, special adviser on religious affairs to the governor of the Nigerian state of Plateau, has said the attackers were Muslim herdsmen, some dressed in military uniforms. They also stole about 120 cattle from the village, he said. The violence has put much of oil-rich Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, on edge. Authorities in Lagos took the unusual step of sending a text message to residents earlier this month to try to put them at ease. The violence often pits Christians and Muslims against each other. But John Onaiyekan, Roman Catholic archbishop of Abuja, Nigeria, and former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo have said that the violence is fueled more by other factors: ethnic, social and economic problems. \\"If you have one group or a community that has land that's been encroached upon by another community or even by itinerant cattle farmers, then the people who lay claim to the land will fight back,\\" Obasanjo recently told CNN. \\"If there are job opportunities in an area, and persons believe they are indigenous to that area, and (are) not getting enough out of the jobs that are available, they will fight those who are getting the jobs.\\" Highlights:","output":"1.

Why so much emphasis on Illuminati and the New World Order? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Yes, these two questions are inquiring about the same information. Both questions are asking for an explanation on the emphasis and hype surrounding the Illuminati and the New World Order. Here is an analysis of these concepts and the hype surrounding them: 1. Background: The Illuminati is a term often used to describe a secret society or group of individuals believed to possess significant influence in global affairs. The New World Order is a conspiracy theory that suggests a secretive and powerful elite group aims to control and govern the world under a unified and authoritarian regime. These concepts often intertwine in various conspiracy theories. 2. Popularity: The reason for the emphasis and hype around the Illuminati and the New World Order can be attributed to their widespread presence in pop culture and social media. Movies, books, music, and other forms of entertainment have contributed to spreading these theories and keeping them relevant. 3. Human nature: People are often intrigued by the idea of secret organizations and mysterious forces controlling world events. This fascination stems from our natural curiosity and the desire to make sense of complex global issues. 4. Distrust and uncertainty: In times of socio-political turmoil, economic crises, or other large-scale events, people may feel overwhelmed and afraid. Conspiracy theories like the Illuminati and the New World Order provide a narrative that can help individuals make sense of their fears and uncertainties by assigning a scapegoat for global problems. 5. Internet and social media: The easy dissemination of information – including misinformation – has led to more people being exposed to these theories. This accessibility allows conspiracy theories to spread quickly and widely, fueling the hype surrounding them. In conclusion, both questions are asking for information on why the Illuminati and the New World Order receive significant attention and notoriety. The reasons behind the hype include their presence in popular culture, human curiosity, socio-political uncertainties, and the proliferation of information via the internet and social media."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Health officials issued a waring over common energy-saving lghtbulbs  after research showed some types could potentially harm the skin and may even raise the risk of cancer. A study by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) found that some eco-friendly lightbuulbs release levels of ultraviolet (UV)   radiation that are above recognized safety limits. The agency urged people who work with lamps nearby to avoid spending more than one hour within a foot of the eco-friendly bulbs. The warning was directed at those using desk lamps for long periods, such as jewellery makers, and others who might have lights close to their faces, such as car mechanics. John O'Hagan, a scientist at the HPA's centre for radiation, chemical and environmental dangers, began tests on the ligthbulbs after patient groups raised concern about them. Among the groups were patients with a skin disease called lupus, which makes people highly sensitive to light. The tests measured UV light from the lamps and found the highest levels of UV radiation, measured 2cm from the lightbulbs, were _ to being outside in direct sunlight in the summer. The most immediate risk from the lightbulbs is a reddening of the skin similar to sunburn, but there is also a small increased risk of skin cancer associated with this, again similar to that of sunburn. The risk of health problems from the lightbulbs was not so high that people should remove them from their homes. People are advised to avoid using open lightbulbs for long close work until the problem is sorted out. It has confirmed that the government will not be reviewing its strategy on introducing energy efficient lightbulbs. Question: In the next part, the author would most probably further explain   _  .

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The properties of the alkali metals are similar to each other as expected for elements in the same family. The alkali metals have the largest atomic radii and the lowest first ionization energy in their periods. This combination makes it very easy to remove the single electron in the outermost (valence) shell of each. The easy loss of this valence electron means that these metals readily form stable cations with a charge of 1+. Their reactivity increases with increasing atomic number due to the ease of losing the lone valence electron (decreasing ionization energy). Since oxidation is so easy, the reverse, reduction, is difficult, which explains why it is hard to isolate the elements. The solid alkali metals are very soft; lithium, shown in Figure 18.3, has the lowest density of any metal (0.5 g/cm3). The alkali metals all react vigorously with water to form hydrogen gas and a basic solution of the metal hydroxide. This means they are easier to oxidize than is hydrogen. As an example, the reaction of lithium with water is: 2Li(s) + 2H 2 O(l) ⟶ 2LiOH(aq) + H 2(g).   Q: The properties of the alkali metals are similar to each other as expected for elements in the same what?

Most students have not been taught the principles behind really effective working. Imagine a graph showing the amount a person learns against the number of hours he works in a day. If he doesn't do any work, he learns nothing (point 0). If he does an hour's work he learns a certain amount (point 1). If he does two hours' work he learns about twice as much (point 2). If he does more work he'll learn still more (point 3). However, if he tries to do twenty-three and a half hours' work in a day, he will be so tired that he'll hardly remember anything: what he learns will be very little (point 4). If he did less work he'd learn more (point 5). Now whatever the exact shape of the graph's curve , made by joining these points, it must have a high point. Point \\"X\\" is the very maximum anyone can learn in the day. And this represents the optimum , the best, amount of work to do. It is the best possible compromise between adequate time at the books and fatigue . Fatigue is an absolutely real thing; one can't escape it or ignore it. If you try to ignore it and press yourself to work past the optimum, you will only get on this downward slope and achieve less than the best - and then become very tired and lose your power of concentration.

Group: Currently 137 Israeli settlements in the West Bank, with about 325,000 inhabitants.","output":"Title: Israel's Plans to Construct Settlements in the E1 Zone Raise Concerns over the West Bank's Future Introduction: The ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine has taken a new turn as Israel plans to begin construction of settlements in the East 1 (E1) zone in the West Bank. This development arises amidst the United Nations' recent decision to grant Palestine non-member observer status, thereby signaling a significant change in the dynamics between the two nations. Paragraph 1: Background on Israeli Settlements in the West Bank Currently, there are 137 Israeli settlements in the West Bank, housing approximately 325,000 inhabitants. These settlements have long been a contentious issue between Israel and Palestine, as Palestinians argue that they infringe on their territory and disrupt the possibility of a contiguous, independent Palestinian state. The international community has also expressed deep concerns about the expansion of settlements, with many countries deeming them illegal under international law. Paragraph 2: The Importance of the E1 Zone The E1 zone is a strategically significant area in the West Bank, lying adjacent to Jerusalem and stretching from the western edge of the city to the outskirts of Jericho. Palestinians express their fears that Israel's construction plans in the E1 zone would effectively cut the West Bank in half, isolating East Jerusalem – the intended capital of a future Palestinian state – and rendering the prospect of a territorially intact Palestinian state virtually impossible. Paragraph 3: Implications of the U.N.'s Decision to Grant Palestine Non-Member Observer Status The United Nations' decision to confer non-member observer status upon Palestine signifies an important shift in international recognition of the Palestinian plight, paving the way for greater influence and standing within the global community. Although this upgraded status falls short of full membership, it enables Palestine to participate more actively in U.N. debates and to join various U.N. agencies and treaties. Paragraph 4: Potential Consequences of Israeli Settlement Expansion in the E1 Zone The construction of settlements in the E1 zone is expected to further destabilize the already fragile relationship between Israel and Palestine. If Israel proceeds with its plans, it will likely provoke outrage from Palestinians, the United Nations, and international powers that have been advocating a two-state solution. Ramifications may include escalated tensions, deteriorating regional stability, and the diminishing possibility for peaceful reconciliation between the two nations. Conclusion: In light of these potential consequences, the international community is likely to keep a watchful eye on Israel's actions regarding the E1 zone, hoping that both parties can find a path towards a sustainable resolution to the longstanding territorial dispute. With the U.N.'s recent recognition of Palestine's non-member observer status, there is an opportunity for fruitful dialogue and negotiation – but only if both sides are willing to engage productively and in good faith."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the Sahara, and how do the average temperatures there compare to the ones in the Sonoran Desert? What is the Sahara, and how do the average temperatures there compare to the ones in the Syrian Desert? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Select from:  (A). no  (B). yes","output":"The Sahara is the world's largest hot desert, encompassing most of Northern Africa. It spans over 9.2 million square kilometers (3.6 million square miles) and occupies roughly 31% of Africa's total area. The Sahara's landscape includes varied topography such as sand dunes, sand seas, vast stretches of flat rocky terrain, rocky plateaus, mountains, and dry valleys. Some of its iconic features include the Erg Chebbi and Erg Chigaga sand sea in Morocco, the Ténéré Desert in Niger, and the Tibesti Mountains along the border between Chad and Libya. The Sahara's climate alternates between extreme heat and cold, with extremely hot temperatures during the day and substantially cooler temperatures at night. The region gets very little rainfall as well, with annual precipitation amounts typically less than 100mm (4 inches). The Sonoran Desert, on the other hand, is located in North America, spanning parts of the Southwestern United States and Northwestern Mexico. It covers a total area of about 260,000 square kilometers (100,000 square miles). The Sonoran Desert is characterized by its unique flora and fauna, including the iconic saguaro cactus and the Joshua tree. This desert area experiences a subtropical desert climate, with relatively warm winters and scorching hot summers. Rainfall mainly occurs during the summer months. Now let's compare the average temperatures of the Sahara and the Sonoran Desert. In the Sahara, the daytime temperatures during the hottest months can reach up to 47°C (116.6°F) or higher, while at night they can fall as low as 3-7°C (37-44°F). It is important to note that winter nights can be cold with temperatures dropping to below freezing. On the other hand, the Sonoran Desert's average high temperature in the summer is typically around 40°C (104°F), with the night temperatures ranging from 20-25°C (68-77°F). In general, the Sahara experiences more extreme temperature fluctuations than the Sonoran Desert. As for the second question, the Syrian Desert, also called the Syrian Steppe, is a region in the Middle East, covering parts of modern-day Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Syria, with an area of about 520,000 square kilometers (200,000 square miles). It consists of a combination of arid steppe and true desert, characterized by its gravelly terrain with occasional sand dunes and a semi-arid climate. Temperature-wise, the Syrian Desert experiences very hot, dry summers and cold, relatively wetter winters. The average high temperatures in the summer months can reach up to 40°C (104°F), while nighttime lows are approximately 20-25°C (68-77°F). In conclusion, the questions are not paraphrases of each other as the regions being compared differ. The first question seeks a comparison between the Sahara and the Sonoran Desert, while the second question requests a comparison between the Sahara and the Syrian Desert. Hence, the correct answer is (A). No."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

It seems like the first two numbers (12 and 13) increase by 1, and then the next two numbers (15 and 17) increase by 2. After that, the numbers start with 111 and increase by 2 again (111 to 113) and then increase by 4 (113 to 117). The pattern seems to be alternating between increases of 2 and 4. Continuing this pattern, the sequence would look like this: 12 (increase by 1) → 13 (increase by 2) → 15 (increase by 2) → 17 Now the pattern starts over with 111: 111 (increase by 2) → 113 (increase by 4) → 117 (increase by 2) → 119 The pattern continues: 119 (increase by 2) → 121 (increase by 2) → 123 Following the same pattern, the next increase will be 4 and then 2. 123 (increase by 4) → 127 (increase by 2) → 129 At this point, we arrived at the last number given in the sequence.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. The type of fennel you choose to grow will depend on what part of the fennel plant you wish to use -- the bulb, the fronds or the seeds.   Florence Fennel is grown for its bulbous stem, which can be eaten raw, grilled or baked. It is also possible to eat the thicker stalks which sprout from the bulb, as they are similar to celery.  Herb fennel does not produce the same bulbous stem. It is grown for its delicate leaves, which are used as a herb. Herb fennel also produces seeds which have a licorice-like flavor (as does the rest of the plant) and are used for seasoning. The process for planting both varieties of fennel is the same. The seeds should be planted directly into the garden, around the time of the last spring frost.  Plant the fennel seeds in fertile, well drained soil. If necessary, loosen the soil a little before planting and add in some compost and a little soil for drainage. Plant the seeds approximately ten inches apart and cover them with a light layer of soil, about 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) deep. It's probably a good idea to plant a few more seeds than you need, then thin them out later. Plant the fennel far away from any dill or coriander -- these plants tend to cross-pollinate, which reduces seed production and affects the taste. You can use an almanac to determine when the last frost typically occurs in your area. If you prefer, you can plant the fennel seeds in containers approximately 4 weeks before the last spring frost.  Once the seedlings have grown to height of 3 or 4 inches (7.6 or 10.2 cm), you can harden them off in a cool greenhouse or cold frame before transplanting them to the garden. Alternatively, you can keep the fennel in a container. As fennel is a deep-rooted plant, it will require a container at last 12 inches (30.5 cm) deep, filled with light soil with some added gravel for drainage. If you plant more than one fennel plant in a container of this size, it will be too crowded to produce a large bulb, but you will still be able to enjoy the leaves and seeds. Fennel grows best in full-sun. At first, you should water it regularly to keep the soil moist. Once it has established itself, you may only need to water it if there is a drought. Be careful not to overwater, as this may cause the roots to rot. There is no need to fertilize the soil during growing season.  Once the bulb begins to form at the base of the stem, hill up the surrounding soil to cover it. This shades it from the sun and prevents it from turning green. This is known as \\"blanching\\", as it keeps the bulb white and sweet (which is only necessary if you intend to eat the bulb).  Fennel is not usually affected by pests or disease, but occasionally you will spot aphids or whiteflies on the leaves. If so, you can use a pyrethrin-based insecticidal soap to get rid of them.","output":"Fennel can be grown for its bulb, fronds, or seeds, and to enjoy all parts, plant the right type of fennel in well-drained soil with sunlight and watering without overdoing it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Select from the following.  - Multiply the number of days you will be gone by the amount of water needed by the plant per day.;  - Multiply the number of days you will be gone by the amount of water needed by the plant per week.;","output":"To calculate how much water your plant will need during your vacation, you have two options to consider, depending on whether the plant requires watering daily or weekly. Here's a detailed explanation of each option. Option 1: Multiply the number of days you will be gone by the amount of water needed by the plant per day. If your plant needs daily watering, you should follow this approach. First, you'll need to determine the amount of water your plant requires each day. The daily water requirement may vary according to the plant species, pot size, local climate, and other factors. You can find this information in a plant care guide, by consulting with a plant specialist, or by observing the plant's condition over time. Once you know the daily water requirement, follow these steps: 1. Determine the length of your vacation - the number of days you will be gone. 2. Multiply the number of days by the daily water requirement of your plant. This will give you the total amount of water needed by your plant during your vacation. 3. To ensure adequate watering, you may want to use self-watering devices, a drip irrigation system, or ask a friend or neighbor to water your plant on a daily basis, following the calculated daily water requirement. Option 2: Multiply the number of days you will be gone by the amount of water needed by the plant per week. If your plant needs watering on a weekly basis, use this option. In this case, you should determine the amount of water the plant requires each week. This may depend on the plant species, soil type, pot size, local environment, among other factors. Check a plant care guide or consult with an expert to get accurate information on your plant's weekly water requirement. Once you determine the weekly water requirement, follow these steps: 1. Calculate the length of your vacation - the number of days you will be gone. 2. Convert the length of your vacation from days to weeks. If the number of days is not a multiple of 7, round up to the nearest week. For example, if you'll be gone for 10 days, convert this to 2 weeks. 3. Multiply the weekly water requirement by the number of weeks, to get the total amount of water needed during your vacation. 4. Since the plant requires water on a weekly basis, you can consider using a self-watering device or an irrigation system that you can set to release the calculated amount of water each week. Alternatively, you might ask a friend or neighbor to water the plant on a weekly basis, following the determined weekly water requirement. By considering the plant's unique water requirements and the length of your vacation, you can choose the most appropriate method to ensure your plant receives the necessary care and sustenance during your absence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Saints' Keenan Lewis pleads New Orleans to 'get our city together' after Will Smith's death Tragedy struck on Saturday when former Saints defensive end Will Smith, 34, was shot and killed in New Orleans. The entire NFL community -- players, coaches, teams and fans included -- have come together to share heartfelt messages for the Smith family and the Saints organization. Saints cornerback Keenan Lewis, who has played the last three years with the Saints and is a native of New Orleans, shared a message for the city via Instagram on Monday. In it, he discusses what it's like to grow up in New Orleans, and urges the city to come together.

Movie title: Dostana Movie plot: Dostana is a story about two guys, Sameer Acharya (Abhishek Bachchan) who is a doctor and Kunal Chauhan (John Abraham), a photographer. They bumped into each other while looking for an agreement to rent, and confusion headed towards the same bungalow. However, they were both thrown out because the owner wants to re-rent the apartment to girls only, since niece, Neha Melwani (Priyanka Chopra) stays in second apartment alone. Sameer gets the idea (when a US Soldier, who is a gay, tells them about missing his life partner) that if Kunal and he pretend to be gay lovers, then the owner will agree to let them stay. Kunal initially refuses, but agrees out of desperation. Their plan works and they move in. Over a period of time Neha, Kunal, and Sameer become good friends, hanging out together and developing a good relationship as housemates.One day Neha's boss 'M', short for Murli (Boman Irani) announces that he is resigning from his job as the editor of the magazine called 'Verve' and will also decide who should take his position. In order to impress her editor and get the job, Neha invites 'M' for dinner at her house telling him that she will introduce him to her gay friends. The evening turns out to be a comedy one. But Sameer's mother finds out that her son might be gay and is not pleased. Next day at Neha's office M announces that Abhimanyu Singh (Bobby Deol) will be the new editor. Neha, heartbroken returns home where she is consoled by Sameer's mother. Kunal and Sameer, then help Neha with her on a film project, given to her by Abhimanyu.While Kunal is out of the film for a few days, Sameer takes Neha to supporting role, and they share a film. Later, at a shop, Sameer tries to tell Neha that he acts her in second scene and that he's straight through a fitting room door, but it turns out Kunal was behind that door and heard everything . Murli becomes angry with Sameer and states that he also marry him. As they try to figure out what to do be gay, Kunal suggests that they should both take Neha out to this great... A:","output":"The magazine that Murli resigns from being the editor of in the movie Dostana is called 'Verve.' This information is quintessential to the plot because it shapes Neha's professional ambitions and affects her relationships with Sameer and Kunal. Murli's resignation leads to a chain of events that further complicate the dynamics between the housemates. After Murli's resignation, the position of editor becomes vacant at 'Verve,' setting in motion Neha's desire to fill this position. However, Murli is not only resigning but also choosing his replacement, adding an extra layer of complexity to the situation. To impress Murli and get the job, Neha devises a plan to introduce him to her supposed gay friends, Sameer and Kunal. But despite her efforts, Murli chooses none other than Abhimanyu Singh, played by Bobby Deol, as the new editor of 'Verve.' This situation at the 'Verve' ends up becoming a pivotal point for Neha, Sameer, and Kunal's relationship and their respective future trajectories. It forces everyone, especially Sameer and Kunal, into helping Neha success on a film project given to her by new editor Abhimanyu. It also leads to Sameer's unexpected confession to Kunal about his true feelings for Neha and the fact that he's not really gay. The decision Murli makes regarding the position of the editor at 'Verve' is the inception of the conflict that drives the rest of the film's plot. So, in essence, Murli resigning from his position at 'Verve' is a critical plot element in the movie Dostana. This stroke of fate seems to bring Sameer, Kunal, and Neha closer but also imposes challenges in their personal and professional lives. With finesse and humor, the movie explores same-sex relationships, friendship, and love using 'Verve' as a metaphorical backdrop."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:Y,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],D={key:0},R={key:1};function N(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",H,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",P,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
